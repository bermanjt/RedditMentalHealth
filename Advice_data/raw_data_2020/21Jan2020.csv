0,"I was a normal 21 year old guy who works in a restaurant for quite a while (almost 3 years) and with a split decision took myself from doing okay to not eating for 4 days. About 2 weeks ago after trying to get an advance from work and getting rejected, (almost broke) I resorted to stealing 50ish bucks from the cash register to finance my transportation to work. The next day i got called an hour early before work and i got the ultimatum, i was terminated (with no charges thankfully) but i had to return all of the money, i ended up walking 3 hours to get home with my head down and guilt overflowing. I came home and told my parents the truth and shamed me for it. I knew what i was doing and took full responsibility for it, but now I feel like I just got kicked out of society. I'm broke, with no food and no friend to approach about this. I need help getting myself together. I need your advice.",21Jan2020,1
1," Every time we go out in public I notice my wife eyeing black men, especially big muscular ones with extra dark chocolatey skin that glistens in the sunlight. It makes me feel uncomfortable and I've told her to stop but she denies that she looks at them and told me I'm crazy. Its gotten to the point that I don't even feel comfortable being out in public with her because I know she will be looking at black men and making me feel awkward. What can I do?",21Jan2020,1

5,"I have 15 missing assignments and still manage to get C's my family always says ""it's not good enough"" the sad thing is I'm actually trying and I feel like I can't be good enough for them.

My anxiety takes a toll when I walk into school even though I try to be as social as a I possibly can. But when I get home I think maybe I said something I shouldn't have or made someone upset.

6,"I'm 29.  I've never had a 9-5.  I've only had a few part time jobs that I hated, and I've been unemployed for the past 2 years.  Safe to say I never figured it out.

Next week I start my first full time job.  8am-4pm 5 days a week.  I'll finally have some stability and enough money to make progress in life.  And I'm nervous.  Nervous because I've become so accustomed to sucking at life that I won't know what to do with myself once I have nothing to complain about.

I'm nervous because I'll have to go out into the world and live and be normal.

13,"I work in IT at a relatively small company with said department consisting of 3 full-time and 1 part-time employee. I'm one of the full-time employees, doing an 11am-7pm shift and I need to tell my boss I'll be needing a schedule change in order for me to take classes. I can't bluntly tell him I need to leave work early so I can go to school (MW 6-10pm) to pursue a new career so I've been trying to think of a plausible reason as to why I need to leave early.

14,"Today I put in my 2 weeks notice, but my job is trying to convince me to stay. They've offered me what I've wanted, higher pay and the opportunity to learn other areas. Here's the problem, for the past 2 years I've been doing the same mundane task Monday-Friday, for 8-10 hours a week, even though I'm a more efficient worker than most of my co-workers and have the knowledge to do multiple tasks in my area. I can even act as a substitute when our supervisor is sick or on vacation.  I've tried asking them if I could do something else or learn something new but it never had any effect. I've been extremely depressed at work for a good while now thinking that I'm just going to be stuck where I'm at and just feel completely miserable working there. I've completely checked out mentally and emotionally at work and I don't know if having the 2 perks will change that.

Any thoughts/advice?",21Jan2020,1
15,"As the title states, I was in an auto accident in MN in which another driver failed to yield at a stop sign before turning right onto the road I was driving. I promptly rear ended her. I have only liability and the other driver has full coverage. We filed a police report on scene where the other driver admitted fault. We claimed other party's insurance and they denied my claim initially because the other driver lied about the events. We then sent in the police report, where the other driver admitted fault, and the insurance company still wants to deny it. The reasoning is; I should have been driving under the speed limit because it was a busy intersection, meaning I was driving unsafe, and I should be ready for anyone to pull out in front of me and break in time. For example, when I go through a light, I should be going under the speed limit because someone else might want the right of way and I need to be prepared to let that happen. 

This seems crazy to me. I don't think they teach that in drivers ed. That practice seems unsafe to other drivers obeying the laws of the road. I am waiting to speak to someone higher up from the other party's insurance to see if I can reason with them. If they don't want to reason with me, what are my options going forward to make this right for me? I know I can try to sue civilly but I want to go after the insurance company. I appreciate any advice. I know I am not at fault here. I feel like I am being played because I won't try to peruse any further than their initial claim. 

Please do not give me advice on switching to full coverage. I have learned my lesson and only had liability for financial reasons.",21Jan2020,1

17,Reddit - I am a second semester senior at a university on the east coast of the United States. Right before winter vacation I was arrested for public intoxication while trying to go to a concert. ( The police gave me multiple opportunities to go home and I was being really stubborn because I wanted to see the show and the arrested me) While in jail when they stripped me down they found the bag of MDMA in my sock (.1 gram or 1 normal dose for those of you who are not familiar.) I have been in trouble with my college a few times before. My freshman year I got caught with weed in the dorms. My junior year I got an unintentional plagiarism for not doing in text citations on a paper and one month before turning 21 I lost my wallet which was turned into campus public safety and they found my fake ID. Due to past offenses I've been suspended before and was already placed on Deferred expulsion which basically means don't get into any more trouble. Obviously I fucked that up. I already accepted a job offer out on the west coast prior to getting arrested and now pretty much everything in my immediate future is up in the air. I will be going in front of my schools honor board some time next week probably and in the mean time Im still attending the 4 classes I have to finish ( 12 credit hours). I am super scared about this all and getting expelled would greatly alter the next year or two of my life. My family knows about all this and hired me a lawyer to try to help me out. I've made a lot of dumb decisions but I'm a good person who likes to have fun and obviously got carried away. Would love some advice from anyone who knows someone who's been kicked out of college this late in the game or knows anyone who has and how they responded.

23,"I’m 18, female, I live in the UK and I finished college(high school) in June. At this point I was in a relationship with someone who I eventually found out was quite controlling and abusive and I didn’t know it. This had a big effect on my A Levels and I was really upset. I ended it and to take my mind off it I went to Japan for three months on a working holiday.

Returned in Nov, it was great but for the most part very challenging living independently. 
My situation right now is I’m at home and looking for some full time work but this has been going on since I returned from Japan. My last relationship left me isolated and I don’t have any friends at all. I’ve attended a couple of events here and there in London and met some nice people but nothing’s really come out of it.
I had an amazing year two years back in 2018, I met my idols at a festival backstage. Lots of other things happened and at the moment I’m just feeling really low. I want to go out I just don’t know where because where I live there’s barely anything to do, and I have no one to meet. I go swimming sometimes but just to get out. I meet up with someone I’m dating usually once a week and thats probably the only highlight.

24,"So I \[20, M\] am an actor and performer and recently taught a workshop with another performer \[19, F\] from a local theater. 

There were about 15 kids in the class, ranging from 7 to 14. When I'm interacting with kids, I always try to be approachable, friendly, and try not to talk down to them.

We did a song, a dance, and a scene, and those all went great. I'm having some tinges of concern, because we played a couple of games during the class, and in one of the games I may have been goofing too much with the kids.  I only got a few hours of sleep last night, and I'm concerned maybe I wasn't thinking what I was doing through completely. We were playing a ""game show"" Q&amp;A type game, suggested by the other instructor, and I acted as a goofy 'MC'. Sort of based on Herb Welch played by Bill Hader on SNL, 

I used a water bottle as a mic, and when the kids were talking, I had them talk into the mic. I was doing funny voices/accents, and later on I put the water bottle on a couple of the kids cheeks, as if I didn't know where to put the mic. The kids/other instructor were laughing. I was basically ""misaiming the mic"". At one point, I put the water bottle on a kids (about 7) shoulder, and accidentally spilled a few drops of water. She got a bit mad at me, and I apologized to her, and she seemed OK. I suddenly felt like maybe it wasn't such a good idea to be poking kids with a water bottle.

I later asked the other instructor if I pushed the humor too far, and she told me no, I was fine, that it was funny.

I'm just not sure, I feel maybe it was inappropriate, and I'm concerned a kids gonna tell their parent ""oh, yeah, he poked me with a water bottle on my face during a game"". I'm just afraid a parent might not get the context of what was going on/the humor. Maybe it was totally fine, maybe it was totally out of line. I know you guys weren't there, and don't know me, but I would be mortified if a kid felt uncomfortable because I was trying to be funny. I don't know, help me out.",21Jan2020,1

27,"I have a friend my age (17) who has his own fair share of issues. Depression, dad died a few years ago, among other things. I have ADHD, ODD, social anxiety, and come from an emotionally abusive household. 

Lately, I've been feeling inexplicably upset with said friend. Everytime he mentions he isn't feeling okay, or says something sad, it makes me just... angry? I dealt with a huge bout of suicidal feelings a couple years ago and I know that the constant mentality of ""everything sucks and nothing will ever get better"" does NOT help, but I also know that this is just how some people cope. 

I also feel like sometimes he does it for attention. I don't doubt that he has depression, I just feel like some of the things he says or does are exaggerated. But I know that I can't know, and I know it's wrong for me to think that. 

I haven't been doing great lately and have been wanting to reach out to our group of friends for help, but I feel like they're more preoccupied with helping him, and I don't want to risk him getting upset with me. But it's gotten to the point where he constantly needs help, and I am feeling like my support system is gone.

I know the way I feel is wrong and selfish. Depression is serious and a huge struggle, and I know I can't fully understand the way he experiences it. I want to be more sympathetic about his situation, because I know he's struggling and has been for a while. I want to be able to help him as best I can, but no matter how often I remind myself that I can't be upset over this, I feel like I can't help it.

30,"Hey guys, this is my \[M20\] first post on reddit, so please be nice.  
A little context: 

I´m a very shy and introverted guy, so recently I decided to take some theater classes for introverted and shy people to try and be more comfortable with myself around others.

Because of the way I am I was always very nervous and anxious around people, especially females that I considered attractive, so I have never been on a proper date with anybody. During the theater classes I met this cute girl \[F24\], and pretty much crushed on her right away. After a whole afternoon of trying to gain courage I decided to ask her out on a date, and guess what? For my surprise she said yes!!

Here comes the part where I need the advice. Being that I am 20 years old and she´s 24 I figured she must have some experience in this area and that I probably should´ve had some too. But I don´t. I fear that I won´t know how or when to (re)act if we hit it off (or if we don´t). Also, since our date is only on friday I don´t know if I should try to keep a conversation via social media until there or just wait for the date (in case of the first option how should I bring up a conversation topic in a way that it doesn´t seem weird?)

I know that I shouldn´t go with huge expectations and just try to have a good time, but I fear that I might get too anxious and nervous to be able to act like a normal person in the date.

I´ll appreciate any advice you can give.

PS: English is not my first language, if something is hard to understand tell me and I´ll try to clarify it the best way I can.",21Jan2020,1

I know that I need help, I'm not afraid to ask for it because I am sure that it is for the best but am unsure about how to prepare for this situation. I believe that I have a daughter who is about 9 years old. Her mother and I haven't spoken since before she was born. I wasn't ready or prepared to raise a child or support a family and only have reasonable suspicion that she exists because of a fb post and word from a mutual friend. I like many others believe I would want to provide a better or similar upbringing to my own, however there is no such thing as a perfect life but I believe there are perfect moments. I know that it is going to be a difficult challenge to even try and be a part of a child's life that I know next to nothing about. I now know that the mother got married and has been in prison for about 2 years with about 5 years left on the sentence. I don't know if the child is even mine or how to go about with most any thing related to this situation. I would suspect either the state or the mothers relatives have custody of the child and her older sister. I just want what's best for the child and to help where I can. If it means only child support payments and/or visitation then that is a possibility I will work towards. What are my options and what should my goals be? Do I talk to a lawyer? Should I hire a private investigator? I prepared a letter to the mother and will start there. Words can try to help this kid and her family but I don't know where to begin and which paths to follow.

33,"So i've been part of my schools choir program for about 3 years. Ever since I started i've tried to involve myself in all the events I could, all the audition based advanced choirs, all the optional eventd and fundraisers. But despite how much I get involved in, i'm constantly treated like a joke, my choir teacher refuses to take anything I say seriously and constantly talks shit about me behind my back with oher students. People have said my singing is obnoxious or that I don't deserve the position I have. However I absolutely know that I deserve to be where I am because all my knowledge of music and theatre only comes from me having a passion, I don't have the money to afford private lessons, I can't go to acting workshops, I spend almost 100$ a month to be able to do community theatre because there i'm at least treated like a person. This year I was involved in the schools musical, Into The Woods, and on the audition form it asked me to write down all conflicts I had. I had one major conflict, and that was that I had to leave at 5:30 every tuesday and thursday until the end of February. At a recent rehearsal, I left early and my choir teacher got very upset with me despite it being on my conflicts. The next day I got a text saying that I was completely removed from the production as a result of me leaving rehearsal early too many times. I find this absolutely ridiculous as it was clearly stated in my conflicts. This has been a theme with my choir teacher where she expects her students to miss shifts at work to be able to keep rehearsing. After dealing with this for years, being treated like a joke, being expected to act like a machine, constantly having to give up my free time to appease my teacher, I decided that i've had enough. I'm now in the process of leaving all classes related to choir, no longer giving support to the arts program and exclusively doing community theatre now.

I am mentally ill, struggling with that right now, not even taking all my meds because I hate anti-psychotics. My living space is dirty and small and my housemates are always hostile and this contributes negatively to any episode or relapse of anything. I can't even cook because of their mess. I spend lots of money on ""eating outside"".

I want to go back home for a while. There I can have my room back, a clean house, I would clean stuff and buy my own food. A more tranquil mind. My instruments, my music, my hobbies, my pets back. I wish that. I don't know how to ask my parents. We made ammends on New Years, we started writing back each other.

I forgive them but I still hate them deep down, and they still resent me for my bad past actions. Also I realized my mom is as much depressed as me,and my dad joined a religious cult and found Jesus and talks non-sense while constantly reminding everyone that he has money issues.

37,"So basically my brother (24M) told me and my family last year that he got himself a girlfriend but she's from America (we are from the UK). They have been only dating a few months and he's thinking about travelling to the US to meet her. 

The only problem is that my brother is going there alone (it will be his second time travelling abroad) and planning on staying at his gf family's house. Though recently my brother tried to ask for £250 for his gf hospital bills because apparently she broke her leg from getting into an accident and doesn't have enough money to pay for it all. 

My parents really don't want him to go or to at least stay in a hotel or hostel while he goes there. My brother can't get a full refund back for his flight ticket and he thinks that things would be okay if he stays at the house even though his gf mom has recently gotten out of hospital herself too. 

I did try to have a talk with him but he said he's too broke to get a hotel/hostel and he feels that he has to be with his girlfriend. If things don't work out with her he said he would never date again.

So yeah I don't know what to do... Like I really want to convince him not to go but that would be a lot of Money for him to loose... And it sounds really dangerous for him to be going alone to stay at an online girlfriend's place especially when she has been asking for money off him....

42,"This is gonna be super long and talk about some mental health, just a heads up if you don’t wanna read that stuff.

I am VERY aware that this could just be a millennial life crisis lol, but the thing is that I don’t know if what’s happening is ”alright“ and I‘d love to maybe hear the outside assessment of a stranger. 

My head is in an very strange place right now, I feel insanely energized and optimistic all the time. I keep having these flashes of energy where I sometimes skip a night‘s sleep and am entirely fine even the next day and even the next night, feeling like I could skip another one if I wanted to. In other instances however, it feels like my energy is somewhat ”kickstarting“ if that makes sense, I have an intense rush of adrenaline and being awake and hyperaware of everything to the point where I analyze the different kinds of fabric I can feel on my skin to the amounts of colors I can count in the room plus the last subject I studied all at the same time (not even chronologically, I can’t even put into words how it feels) and then when that burst of energy is gone I fall into a patch of utter exhaustion for like an hour or so. It is definitely affecting my life in positive ways because I get SO MUCH stuff done, but it’s also kinda weird because I feel very alienated from my environment as I feel like everyone is just talking very slowly and thinking a lot and too long and just taking life very slowly in general. (Rationally I know that that’s bs and it’s not intended to be condescending, but this energy is making me feel so awake and so impatient. It’s definitely an error on my side.)

Right now I‘m in a challenging place in my life where I am about to graduate, wanna move abroad, do a graduate degree, have this thing with this guy where I don’t know if it’s real or worth fighting for or going to break my heart but I have a lot of feelings for him anyways, so I know all of that stuff factors in immensely. I wouldn’t be too worried because it is also somehow enjoyable to have this much energy, but my rational side is worried that I am using up some reserves that I can’t refill (as well as thinking that my risk assessment might not be functioning properly right now, so I don’t know if I should be making such huge decisions about my future) My friends and family always told me that I am very emotional and energetic and extreme, so maybe that factors in too.

What is giving me a reason to worry is my ”history“ over the past 3 years. I try to make it as short as possible, but it’s some dark stuff that needs some explaining: My best friend was raped and had a nervous breakdown, leading to her being hospitalized in a psychiatry. I was 16 at the time and got sucked into a lot of the surrounding stuff. Her therapist was a mess and called me during my final high school exams crying and apologizing for having treated her badly, her parents didn’t want anyone in school to know and made it my job to make sure teachers and students heard rumors that had nothing to do with the truth, she herself sometimes didn’t even recognize me when I was visiting her because she was very schizophrenic at that point - it was a lot. Due to that I was very vulnerable to some other stuff and got into an incredibly emotionally abusive friendship. He had feelings, I didn’t, he started threatening to kill himself, to hurt me or my friends, he stalked me, sometimes locked me in rooms and told me about his sexual fantasies with me and didn’t let me leave. Y‘all I wish I could say I was smart enough to leave but I was scared out of my mind and running out of energy, so I put up with it for a long time. I couldn’t tell my friends about it because he said he’d do something to them if I did and that no one would believe me. I tried telling my parents, who I was living with at the time, but they were very religious and all I got was ”Well he loves you and Jesus says to turn the other cheek, so just be more empathetic.“ 

At some point I realized I‘d never get out of there if I waited for some miracle to save me. At a party, I tried to tell him I never wanted to see him again. He then turned physical, tried to pull me into his car and started choking me. I don’t know how, but I had an immense burst of strength, pushed his head against the car, punched the living hell out of him and ran away, back to the party, where I downed half a bottle of vodka (dramatic, I know, but it’s important for what’s next) and went home by foot. Luckily it wasn’t far, luckily he had left, but obviously freshly turned 17 y/o me didn’t hold her liquor very well, so I vomited all over the kitchen floor and fell asleep right inside of that. The next morning my mom came downstairs and just told me to clean up and that ”if my problems are so severe she couldn’t help me.“ 

That was when I realized I hadn’t yet done enough, I had to get out of there as well. I didn’t have the financial means to move out, but I cut all ties with my friends from home and tried to talk to my family as little as possible. My relationship with my parents worsened, they said some pretty hurtful stuff and my mom beat me sometimes, so I was VERY focused on moving out and worked 3 jobs next to college. 

All went well and although I was really struggling with anxiety at that point I managed to find a group of friends. There was a guy in that group who was into me and although I didn’t know what I was feeling I tried to give it a shot. We dated for half a year, but trauma was catching up with me and at some point I had to admit to myself and to him that I was depressed and not able to feel anything for him. He was the first person I admitted this struggle to, but he decided to react like a horrible person and went ”Well you were a waste of time, maybe reconsider that suicide thing.“ 

Obvs I was devastated but what was even worse was that he turned all our friends against me (I was still living at home and had to commute quite a bit so I had no chance to get to them at all those spontaneous get togethers). He told them I was a slut and just playing him (lol depressed me was at most playing myself by not getting out of bed), they believed him and started childish bully stuff like not talking to me anymore, putting their bags on free chairs in lectures when I got there, screenshooting my social media, writing something mean and then ”accidentally“ sending it to me. It sucked. I hurt. But then I got better. I found an apartment, got away from my parents and our relationship improved immediately. I once again started building a new friend circle. This time, I fell in love with a girl, for the first time in my life did I experience something more than ”liking“ somebody. Of course, as you probably have guessed from the theme of this story, it was very complicated and halfway she realized she wasn’t comfortable with her sexuality and all of a sudden found me disgusting for being bi.  You see, the past years were so much fun.

Well I thought I was done with the worst, but then last year my mom got diagnosed with cancer. My Dad is struggling with depression and they don’t really have friends and most of my extended family doesn’t really talk to them, so I knew I was pretty much the only help they could get. It was, once again, a lot to juggle with three jobs and college and beyond emotionally taxing. But, somehow, I managed. And the weirdest part is that during that year I really felt like I came into being myself. I grew confident and I felt this very deep sense of trust that everything is gonna be alright, because I realized that really my only options were to either stop existing or just go ahead and deal with it. That very basic realization did so much for me somehow. It wasn’t all a choice and no matter how bad I felt, as long as I kept breathing nothing was lost or over. And through that thought process I developed a very deep sense of ”fight back, you got this.“ I formed meaningful, healthy and supportive friendships, did great at my job, somehow managed to keep my GPA up high enough for the degrees I wanna do and made a ton of great and new experiences outside of the hospital/ work. By the end of the year, my mom was fine again. I got better and better and better, I feel insanely awake, grateful and present now. Which brings me here and which is why I had to write this TON of text. Thanks if you got here. The very basic question that needed a lot of context would be - do you think that this heightened energy stuff I described above is normal, can I go with that and make decisions and get stuff moving or am I overcompensating for the bad stuff that happened? I know you guys aren’t therapists and I hope I don’t put too much on you, but an outside evaluation by a stranger would be super helpful right now, even if it would just be for me to compare my own thoughts too.

59,"Throwaway account just in case family sees this.  Hi there, I genuinely need help making a decison here. 

I am in my early twenties. My current living situation is coming to an end due to one of my parents abusive actions. They've had issues for years but i finally cant take it anymore. Long story short i lived here up until now to save as much money as possible before I have to start paying rent or a mortgage. But the parent has become unbearable and recently did something unforgiveable and I've made the decision to move out to be happy. 

I now have the option to live with family member A or family member B.

A is purchasing a house and wants me to live there and rent a room. I would have my own space and only have to pay 500-600$ a month. I would have my own room, be able to be creative with my own space. Probably even have a section of the house to put my own tv and make that area my personal relaxing area. I would have a more ""adult"" living situation, feel more free and taking care of myself more. I would be able to come and go with my girlfriend in a feeling of true adult living seeing as A is closer to my age and my gender. 

B owns a house and wants me to live with her and have my own room for only 100$ a month. The room would be smaller than A's option. And i would have to share communal space much more. Less freedom to make my space my own, less privacy. I would still be able to come and go but have the ""kid"" feeling seeing as B is an older female family member. 

I am all about financial planning and thats why this decision is so hard for me. I work 50 hour weeks every week to make enough money to be able to spend it before im too old. Buy a house, start a family etc. Thats why ive lived where i do up until now because its been almost free and I've saved thousands. 

So its hard for me to decide. Do i pay 500-600 a month for A, which would probably make me happier in the short term. Or save hundreds by living with B and only paying 100 a month, but ""sucking it up"" to live in a doable but not ideal living situation?",21Jan2020,1

61,"I have been with my SO for nearly 4 years. I'm 23 and he's 32, his sister is 27. 
From the get go she was distant and snobby. 
This is the type of girl to go to post-secondary for nearly 10 years to become a middle school teacher. My SO is a business owner and supports His self and his family. He has paid for all of her schooling plus multiple years of studying abroad. Plus a brand new car for her as soon as she turned 16.

this girl is nearly 30 years old and has never paid a single bill for herself in her entire life. Her parents still pay her credit card and give her spending money and then some. She will ask my boyfriend for money when her credit card limit is up. 


My boyfriend wanted to get me flowers  after a long trip I took visiting family and she threw a temper tantrum because she didn't get flowers from him when she came home from studying abroad. ( AND HE LISTENED AND NOT ONLY DIDNT GET ME ANYTHING BUT WAS AN HOUR LATE PICKING ME UP FROM THE AIRPORT AFTER AN 8 HOUR FLIGHT)  she also has croped me out of multiple family photos and not only posted them online for everybody to see but have framed them in her house for me to see when I visit my in-laws. 

when my boyfriend had his 30th birthday I decided to be the bigger person and extend the Olive Branch, I texted her and asked her if she would like to help me plan his birthday, she agreed. I asked her to take care of the guest list, again, she agreed. 
The day before the party she showed up to my house with food cake decorations and everything taken care of if she completely took over the entire thing and I just sat there and said nothing and let her do her thing. She insisted on lighting his cake and bringing it out to him, I was livid. 

Everyone thinks this witch walks on water including my boyfriend. I was raised to pay for everything myself and haven't had half the opportunities she has yet she's still horrible to me. I have developed this deep rooted seething hatred/jealousy for her and it's really affecting my relationship.

I have no social media presence which seems key to doing this in 2020, I can't seem to get any success locally other than maybe getting into some shows if I'm lucky, and the only option that seems like a way to get money coming in is to get disability from the government for my schizophrenia, but I don't want to do that because it will make me feel like a failure.  


I keep telling myself that if I just work harder and make better paintings eventually success and happiness will come to me but I'm not seeing any progress towards that, and it's completely drained me of my will to continue doing this because nobody really seems to give a fuck about me or my artwork.

I see other people who are in artistic fields that are my age who are starting to or have seen success, who seemingly don't make as good of art as me, but I'm starting to even doubt if my stuffs any good, if any of this ""hard work"" i've been doing was for anything, because people just don't like my art, so I'm starting to think it must be shit, and I'm delusional.",21Jan2020,1
69,"My mom is really sick right now. She is coughing really bad, and she gets into these terrible choking fits where she has a hard time breathing every time she talks or does something.

I wouldn’t be so worried normally, however every 3-4 weeks she gets really sick like this. However this is the worse it has gotten. Normally she would get bronchitis and she would be out of it in a week, now she gets like this. This has probably started around late August.

However, my friend had turned that age and she has a job at a local store. So she does have the funds to pay their phone bill and they have do WiFi at home. She was finally given her phone and we were able to text easily.  

Texting is easier than having to physically walk over to the place (which is a mile away) and see if she’s home.  

Age had their phone for a while until it was taken away for no reason. They didn’t misbehave or anything (this is isnt the first time something like that this happened I’ll explain further). They had came over to my house, their sibling comes with her every time they come over.  Which is strange because there’s no one around their age to play with any of my siblings.  It’s really weird.  My two younger brothers are two young to play with the sibling while my two older siblings are older.  

I had asked about her phone and they said it was taken away for no reason. I asked if she had misbehaved possibly and she said no.  She said her parents decided to take away her phone despite meeting their requirements of the ability to have a phone.  

Then I asked what if there’s like an emergency and you need a phone (they drives alone to work late at night around 10 in a rural ghetto sorta neighborhood.) she had stated that her parents told her if it happened she should knock on every door to get help which is totally unsafe for a 16 year old girl to go to strangers houses let alone at around 10 PM.  However the houses are like at least a mile apart in this area.   

She then told me another story where her headlights had once gone out.  She didn’t have a flashlight or a phone for that matter, she had to drive on the pitch black.  

Another case where I suspect abuse is once I was over at her house, one of their kids (who has a problem) had wet their pants.  They began to scream at them for wetting his pants and told him to wash up. However I read that like screaming at young children for wetting their pants is bad. However this kid is slightly older. 

Another was I invited her to see a Disney movie. Her parents agreed to let her go the day before.  She was excited since she had wanted to see the movie. 
Next day we go to pick her up and she has tears in her eyes saying she couldn’t go at all. Later a few days ago I went to her house and asked about the movie.  She stated she didn’t get in trouble and her parents decided to not let her see the movie. 


So basically having a phone is good for safety. What if she got into a car crash? She couldn’t call for help. Even a. Flip up phone could be used but she doesn’t have that. I wouldn’t want my future 16 year old daughter walk at night all alone or drive at night alone with creepy people who are out there in the world.",21Jan2020,1
81,"My dad has contact saved in phone with just the initials. He doesn't do that with anyone else. A few times now, my brother, my GF, and I have seen him texting this random initials contact in his phone flirtatious things, coupled with flirtatious emojis. I was able to find out that he's also been visiting her place when my mom is out of town, perhaps even while she's here. He even bought her daughter a very expensive graduation gift. I mean like, he put more effort into that than when I graduated high school. Another thing, I've gone to check his phone a few times when I've had the chance, and most of the time he's erased the conversation on his phone (clearly hiding something). The one time he hadn't done that there wasn't anything too incriminating there, but it was definitely odd. It fucks me up to even say this, but he's more friendly and loving with his texts to this random woman than he ever is with my mom. It breaks my heart. Still I keep thinking, well, I don't know anything yet, but at this point, some clear lines have been crossed. And the funny thing is, my dad was always very hard on us about like, ""if you have a girlfriend you should never text or hangout with other girls! That's totally inappropriate and will lead to mischievious behaviour! It's nothing anything to be fucked with!''. Starting to sound like the son of a bitch was speaking out of experience. 

Anyway, I'll get to it. I roughly know where she lives, I know where she works. She has a hair salon in town, and I wanna go in there and confront her. Or should I ask her daughter what her mom's relationship is to my dad? I haven't been able to get her contact info but I could probably manage that. I don't wanna just confront my dad because he is an angry violent man who would most likely just deny everything anyway. I cannot let this keep going though. I have to do something about it. I feel like I can't go to my mom about it yet because I don't have concrete evidence yet, I know this is gonna sound naive but it could be that their ""friendship"" is a non-sexual thing. But at the same time why is he trying to conceal her identity and erasing conversations? (More than once). He's clearly got something to hide. 

If you have any advice on how to go about this or have been in a similar situation before please hook me up. 

PS. I do also have reason to believe she knows my dad is a married man and is ""in on it"" if you know what I mean. So if I ask her about I am quite sure she will just lie to my face as well.

85,"In the past I’ve had crushes and in the past I’ve had long term girlfriends, but I’ve never felt the feeling I do now. I’m 20 living in Texas, I enlisted in the Air Force last year. She is 20 living in my hometown in Illinois. We’ve known eachother since 2nd grade and she was my neighbor. We rode the bus every day until we could drive and spent a lot of time together. We grew apart during that time but still talked and hung out occasionally. We started talking again about four months ago and chat every day. We’d simply been friends, completely platonic, until last month when I went home for Christmas. The time we spent together was wonderful and she feels the same about me as I do about her. The only problem is that she just got out of a long term relationship with a man who broke her heart just a few weeks after we started talking again. I supported her as a friend but didn’t “take advantage” of her in her emotional state. Like I said, just friends. We both would talk to each-other about dates we went on and other things in life. I wasn’t jealous, and I don’t hold those things against her. I don’t feel insecure about her talking to other guys. She’s so much more important to me than to get upset over petty things like that. Anyways, she’s told me that she feels the same way about me but she’s not ready. I respect that. I find myself reaching out to her more than she does to me. Sometimes she’ll ignore my messages. I don’t get mad at this, and I don’t play games in response to being hurt. I simply just am hurt knowing I’m not as important to her as she is to me. Last night on the phone she told me she loves me with all of her heart and I mean the world to her, and I believe her 100%. She tells me she loves me and thinks about me multiple times a week. Last night she also said that she’s “dangerous for me” since I love her so much and that she wants to “keep my heart intact”. What does this mean? My mind is telling me to block her on everything, go get laid and drink away my pain. But my heart doesn’t want to give up. I don’t want to keep giving and giving and keep getting disappointed. What do I do?

Ps. I’m keeping my mind occupied. I’m hanging out with friends, working out, doing fun things on the weekend, enjoying my hobbies, etc. I have tinder and am chatting with other women and have gone on a few dates and had sex since I came back to Texas but they don’t mean anything to me.

87,"I'll get right to the point. I was best friends with someone for most of my childhood. We had an argument that effectively killed our friendship. She was in the wrong (we both agree on this). She has apologized. I forgive her completely.

The thing is, we just grew apart after that and she doesn't seem to be willing to accept that. It's been about two years since this fight and the resolution and we hardly talk (I'm talking a handful of times a year). I saw her once last year. I'm fine with us talking and if she wanted to hang out, I wouldn't be against it but that 'spark' really isn't there anymore and we aren't close at all. 

She sent me a very long message one night telling me that I need to be honest with her if I'm upset about something because she wants us to 'fix this' and that can't happen if I don't tell her if I'm upset. I didn't really know what to say. I told her that I had no reason to not be honest because there isn't much to lose (trying to politely point out that we aren't that close anymore anyway). 

That was half a year ago. We haven't spoken since besides a few words. The other day she asked how I was. We had a small maybe four message conversation in which she asked what I wanted to do with my life in the last message. 

I got busy and then had worked all day the next day, so I didn't respond even though I had seen the message. 

She then sent me a long message telling me it upsets her a lot when I see her messages and don't reply and that she wants us to 'make this work' but it feels like I don't want to when I do that. 

I haven't responded not because I want to ignore her but because I really don't know what to say. We've hardly spoken all year. I don't even know what's going on with her life, nor she mine. Her messages sound very disconnected from the situation to me and I don't know how to point that out without hurting her or making it sound like I never want to talk to her. 

I'm okay talking to her. We just really don't talk (she doesn't reach out much either) or make plans and there isn't really a connection anymore anyway. She acts like we're trying to rekindle our friendship but in reality, it's been years since we've been close and the only thing connecting us now is the fact that we used to know each other. 

I don't know. I've scrolled through reddit for a while but made this account to post this. Any advice would be welcome because I'm kind of at a loss and I don't really know what to say without hurting her.",21Jan2020,1

So my mom died a year ago. She was an art teacher. When she died she had like 20 grand left for me. I was going to use it for my schooling.

I haven’t visited them in a few weeks and my grandmother wants to know why. I just can’t tell her why even though i complain about it. I’m afraid that if I can figure out the issue it’ll make things worse for me. I live with my dad, I don’t have anyone else. I don’t want things going bad for him if things happen because of my grandfather claiming I live with him. I don’t know really how to fix this issue. Should I just let him keep my money.. keep the 20 grand and never talk to them again ? What he did was illegal . Why? He used papers from when I was a baby practically from when I was living there with my mom for not even a full year. I’ve had this issue with my money since I don’t know.. a while.

95,"So there's this pretty cool job that I like and I'm thinking about applying but I'm hesitant. 

I meet some of the expectations, i.e. a high-schools diploma. They also say that having a college degree in a major linked to economics is a plus. I don't have one yet, but I'm in college to get my economics degree. 

It's said that previous experience is welcome but not required. The other requirements are pretty vague honestly, they mostly describe character traits. 

Here's the catch though. The job pays well, exceptionally well, actually. It's not said explicitly anywhere in the offer but it's apparent that it's a senior position or at least higher management. 

I'm 21 and I don't need a job. I'm still at school. However, this looks like a pretty cool offer. I'm very hesitant about applying though, because I there will be tons of other candidates with so much better qualities queuing for this position. Also I'm very (I MEAN VERY) afraid of being laughed at and mocked thinking I could even imagine getting a job there.

97,"This is going to be long, I apologize in advance. I'm a 22 year old socially awkward guy who's never been in a relationship and just started online dating fairly recently with not a lot of success so far.

I started talking to this guy on tinder and then on snapchat. He told me that I was really hot and smart, things that I don't get called often. He gave me his phone number after talking on snapchat for a few days and we planned a date after texting each other for about a week.

We go to a diner and then a park near me and it goes really w7ell. We make out a few times and he calls me cute. He had to drive an hour to see me, which he says he never does, and that after his last relationship ended he didn't think he'd be ready to date again so soon but that there was something about me that he liked.

We keep texting for a week or two after the date. He tells that he's obsessed with me, that he's falling for me and that he can see himself spending the rest of his life with me. I'm absolutely over the moon about this, since I've never had anyone say anything like this to me before, and I really like this guy. He also tells me that he cheated on his last boyfriend with an older guy because he and his boyfriend fought too much and didn't have sex enough since they lived an hour away. He said that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that it's important to have his sexual needs met.

I live an hour away from him too and I can't drive at the moment. I felt like I wouldn't be able to fulfill his sexual needs as much as he wants and I don't want to be worried that he'll cheat on me, so I told him that I think maybe we should go our separate ways.

He says that I'm acting like he's a sex addict and that he's not interested in me anymore. I beg him to reconsider and he says that we can be friends for a bit first and maybe we can date in the future. I tell him that I'm ok with that. He texts me a few hours later and asks for nudes to make sure that I'm dedicated to him.

I send them and he tells me that I made him lose all the positive feelings he had about me and that he needs to have sex with me and cum in me to see if he still likes me and that we'll be dating after if the sex is good.

I'm hesitant to have unprotected sex with him, but I feel awful for making him not like me anymore and I want him to be falling for me again. What should I do?",21Jan2020,1

100,"I have begun to notice this significantly more in the past year or so than the rest of my life. I believe it stems from the fact that I am at the age where people are constantly asking me what I want to do with my life and I am not entirely sure.

I would like to avoid being influenced by things such as movies and TV so I can make decisions on my own.

For some examples of what I am talking about this is what I am dealing with:

\- I found the youtuber Mark Rober (a former NASA engineer) and watched a lot of his videos, for about a month afterwards I wanted to be an engineer and vigorously studied before that dream started to fade.

\- I watched some military movies, and the most recent John Wick movie and wanted to join the military, this one did not actually disappear entirely and more so transitioned into another one.

\- I binge watched a few seasons of Bob's Burgers and got seriously interested in cooking and wanted to open a restaurant when I get older, again after about a month that began to fade.

\- After playing some various games that I greatly enjoyed (Red Dead Redemption 2 and some others) I wanted to become a video game designer and even watched countless hours of tutorials and learned some moderate code in about a month. 

\- My school went on a field trip to an extracurricular program where we got to learn about different career choices, one of these was public safety and I chose it to learn about. At the presentation they explained that they train people to join the military and become police officers, all of a sudden I wanted to be a police officer now.

\- The most recent one is the most ridiculous and is why I am making this post. I watched seasons 1 and 2 of Attack on Titan (an anime) about a year or two ago and simply enjoyed the show. I returned to it yesterday because I found out that all of season 3 was out and in two days I binge watched the whole season (I was on a three day weekend from school) . I found that while I was watching this time around, I wanted to be in the universe of Attack on Titan (an insane desire considering the show is about people getting brutally murdered by enormous creatures outside their control). Obviously I cannot magically go into the world of Attack on Titan, and I know the dream will pass in a few weeks or so, but I don't know how to stop getting influenced like this.

(for context, all of the above examples have happened in less than 6 months, making my life a constant roller coaster)

Im obviously not asking someone to decide what I should do in my life, but rather what I should do to avoid every little thing steering my life in a different direction. As I am typing this I still have that Attack on Titan dream in my head, and no matter how many times I try to remember that it is ludicrous and physically impossible I can't shake the idea.

101,"Hi there. I'm a freshman in college and I just finished my first quarter of college. I had a pretty rough time getting used to college, and because I commute and also work a part time job, it was difficult to keep up with the work load at times since I was taking 5 courses. These sound like excuses, but I also slacked off quite a bit and didn't take my classes seriously. Luckily, I did okay in my other four classes (A-, B+, A-, A) but in my math class I got a C-, which is barely passing. I passed the final exam by around 0.7%, so you could say I cut it really close.

Anyway, I was obviously really upset and distraught when I got my grade back, but also knew that I could've managed my time better. I'm doing everything I can this quarter to do well in my classes and feel like I have a better idea on how to succeed.

The issue is, I have an incredibly overbearing and strict father. He asked to see my grades over break and I panicked and ended up coding the letter from a C- to an A on my laptop to show it to him. He said he was angry about my B+ and that I should get all As next quarter. I know I shouldn't have lied to him but I was just so scared since he is the one paying for my education.

Today, he asked me to see my grades again. But this time, he asked me to login while he was right behind me. Naturally, I didn't have time to do the same trick before, so he saw my bad grade. I told him it must've been some mistake and that I'll contact my professor, and he seemed really irritated about it.

I know it might seem like I'm overreacting but I'm just really scared to tell him, especially when he expects so much from me, and I feel like I dug myself a grave when I lied to him the first time because now I feel like I have to keep it up somehow. I want to tell him and let him know that I'm determined to do better for the rest of my college experience, but I'm worried he won't believe me and won't give me a chance.

109,"Trying to start a music career but I can’t escape my family

Background info: I’m 19. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and dropped out of community college. I’m unemployed and have no driver’s license. I live with my parents and my 15yo sister. I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, yada yada yada.

Our house is small: kitchen, living room, sister’s bedroom, mom’s bedroom, my bedroom, one bathroom, and the basement where my dad lives. Every noise anyone makes is audible from everywhere. I’ve developed a lot of noise sensitivity because of this (ie I get anxiety attacks when I hear TV from the other room, I’m constantly listening to white noise so I don’t have to hear every noise from the bathroom, etc). 

And yes, my dad works and my sister goes to school, but my mom works from home and is the loudest of any of us. Plus she’s the overbearing type and I feel constantly surveilled. There’s no escape. I’ve developed a sleep schedule where I wake up at 4pm and sleep at 7am, just so I have some time to myself without TVs blaring and people yelling across the house and my mom keeping tabs on every move I make.

So you can see how it might be difficult to make music in this environment. Nighttime is the only time I ever write anything, but at this point it feels kind of futile — I can’t record during the day bc noise, and I can’t do it at night bc I’ll wake everyone up. And it’s not like I have much inspiration anyway, spending every day basically in hiding from my family till I finally get to breathe at like 2am.

So I’m pretty much at a loss. My entire life feels wasted. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get time/space to myself to write and record music and actually live my life like it’s mine?

113,"When we first started dating he told me that he smoke pot, and I thought he only did it for fun or even once in awhile. However, I soon realized that he smoke 24/7. In the beginning he was very good at hiding the smell from his car, himself, and his breathe, but he didn’t keep up that routine long. Then, we went on trips to cali and he couldn’t last a couple hours without it. We took a bigger trip to Spain and boy was it a rough couple days in the beginning of the trip. However, when we came back he went back to smoking 24/7. At the time he thought it was helping his stomach problems, but it was making it worse. We didn’t find out until the doctor told him to quit because if he doesn’t his stomach would need surgery. He finally stopped and his stomach healed. After he took a drug test for his internship, out of nowhere he started smoking 24/7 again. I feel like it’s an addiction that I don’t know what to do or say because if I say something he makes it feel like I am too uptight and that’s why I dislike smoking or that it’s his business not mine. He spends all his paycheck on weed, and it’s not healthy. I think I have been very patient the last 3 years, but I don’t know how long I can put up with it. I don’t want to have kids and him just driving smoking for an hour or two to “relief stress,” then making excuses for him to where he is. Like I am now when his family or my family asked where he went during events/trips. An hour may not sound bad, but it’s pretty bad when it’s like 4 times a day. When I want to go up and sleep, he has to go to the dispensary, drive around and smoke, then come back in bed (it’s like 2 hours and I am just waiting for him in bed to sleep next to me). It’s such a pain, and I am pretty sure that he is having stomach pains again; however, he would never tell me because he probably doesn’t want to stop smoking. I know and he knows he is addicted, but you can’t do much with a person with doesn’t want help right. What should I do? I can’t stick around watching this, but it’s hard to leave.",21Jan2020,1
114,"I moved to a new city to start a new job and experience living somewhere new about a year ago. 

Everyone I work with is 10+ years older than me, I have no friends here and I've had a really difficult time trying to build a social life. I've tried joining church groups (although not very religious), sports leagues (everyone just wanted to get drunk on a Monday night), meetup groups, etc. and I don't really hit it off with anyone! 

I've never had difficulty making friends in the past but I just don't have any regular situations where I am around the same people to really get to know them.

116,"(this is in Iowa by the way) Our landlord has decided that, after having us as tenants for 19 months, is FINALLY going to get the basement bathroom tiled and have a shower installed.  The tile guy she is employing is doing this as a side job and won't be able to show up until 4-5 PM.  

My bedroom is right next to the bathroom and opens into the laundry room/storage room.  My issue is that I work 3rd shift (11 PM-somewhere between 8 and 11 AM) 7 days a week.  When this guy is due to show up i will be in the middle of my sleep.  My landlord is planning to have him set up the wet saw literally right outside of my bedroom door, and cut tile with it while i'm trying to sleep (and terrify my dog too).  I don't mind him doing the tile work if he uses the saw outside in the driveway, but it is currently lower than 10 degrees outside.  This will also mean there are going to be 6 people sharing one bathroom for a week and a half while this is all going on.

I’ll try to keep this brief. 

Recently, a friend of mine (let’s call them J) did something...awful, to another friend of mine (let’s call them Q). Something unforgivable, can’t really talk about it as it’s not my business to be sharing, but regardless that’s not really the point of this.

127,"Lately, my mom has been full of rage for the past few weeks. She’s that typical Asian tiger parent who values school more than your own well being. Anyways, my mom has been threatening my siblings and I that if we don’t go to church she’ll have the internet taken away forever. I’ve tried talking sense into her but she never listens. I know it’s not right to disobey your parents but I don’t like being forced into a religion I don’t want to believe in. I got baptized in 2018 just for my parents to shut up because they would always say how I need Jesus in my life and that he is the answer to all your problems. How am I suppose to believe that with no proof except a bible? Religion is a sensitive topic so I’ll stop talking about it.

This happened just recently: There was a rumor about a shooting happening at my school. I told my mom this last night and showed her evidence (posts on FB about who is doing it). She reacted like how any of us would. Thankfully, there were automated messages from the founder of our school sent to parents of the students. There was no threat since police investigated. However, I still felt unsafe. You never know, right? I ask my mom if I could stay but she said I had to go to school. There’s literally exams this week but not on Tuesday. It’s just a normal day tomorrow.

Just an hour ago from writing this, I jokingly whined to my mom, “Mom ~ all my friends are staying home TT” but she screamed at me. She yelled to me, “I don’t give a sh*t if you die. If you die you die. I don’t f****** care. I don’t want to excuse you anymore.” I replied, “Geez, it’s just a joke.” Then she mumbles something I couldn’t understand cause I was talking over her “Wow, I have the best mom ever.”

My mom has constantly told me I’m stupid because I didn’t do so well in my freshman year of high school. I was just really lazy since I got into games and that was the only thing I cared about. I went to summer school to get back my credits. Fortunately, I’m doing way better now. No failing grades. I’m not trying to satisfy my parents though. I just need to get a high school diploma or life will get really hard. It hits really different when your own parent calls you stupid. Anyone feel me? I did ask my mom, “Did you only give birth to me to be successful?” She smiled and says, “Yeah! You have to pay me back all the money I spent on you.”

I honestly don’t get people who have babies but aren’t ready for parenthood.

I know I don’t have it the hardest in this world (obviously) but it’s fine to complain, such is life. I know I’m still young and I still have a long way in life. But I don’t know, I feel like even if I died, my parents would only complain about how I didn’t attend college and how I was very lazy/didn’t do anything productive or beneficial. I’m an introvert by the way and it’s extremely hard to talk to people I don’t know/I’m not close with.

I don’t feel loved by my parents. They probably do but I’m hurt that they don’t try to understand no matter how many times I want my voice to be heard. Getting ignored, yelled at, and cursed upon by your own parents is so heartbreaking.

What can I do in this situation? Both my parents are busy and don’t want to be bothered.

I can’t really understand it, but it’s also really familiar? I really don’t know how to describe it, but it’s like instinctual, just on the tip of my conscious realization.

136,"So there's this girl…

Background: 

So there's this girl in my art class, we're both sophomores, the same age, etc. I began talking to her sometime after the second semester started, but I've never had any 1 on 1 conversations with her, because the way the classroom is set up, we have to set by 2 other people (luckily my friend and her friend are those 2 other people haha). Now this girl, I think she looks attractive, and apparently other people do too, as she's told the table, but she doesn't actually like any of the guys that find her attractive lucky enough. I've noticed that I make this girl laugh almost Everytime we're in class, (not to gas myself up or anything) but this could just be because I'm a comedic person. I've also got a lot in common with her, she has an xbox I do too, she smokes weed etc. I've gone on long enough about her though, here's where I need actual advice

The problem:

 this happened on Friday…I was walking out of class one day, when suddenly the girl I've expressed to be so find about playfully taps my shoulder and does that little thing where you run around to the other side of the person you tapped and basically make them look like a fool, however, I managed to turn my head in the right direction and catch her in the act, keep in mind, this girl had never really done anything playful like this to me before, so I was genuinely confused, but happy nevertheless. So we begin to walk and talk down the hallway, and im making her laugh, until we get to this intersection where I need to make a turn to get to my class, and where she needs to make a turn to get to hers, as we're getting ready to depart after talking, we both just kinda stand there looking at each other, and in my head im like ""say bye to her! Say bye!"" But I just give her this blank stare and we go our separate ways. Over this weekend I've just been sitting here thinking about this specific moment on repeat, it won't get out of my head.

My Dad has extremely high expectations of me, and expects me to perform like him, if not better. He went to one of the best schools in the nation, and is a prominent figure in both business and politics. Nonetheless, he's crazy smart. I'm just an average high school kid with decent grades who runs track. Everything he does or says to me is related to something that I am not doing well enough. Here are a few examples (all verbatim):

\-Yells at me constantly for grades, even though I maintain a steady 4.0 (weighted) it is not high enough for him, since he thinks colleges look at it unweighted or something.

\-Yells at me for being too slow at track, even though I am close to qualifying for districts and he is quite a heavy man.

\-Calls me a ""lazy, unmotivated fuck"" for browsing Reddit instead of doing ACT prep.

\-Speaking of ACT prep, signed me up for a prep class, saying that my score was ""below his standards"" after I got a 33.

\-Can no longer do anything I enjoy, like ultimate frisbee, because ""ultimate frisbee will not help you get into Amherst.""

\-""You won't get into college unless you do XYZ,"" forces me to do activities that overload my schedule and ruin my lack of motivation to try anything new.

\-Refuses to let me hang out with one of my friends, who is a senior, after finding out that she is going to a school that is not very ""academically prestigious.""

\-Whenever I try to explain how burnt out I am, he just says that I'm lazy and wants to ""waste my life playing those stupid fucking video games, this is why you aren't going anywhere in life.""

I know it's not physical abuse, and I don't want to appear ungrateful for having my Dad in my life.

142,"TLDR; Bad memories associated with this language. Absolutely no motivation beyond fear and pressuring. Am I just being whiny, lazy, or avoiding something crucially beneficial to me later in life? 

This morning I created a schedule that would help streamline student life. Chores....schoolwork.....writing.... check, check, check. But as my eyes go down the list I notice something that didn’t sit well with me. Mandarin, 8:15-9:15. Any sane person would tell me to go for it. There are no cons. You get to connect to your cultural heritage better, communicate with family members, and learn one the most powerful country’s dominant language!

My first memories of mandarin were the happy ones. Eating in a restaurant with family, speaking in a secret language no one else knew. Watching fascinating dramas, joyous festivities. As I approached elementary school my dad decided to self-teach me. It was alright at first, but I wasn’t exactly the sharpest knife in the shed, at least when it came to learning Chinese. My dad would easily lose his temper, and my rebellious nature didn’t help. He would scream a lot. I would often play “hide and seek” to avoid learning. Inside laundry dryers, under the couch, small cabinets. It felt like torture. I suppose it all cumulated when he got fed up and slapped me, leaving a large bruise and my mother in hysterics. We stopped learning at my mother’s behest. I suppose I got off easily. From that day on I decided to loathe the language, despise it, forget about it entirely.

Recently I got the idea to start self-studying seriously again because we are going to visit China soon and I’m more scared of disappointing my extended family than some childish experience. My parents don’t know about this desire, so there’s no direct pressure. But I always feel the heavy weight. Everytime I visit some of my relatives will gossip in front of my face about me. I’m not that great at speaking so they think I can’t understand either. I hate it.

Everytime I approach a Chinese textbook though I feel a very opaque sense of dread. My heart rate drops. I keep remembering the worst memories. Should I just give up? I don’t know what to do.",21Jan2020,1

It's become a habit. Just... Lying. Just without thinking it, saying something blatantly untrue. Something that could be true but that just isn't. Saying someone just said ""Insert mundane thing"" to me online. Telling someone I ate toast for breakfast when I had cereal. It's always bugged me to a degree but I hate it now.

I know it's counted almost everyone I know currently out of being in my future because I've lied to all of them and they'd never trust me when they find out. And they'll probably find out.

160,"Hi r/advice,

(This might be a long post, I’m really sorry. TL/DR at bottom)

I’m a 17 year old student who’s had some issues in the past with anxiety and self-harm. I used to live in a different state, where I went to therapists for several years through elementary school, had multiple psychological evaluations, and even tried medication for my anxiety. I moved, and told my parents I didn’t want any form of mental health treatment. I was 11 years old at the time, but my parents, in their amazing judgement, listened to me and I haven’t been to a therapist or psychiatrist since. 

A few years after that, I went through a pretty hard time for one reason or another (I’ve honestly blocked it from my memory enough that I don’t remember what happened) that led me to harm myself. My parents discovered it, and basically told me to stop (I did, even though I relapsed a couple of times). They didn’t take me for any kind of treatment. (To me, that doesn’t really seem like the best judgement, but what would I know, right?) 

So now here I am. I’ve been doing fine, even though my anxiety (social and general) is kind of a constant in my life, it hasn’t gotten “really really bad”. I’ve had some recent issues between me and my mom that has caused me to think more about this whole not having the best judgement thing. She’s told me to tell her if I need to see a psychiatrist, and I think some part of me could still benefit from it, but I’m really scared to go back because I don’t really have the best memories associated with psych offices, and I don’t want this to make her think I’m not ready for college (a big fear of hers is that I’ll have a mental breakdown in college).

Oh, and this story gets even more complicated: I’ve read through one of my psych evaluations (there are at least 2 that I know of), and the psychiatrist that wrote it was considering a diagnosis of PDD. That’s now part of the autism spectrum. Some emails I’ve seen have referenced me being “diagnosed” with a social perception disorder. I also have some memories of going to occupational therapists over the years, and I remember one time at school we had a disability awareness assembly and I noticed the “touch brush” looked like what my OT had given me. I know there’s nothing wrong with being autistic, but I’m still really scared I could have this diagnosis and my parents have been keeping it from me for years. I don’t want my whole life and perception of myself to change.

I’d really rather not confront my parents about the diagnosis, but instead I’d like to access a copy of my old psychiatric records.  How would I go about this if I don’t live in the same place where I had my treatment and I’m not 18 yet? Should I wait until I turn 18? Would I even be able to get my records (from when I was 5-10 years old)?

Any advice would really be appreciated, thank you!

TL/DR - 17 years old. Saw therapists for anxiety from 5-10 years old. At 10-11, told my parents I didn’t want any more therapists and they (shouldn’t have) listened. Struggled with anxiety and self-harm, doing okay now but still considering seeing a psychiatrist to work through it. Also, my parents might be hiding an autism diagnosis from me and I want to get my medical records.",21Jan2020,1
161,"Hello. I'm a normal guy with a pretty good life. I didn't start realizing I had barriers caused by situations I had been put in and didn't know any better on how to react towards. It got so bad that I started masking it with the sense of cockyness inward my own mind telling myself I didn't need to deal with any bullshit. I ghosted a close friend who had her own issues because of this mentality. I started splurging in ways that didn't leave me feeling whole at all. I started building a persona I could get high from almost, whenever I wanted. It just hit me so hard this evening, how much I've been creating a prison for my own mind. Tonight I've finally decided enough is enough. I want to see a therapist.

Where do I even begin seriously looking, and how do I figure out where a good place is to go for psychotherapy in the form of just talking for now?

169,"So here's the context:

This boy and I met through Tinder in March of last year. We met up when he was visiting my college for orientation; he was transferring to my college the next semester. We went out on a date and tried to keep in touch throughout the summer while he was 4 hours away in his hometown; although, I was getting vibes that we would be better as friends. We briefly lost touch but picked back up in August when the semester started. 

After meeting up again, we hung out every day, and he kissed me during the first week of school. He met my friends, we went to football games together, went on more dates, he stayed over at my place sometimes, and we essentially acted like a couple. But we never made anything official, never talked about our relationship or what we ""were"".

Eventually, I knew I had to end whatever this was because this boy was giving me a headache as he put more distance between us by canceling plans and forgetting to text back. The weekend before, he had gone home to spend the day at Six Flags with his mom and brother. 

Before the school semester started, I had become suspicious of this girl he retweeted pictures of a few times. I kept tabs on her (I know, that isn't healthy, but this dude wasn't very forthcoming with information). It was apparent they had dated before. However, she had posted a picture of him and her at Six Flags together--while he and I were still ""dating."" So when I asked him about who his friends from back home were, and he never mentioned her, that's when I knew.

He promised we'd still be friends after the breakup, but as we lost touch once more, he began blocking me on social media. His accounts are all private, so I have no idea what's happening on his end. And then the girl posted a picture with them together in January, captioned, ""Six months with my best friend."" She tweets about him constantly, so it's obvious they're together and they have been for a while. Similarly, it's obvious he tried to hide her from me while we were dating and he is still trying to hide his relationship today.

Now, I don't know this girl personally, and she is still living in their hometown. But as one of the people involved, do I have an obligation to tell her about this since there is no way for her to find out about us unless she transferred to our school and our lives collided? Or would I be stepping out of line and should I mind my own business?

I consulted my friends and most of them say to just leave it, that she'll find out eventually, and it's not my place to say. But I can't shake the burden of knowing this and knowing she doesn't know he cheated on her with me.",21Jan2020,1

A year later I was in the same class as him and some how we managed to be friends now I was completely different to him I was on the better side of teachers but not a teachers pet. Me and Frank started spending more time together and near the end of the second term of school he admitted that he was gay ( not a problem with me ) he also said he had a crunch on me and asked me out I declined and that was that until the beginning of term three he kept on asking me out over and over which I always said no and in case you were wandering the only reason we where still friends after he asked me the first time was because he awkwardly asked if we would still be friends which I said yes. I should have stopped being friends with him when he started to stop me from hanging out with my other friends but me being nicer than I should kept being friends. This friendship got super unhealthy when he would ask me out I would say no and then he would say kinda crying why does it matter what’s under the pants which  after I got sick of him saying that I said if you don’t care what’s under the pants why are you not straight he would say I would if I found the right woman ( which he hasn’t tried because all he does is ask me out. I’m male btw) eventually he started threatening me by saying stuff like “I will hurt myself because you hate me and won’t go out with me”  again this is where I should have stopped being friends with him.  But one day he texted me a picture of a knife wound which I told my parents which told he’s mum he talked to him and got him to stop a few weeks later he thanked me for stoping himself from stabbing himself which I said no thanks needed he than asked me to not tell his parents when he says he want to kill himself stupid me not realising why  stupidly agreed. Later he asked me out which I said no than he said he was depressed all the time because he’s dad had beaten him I told him I feel sorry. The rest of the year whenever I spent time with my other friends he would say my name over and over and over until he got my attention or he would squeeze himself in between me and my friend I was talking to no matter where we were he also followed me everywhere and I mean every where I told him to stop which he would than say he needed to talk like it was urgent ( it was not he had nothing to say). Some how it got worse when I was talking to friends he would slowly creep in and say my name so many times until I responded and he would idk. Now Frank had my attention 80% of the time because he threatened to hurt himself if I didn’t he would say that we were a perfect match and ask me out over and over but one day it turns out that he is going to a different school next year I thought I would finally be without him but I was wrong it turns out he had all my social media’s and my phone number from the start of the year great I thought to myself now all he did was spam me all the time saying we are soul mates and should start to date I now feeling like I’m trapped had enough of him not letting me have other friends him threatening me by saying he would hurt himself I was so sick of him asking me out I decide to act like he didn’t exist. The year ended and he blow up my phone by text messages I caved in and I found out that no one has ever told him no that is why he fought all the time with he’s parents was because they said no to him building or buying a motorcycle. Today I had enough I sent him a text that took me two hours to wright I told him everything that I was sick of I made it super nice as well and do you want to know what happened he took it as “fuck you and fuck off” he sent that saying that that is what I told him. It turns out that he is hurting himself from his depression and that I’m the only person he needs right now to help him go through it I caved because I don’t want to feel responsible for someone’s death.

As I'm on the phone with 911, she gets back in her vehicle, throws some trash out and starts driving off.

My outgoing call says 2:21am to 911.
I wait. People are pulling to my side and asking what happened. Someone described the suspect to me and said they were at the gas station down the street causing a commotion.

I wait then call the assigned division at 2:59am.

Cops don't arrive until 3:25pm (based on my text timestamps with fiance). These cops tell me they didn't get a call and that people told them there was a wreck down the street. I give them whatever information I had.
Cops barely get information from me, arent physically writing a report rather he was scribbling in his notepad, and didnt ask me for a description of the suspect.

I finally get to go home: 3:55am.

The same cops call me an hour later saying they found an address associated with the tag but no one answered then he asked me for the victim's description.

Fast forward a week, my insurance cannot do anything else as they found the insurance for the victim was canceled March 2019. They obtain the police report which I've read and it has MINIMAL information.
I call the station, ask for the status, and they kept telling me the assigning offer is out on training or on vacay and that the on scene cops barely filled out the report.
I tell them about 1) the gas station cameras 2) the business building camera at the accident and 3) the hospital and their cameras she was headed to. The cop on the phone told me it would be too dark to see their face, that they would have to request it from corporates, that it's the holidays and they have over 70 hit and run cases and kept giving excuses.
Okay fine. I wait until after the holidays.

I go, in person, to the division office on Monday January 6th at 8am to talk to the assigning officer. He's away at training again. Was told he will leave a warrant letter at the associated address when he returns.  Attending cop gave me his ""personal"" number which I found out was just the station number.

It is January 20th and they're closed to the public for MLK.

I will call tomorrow morning for an update.

TLDR:
Got hit in a hit and run 2 months ago.
Cops take over an hour to come on scene.
Cops that did come weren't the ones called to scene.
Provided tag, car details, suspect details, and the fact that there is business cameras at the scene.
Also told them she was at the gas station down the street and was headed to the hospital.
Been given the run around and still no updates.

What else can I do?
How can I get them to work on my case or assign it to someone who isn't constantly out of office?

194,"My brother, Michael, has always been a difficult son to raise for my parents. He had very bad anger issues growing up which affected my family greatly. My parents ended up sending him to therapy, and he did get better, but he continues to have an extremely short temper. My father was in the military which caused him to have a very no-nonsense approach when he would deal with my brothers bad behavior, and my brother would always turn it around on my father, saying he was too hard on him and trying to play the victim even though every fight between my brother and dad was started by my brother. I was really young when he was at his worst behavior wise, and all the constant yelling and fighting really effected my sister and I. 

Anyways, after he graduated high school, he took some time off while working. He quit his job and went to college after this, but failed the first year. Now, he lives at home, doesn’t pay rent, doesn’t have a job, and has lived that way for a couple years. He never comes home, he’s always somewhere getting high with his friends, and only comes home to eat and sometimes sleep for a night or two. On top of that, he is a pathological liar. If he ever says he’s making any kind of effort, it’s a lie. He lies for fun and manipulates people for fun.

Anyways, my parents are getting really fed up with his lifestyle, and they have tried everything you can imagine to help. My dad offered multiple times to set him up with recruiters, they scheduled therapist appointments for him, drove him to get job applications, ect. Now, they are going to threaten to stop paying for his phone bill, and other things for him over time. While this is perfectly reasonable, my brother is a very unpredictable person. I don’t know what he is capable of. He has physically assaulted my sister and father multiple times before, he has called my mother names I would never say out loud, he’s threatened to kill my sister, he’s manipulated me my entire life. I’m deeply afraid that when my parents present the news that they are going to stop supporting him that way, he will lose his mind. 

I’m a senior in high school, my sister is away at college. I’m leaving town when I graduate, and I’m joining the Air Force next summer. My sister and I aren’t going to be able to stop whatever happens between them like we have before. (Ex. My sister once had to physically pull my brother away from my dad once.) I’m constantly going to worry about them if something doesn’t change now. Having to watch this unfold still while we are all basically adults is absolute misery. I pray to god he takes the opposite approach and finally finds a job to pay for school, and that is entirely possible. However, like I said, he’s very unpredictable and I’m very scared of what is going to happen between him and my parents and possibly myself.",21Jan2020,1

I feel so useless not being able to do anything and am pretty much letting myself be a punching bag, because I am getting a lot of “you don’t understand what I am going through” responses. It’s taking a huge toll on me feeling so useless when all I want is to make it all better. I have never lost someone close to me so he is not wrong, I don’t understand. He hasn’t been saying I love you back and has been distant which I don’t blame him for but it still hurts.

202,"So I was married to someone, we'll call him Rich, for a long time. After the marriage ended, very badly, we tried to stay friends and it worked for a long while. He started seeing a woman who was obsessed with him and more than a little manipulative and sort of stalking him. I started seeing someone who ended up hurting me pretty badly. This summer, after the dust cleared from both of those, Rich and I talked about getting back together. I said I wanted some time. I did want to be with him, but I didn't want to rush into it without knowing I was doing it for the right reasons. I was stressed out after my break up and honestly wanted to get laid without any kind of emotional hang-ups or being insulted in the middle of it like Rich did when we tried. The most important thing was, I wanted to explore a little bit before just running directly back to him, to make sure I wasn't  jumping back into things because I was lonely or horny or desperate. I thought he deserved that. I honestly considered him my soulmate and I wanted time to do things right. He asked me every few days if I was ready to start seeing him again. After the break up, I honestly just needed a little breathing room to collect my thoughts and getting peppered with ""are you ready now"" every other day didn't help me do that. After a while, he started suggesting that we should get married. Were it six months later and we were seeing each other again and things were going well, then great, yes, I would have done that, but at the time, what I needed was a little breathing room and time to clear my head out.  
So I started dating casually. I didn't go into things with any expectations, just getting out of the house a little, having some fun, hopefully having sex. I started talking to someone romantically that I had known for a few years, we'll call him Joe, a few months ago. He stayed for the weekend at one point and we had sex and that's when everything fell apart. When he left, Rich called up his stalker, because he was lonely and hurt that I slept with someone else. He came to my house and screamed at me, called me a whore and kept saying that he and I would never be together again romantically. He said that about three or four times in the following weeks and also said that we weren't even friends anymore a few times. Since then, things have been tense. He spends all his time texting or hanging out with this same obsessive woman, who I and most of his friends feel may be manipulating him away from the rest of us. I told him a few times that it felt like he replaced me with her because I hurt him, since he ran off to her almost immediately. He claims he hasn't and just wanted a friend. He mostly just gets angry with me because of it and starts fights with me or leaves. Since then, Rich and I have been fighting a lot. I keep trying to talk to him about things in an attempt to fix things, and he gets angry at me and snaps at me, but then blames me for being the hostile one and leaves or shuts down the conversation. We were barely around each other over the holidays, due to the fighting. I just wanted to try and fix things, but the pattern was always the same. I said something he didn't like, even if I was trying to be calm, he would get upset and blame me for being the hostile one and leave, usually insulting me in the process, like an angry teenager who didn't get his way. I even offered to stop seeing Joe in order to fix things with Rich, and Rich threw it in my face like I was an idiot for even suggesting it. He claimed he didn't want to date anyone anymore, especially not someone he couldn't communicate with. He insults both of us a lot. I know it comes from a place of pain, but it's still hard to be yelled at and insulted and treated like this for so long when all I want to do is to make it up to him and work things out. I would do anything to be able to do that.

Rich kept telling me that we weren't ever getting back together, so I kept seeing Joe. He's a nice person and I care about him and I was honestly really lonely, too. Neither Rich nor I have much family or other friends, besides each other. So with him being so caustic to me all the time, it was nice having someone else to talk to. Rich made a big deal about me sleeping with someone, saying that if I wanted to be with him, I wouldn't be with someone else. I understand why he says that and for the most part, he's right, but I was trying to be clear with my intentions at the beginning.  And he says that he won't even consider us getting back together until I stop seeing Joe. But I really don't have anyone else to talk to right now. I've been dealing with a lot of severe depression and anxiety at the moment, some of which has been brought on by Rich's hostility and gaslighting behavior, and I need someone to talk to because my mind is going in some dark places lately...Joe is that person, because Rich is usually angry with me and I have no one else. I've been feeling pretty isolated and not doing very well lately and I need a friend...just anyone....just as an emotional lifeline. Rich has his ex and I have a few online acquaintances and that's it. No one I can really rely on for emotional support outside of Joe. I keep trying to explain that to Rich, as to why we're still seeing each other, and I guess I haven't been doing a great job with that because he never seems to care. He usually just counters by telling me how hurt he is by everything and reiterating that if I really wanted Rich, I wouldn't be with anyone else. 

Rich claims that he'll never be able to forgive me for sleeping with someone else, but the end of our relationship was a year of him being on medication that made him act like a different person. I was scared of him. He was physically abusive sometimes. I know it wasn't him, it was the medication and I forgave him for all that. But I was with someone, when we weren't together and he claims he can't forgive me for it or get past it. He always said there would never be anything that I would ever do that he wouldn't forgive me for, or that would make him stop loving me, but apparently this was it. He makes me feel like I'm a terrible person who did a terrible thing that was so awful and personally attacking to Rich, that he shouldn't have to work on forgiving me for it.  It feels like he was hurt and jealous and is using those feelings to try and hurt me in return in the same way like an angry, petulant child, even if he doesn't realize it consciously. It's like there's no getting through to him and all my trying just irritates him.

I am still in love with him and still hold out hope of spending my life with him, but things are a mess right now. I would settle for figuring out how to get my friend back at the very least. I know that most people's advice will be to give it time and normally that is the best thing (and a few of you probably think I'm the devil...and I accept that, because I could've handled things better), but I feel like he's slipping away and soon he'll be living with this woman and then that's it. He claims they aren't dating, they're just friends, but it still feels like he replaced me with her after almost a decade and a half and everything that we've weathered just suddenly, because I hurt him. It'll take time and I know that most of this was apparently my fault, even though I had no idea that it would turn into this huge, gaping wound, but I'd still like to try and make things better for us if I can. I feel like a bad person for causing all of this, and I want so bad to make things better and fix this huge rift between us if there is any possible way to do it. I just need my friend back and if anybody has any ideas of how to start a dialogue, I'd appreciate it.  And also, thanks for reading all this. I know it was a lot.",21Jan2020,1
204,"For the past 6 years of my life, I've had terrible porn and masturbation addiction. It is so bad that I've normalized myself to some very absurd kinks, very quickly. I can never tell if I'm genuinely attracted to them or I just see it as porn I haven't seen. Regardless, the biggest problem is this.

My addiction is so bad, that it persisted throughout almost every relationship I've had, often leading to bad consequences. I've done a great job of keep my private online prescence seperate from my normal life, but it gets out of hand. I've roleplayed, sent nudes, catfished, chatted with complete and total strangers, and once, even almost physically cheated on my girlfriend by leading another girl on with lewd texts. I probably ruined that girls entire self esteem just because I got horny at a church party, and now I can't ever see her without her bringing it up and beggining me.

I have an email account, actually, TWO email accounts (one I locked myself out of and the other I recently created after failing to abstain) filling to the brim with porn emails, USBs, and I still have to sift through thousands of photos in my Google Photos account after I noticed it saves photos after you delete them. 

My mother is the only soul who knows the very tip of the iceberg of this double life I lead. I can't even *** for my own girlfriend due to my addiction or tell her I love her without feeling like a monster. I got a therapist to talk this through, but can't even do that after being to utterly embarrased to admit this to someone face to face.

My girlfriend is suicidal, and me being in her life and caring for her has clearly helped her alot. I love her, and if I knew she wasn't so dependent on me I would leave her just so I would never have to be guilty about the truth, and burdening her with this sex addicted maniac I've become.

I've done about everything I can trying to quit this addiction myself. But I live with my  parents, don't drive, and have all the privacy and free time in the world. I don't know what the hell to do or stop this double life without crashing my whole world in the process and being responsible for the death of everything I've worked for.",21Jan2020,1
205,"I went through two telephone interviews and a 4-hour panel interview (one interviewer privately at a time, though), and I know there is one other candidate who will be interviewing Wednesday. 

My recruiter told me that I “vibed hardcore” with one of the interviewers, and the hiring manager was very impressed with me verbally, though has not commented after my third interview (the second that I held with her at this point)

Today he called me to say the hiring manager will have interview feedback by EOD tomorrow. 

In my mind, there’s no use in giving *interview* feedback if I’m to be selected, HOWEVER she hasn’t even finished interviewing all her candidates... I don’t know what to think.

207,"I'm 28 and currently I'm at a situation where I have to choose what path I should take with my life or at least that's the way I see it. Let me try to explain:

I have the opportunity to emigrate to the U.S (my dad is a U.S citizen, he'd submit a petition) the process apparently could take anywhere between 2-10 years,  my dad has asked me if I want him to submit the petition since that implies legal costs, etc. The huge dilemma I have is that currently I have a girlfriend (we've been dating for 4 years now) to go with possibility to (one day) emigrate would imply for us to keep our relationship the way it is right now (she's very strict in the sense that we won't live together unless we marry) I wouldn't be able to marry because of that would conflict with my dad's petition. Currently because of work/study schedules we only get to see each other once a week, maybe twice or more on holidays.

From another point of view i know that I/we might be able to have a better life in the U.S (we live in a '3rd world country' that might have been obvious but i thought I'd disclose it) better quality of life for us and who knows maybe our kids later on in life, less danger/violence, etc. However it'd probably take years (not sure how long, probably around 5-6) for me to be able submit a petition for her to join me once I'd settled + all the legal stuff that we'd have to comply with in order to do so, this would mean having a long distance relationship with maybe being able to see each other once a year (she has a visa) when she gets vacations from her job and had saved enough money to travel.

I also cannot stop thinking that I won't be able to make ""my own life"" if I choose to take the possibility to emigrate since like I mentioned I'm already 28 and who knows how old I'll be by the time the petition is accepted (if it ever is) and in the meantime I'll always be ""waiting"" for it and like I mentioned above not being able to compromise much with my relationship as well as the fact that once I settle in the U.S I'd have to sort of ""reset"" my life as in look for another first job, get experience, get my own place and while all of that takes place most likely I'd be living with my dad which is not something I look forward to.

Typing all this it may seem like staying might be the better choice for me since I expose a lot of insecurity on the possibility of leaving but I'm still not able to make up my mind, I feel like I might be losing ""my opportunity"" for a better future and in the best of cases a better life for my gf and what could be our family one day. I'd appreciate your advice on what objectively would be the best choice, I know in the end the decision is mine but you may be able to see something I cannot.

208,"I know it sounds weird, but let me explain. Ever since I was around 13, I had these feeling of needing to be someone’s slave or servant. Now, after 3 years, it’s stronger then ever. I feel like I was born to serve someone. I feel like the meaning of my life is to be someone’s slave or servant. If I don’t serve someone in a while, I lose all my focus and end up breathing really heavy and my eye twitches. I go crazy until I serve someone. It’s not even in a sexual type of way. I don’t get turned on by it, I just feel like it’s my job to serve people. It’s why I was born and if I don’t fulfill that, I start going crazy. And the worst part about it, I have a really hard time finding people I can serve in a non sexual way so I end up going insane a lot. Is this normal? Is it a mental problem? Why am I like this?

209,"Hello. I’ve always had body image issues and have always hated things such as my stomach and thighs and butt and chest. When I was younger (I am 18 now) I was somewhat content with this because I believed I had a decent face and I figured I could always work out to change my body if I felt determined enough to do so. 
Something has changed in the past year or so. I began to hate my face too. Now I have become unmotivated to work out for a better body because no matter how hard I try, I am still going to be ugly because of my face. I feel crappy for even posting this because I know there are so many things I am blessed with, appearance is just not one of them. But it’s gotten to the point where I cry at the sight of myself when the front facing camera pops up. I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year now and he always tells me how beautiful I am and treats me so kindly, but I’ve started feeling bad for him because he could do so much better. I feel too ashamed to post photos of myself anywhere. 
     I have friends who wear makeup every day and they are all beautiful, I am wondering if I wore makeup daily and learned how to do it well maybe I would be slightly more attractive. My fear is that this would make me even more insecure and unable to step outside without makeup on. 
    I know that I sound insanely insecure and annoying, I know that I am. I am just wondering if there is any way I can learn to accept that I’m ugly and feel content with it. 
    I know I cannot change this about myself but I would just like to feel okay with it and not have it on my mind so much.

211,"I 'fell in love' with a coworker one day a couple months ago and I haven't been the same since.

At first I was very content being coworkers -- but then we started flirting, then our conversations became more personal, then one day it just happened. I looked at her and it was like seeing all the colors and realizing my favorite one right in front of me and I was just like: ""fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck""

Of course she isn't into me -- which she has mentioned to me before -- but that isn't the whole problem. Besides the fact that she isn't into dating in general, we aren't exactly anything more than good co-workers. I don't really believe I'm 'in love', as much as I've found someone that *I want to be in love with*. Fact of the matter is though we really don't know each other well enough and it's very possible that we aren't compatible.

And that's kind of the heart of the problem; I want to become closer with this person to explore this connection, but I just can't. Sometimes we'll be joking around having lots of fun, and other times it's like I can't bare the sound of her laugh or her smile because it somehow hurts. Some days she acts like she doesn't want to see me, and I think it's my fault because I must look mean when I'm not being friendly, or maybe because she doesn't want to give me the wrong impression, I dunno. 

Sometimes just being around her hurts, other times I wish she was around more. I'm not sure if it means anything to her or if the situations were similar, but some of the conversations we've had were not conversations I would have with just anyone. She seems to care enough to ask and say things that not even my best friends would ask or say, and I want to reciprocate.

The most frustrating part is I haven't been able to tell her how I feel. She told me she wasn't into me very casually, and not as a response to any of my confrontation, so I don't really know where to put all my feelings or how to cope with them.

I'm afraid revealing these feelings would not be a great idea, but I don't want to lose my chances of befriending someone like this *because* of my stupid emotions. Maybe she just wants to remain close coworkers-- it's not like she's gone out of her way or made any attempts to really connect outside of work. It doesn't help that nothing about this experience has been typical, and I feel like we are both full of obscure problems.

What should I do?",21Jan2020,1
212,"So, I'll keep this short because I could literally go on for hours over this. Lived with her for 3 years. For 2 years, I would say Hi, or good morning whenever I saw her for the first time. Same to her boyfriend. I tried starting convos once in a while, like asking her if she had any cool plans for the weekend, or if she's going to certain events in the city.

Well after I while I realized we only ever talk if I say something first. She won't even tell me when she's having 6+ people over after I have asked her nicely many times the next day, to just give me a heads up if there are people over that night as it's just common courtesy. She'll do it once or twice, then go back to not telling me.

So starting about 3 months ago. I sent her a slightly ruder text, but left it open for her to tell me how she feels. I said ""If you guys don't want to talk at all that's fine, but there's no reason you can't give me a heads up when you're gonna be loud super late. Pretty fucking sick of being kept awake. If that's your way of saying you want me out then fine, because right now it sure doesn't feel very welcoming"" She didn't respond to me saying if they don't want to talk at all, and didn't tell me if they want me out or not. She basically said ""sorry we didn't realize we were that loud, we'll go in the basement next time"" Which ya, obviously she has not used the basement the next 5 or 6 times she's had a party till 3am on a weekday.

Since then I basically stopped talking to her. We went a WHOLE MONTH being in the same house, seeing each other every day, and not saying a word when in the same room for minutes. In the 3 years I've been here I can count on one hand how many times she's greeted me first. She doesn't even tell her friends that she has a roommate, so many times I've come downstairs and startled people she had over because they didn't even know about me.

Last Thursday I sat in the kitchen and had breakfast, she came in and started packing lunch for school. She wasn't in zombie mode, she was awake for a while before that and she was moving fast paced as she always does. Again, didn't say good morning because I didn't say it first. So after she left I texted her a snarky ""Good morning to you too, Amy"" And she responds with ""huh?"" Note that I don't want to be snarky, I've been super passive until the last 3 months now when I realized she's in her own little world.

She'll also only text me the odd time she has something to tell me. And it's usually when she forgot her keys, or she thinks she left the fridge open or something else that requires me to help her.

When I first moved in, she had said how I'm free to join them watching hockey games or whatever if I want. I passed on the idea at first because I am fairly anti social and didn't want to be a bother. Did I miss my chance to be ""friends""? Or is she just self centered in general. I would still like to be friends, and at the minimum be able to have small 2 minute convos when in the same room.

TLDR: So my question is, what should I do? Do I outright tell my roomy it's rude to never say hi first? Or that I feel she hates me in general because she never talks to me? How do I word it? I shouldn't have to tell her to say hi to me, because then it's gonna feel forced and that's just as bad as ignoring me. Or do I continue to get meaner/more abrasive until she asks me what my problem is? I'd rather not be rude but the nice way doesn't seem to stick with her.

BTW I type this now because again, she has a bunch of people over on a weekday and can't be bothered to tell me.",21Jan2020,1

About 4-5 years ago, my friend's father died. (Long story short, their mom and dad's marriage didn't work out, separated). The father had a dog, and 11 years old at the time. Cutest little thing, tons of energy, clingy as hell.

Once the father passed, the dog was placed into my friends mother's care, who they currently live with. The dog is blind, deaf, has dementia, cannot smell, and has been this way for the last about 4 years (all came on suddenly after the father's passing). The mother has made multiple appointments with the veterinarian to put the dog down as he is in a visible state of suffering, but she has cancelled then all last minute claiming that it is inhumane to put the dog down, and goes ""against God's will"". Both my friend and his sister have both pleaded time and time again with the mother to put the dog down both for his sake, as well as their health as the dog is incontinent.

What could be done in this scenario for my friends? The poor dog limps around all day wimpering, pacing in circles, and has no sense of where he is or what is going on, and the mother refuses to let the dog go peacefully with the vet. I feel not only terrible for them, but for the dog as well.",21Jan2020,1

I know where I’m at but I daydream as if I’m somewhere else and just talk for hours sometimes. Life is just extremely hard for me and I’ve gone through years of torture and it still effects me and still sometimes happens.

Long story short i asked her out, she said she jusy wanted to stay friends it sucked put we are still close.
Well just recently she had opened up to me about her liking me. Pretty simialr to my last post, but she still is giving me mixed feelings and signals.
The day she told me she liked me we held each other, talked for hours, held hands, all of that. And i tried to see if the same thing would occur the following day. It didn't she was kinda closed off. She was still talking to me and everything looked fine i just didn't know what to do.
Now im kinda where i was at the beginning.
Should I ask her out?
The only difference is: I know she likes me back.
I dont want to mess up this relationship but i REALLY want to be something more.

They paid for everything and provided me transportation there: it's like a 20mins drive. They picked me up on the way there as it was easier. It was really nice and they were all so great and lovely. I got the cheapest entree there which was $27 dollar so I'm guessing the total is around $30.

I'm planning to write them a letter to thanks them for such a wonderful meal.

Advice Need: I was wondering if I should put cash in the envelope as I way to pay them back. If not then what should I do? Is it considered rule? My girlfriend said not to worry about the money but a letter sounds nice. Also what should I write in the letter?

She do things like cut off a conversation she isn't even a part of and say thing like just drop it even when it is something that is important that we are on the same page or she will treat me like a child having a tantrum.

238,"My first relationship I had the guy cheat on me with several of my closet friends. 

That was years ago and I'm with an amazing guy. We've been together over a year and things are great except one small thing; me being jealous whenever he's around a few women. Most of the women are people I've known for years and have been nothing but nice and trustworthy. I don't ever think that my boyfriend will cheat on me, I just always feel uncomfortable. He has no history of ever being unfaithful, I was friends with him for several years prior to us dating and knew him when he had a couple past relationships where he was never unfaithful. 

I don't know if it's just a irrational fear because of my past or me just being insecure. Either way I get super anxious when a few girls approach him or hug him. 

One of these girls though I've seen her touch his shoulders a few times, wear revealing clothing when planned to hang somewhere when he was there and just talking in a cutesy voice she doesn't use when talking to others. He says he's known her for years and she's said she likes another guy. But when we're on dates and she bumps into us (small town) she is trying to get close to him and just overall acting like how I've acted when intested in a guy. I get upset and it makes me feel down the rest of the day. My boyfriend doesn't see it that way and just laughs it off as me being jealous but reassuring me that she'd never make any moves on him when I've mentioned it before. Also everytime I've tried talking to her she ignores me and acts as if I'm not there and she just keeps trying to talk to my boyfriend. Today we were in a large open space just the two of us with no way of anyone bumping into each other and she walked over and bumped into him on purpose, laughed and started talking to him. It made me really uncomfortable and I haven't said much to my boyfriend because I don't want to come off across as jealous or controlling. 

I trust my boyfriend and he really treats me so well but I just feel so guilty about being jealous when a few others but mainly one girl is around. Am I just jealous or should I actually be uncomfortable when she's around him? If so, how should I go about this?",21Jan2020,1

243,"Don't know what subreddit to post this in but here it goes. 

The other day I (23M) asked my single friend (47M) if my girlfriend and I could crash at his place for the night. Yes I know there's a large age gap but we've been good friends for a long time and he practically raised me growing up. Anyways, he said there was no problem with us spending the night and that we could take the guest room. I'd also like to preface this story with the fact that while I've slept over at his house many times before, this was the first time a girl was with me. 

Well the night that we arrive, all is swell. We're hanging out, catching up, and sharing stories. When it's time for bed we go our separate ways. My girlfriend and I decide to stay up a little later watching TV in the guest room; she and I get a little handsy and eventually, one things leads to another and we proceed to do it. Halfway through sex its getting really hot and heavy so I take the condom off and toss it on the ground (don't worry shes on birth control, we just typically like being extra safe). After it was over and I helped my lady clean up and I went to bed forgetting that I had thrown a condom on the floor.

The next morning we packed up, washed our sheets and towels, had breakfast, and went on our way. I was feeling completely at peace until I receive a text from my friend that basically read ""you must have not appreciated my generosity or else you wouldn't have thrown and left a used condom on the floor. You're fucking ridiculous.""

I immediately read this and went into shock. I felt like shit and didn't know what to say or do. I eventually replied and said ""I cannot write in words how sorry I am and how bad I feel. This is beyond disrespectful and ungrateful. I do want to make this right but I understand if you want nothing to do with me. I am sorry NAME OF FRIEND.""

I feel like I really fucked up and it's probably because I really did fuck up. I don't know what to do or say but all I can think about is what a shitty, unappreciative person I am. I don't know if I should write my thoughts on a card and apologize. I've also thought about returning the money I received from my friend after I recently graduated. I feel like I don't deserve it but I also don't want him to look at it as me buying back our friendship.

Any advice on what I should do? Anything amount of guidance is appreciated.

A few months after my father had passed she noticed I was down and decided to purchase me a gift. She used a credit card to do so. A couple of weeks later the gift arrives and I say thank you, but this is not necessary. She insists. 

A few weeks later I ask if I can use her credit card. The same one she used to buy my gift. She agrees if I promise to clear whatever I use. A few weeks pass and things are fine. 

My grief hits an all time low and I decide to take some time away from my relationships to heal. We stop speaking for some time. I receive a call from her saying  she's extremely upset and disappointed that I did not inform her about something she found out about me. 

I said I decided not to share that with her as it was nobody's business. She felt betrayed, and demanded I pay off the entire sum of the credit card. Both the item I purchased and her gift. 

The new year arrives. (2019) and I contact her around February time to make a lumpsum payment to 90% of what I purchased. She refused to respond, cooperate and even accept payment. She ignores messages, blocks me occasionally. Every time I tried during the months of February and August it was met with cold silence. 

When I did finally get in touch I  asked her to ensure to me in someway that the money would be use toward the debt. A receipt or guarantee. She refused to which put futher delays. This delay turned into weeks, and months which resulted in her defaulting on the card. 

She is now demanding that I pay off the entire credit card which is comprised of my gift, the product I purchased and late fee charges. She categorically denies that she purchased a gift for me, refused to acknowledge that she has a level of responsibility and is pinning the entire debt on me.

251,"Im not sure where to post this, I tried posting this in r/college but it kept getting removed, so :/

21F here. Im going to be finishing my junior year this semester and I’m thinking about dropping out. Even though it’s my junior year, I will still have 2 years left since I switched majors. I’m feeling like I really messed up and possibly made the dumbest decision of my life here. Last spring I was a nursing major, and had to take an art class to finish up my gen eds. I hadn’t done anything artistic in a long time and fell in love with it again while I was in the class. The teacher really hyped my work up and made me feel important and even asked me if I’d thought about switching to become an art major. At this point in time, I was depressed and just generally unhappy with my nursing degree, and I feel like I was just looking for a way out. I ended up getting accepted into nursing school, only to decline the offer and switch to a Fine Arts major. This past fall was my first year as an art major, and now I’m wondering if it’s even for me. To even do something with your art degree, you have to network and meet tons of people and that’s something that I’m terrible at. On top of that, I’ve been unable to get an art internship anywhere so far, so my resume is empty. I feel like I would’ve been better off as a nursing major, since that would’ve guaranteed me a job. 

The thing is, I’m already over $20K in debt just from these three years. I have 2 years and a semester left as an art major and I’m wondering if its even worth it to finish up my bachelors at this point. My parents keep telling me to finish it and that just having the bachelors will help me get jobs, but I just don’t know if I have it in me. If I quit now I would be a little over 20K in debt, if I finished my bachelors I would be around $35K in debt. I would switch majors again but I don’t even know what I want to do. If I were to do nursing again I would have to apply in the fall and wait till next fall to begin, so another year. If I were to drop out, I have absolutely no plan. I wouldn’t know what to do then either besides start working at any place that’ll hire me. 

Any advice here? I’m really struggling",21Jan2020,1

254,"As the title says, there's no abuse between my parents, but he did something really bad that's put my mom in this anxious funk. 

To shed some light on my living situation, I'm going to a community college not far from my house, where I live with my parents. I'm 19. They have their ups and downs like any normal married couple, but something really wrong happened a few nights ago.

My grandpa, my dad's dad, died last year. Ever since then, my dad has been more volatile and unpredictable. He could be the nicest person to be around, then suddenly snap and be very rude and hostile. Just recently, they were at dinner, having a nice time, when he suddenly went into this anger mode. He dismissed everything my mom said, demanded they immediately go home, then proceeded to gun the engine to go get gas. He swerve when he drove, didn't use signals, and basically acted like he was on crack. Needless to say, this absolutely terrified my mom, for very deep reasons. 

My mom's dad and her friend both died in car accidents, and she herself was in a very traumatic car accident where she needed physical therapy to recover from for 4 years when I was in middle school. This accident was also very close to when her mom died. This outburst of his, putting them in danger, triggered all of this trauma, and has made her very anxious around my dad. From what she described, apparently at the gas station he was stomping his food in anger and yelling at her in the car. I'm surprised no one called the cops. Anyways, if I did that to my girlfriend, we'd have broken up immediately, which is what I told my mom... she told me if someone did that in her 20's while she was dating, she would have never saw them again.

257,"Even now, I'm struggling to find the right words to say. Early on in high school, I suddenly stopped caring about trying to do well and became way more critical of my work and was afraid of writing anything. Any intelligent discussion that popped up in class seemed to head in one ear and out the other. I ended up with an average mark out of school. I finished a university course for music (which is what I like to do) and even then I felt as if I just scraped by. Over these last few days, I haven't stopped thinking about how stupid I feel compared to many of my peers. Every one of them can write, create, debate politics, discuss history or whatever and contribute to discussions intelligently and with total ease but I constantly don't know what to say and it seems as if I have to really try hard to do these things. It's making me upset as whenever I ask for help, everyone says ""What do you mean? You're intelligent"" or ""you don't need help with that"" or ""it's nothing special."" My vocabulary feels stale and I don't REALLY know anything that well (apart from music, I guess).

It started when I was around 20, and now I'm super gray on the sides and temples.  
Obviously people notice that and make remarks, which make me want to die.

I literally think about it all the time, all day long. It started when I was around 27.

I'm so ashamed of it that I'm losing my mind. When I talk to people, I feel like all they're thinking about is how gray I am (obviously in reality no one cares) and all they're looking at is my hair.  
A couple years ago, I started using the dye that covers the gray partly, but it makes it even worse because now I have to 'monitor' the level of my gray all the time and worry about it even more.  
Moreover, this dye is probably very harmful (chemicals) and I have to stop using it at some point anyway.

It makes me want to meet people less, and especially avoid people who I haven't seen in a while (since they will notice the difference).  


I don't know what exactly that is: the fear of aging? The fear of being unpopular with women (I'm single)? Something else? I'm a perfectionist by nature and like to be in control, so I'm freaking out that there's something that I hate and yet have no control over.  


It's worth mentioning that I'm normally a very sociable, easy-going, self-confident person, it's just this part that makes me want to hide from the whole world.

Objectively speaking, I have nothing that should be making me shy. I'm more successful than basically all my peers (I run a business that employs dozens of people), I travel a lot and I basically have the life that most people dream about (yet I'm 100% self-made). But, as silly as it sounds, going gray makes me an unhappy person.

263,"I live in NJ, and rent the bottom floor of a two family home with my partner. I have a lease, and my landlord allows us to rent out our spare bedroom.

We've had great roommates, but will eventually want the spare room to expand our family--in a year or two. In the past, my gf and I have had verbal agreements with past tenants, and zero issues occurred. We've yet to rent our room after our previous roommate moved away, and are reluctant to do so because of our desire to have a family.

If the room were needed, I would provide notice and a full security deposit refund (if one is provided).

I would not want to impact my landlord in any way, and would want to be fair to any roommate that moves in. What concerns me is, ending up with a roommate that simply refuses to leave.

I have tried multiple times to go to the gym to work out but it just doesn’t work for me. I get bored (despite music/podcasts etc.) and I feel anxious around others, like they’re judging how sweaty I look or my lack of knowledge on what the hell I’m doing. I know this is stupid and that everyone is usually in their own zone but in my experience I do sometimes get men approaching/watching and anxiety doesn’t help.  I’m also a student and don’t have a lot of spare money to pay for a gym membership I probably won’t be using, I just feel guilty for wasting money. 

I’m by no means overweight, I’m around 5”1 and a normal weight for my height. I just want to be a bit leaner as I do have some chub (normal I know) but I mainly want to improve my overall health, physically and mentally. 

I’ve tried some at home exercises and watched some YouTube videos but I find I really lack the motivation to keep going in one session or to keep up with a new routine throughout the week. I know it takes a lot of hours to create a new routine I just really lack the will power. I don’t want to push myself into some super hard workouts because I know I’ll feel overwhelmed and give up. 

Any advice on how to kick my ass into gear and stay motivated would be appreciated and any beginner routines that people use/know of I would love to hear about and try.

We had one long pause in our relationship because he and long time girl friend that I had been engaged to were about to get together and I put a stop to it..  We finally got back together without that incident ever being mentioned/.   He has called me to take him back to the country twice when he left his car in   town  to be worked on.  We talk almost everyday, that is  up until  three days ago.  I was talking to him about normal stuff when one of the phones cut off.  I tried to call him back , the line was busy.  So, I said,  that I  will wait a few minutes    and try back.  Well,  someone else called me in the mean time , then I had to run to an appointment and thought I would call him back later that afternoon.  I did attempt to call several times and there was no answer or the line was busy.  Now , he won't answer his phone when I call.  I have left a message several times for him to call me back , but he has not.

What bothers me the most is he has a wonderful daughter that I have great respect for and she knows me personally.  I don't want her to think bad of me,.  I have no idea why he decided to cut of communication with me  just out of the blue.  I need to add , that he and I are very old, both live alone and he is in horribly bad health and don't believe he will be here much longer.  I've tried to check on him and tried to raise his spirits as I'm in much better health than he.   

What should I do to insure his daughter doesn't lose respect for me in this ordeal.  As I said, I have  no idea why he chose to give up on our life long friendship right here at the end of our lives...

268,"So a little bit of background on me and the situation. I am in my early 20s and female. I’ve been in a healthy relationship with my boyfriend for three years and have no intention of ever breaking up. 
About a year ago I met a guy at school (he’s a year older)  and we connected, became good friends and built a good platonic relationship. I have to admit there were times in the past he was flirtatious towards me knowing well I have a boyfriend but I thought of it as harmless. We’ve gone out just me and him several times and it’s been fun and honestly pretty normal. 
Recently he got into a relationship with a girl a few years younger than him and that’s all he’s been able to talk about and honestly I’m really happy for him because he seems happy. 
However there a few things that are throwing me off and I don’t seem to understand. 
Firstly, he asks me to hang out with him and his male friend group. I’m not comfortable with this as I don’t really like hanging out with a bunch of guys I have nothing in common with and it’s quite apparent, so I’m not too sure why he keeps insisting we all go out together? Why not invite his girlfriend to hang out with them? Wouldn’t that make more sense? He’s asked me to go out with him and I’ve agreed thinking it would be just me and him and when I get there to our meeting place he suddenly lets me know he’s invited his friends. Totally threw me off guard. 
Second, he wants me to meet his girlfriend, again, I don’t really see a reason in meeting her? It would be kind of awkward and unnecessary. Me+him+ his gf? 
And lastly he sometimes makes odd sexual comments towards me and plays it as nonchalant. I ignore the comments and pretend I didn’t hear them. 
Whats going on?! I really don’t understand this behaviour or what the intentions are ?

269,"
My neighbors young  (18) daughter is the perpetrator of domestic violence against her girlfriend (16) I know this because we live in a cramped apartment building where we share a thin wall and I have also witnessed it. The fighting is very loud, happens almost every day, and has woken me up in the middle of the night on several occasions. Fighting also occurs between mother and daughter (although I’m not sure it’s physical) I’ve reported this issue to building management before and have called the police more than once out of safety concerns for both partners. Last night mother and daughter were fighting so loud that it woke me up from a deep sleep. I tried to speak to the mother about it today but she became extremely defensive and hostile, saying I should go report it to mgmt if I wanted to. 
Here’s the issue- I want to report it tomorrow when building managers return from the holiday, but I know they will know it was me who reported them since I had that conversation with the mother. Because of the daughters clear anger issues and tendency towards violence, I fear for my own safety. I know when the building manager speaks to mother and daughter she will not reveal it was me who complained, but they will figure it out. I fear retaliation from them especially if they end up getting kicked out of the building. (I don’t want them to get kicked out. I just want the screaming and smashing things at all hours to end) Each time it happens I am sent into a panic because of things that have happened in my own life, it is very disturbing. I don’t trust building mgmt to keep me safe because they don’t seem to care much about their tenants and only work business hours M-F. 

Has anyone ever dealt with a similar situation? Anyone an expert in DV or mediation? I’m at a loss. Thanks in advance for any help.",21Jan2020,1

273,"Last year I started going to therapy. I was 14 at the time and it was good at first. But then it started to get overwhelming when appointment time came and I dreaded it so, eventually I stopped going. I don’t know if it was me or the therapist. She was nice, and I could talk to her somewhat easily, but sometimes she would say off putting things. Sometimes when I would talk about my feelings, she’d find something to cushion them and make them seem like they weren’t as bad as I think. She really could’ve just been doing it to potentially provide relief and comfort for me but I really wasn’t feeling it and instead ended up feeling invalidated in the end. Of course, maybe my emotions aren’t as bad as I think and I’m just all in my head but that’s the problem,,, I overthink everything said to me by anybody. It’s like I would tell myself, “Okay, maybe this time will be better than the last. Just try it again”. Sometimes it would work and the session would be fine, but others I felt like she didn’t care and wasn’t fully there.

It’s probably just an issue with the therapist but I don’t want to stop going to her because of all of the groundwork we’ve laid as well as the fact she said I could go to her regardless of any money/insurance issues. 

This post might not make sense but tl;dr: I stopped going to therapy because it was overwhelming and I felt worse and somewhat invalidated after each session. This might have just been a me-problem but I can’t tell. Should I give it another shot?",21Jan2020,1

I used to pay the bills with roommates, but the house is in his name and he put a stop to that. The deal was, he was going to pay my bills if I didn't have roommates. 

The good news is the house recently got transferred to the family trust and cannot be taken away. My mom would have to agree to it and she would never allow it.

Anyway, I don’t expect anyone to respond and consequently, understand this post might get buried. I guess I’ll just give a bit of background so that way people can understand the circumstance. I go to an academically tough school and because of it, not many of kids are focused on relationships; the people that do have relationships typically don’t last long due to the stress and work we have. The girl that I like is the the sweetest, smartest, cutest, and most responsible person I’ve ever meet. Ever since the beginning of high school she’s been the top of her class and the moment I first saw her I felt warm and fussy inside. At first I couldn’t even talk to her because of how nervous I got, but by the end of freshman year,  she noticed my existence. and we became friends. Then, sophomore year roles around and we start talking more.. I could honestly see a future with her, but I heard that she was top of her class so I decided she didn’t needed any distractions so I would purposely make our conversations as bland as possible in hopes she would focus on herself rather than me. After many moths of that, we met up again because of a debate program and it was so amazing hearing her speak; the way she spoke and how she captivated everyone made me stop caring about the bland conversation thing and decided to get to know her better. Anyway, during the 1st half of junior year my mom and I got into a bad car crash and honestly thought welp this is how I die, but who was there? You guessed it—she was. She saved both my mom and my life and keep my mind working when I would space out. Oh I’m probably going off topic by describing these things and not the situation.  Anyway, I guess the one of the smaller issues is that her family speaks an entirely different language than I do and anytime I try and talking with her mom or any of her relatives when they visit the school, it just turns into me turning red and spewing out incoherent syllables then finally me just excusing myself and walking (that’s something i can fix in time). However the thing that crushes me is that I might not see her again after senior year. You see, she plans on studying at Harvard to become something way beyond my way of thinking. So I’m probably never going to see her again. I don’t want to hold her back or see her hurting in anyway, I just want her to be happy. So Reddit, I guess what I’m trying to say is it better for me to ask her out which would definitely end up be me holding her back or watch her be successful and happy beyond her wildest dreams; better yet, is there something I’m not seeing here.

I made sure to be extra careful, check the condoms regularly to see if they were good, put it on the right way, etc.. only question I have is, Should I be worried if I touched a condom with my hand during sex??

I mean I took off the condoms and then put new ones on and I had to touch my penis a couple times to get them off. I didn’t ejaculate until we were done having sex, but there may have been pre-cum...

293,"So my girlfriend has been ""unofficially"" living with me for about a year. I have a roommate that has an old pit bull. My girlfriend is driven to tears by the pit bull's seemingly constant licking (she has a skin condition) and by my roommate's habitual mouth noises of which I don't really notice. All the sounds of each just drive her crazy; she worries she may have some issue that causes repetitive noises to drive her crazy. I presented the idea of possibly isolating the pit bull to my roommate's room so that she wouldn't hear her anymore and the idea of just her, with me by her side, telling him how she feels. My girlfriend doesn't really like either of those ideas. The main issue she has is that he pays rent and she doesn't and thus she believes she doesn't have much room to make any complaints or anything. I don't feel as though her not paying rent invalidates her feelings, but she doesn't think it's her place. I'm really stuck here as to how to handle this; her solution is earplugs, but that just seems... Not right? I'm just really stuck. I can't ask my roommate to move out because I need the rent money and I can't have my girlfriend officially move in and pay rent because my parents are very old fashioned.

294,"Can going to Community College save a poor High school GPA?

It took until my senior year in high school to realize that school is kinda important and I probably should try harder. I’d pretty much get by on doing the absolute barest minimum. 

I have lots of friends who’ve achieved great things academically so far and hearing them talk about their future and stuff sounds really interesting! It’s pushed me to be better by doing things like doing a good majority of assigned work and actually going to school! (Low standards, I know, but it’s a start!). I’ve been doing great so far in my last year of high school but it’s a little too late to throw a band-aid on the gaping wound that is my GPA

I plan on going to community college for two years and then transferring to another four year college after. Would a turnaround performance in community college make it easier to get into a better four year college after? I’m not looking to get into Harvard or anything crazy like that but I’d at least like to get into nice school

TL;DR: I screwed up really bad in high school. Will doing better in community college make it easier to get into a nicer four year college after? (Thanks for reading!!)",21Jan2020,1
295,"So yesterday my boyfriend said that he wants to have kid(s) but I personally think that having a kid is not wise because I don't want my son/daughter have to life a rough life just like mine, they don't have to experience difficulties in this life all just because the parents want a kid and they have to do it because as a kid you have no other choice but continue living. I know life is not always as bad as mine or my boyfriend's but there's always an obstacle right? It's not that I don't want a kid, but I just don't want them to experience life because I know life is hard. I used to regret that I'm alive so I don't want to give life to another human being, I'm afraid my kid would regret their life too and it's all because of me giving it to them. 

I love him so much but I can't get rid of those thoughts and he really loves me but he really wants a kid too. And I already ask him, did he want to be with me but no kid or break up with me so he could have a kid. And he said if he really have to choose, he would choose to break up. But he loves me and he couldn't break me up. Now we really don't know what to do.

Do I need to go to psychiatrist or something? Is something is not right in my head if I think that way? Please give me an advice. Thank you very much.

300,"I recently made a new friend this past semester in college. Friends are rare for me since I'm quite socially anxious, but I met this girl who has many of the same interests as me and I feel like I can be open with her.

We've spoken a lot at school and we have even gone out to eat a few times. We also have texted each other a lot. However, after the semester ended she stopped answering my texts so much. She will either completely ignore my texts or won't answer for days on end. I don't text her incessantly either or keep texting her if she's not answering. I only text her again once she responds.

I know she's not obligated to text me back all the time or even ever, but should I take this personally? From the times we interacted throughout the semester I got the feeling that she liked me as a person, which is rare because I often tend to assume people don't like me. But now I'm questioning this. For me personally, the only people I don't text back are people that I don't particularly like.

Do you think the fact that she is suddenly not very responsive towards me anymore actually means something? Could she just be busy and she didn't let me know?

I would just like to know how I can deal with this and not let it make me feel so insecure about myself.

Btw, I'm a straight female. This is nothing romantic.

301,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

A few years ago I ran away from home to live with some family friends. I was about 14 and things at home were getting rough. My mum and dad were going through a divorce and it was messy and chaotic and my mum would always be fighting with my older sister and my dad is controlling and so on so forth.

Although i was the target of some of the abuse, my sister took the brunt of most of it, so sometimes i feel that my reasons for leaving are invalid. My mother, despite being bipolar and quite manipulative, wasn’t the worst mother in the world and was basically a victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

I am now F19 going onto 20 and im still living here with the friends i ran to about 4 or 5 years ago. My life is great, i’m in university and they are my family and I’m part of theirs aswell  but I’ve lost that close relationship with my two younger sisters and my parents. I haven’t seen my dad since late 2017 which doesn’t hurt me much because he’s always been abusive and hard to deal with, and my relationship with my mother is strained and we just had another falling out the other day. I can’t have a proper relationship with my younger sisters because they live with my mum and if i dont have a relationship with her, she’ll stop me from a having a relationship with my sisters.

Sometimes i feel like I’d have a fine relationship with them if i had just stayed and by leaving i opened this wound that didn’t have to be opened. At the same time, I dont know the cost I would be paying if I had stayed. I definitely not the same person and I can’t guarantee that my mental health would’ve been as stable as it is now.

I just feel like I’ve dug a hole that I can’t get out of. I feel to a point that I left and stayed where I am out of the quick, rash decision making of a 14 year old. I suppose I just have some regrets. In all honesty, I would’ve survived if I stayed. I’m not high maintenance and was never a difficult child. I find it hard to explain to my parents why I left because the reaction is always “it was never you it was your sister” and stuff like that. I can’t explain to my dad why I don’t speak to him anymore, because the reason why I don’t speak to him is because he always lectures me and abuses me about leaving and coming back, which is something i feel is my fault.

I can’t go back and live with them because I’ve established a life and a lifestyle and a way of thinking that is different from theirs. I’ve been given more freedom to be who I truly am and I’m not the hermit that they remember as their daughter, so we’d be totally incompatible.

Now I’m a sophomore comp sci student, and it’s rough.

305,"So this is going to be a long paragraph about me attempting to explain my problem, so I might sound crazy or repeat myself a lot, sorry about that. 

This started a while ago, back in May of 2019. I was living a pretty normal life, I didn't have any history of anxiety or anything like that. I was just watching TV when out of nowhere, this memory popped up. Now when I say this memory, it's not really a past experience I had or anything like that. It's hard to explain for me, but it's like a quick bing in my mind. I can't see it as a memory, but more of like a thing that just pops up in my head. Let me put this into perspective for those of you reading this. Close your eyes for 30 seconds and try not to imagine an apple. You attempt it, but the idea of trying not to think about it, but that just makes you think about it. That's how it is for me. After the first time it popped up, I didn't really think much of it. But then not soon after, it happened again, then again and again. I couldn't focus on the TV since every once in a while or so, I keep remembering it. It's almost as if I'm watching TV fully focused, my mind is on the storyline and fully immersed in the story. Then when the memory randomly appears, I'm self conscious or self aware that I'm watching TV. This happens randomly and it just ruins the experience of me watching TV. And I can't even focus on the TV cause I'm focused on trying to forget about the memory. This problem happened to me 3 times. 1st time, I had it for a week and forgot about it after a month or so. Then months later while watching something on YouTube. Boom! It just randomly came up out of nowhere. I was so frustrated when it came back since I thought I've gotten rid of it for sure. 2nd time it happened, I was struggling to keep track on the story but it keeps coming back no matter how much I try. I've tried methods to try and forget about it, but the problem for me is when I try the method, I know that I'm purposely trying to trick my brain into forgetting and that just makes me remember it again. After a while, I just got better at forgetting. While I watch something, I just get too fully immersed into the story that the memory just disappears. This problem was only just when I was trying to watch something though. In real life, I forget about it with ease since I'm busy doing something and it just goes away. But once my eyes are on the screen, it just happens. The 3rd time, which is present time, has never been this bad. 

(If you're still reading this, thank you. I know it's long but I've just been dealing with this for months now and I want to be as descriptive as possible to hopefully find answers) The third time this came up again, it wasn't even the randomly appearing memory. It was me being self aware/self-conscious about my breathing. Before I explain, sorry to do this, but focus on your breathing. You can probably feel it more in depth and have trouble trying to breathe properly. Everyday, everybody breathes automatically, thinking nothing of the way they inhale and exhale. But once you actually focus in on it, you start feeling like you're not inhaling enough or a short exhale ruins the cycle. This does get super annoying and hard to forget for me. And the worse part for me was that this was happening to me while I was trying to fall asleep. Everyday, I slept normally, usually just closing my eyes and having weird and imaginative thoughts in my head and to hope waking up at the sound of birds outside at the early morning. But one day, I started focusing on my breathing and I kept ruining the automatic cycle, I start getting butterflies in my stomach and panic attacks, it was horrible. I somehow managed to sleep but only for around 3 hours. I enjoyed my day pretty well, hoping the day lasts forever so I didn't have to deal with that again, but as soon as the sun went down, I started getting anxious and scared and I kept getting butterflies in my stomach. This happened for about a week and the worse part about this too was the fact that I kept waking up in the middle of the night, and having to deal with it all over again. By now, I've kinda gotten used to it and my method is to use a breathing technique online counting the seconds I should be exhaling or inhaling. 

Being self-aware is the worst. Everyday, we don't really focus on ourselves doing something. We instead focus on the thing we're doing. Someone like myself can't get the idea out my head that what I'm doing isn't normal and that I'll probably forget it at some point, but It just keeps happening, I keep remembering and I overthink, I feel like I'm going fucking insane. If someone can please help me and give me advice, help or even medicine, please just help me. I'm too afraid of going to the doctor cause I don't want to sound mentally ill or crazy. If someone could give me advice, that'd mean the world to me. Thank you.",21Jan2020,1

311,"Hello everyone, I hope you’re having a good evening/morning, thank you in advance for reading.

TLDR: my suicidal friend likes me, and I like her back, but she’s in no position to date anyone since she isn’t over her ex, but refuses to recognize that and instead redirects blame to me, which she’s done before, and I’m at my limit; what should I do next?

So my friend (F) likes me, and I have a small crush on her as well. But she got out of a relationship a month ago, and while she claims to be over her ex, she has told me she isn’t. Now we both know that we like each other, and she wants to get into a relationship and I’ve told her (and made it clear at the beginning) that I’m in no position to date her, and I think she should focus on herself. She is mentally distraught, refuses to eat/drink water, and overall is emotionally unstable. 

Now, I genuinely do want to see her get better, and there’s no ulterior motive to that either. I just want her to learn how to take care of herself so that she can live life truly happy. That’s really my intention, despite others mistaking my kindness and my want for her to improve herself as attraction. And it seems she also has that concept locked in her head; despite me wanting to see her care for herself, she (and others) continually misconstrue that as affection and non-platonic love for her. 

Now, earlier today the topic made its way to her ex, and I asked her how often he comes up in her mind; she responded with, “every time he texts me.” I asked her if she blocked him, and she said no. When I asked why, she said “because I loved him. And it still kinda hurts, y’know?” After I said “oh?” She said that she didn’t want to talk about it any more, which I respected, and said that if she does want to talk about it, I’m here for her. But she then asks me if she, “ruined [her] chances of getting with me.” And I responded by telling her that she cannot get into a relationship with someone when they aren’t over their ex, and also brought up that if one was to use the logic that dating someone else will help me get over my ex, they would be dangerously wrong. And then she sent me a photo with small text, reading, “he’s not the problem. The problem is that I’m in love with you, okay? And idk what to do because you don’t want to do anything about it.” 

I didn’t respond after that, because of how livid I was at reading that. I understand that she doesn’t realize what I’m doing for her, but understanding why someone says something doesn’t subtract from what she said. She indirectly (or maybe directly) blamed me for her having all of these thoughts and problems in her head. And I know for a fact that she’s not in love with me. She’s in no state to get into a relationship right now, and if she refuses to believe that and instead puts the blame on the other person, that only justifies my reasoning. 

Now, as I put in the title, she is suicidal. And I’m not going to straight up abandon her, but my patience is running thin, as this isn’t the only time these kinds of things have occurred in our friendship, and I’ve been as understanding as I possibly can but I myself have limits. What do I do with this situation?",21Jan2020,1
312,"I have been with my husband for almost 8 years (married 3years). When we met, we were both pretty clear that smoking was a deal breaker for the both of us.

322,"I received a text from my neighbor this afternoon after a steady stream of water damaged drywall and other cosmetic things in their unit. I live above him, so I rushed home to inspect the source. I expected full on disaster in my 100yo Chicago apartment, but found nothing. Not a drop of water or a waft of sewage. No damage whatsoever.

Other neighbor in the front unit had nicked a pipe while doing renovations earlier in the day, so they shut the water off for an hour to repair the leak. A leak in the front basement unit. Seemingly unrelated, right? 

A plumber came out and inspected the unit, found nothing but water damage. Tomorrow they’ll inspect my unit and probably (hopefully) find nothing that will cost thousands of dollars. 

Can my neighbors try and stick me with a bill? Im happy to fix something if it’s broken, I’m new to homeownership and I’m not sure if there are steps I should be taking to protect myself and my apartment.

TLDR: Failed college, dropped out, grew up, want to go back, low GPA and life getting in the way, help!
 
Ok, so. I graduated from High School in 2010. Despite my protests, I was a coerced into college by threats of losing a major portion of Financial Aid available to me through the TOPS program. Coming from a single parent household, we had little to no money to spare on sending me to college and losing any aid would’ve been a big deal.
I did very well in high school. Graduated with a high GPA and a fairly high score on my ACT. I was offered scholarships to attend a local university and would end up receiving money back each semester after tuition and fees were paid.
 
I was not ready to go. I messed up. My first semester, I was living on campus and had no supervision. No parent checking up on me to make sure I was attending classes, and no consequences for staying in my bed all day instead. For whatever reason, the reality that I was going to lose my aid never dawned on me and I withdrew from all of my classes. I mean, withdrawals were better than failing right? I fell below the required number of hours for full time status and immediately lost my TOPS.
 
Second semester, I was going to get my act together. I started off strong, scheduled a full load of classes determined to right the wrongs. I was quickly overwhelmed and chose to procrastinate and partake in activities that made me feel comfortable rather than focus on school. Once again, I stopped going to classes. The only difference this time, was that it was too late to withdraw. I received all failing grades. Straight F’s. Not for lack of intelligence, just a lack of discipline.
 
At this point, I was academically suspended for a full semester. I took the time to work and reflect on my choices and after my suspension was over, I scheduled myself smaller work load. As a part of my consequences, I was required to pay for 1 semester of classes out of pocket before financial aid would be reinstated. Well… of the 4 classes I scheduled myself, I passed 2 with an A. The other 2 added to the failing grades already on my transcript. Looking at my grades, I ended up with a 0.75 GPA with 46 attempted hours. My resolutions were short lived and I decided that college wasn’t in the stars for me.
 
Fast forward 8 years. I am in a much different head space. I have matured exponentially and still long to complete my college education. I have landed a great entry level career and would like to better my chances for advancement… Of course with a new phase of life, there are also unique challenges. I’m looking for advice to help my overactive mind make a semblance of a plan. My current challenges are this:
 
#1: Obviously, my 0.75 GPA is not doing me any favors. I have searched online, and my previously attended University does offer an Academic Renewal (Bankruptcy) program, which would negate my GPA while I attended the institution again.
 
#2: I used a fancy online GPA calculator to determine what it would take to get my GPA up to a level I am happy with, and came to the conclusion that completing 253 hours with a 4.0 is just a little unattainable. At least within a reasonable time frame.
 
#3: I now work shift work at a plant. I rotate from days to nights on 12 hour shifts, so attending a traditional sit in class is impossible for me.
 
#4: I have looked into online classes, but most require a higher GPA than I have. Academic renewal will only be considered by the University at which the failing grades were received.
 
#5: Community college does exist and does offer online classes, but again… I would have to claim my .75 GPA and start on my 253 hours.
 
I am eager to learn and have a new view on life responsibilities and my education. I have been relearning math online. I have also considered going through ACT prep courses to possibly retest and refresh my test scores, maybe show how seriously I’m taking my academics this go around. I yearn to learn so to speak, and it really is a recurring theme when it comes to any unhappiness about my life thus far. I suppose my question is… what would you do if you were in this situation? Or does anybody have any insight into how GPA’s really work? I refuse to let this goal go!

326,"3 days ago my sister got out of prison, i havent seen her sober in i dont know how long and after trying to deal with drug addicts all my life i feel like im at a breaking point and i dont know how to cope.

Every time my parents welcomed my two sisters back into the home in the past its ended in either, my money beimg stolen, my parents money being stolen, their jewlery being pawned off or them bringing drugs/strange men into the home when my parents werent here. This kind of thing has been going on ever since i was a little kid and im 20 now.

The last time i met this one particular sister i was 15 and she screamed in my face because she was mad that i told on her for stealing almost $100 from me

And ever since she got out of prison i havent even been able to look at her or even be in the same room as her without having a mental breakdown, i just get overwhelmed with emotions and memories and its too much to handle, i can not cope with this and it feels like hell and i cant even leave my room for most of the day because of it.

And everyone else in my household welcomed her in without question so i feel selfish for feeling this way, and i dont know why it hit me so hard, but its getting too much to handle, and i was wondering if anyone here could give me advice on how to cope with this.",21Jan2020,1

328,"So I am currently a college student at a UC. I am in my fourth year and was going to graduate this spring until I got a c- in a class and messed up my plan and have to wait until next year to graduate. I am debating taking time off and starting up again next year, but idk if I will even come back to school. I started a new job recently and I make a really good amount of money, and they will pay for me to get a degree at another school and I won't pay anything. My schooling now is expensive and I don't really think it is worth it anymore. Everyone is saying to keep going because I'm almost done, but I've lost my interest in physics(my major) and don't want to do it anymore and really don't want to pay for it anymore.

329,Okay I’ve been experiencing this flooded feeling in my mind which started a few hours ago and is still going on. It all started when I was watching an a show and I was thinking about how overrated it was. But I was hooked watching it for some reason. During me watching it I felt a weird sensation in my mind not sure why. So I stopped watching after a while. Then this feeling in my head amplified by a great amount. It felt like my mind was just flooded. I don’t know with what it wasn’t thoughts or fear. I know it wasn’t a panic attack or anxiety attack because I didn’t panic or my body wasn’t acting weird. Not sure what is going on but I would appreciate an explanation. Thanks!,21Jan2020,1

331,"On thursday, my side started aching.

On friday, I still worked though the pain didn't allow me to be as efficient as I wanted to.

On saturday morning, 3am, I woke up and went to the local hospital ER to have it checked instead of working that day. The nurse said it might be a pulled muscle caused by my two weeks of hard coughing and the doctor said nothing was broken (after an awkward bit of digging his knuckles into my side). I was given two days off, including the saturday.

On monday (yesterday) I was naturally free from work, but my side still hurt enough that I went back to the hospital to get a continuation. I didn't even get to a doctor when the receiving nurse presented me with some online thing to get me a sick leave paper for work. A health center nurse should call me the next day.

In the evening I had a real bad coughing fit and felt something snap. Hurt like a bitch.

It's almost 8am now and I've been awake since 5am because my side hurts and I'm absolutely paranoid I broke a rib. It's a stabby pain and dull ache, I'm so tired cus I can't sleep and my arm is going numb due to not being able to roll around. If it's broken, I have 6 weeks of sucky coming up, and I cannot take sick leave for that long. I need the pay from work.

Does anyone have personal experience on broken ribs? How does it actually feel? The nurse should call me today and evaluate what needs to be done, but what do I say? The snap could have been just a joint popping since I'm so stiff from the pain, but is this paranoia? The painful spot feels painful now even when poked, and the tissue under the skin feels swollen though doesn't look like it.

Lately they've been sick a lot so there's constant coughing, so many snot covered clothes/tissues everywhere and so on.   


They've stopped doing their laundry and are now wearing my clothes. I have nothing against this, but they are wearing my GOOD clothes around the house and now some of my favourite pieces are stained, and stink to high heaven. 

  
I've known this person for years. They're going through some personal issues, but I've tried again and again to help. I realised that they're putting their health/well-being off for attention. I'm not in any place to give them the attention they're craving right now. It's taking a toll on my mental health and I'm starting to lose it. I'm going to move out as soon as I can. I've talked to them about personal boundaries, common courtesy and the like but all to no avail.

335,"A bit of backstory  
 

I have a female friend who I've  known since middle school. We'd  do everything together: play sports ports, play video games, go to the movies, ect.  Once we hit puberty, we started talking about sex amongst ourselves. Over all those years, we are now sophomores in college and that talk eventially led to sending nudes and even  occasional sex. We aren't  in a relationship but we still do send nudes to this very day.  
 

So, this morning I had to take a massive  shit. I brought my phone in with me.  I'm sitting in the toilet, scrolling reddit, when suddenly I get a new snap from the girl. I open it, and it's  her pussy  spread wide open with a caption that says, "" im waiting for you ;)"" Of course, I was aroused by this and immediately amassed a raging boner. Now it's  time to shit. I try to push the turd out, but I also start  peeing out of my hard! Piss flies acroas the room so I move all the way back and point my body downwards  so my piss will land in the bowl, but in all that commotion I had forgotten about my shit. I completely forgot about where my shit would land and realise I'm  standing over the floor, but it's  too late. My shit lands on the floor. I'm  still pissing and shitting at this point, so I position myself over the toilet so the remaining shit could fall in, but I had forgotten about my piss. This time, the stream hits my phone so I instinctively yank  my phone away, but my wired  headphones also fly off with it. The piss hits my headphones, breaking them. Now I'm  left  with piss everywhere, shit on the floor, and broken headphones.

I under stand that people can be busy but out of all of my friemds I have the most hectic schedule and still manage to make time for them, plus I have depression. I have 5 3 hour classes and commute to college everyday during the school week. On snap chat I kind of put a rant in which I said that if you cant make time for me then we dont need to be friends.

Waking up has been one of the biggest issues in last years and I can't really do it. I did do a couple of things to wake me up in time. For example, I'm using this app called Alarmy which gives you certain tasks to do in order to turn off the alarm, I've been using that for some time and I gotta say, sometimes it really works but in a situation where I sleep 3-4 hours a day it's difficult to wake up even after many alarms, all with certain tasks. Also, a friend of mine wakes up early in the morning every single day and I asked him to call me whenever he wakes up (which is around 5-7 am) but even after answering and talking to him for a bit, for some time now, I find myself going back to sleep again. 

All of this can work, I'm aware of that, I've experienced them. It's just really hard to force yourself to do something. Worst thing is, not just concerning sleep, whenever I say I'm gonna improve or fix this or that, like procrastinating or start studying multiple subjects at once (which I just have to do in this situation) I still can't force myself to do any of those, especially when I understand that in order for me to succeed I have to work on improving myself but ultimately I end up where I begin, I never get anything done and always feel like a failure.

350,"\*\*\*This is not a relationship advice question

I'll try to keep this short, but here is a little background:

I started dating a separated woman about 9 months ago. They are now divorced and is in the process of moving out totally. While she was grabbing things from the basement she found a bag with a pistol, $1,000 in cash, duct tape and zip ties. 

We are in Kentucky, a lot of us have guns for various reasons, including myself. I would prefer this not turn into a gun debate because no one can win politics and I'm honestly trying to get some advice on what she should do and would like to hear if we're jumping to conclusions. 

She called and asked me if I knew why it would be there because she just thought it was weird. I said well maybe at some point he had a thought of using the cash to drive a few states away to take out someone that was bound wit the zip ties and duct tape. People do crazy shit all the time. 

According to her he is a very normal, stable man. Very passive. They were together for 12 years so I assume her judgment is correct. 

I met him a couple of weeks ago just to be on the up and up. He said he just wanted to wipe the slate clean and be on good terms moving forward. They have children together, so he will be in our lives. He also made it a point to say he will not be the crazy jealous ex. ""we're done, her happiness is your responsibility now. But I would very much like to work as one unit with the kids."" I of course agreed. We shook hands I said thank you for your time. And we headed our separate ways. 

So everything on the surface seems fine. I don't think there is any threat, but those items being in the same bag is kind of alarming. Why else would those specific things be together? 

Do you think this is alarming to the point where we need to look over our shoulders? Or is it just a coincidence? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: GF found a bag with $1,000 cash, a pistol, duct tape and zip ties. We're trying to figure out why those specific items would be together outside of the worst case scenario. Kidnapping, murder etc. Anything helps",21Jan2020,1

355,"My best friend is someone I deeply care about and I'm worried about her. She has told me some of the horrible things her family did to her.

My best friend has a eating disorder and body image issues because of her family. Her family abuses her like hit her such as punches or use weapons like bats to hit her, verbally insult her by calling her like b*tch or h*e or attention seeker. Even body shame her when she is just fine. Not only that they didn't believe her when she finally had the courage to tell them about her uncle molesting her when she was around 13 but her family did not believe because ""she didn't say anything at the time"" or ""why she kept the information for too long"" because she is currently 17 years old. Which makes it ""justifiable"" for them to call her a liar and a attention seeker. Also ""justifiable "" to abuse her the way they do to her because her real father is a bad man who abused and raped her mother despite being her mother boyfriend. Still after that her mother tried to have a abortion but my best friend survived but her twin brother did not sadly. 

Not only that, around the time where her family kept on beating her, she met this one guy and gave her virginity to him. Although in my opinion it seems like he took advantage the whole situation because of the test messages I read between them (she gave me her accounts passwords like Instagram and snapchat because she trusts me) and he would make it worse by telling her ""your own mother doesn't love you so be grateful im still in your life"" or ""atleast I help you forget the way your uncle touches you"" which in my opinion is absolutely disgusting and got me the angriest the most. Still my best friend still decides to be with him because he was the only who was with her during the family situation and he is her first love. 

Although,  he also seems like a jealousy type because he did message me one day and threatened me to stay away from my best friend or else he would fight me which I responded ""bet let's fight then but I'm not going to pay your hospital Bills once I beat your ass."" However my best friend found out and almost cut me off her life. She made it seem like it was my fault despite him threatening me. Look, I'm guy and I do love my best friend but I'm not going to let some idiot ruin her life even further or ruin herself over situation like these. I tried to warn her that he was using her for her body but she didn't listen to me. Still after that, he left her and she would end up crying for months about him until he pop up in her life again which made me frustrated about the situation.  Which was about a year ago but she blocked him on all social media because apparently she is not ready to confront him again.

Even still, she did tried to move on but this time it was worse. We have spanish class together and she sucks on Spanish if I'm being honest. We have some student in our Spanish class that dont speak English. There are two of them that caught my attention the most. I usually call them the ""wierd spanish boys"" because in my opinion they creep me out. They constantly stare at my best friend. 

One made a  creepy poem about her (which I'll summarize since I read it with her and translated to her in Spanish: basically,  he fell in love the first time he saw her, has the most beautiful smile and loves her""  and he did tried to walk her home since they walk the same way but I basically made him back off politely and walked with her constantly to make him take a hint.  

The other one was way worse. He would often follow her around when she was alone. Ask creepy questions on why she doesn't love him or why doesnt she want to be his girlfriend and shit like that. I basically told him to back off as well and it seems he is scare of me since I'm tall and buff so he would be like ""okay sorry I dont want problems."" This would go on and on until he went after some other girl. 

Recently she has been crying alot even if she tries to deny it. It's pretty obvious. Her face seems to swollen.  Her eyes are always red and watery. She always avoids her friends now and avoids me. I tried to confront her about it but she constantly tells me she wants to be alone and when I try to kinda hang out with her even when she wants to be alone. She gets angry at me and yells at me to leave her alone. Which I did argue with her about the sudden change in her behavior but after that she would give the cold shoulder,  give small talks or just ignore me. Which I was hurt by but I took the hint and left her alone. 

However, a few days ago she apologized to me and told me that she wants to be alone for now and dont know how long we would hang out but hopefully soon. During the whole conversation,  we saw the the second wierd spanish boy stare at us. My best friend immediately cried and begged me to help her avoid him like if she was in serious trouble and wanted to avoid him at all cost. I just accepted and went with the flow despite being confused about the situation  and walked her off until we reached the school gate. 

A few days later I was confused about the situation still and confronted her about it and asked her if something happened to her with that spanish boy but she gave me a hint something did happen but it was only part of why she was crying. She basically told me that she wants to be alone and wants to focus on herself and that it's mainly about her family situation again but worse this time.

Still, I worry about her especially her sudden behavior.  She flinches when I try to gave her a simple hug or pushes me away when I put touch contact to her like playing around with her hair. She seems scare like paranoid or afraid because her eyes get bigger and always seems like she about to cry constantly when I see her. She doesnt smile or laugh as much like she did before and always looks down on the ground.  It's like she had a complete shut down and just change. 

I want to help her but I dont know how?

Summary: My best friend is girl who comes from a abusive family. She was sexually abused by her uncle and her family called her a liar and a attention seeker for keeping the information for too long. She is constantly belittle by her family. She has body image issues,  eating disorder and constantly cries because of her family.  I gave her one of cat kitten to comfort her as a friend for home when I'm not around. She was in a verbally abusive relationship with a guy. There are  two guys from Spanish class who have some wierd obsession with her like stalk her or follow her when I'm not around. Now she doesn't wants to talk or hang out with anybody including me. She always constantly flinches when I touch her like give her a simple hug or play around with her. She always avoids me or her friends. Even when I try to hang out with her she pushes me away. I'm worried about her and dont know what to do?",21Jan2020,1
356,"So, I am a freshman at (omitted) University, and I am very anxious. Last night, I hosted a dorm party for my best friend to show much I cared about him. There was alcohol at the party, which I had gotten from an upperclassman. In total, there were about 15 people in my dorm room. Time goes by and everyone is fine except for my one friend. He is ridiculously drunk and can not handle his alcohol at all. He is not at the point where he would need medical attention, but he was laying down on my bed drinking water and was not in a condition to talk to anyone.

So the party goes on and it is a lot of fun. I feel as though I’m considered a nerd or unpopular by my friend group because of my poor attempts to throw parties in the past, so this made up for it in my eyes. In my ignorance, a little bit before midnight, the RAs at my dorm are knocking and they ask to speak to me because it is my room. The only things they ask are about my drunk friend and if there was any alcohol left in the room, which there wasn’t. They sent everybody out of the room except for my roommate, myself, and my drunk friend, who I was nursing.

They took the ID and name of every student that was in my dorm room and we are expecting to have a University hearing. I am freaking out because I want to be an Orientation Leader this summer and I fear that this will affect that somehow. The one thing I ya e going for me is that I know for a fact that the RA put that there was no alcohol present in the room.

After reading online, some of my friends suggest making a group alibi and skew the truth to avoid guilt. I’m honestly not sure what to do or what will happen and it scares me. It is my first offense.",21Jan2020,1

359,"I apologize for the length of the backstory. Skip to the end for a tl;dr. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (17F) am a part-time front-end shift manager at a grocery store. 

For the holiday season, a kind, generous soul donated several hundred dollars in gift cards to be used in instances when people who cannot afford their groceries. (This was a big deal to me because it is genuinely heartbreaking to see people on the verge of tears in the checkout lane, embarrassed at being unable to pay for their food. How many times I've wanted to pull out my own wallet...)

A couple of weeks ago, a situation arose where it would have been appropriate to use the card. I knew that there was a not-insignificant amount of funds remaining on the card, certainly enough to make up the difference in this case. I went to retrieve the card, only to find that it was not in its usual spot. 

Just the day before, my boss and I had used it to help a woman pay for baby formula. So, I found my boss and asked if he knew where the card was. He was equally bewildered by its absence, and we were both trying to think about when we had last seen it.

I then remembered seeing, earlier in the day, a fellow customer service rep, Jane (&gt;55F), messing with the cards. It stuck out in my mind because it looked as though she was trying to determine the balance. I thought that was strange, as we were always careful to keep a balance receipt attached. 

So, that being my last recollection of seeing the card, I relayed to my boss what I remembered, being very careful to clearly state that I was not making any accusations in any way, shape, or form.

He acknowledged that I wasn't trying to start shit, but he seemed very frustrated. I got the impression that he thought that she stole them. 

Jane isn't exactly the friendliest person. She has, on multiple occasions, been particularly cruel to me, and has no qualms about saying nasty things about our coworkers as soon as their backs are turned. In addition to this, Jane recently bullied one of our coworkers, Mary, into breaking a serious rule and Mary came to me in the midst of a panic attack, thinking she'd be fired over it. When I was in training for my promotion, Jane also pressured me to fudge the delivery log to cover a mistake she made.

Anyway, while I may have privately believed that she had stolen them, I was not ready to go around accusing her of theft with no evidence. I'm not interested in having a further strained working relationship, and we have cameras all over the place for a reason.

I never heard any follow-up about it, and eventually, I forgot about all of this.

Until the evening before last. We've been having rather bad weather recently, and it was later in the evening, so business was quite slow. The only staff on the front end were myself and a cashier, who I consider a friend.

We were chatting whilst occupying ourselves with some cleaning tasks. I don't recall precisely how we got to the topic of conversation, but in any case, she brought up how wonderful those charity gift cards were, and how she wished it were possible to always have them at our disposal.

I recognize, in retrospect, that what follows was stupid of me. Unprofessional. Inappropriate. Wrong. But alas, I'm a seventeen-year-old high school girl. I'm stupid, prone to gossip, this was a friend of mine, and there was no one around. 

I recounted to her the situation with the missing gift card. Again, I was careful to not explicitly accuse Jane of theft, but, well, it was likely easy to draw a negative conclusion based on my, doubtlessly biased storytelling.

As it happens, she must have drawn said conclusion. And confronted Jane directly about it, likely in an aggressive manner.

I know this because yesterday evening at work, I answered the phone. It was Jane. She was extremely angry, and began to absolutely lay into me.

Note that this was the main phone, at the service counter. The professional, business line.

I quickly cut her off saying, ""I think it's hugely inappropriate to discuss this at work on the main line. If you want to call me on my cell phone, that's fine."" I then hung up before she could get another word in edgewise. 

Let it be noted that I am an extremely emotional person (and probably not suited for my position because of it, but let's not get into that), and I do not deal well with being yelled at. As soon as the phone was back on the hook, I lost all of my composure, and, very obviously crying, excused myself to the bathroom. 

I sat in the bathroom for about 10 minutes, trying to calm down. Once I stopped crying and I had splashed enough cold water on my face for my eyes to be less red, I returned to the front.

I pleasantly dealt with a few customers and was back into the swing of things. 

However, my boss, who was also there and witnessed my little breakdown, asked me if I was okay and if I needed a few more minutes. I said I was fine, but unfortunately, he continued to press the issue, and I started crying again. 

We stepped into the office, along with the store director. Jane had called back after I hung up and spoke with my boss. He made it very clear to me that I wasn't in trouble, that I didn't need to worry, and that I was right to end the call. The store director agreed, saying that Jane approached the issue very unprofessionally and that they would be having a conversation about it. 

I finished the day in peace. Thoughtfully, my boss gave me some tasks that could be done privately (pulling tills and taking them to the cash room, doing some minor accounting tasks in the office, etc.) and continued to be reassuring and kind. (I think everyone was a little freaked out by my crying.) 

I have the day off today (Tuesday), but I'm scheduled on Wednesday. I will be working all day with Jane, and my boss will not be there to run interference.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** I gossiped about a coworker potentially stealing a charitable donation. The coworker heard about it and called to yell at me while I was at work yesterday, on the main business line. She was enraged, and I cried in the bathroom over it. My boss and my boss's boss are involved now. I'm not in trouble, but I will be working with her, alone, tomorrow.

**Here's the advice-seeking part:**

I am obviously guilty of wrongdoing here. I should never have gossiped about it to a cashier. That was information that should have stayed between my boss, myself, and HR or Loss Control, or whoever. 

I feel *extremely* anxious about working with her on Wednesday. (Sick-to-my-stomach, thinking-about-calling-in level anxious.) I really want to resolve this and move on to working in relative peace and productivity. 

As much as I might like to avoid conflict forever, I am not stepping into that ridiculous territory of refusing to work with someone and having to schedule around each other or something.

What should I do tomorrow? What steps can I take to resolve this?",21Jan2020,1
360,"I am not suicidal. I am, however, self destructive. I lie a lot, I push people away for no reason, I often tell myself no one really cares about me, and I can't even look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted with what I see. I neglect my mental and physical health, and live in some sort of denial and tell myself everything will work out okay. 

Not to say I think what I'm doing is normal. It's not. I know, deep inside, that I'm not actually a bad person, and there are people who care about me, but for some reason I feel like I dont deserve to be happy. 

I've tried to bring this up to my family, but I don't know how to tell them without them telling me I'm over reacting or to get over it. (Both quotes from my parents.) They think that if I just put a little more effort in, and just stop being a lazy loser I can just get better. I do have medication for anxiety, but I stop taking it sometimes, and then for some reason I won't take it anymore, even though I know it will help me. 

I don't know why I can't just get up and just start making myself do better. It's like I have a mental block, but no one in the family wants to hear my ""excuses"" or they just tell me to take my medication and shut up. I know I should talk to them about getting counseling, but I have no idea how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",21Jan2020,1

363,"22 y/o gal in the USA and all I've ever known was fast food. Eventually, the toll of working fast food has gotten to be too much for me. 

I was a CNA but didn't last long as I realized I was not cut out for it. I got a job in food service at the airport to keep me close to my dreams of seeing the world one day, but I eventually got tired of the airport busy environment, so I got a job at a regular fast food chain and at first it was good but then we got to training and I was put on sandwiches and the ladies training me were assholes. They didn't let me do much at all. When I did do something, they'd harshly judge me on it. Then I had one manager say I stressed her out, but really she just didn't want to train me. And the other is I'm slow with completing tasks and I was cleaning the line and had an elder lady comment how slow I was and how she got multiple tasks done meanwhile I was still on it and that I need to hurry up. Not even my manager and honestly I just got so fed up. It caused me too much stress (from stomach aches and vomiting) to depression. My mental health has always been in shambles. 

I don't know why but the tasks that come easy to most (tying hair, make up, driving, socializing) has always been difficult for me. I never know what to say in social situations and I tend to catch myself going adrift in my own world. When I'm stressed out or feel overstimulated, I need music to space out and find myself doing this odd, comforting thing where I rock back and forth. I find verbal instructions to be incredibly confusing and I have issues focusing as my mind can't really self discipline. As a child, I always thought maybe I was lazy but sometimes I can't be arsed to shower or do tasks like chores. It gets to be too much for me. Even cooking is so stressful and overstimulating. I'm crying thing about the issues I have. I don't know where to begin or how to address this to a Therapist. 

I just know something is wrong with me and this is why I have issues holding down a job (job hopping a lot), socializing, understanding boundaries or how to be a functional human being without breaking down..

Anyway we still are close friends and hangout a lot. Anyway yesterday I went on a road trip with him and a buddy of his and we stopped at a hotel. We just hung out for a while and had dinner and then went to bed. His buddy slept in one bed and my friend and I slept in the other bed since this is the first time I met his friend. Anyway my friend fell asleep right away but his buddy was still awake. He and I talked for a while and laughed about stuff. I got up from the bed and crawled into the bed with the buddy and we talked a little more. We started cuddling and kissing and I gave him head. He wanted to have sex but I didn't want to have sex with my friend in the room.

My friend does not work with me nor knows any of my coworkers, but was okay with a couple of them joining us when I brought up the idea of my one coworkers joining. I have a hard time saying no, and I felt put on the spot from the moment my coworker asked to join, so I blindly agreed without realizing what she was asking. This all happened in the span of a couple of hours this afternoon right before I left for the day so I did not have much time to think or react until now.

I was looking forward to just keeping it quiet the day of and enjoying an intimate lunch with my friend. I'm very uncomfortable with what's ended up happening.

372,"Hello reddit, there's a lot of backstory in this, so it could end up being a very long text.  But please help me.

  I (20 M) met a girl (let's call her Ana, 20) on Instagram about a year and a half ago and found out that she knew some of my friends.  So I asked them about her and realized that we had a lot in common!  I ended up developing a secret crush on her, which only those same friends knew. But as I was too embarrassed to talk to her, I just couldn't start a conversation from scratch, so I left it at that.

  After a while, I met another girl (let's call her Sara, 22) through other people, we started hanging out more and became friends.

  While I was going out with Sara, I got to see what kind of person she is, and that attracted me to her. We started to text more and got closer.

  In the meantime, one of my friends asked me to go out with two of his friends.  Ana was one of those friends.  It was the first time I met her in person, so I was very happy.  After that we went out a few more times.

  Well, to cut the story short, during that year when I got to know Sara, I started to have strong feelings for her and vice-versa, so I started to see Ana more as a friend, although we have similar tastes for music and other things.  But I still have some feelings for Ana, only I can't start any kind of romantic relationship with her, since my parents have known her parents since they were young and have had problems with them, so our families don't get along very well.

  An important thing to note is that Ana and Sara are related in some level, they share a cousin (let's call her Mia, 19). 

  So, Mia was very close friends with Sara for most of their lives, but recently she has been going out a lot more with Ana and has been treating Sara badly.

  Last week Mia invited me to go to a karaoke with Ana and a group of their friends.  I was already wanting to take Sara for a karaoke. I told Sara what she had invited me to.

  Sara initially did not want to go, since she was not getting along with Mia and told me that if I wanted to, I could go. Then she said she would go only to see me (we didn't get to see each other for a week because I was on another city and we would go another week without seeing each other, because I was going to travel to another city). Basically it was the only day in two weeks we would have to see each other.

  This might be very confusing, english is not my first language.

  So, me and Sara went out with them. Mia called some of our friends too and the karaoke ended up being nice.

  But Mia and Ana were acting very strangely towards Sara and me, and Sara noticed that. Now Mia doesn't respond my texts and Ana deleted me from all social media. I'm feeling very sad about it and this is harming my relationship with Sara.

  Ana knows some people who don't want to see me well. I'm afraid she might be influencing Mia and trying to start to influence my friends too.

  I love Sara. I've been preparing to ask her to be my girlfriend soon.

Please reddit, am I overthinking? Overreacting?

My boyfriend and I have been together for a long time and though we aren't really champing at the bit to get married, we both kind of assume it'll happen in the next several years. I like my last name, so I don't want to get rid of it, but I also like my boyfriend's last name, and I really like his family so it would feel special to me to take on their name as well.

My boyfriend probably won't change his name, which is fine with me, but for myself, I was thinking either of hyphenating our last names together, or just taking on two last names. That would make my full name five names, which to me sounds pretty sweet. My boyfriend kind of pokes fun at me when I bring it up but says I should do whatever I want. Everyone else I've mentioned it to reacts like I'm proposing something completely unheard of, which I guess kind of surprised me.

The only drawback anyone has come up with is that it would take me longer to write my full name on forms. I already don't care about writing four names, so I doubt I would care about writing five. Professionally, I would still use the first/last name I'm using now, it would just be my legal name that would change.

379,"Hi reddit ,
I come from a pretty low income family , we moved a lot as a kid and I havem't felt like I had a home for a long time .I moved to college where I was in a different spot every year or so and right after graduation I moved to a new country after looking for a job/better life and was lucky enough to get a grad job at one of the major comapnies in the world ,I always had a goal of working at a giant firm but I though it would take some years .. I never dreamed my first job to be this . It pays well and the learning experience is amazing .In fact I was sent on a training which triggered this whole mess ..the training was in another country , the months spent there was amazing and I even met someone ,a fellow european trainee and we hit it off and had some serious quality time but it was obvious from the beginning it would never work between us in the long run but he created for us this sense of home , a couply routine that I never had and it brought up in me all the daddy issues and the trauma of never having an acctual home .. 
Fast forward to now , I am in this new country with no friends (I live with a couple and glad to have them there but they still dont fill in the void) 
I got so much of waht I wanted ,Imposterbsyndrome kicking in hard but I am  strong and confident and doing well at my job so that will go away and As I am writing this I can understand how people can see this as childish or spoiled but at the end of the day ,I cant help the sense of not belonging anywhere ..I miss him a lot, He made me discover what its like to have a home , someone to comeback to in the evening and just cuddle and watch tv is more than enough for me but I understand that this goes much further and the solution cannot be a person to depend on entirely 
So do I have the right to be sad .. Or am I delusional and should suck it up and be thankful ?
Also how do I build a home for myself ?",21Jan2020,1

382,"I recently found out last week I am pregnant from my ex boyfriend. 
He has been avoiding me and the pregnancy and wants me to abort.
To make matters more interesting, I found out he was cheating on me throughout our relationship &amp; talking to my “friend” behind my back. 
I was in the E.R. alone today getting bloodwork because of the baby and he said he was “too busy”. Come to find out, he is on dating apps pretending I am not expecting his baby. 

So it came to me...
On a scale of 1 to 10....
How petty of me is it to create dating app profiles of him that contain his picture, name, and in the bio add to prevent this from happening to other women since he’s a serial dater and manipulator:

“ I look good, don’t I? Take a closer look... There is a girl out there who is pregnant by me and I'm on these apps because I have been pretending the baby doesn't exist and want her to abort. I'm a liar, and a cheater. I will hit on your friends behind your back. I am full of myself and I use and discard women to successfully stroke my ego to overcompensate for my surplus of insecurities. I just want you out of those parties so I can do the same thing to you. Have fun being a single Mother.

383,"He's been in my inner circle and one of my closest friends since school and we've been hanging regularly since at least 2007-ish. 

He's never expressed any racist ideas this whole time but has always had a rather simplistic and childlike view on the world. The funny thing is, in our inner circle there is me (mixed-race), a Jew and a Colombian. We're also friends with people from a whole bunch of other nationalities (this being London and all).

Earlier this year he made a dumb twitter post to an activist lady calling her a terrorist supporter and telling her to respect Britain. It was an islamaphobic post, although at this point I still don't think he was truly islamaphobic - more just ignorant on what this woman was advocating (thinking she was an extremist). Anyway he got slapped with a one year suspended sentence.

Since then, he's been weird, distant and hasn't been working. He's also steadily lost a lot of different friends as we all grow up, get careers, get married etc and so he mostly now sticks to hanging out at a flat where every weekend he does cocaine and every other day he is smoking shitloads of weed.

Recently he joined this group called Operation Werewolf and flew to Denmark to participate in some organised activities. This group isn't explicitly racist but are obsessed with heritage and hate on the modern world - basically it attracts angry lost young men like my mate.

Now he's constantly talking about wanting to live in a white ethnostate, his brothers told me he no longer speaks to him because he only ever talks about race, he threw a packet of salt (yeah I know) at an interracial couple and keyed a black guys car.

He does all this while still continuing to talk to us who all have varying degrees of tolerance with his behaviour. Most people we know don't know the full extent of his actions (keying the black guys car or his pathetic attempt at abusing a mixed race couple) but know he's obsessed with race - but as my mate is typically a very dumb guy who talks nonsense all the time without really meaning it, we all kind of brush it off as him letting out his anger and frustration over his suspended sentence and don't take him seriously. Only one other person other than his brother has expressed concern.

What would you do if this was your friend? I finally called him out on it just before christmas but not even in a big way, just made fun of his little 'operation werewolf group' and suggested that's why he's not getting laid (he also hates women now lol). Since then he's been talking about me to a mutual friend (who is Colombian) whose also mad at me but for different reasons obviously and coming up with all these paranoid excuses as to why i'm a cunt - i've never 'backed him in a fight' , despite the fact he's never been in one, and that kind of bullshit.

The last time I spoke to him he said 'i'm racist, deal with it' and stropped off like an angry child.",21Jan2020,1

She's going to be here for two weeks until her official place is ready. I thought about making pancakes in the morning I don't know, because who leaves their sex toy out in first place? On their first night in someone else's house? 

I'm baffled. Whatever people want to do sexually is fine, but it's one of those tiny sinks without really counter space, so I come home to this device that has obviously been in a total stranger's anus at some point, sitting in the same spot I brush my teeth.

Well, today that illusion was shattered when he called an ambulance thinking he was dying from sepsis due to using a dirty needle.

387,"I'm a decent kid, I don't get into trouble,don't drink,smoke,or do drugs, but my grades are pretty ass. My mental health isn't the best, Im pretty sure I'm depressed however not sure since I'm only depressed because of school/my mom, whenever I'm on break from school I'm quite happy so therefore I don't really consider myself depressed, plus I get happy and can laugh at things so I don't really know for sure if I am, that being said I do contimplate suicide just because of life of working sounds worse than hell, since I feel after a while you'd be numb to pain. Anyways the point that I'm getting at is that I'm highly unmotivated to give a shit about school since I think that the fact that our intelligence and success therefore to be measured simply by memorization skills and the amount of effort your willing to put into a disgusting task such as school is wrong, I like learning, I genuinely do, but the things I like learning about such as that this one dude built a huge ass trebuchet outside a castle, the people In the castle surrendered, and then this guy fucked off and killed the city just to see shit go boom, isn't necessarily in the curriculum. And so I'm just not motivated to do well in school, in fact one year I had an amazing teacher, and every day I looked forward to his classes and since I didn't want to disappoint him I got 90s In every class, so it's not that I can't do well, it's just what the fucks the point besides a well paying 9-5

anyways the main reason I want to rant is because I'm pretty sure my mom is unstable.
My dad is a ass and ive cut contact with him for the most part, however when my mom and dad were married my dad wouldn't give my mom any power in the relationship, so now that my mom is independent she is scared of losing that power again, and so my mom doesn't let me have any individuality, and so every time I try and be mature and do things with my life my mom fucks off and says well how can you do (x) when you can't even pass your classes, and every time I get into a argument with her she goes and says ""you are not my equal"" or ""you wont win this"" like a bitch on the debate team when all I wanted to do was resolve the situation.

I feel like she cares more about how clean my room is and how good my grades are than she does about me, this is mainly to do with the fact that my brother is your stereotypical a++ student, he was taking college courses in 10th grade and this that and the other thing, but I just wish she would stop putting me to as high standards as she does with him. Like for  example a while back I was going through a mental breakdown and I was balling my eyes out and she thought to say ""your rooms a mess"" as if that fucking matters.

The worst part is that she calls me names like ""fuckup"" or ""son of satan"" or she says I'm ""just like my father"" and it really hurts, but worse is that shes threatening me such as to make me live with my dad, for example just a bit ago we got into a fight and she took my phone since obviously ""somethings wrong with me"" and she need to ""figure out what"" and I was following her around since I really value my privacy,(worst that's on there is causal porn) I wasn't hurting her or anything I was just asking for my shit and she threatened to call the bloody cops

Speaking of how I really value privacy I like hiding under the covers alot, not to jack off or anything I just feel safe under a blanket, and she thinks I'm some sort of fucking sex addict, also she took my door off the damn hindges like the bitch from freaky friday as a punishment which made me feel like I couldn't even breathe, it was the worst feeling I've felt before, it was just vile.


I dont think my mom's a bad person, sometimes she can be a very nice person and she is quite generous, I just really think she needs therapy, well maybe she's just nice from the edibles which she does (I dont care but I found some edibles snacks in a draw of hers, I haven't told anyone it just kind of messed with me).

I rather not relay the entire info again since every time I try to describe what happened, either verbally or through text, I seem to just want to cry and push life away from me, but, long depressing story short:

 I got kicked out of my mom's apartment due to a terrible argument that I can't exactly remember. I think it was about something petty. I walked to my Uncle's house that was an hour and a half walk away from me. I just met him a couple of days prior to this event. 30 mins in, my mom tried to get me to get in her car so we can get back home, but I was done with her. Fast forward, I was at my uncle's place. It was around 1 am, so it took a second for him to get to the door. He never even opened the door to talk to me. He never let me stay the night. The rest of what happened was even more depressing.

 I dont know how to deal with them. I dought that I will ever talk to my Uncle again, but every day I just kept wishing he would reach out to me via email, but he never did. He said that we could hang out again after the holidays were over. Since that event happened, I kinda pushed it out of mind just so I can deal with my mom. I am 16, almost 17, so i dont have much of a choice. I just have to stick it out till its over, but I just want to leave. I wish had family or friends to stay with, but I dont. The rest of my family I dont talk to, and I dont have friends that can house me. My Uncle was the first person in my family that I reached out to who was not said to be 100% awful by my mother. 

I have not fully processed the events of the night. I dont think I should for a while. Not until I can at least leave them.

393,"Hi everyone. So right now I’m working a job at a call center. I do customer service and I hate it. Not just normal dread of going to work, like crying nightly and panic attack almost daily before I have to go in. For starters I can’t handle people yelling at me like they do. It happens constantly with people screaming at me and personally insulting me for things I have no control over.

396,"Firstly i must give some background information. In the country that i live, after graduating High school you must take an exam to enroll in a Uni.

 I wanted to be Computer/Software engineer since i was a little kid. I remember i was 4-5 y/o when i was amused by Contra, Mario and Nekketsu Kakutou Densetsu. Later on we had computer in household and that was the time i realized that both PC and Console games are programmed in same station etc. etc... 

 Fast forward to High school, until then i was actually successful kid but a Cocky one. So i wanted to change. I changed dramatically and started not giving a shit about grades. I had suffered from OCD and i lacked motivation so i started taking meds (I don't take meds no more i think  i am clean). Everything passed and it was the last year of HS. I hopped on the trend of Distance Education so that i can prepare for the Uni Exam better. In fact i was going too good. In the place i was preparing for i was at TOP 10 at some point but i fucked it up. At the end i couldn't enroll in Computer Science program. Instead of preparing for another year i decided to enroll in Automotive Engineering program. Because i did not want my family to spend money again for the courses.

 Now i have exams because i have failed 3 classes (Math, Physics, Chemistry).I can not study for the reason of I lack the motivation. When i thought about being SE i always thought of ideas but now, i don't have any for AE. I don't want to move from this program because Computer Science is getting crowded nowadays. And here i can go abroad easier. I don't know what to do basically. I feel like there is something i am missing but i don't know, can you guys help me ?

397,"I feel really conflicted. I recently moved up north, from FL, to live with better and healthier family. Due to this, I’m having to maintain on and off friendships with people from Florida via ft, snap or text. I’ve done this before a couple years ago because for one grade, I did live here. While I was here, I made friends with a group of girls. At the time, I suppose we clicked but I hardly remember the year or anything we really together honestly. I was in a dark place, my friendships weren’t really top priority at the time. Which is maybe where a lot of bitterness sprouts from, but I’ve definitely tried to clear that up the best I could. Upon my return, I reconnected with the leftovers of that group and hopped in like nothing happened. There was still some grudges from very misunderstood information that I cleared up, or tried to, but I’m finding that I just don’t click with these people. It can come from all of being stressed and “not finding time” but with my best of friends in the past, you ALWAYS found time. You know? In between this or that class or for a few hours once a week AT LEAST. Just something but it’s like everyone had their own agenda and his plans from one another because of some dumb ass shit talk, which everyone part took in or was the target. It’s a bit toxic in general but they’re also all very PG and spineless, in some ways. They have their traits but I think they tend to be complete opposites to my personality, and it clashes in the worst way possible. 

Everything points at making new friends and branching out, which wouldn’t be so hard if this town didn’t have a high school population of 500. This could obviously be worse but if everyone has grown up together and has their perception of me, there’s always this lack of interest after initially meeting “someone new”. And, honestly, from both sides. Some people I just observe and have a general idea of how they interact with others, if I overhear a lot of jokes I’d have to fake laugh at then I obviously don’t want to interact with you very much. Not their fault, just not my humor. I feel like there isn’t a lot of people I can click with in the spaces and times I’m given at school. Sure there’s got to be SOMEONE but, maybe there’s no chance of me interacting with them anytime soon? I’m hoping college will be a good step in my rather pathetic social life but... I don’t know... what if I’m doing something wrong? And ruin it for myself in the future?

399,"hi all, i’m a little stressed because i recently got hired to work at a juice bar and today was my first day. it’s a really easy and basic job but it’s not really what i thought i was getting into. 

today was my first day and i feel like i learned the majority of the job- it’s that easy. juicing, blending, prepping, cashiering, washing. the catch is that there’s usually 1 employee on at a time and that’s kinda difficult to manage all by yourself. i’m not really sure why i expected that i’d be getting to chat with customers but i basically spent the whole day in the back by myself. that being said, if i wanted to wash dishes all day i would’ve applied somewhere else to be a busser. i guess it was bold to assume there’d be split labor among workers but if there’s no one to split it with, that’s not possible. 

aside from not knowing what the job was going to be like, the management is shakey. red flags appeared in the interview process as the district manager kept flaking, rescheduling, and failing to communicate with me. i have her the benefit of the doubt since she explained to me that she’s bouncing between 3 stores 40 miles apart in her region that all lack managers and that she’s only been at it for a month. that being said, she told me she’d be there to train me on my first shifts, but i was left all alone on my first shift (8hours). 

another red flag was that she failed to ignore my requests for scheduling. i’m a full time student taking overloaded classes and i asked to start with 12-15hrs a week to see how i manage w school and can adjust from there. she scheduled me 25 in my first week and after my first 8, i’m dreading going back. after this week, i don’t exactly want to return, but since that’s such a brief amount of time, i have no idea to go about leaving. i don’t even have an employee ID or done any official on-boarding, so it feels like i just did some volunteer work or something. but at the same time, since i never got through training, might as well leave before i get through it, right? 

tldr; i didn’t know all the details of my new position and it sucks. i thought i would get to be social and this juice bar has me isolated for long shifts. also lacking management (there are literally 3 stores without a manager and mine is one of them) get me out of here.",21Jan2020,1

As days went by my coworkers picked up on the fact that he was hanging out with me at work more and more. I didn't know about this until my coworker told me he's making a move and asked if I like him. I ended up saying yes but I told the rest of them no since I wasn't super close with the rest. They continued to say ""you're so beautiful, of course he likes you!!"" ""You guys look so cute together!"" And  the word got around. I could not control the smile on my face whenever his name was mentioned. But the fact that he would like me made me become really nervous around him and I fucked up so hard.

All through the relationship she felt bad for not being able to facetime me enough because she had to study a shit load or was spending time with her family. Every time I told her to put her education and family before me and shed always talk about how I'm do great compared to her other boyfriends and shes saying I'm like every other shotty guy shes been with 

I've came to the conclusions she makes judgements way too quickly based off less than enough information to make assumptions but all I can do is remember her voice and our conversations and feel a mix of anger and sadness. I just dont know what the fuck to do. My mental health is worse off and I cant get a therapist. I just feel lost but stupid for feeling like this over a girl 

I admit I fucked up in the relationship but it does not excuse the shit she has said and did aswell",21Jan2020,1

I have this friend and they’re kinda the first friend I’ve ever really had, I’ve been more open with them than anybody else I’ve ever met. We usually talk in the early morning’s before I go to work. The problem is that I feel like I’ve lost any semblance of control, I used to never cry. Now I cry throughout most of the early morning, if we aren’t talking. I mean the only thing I look forward to is talking with them. I don’t like this at all, I miss not spending hours before work balling my eyes out.

411,"My best friend decided that she no longer wants to be friends with me. 

A few weeks ago she started a huge fight with me to the point where she ignored me for a week. We work together so she’d just ignore me at work..The fight was literally over nothing and after we talked she admitted that she just got over stressed with life and work and took it out on me. I thought we’d go back to normal but we went from hanging out every day to not having hung out in a month. I tried bringing it up with her but she pretended that nothing was wrong. Told me she had no idea where my  questions were coming from. 

She constantly ignored my texts and made me feel crazy for bringing up the fact that we just weren’t like we used to be. I would make plans with her and she’d canceled last minute. I don’t have a lot of people in my life and I’ve known this friend for over a year she has been there for me a lot. I’ve told her things I haven’t told anyone she was someone I trusted the most.

Yesterday she finally texted me and told me what was up. She said she was done with me and that it wasn’t anything I did. She said I wasn’t a bad friend but that she only hung out with me when she was feeling “blah” and now she’s going to the gym and shit and she’s not feeling that way anymore. She says she’s more positive now. 

I got really upset and I went off becuase she had been telling me nothing was wrong for weeks and just blindsided me by saying she hasn’t wanted to deal with me since “our fight”. She told me I was acting like a crazy ex boyfriend. She said that I needed to calm down and that the way I was feeling wasn’t normal. 

I don’t understand why I’m so sad and angry is it normal to feel this way? I trusted and loved the shit out of her but not in a romantic way or anything like that. I straight up feel broken because I literally have no one now. Am I really crazy is she right? I don’t even know what to do at this point. Can somebody please help me.",21Jan2020,1
412,"So i’ve met this girl on tinder and we’ve been talking for about a month. I’ve asked her out twice and although she had valid excuses to not go, she rejected me.

A couple days go we were texting like we do pretty much all the time, and she said how she wishes she could be mean like her sister instead of too nice like she is (which she is). I stupidly responded “yeah you are too nice like when you let me down easy.” At the time i didn’t think it was dumb to say until a couple seconds after i sent it.

Anyways, we we’re on that topic and she was saying how it’s not that she doesn’t care for me it’s because she doesn’t allow herself to be loved because then she gets too attached and doesn’t know how to be apart she doesn’t want to have to rely on anyone. She also says how she ends up getting hurt so she’s scared of that happening so she basically doesn’t allow this. She also said she feels bad because i’m super nice.

Within the past month she knows i’ve always been there for her, and she’s also been there for me, which makes me like her even more. I’m honestly fine with her being the way that she is as long as i’m with her if that makes sense?

I'm 16 im a girl and I met this guy on instagram we've been talking for almost 4 months now..  He's 21 and he doesn't know I'm 16. I don't look 16 I've been told I look 20s. So he haven't really asked. I really really like this guy we relate on like everything he's 100% PERFECT. He's hot, he's kind, we relate on everything. He's my  ideal man.  

But I haven't told him I'm 16 yet. He hasn't asked and I don't want to tell him because I don't want to scare him away because of some stupid legal number. It's totally dumb 16 is the age of consent so is that ok ? Like can i meet him ? I really want to meet him irl but he wants to take things slow and just gay bro know each other. More first because of a break up he was in. 

I've been crying for like 3 hours now because I feel really bad for not telling him how old i am but I just don't think I can I don't want to hurt him or get him in trouble  because he just got over I really bad breakup where some stupid bitch cheated on him and idk what to do I just can't hurt him I literally love him I could be with him forever.  i just can't hurt his feeling and idk what to do. 

16 is the age of consent in the us so we could at least date or meet right ? Idk how he sould feel about me if I told him I was 16. So idk if I want to meet up yet irl I just really like him and don't want to hurt him again I can't do it I feel terrible for not telling him.

I can't quit crying im just really worried I'm going to lose him and I just can't let that happen can someone give me advice please I really don't want to hurt him. And I feel really bad like I've catfish him or something. He's the sweetest and hottest guy ever He's the only man I feel like has ever actually cared for me. 

I was thinking maybe if I just stall him for like 2 years until I'm 18 he won't be as mad when I tell him ? I mean I have to tell him eventually but I just really can't lose him please give me some advice idk what to do please give me good advice",21Jan2020,1
414,"I feel extreme guilt for something I did. I am 18 almost 19 years old. And I had developed a sexual attraction towards my mother when I was younger. At the age of 15 I ended up groping my mother. On top of this, I would do things like go through her underwear drawers. masturbate with her underwear, wear her clothes while she was gone, take inappropriate pictures of her without her knowing, spy on her in the shower, and listen to her have sex. I got caught spying on her in the shower at the age of 17. Ever since then I’ve stopped doing these things. And now I hate the person I used to be. I was sick in the head. And I don’t ever see myself doing any of those things again with anyone.

Anyways, now I feel extremely guilty. I apologized but I can’t ever forgive myself. I just can’t live like this. Not only that but I’m afraid my mother will report to the authorities what happened. I know I deserve it, but I can’t handle it. Either way I can’t live like this. I didn’t even deserve to be born in the first place.

416,"I had a baby 3 months ago, and there were complications so now I'm left disabled, hopefully temporarily, but docs aren't sure. Now I live with my parents and little sisters again, and they have to help me with even the simplest of things. I can't walk, pick up my baby, get my own food, change her diaper, or do anything besides sit, hold, and feed her. It feels like I had a baby, but I just have to watch as everyone else raises her. 

I was trying to be positive through all of this, but it's proving difficult. Everyone else goes to sleep at 10, but I'm typically up till 3 or 4am, because I can't sleep. I just get sad at night. I feel so pushed down by the world, and that there's nothing I can do to get back up. 

I love my baby. I love every second I get to hold her. But other than her, and my family helping out, I really haven't had any other human interaction in months. I can't get out of the house too well, and our house is too small for guests. I miss being able to do things, and talking to people, and taking care of myself. I want to experience taking care of my baby, and all of her needs, but I can't and I hate it. I feel like such a burden to everyone around me.

I don't really know what advice I'm looking for. I just needed to talk, and this is an anon account so I can talk without my friends or family seeing and judging. 

Do any of you guys have similar stories, or situations? What helped? How can I try to get out of this hole? Today was the first day I felt empty, and lacked interest to do anything but cry, and I really don't want to go down that hole with my baby. Any advice would be appreciated.

Sidenote- for those who may be concerned, I have never had thoughts of injuring myself or anyone else, and my baby's needs are always taken care of, even if not by me. No matter how down I'm feeling, I know my baby comes first, and I'd never let anything put her at risk, especially not me. We are surrounded by love and support from my family, I just still feel alone, and like a burden.

417,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old biological dude who over the course of two years and one abusive relationship gained 40 pounds. I got depressed after being cheated on and lost all interest in most activities that I enjoyed. The one thing that gave me dopamine was exercise, and I managed to lose 20 pounds very quickly. Ive possibly lost even more since the last time I weighed myself because I stopped eating and exercising for a bit. I’ve got my jawline back, my face looks healthier, I have actual abs etc. (although I lost those kind of quickly after I stopped eating and now I’m just kinda scrawny but it’s better than fat imo) I’d like to continue to be able to devote myself to fitness while also having more room in my schedule. If I reach a state of physical fitness that I am happy with for my own well being what kind of things would I need to do to become a personal trainer? Do I need to take any college level courses to get a license or anything? Do I need to go through any agency or anything? I also don’t intend to make it a long term career, just a source of income I enjoy that allows me to make connections with clients and such, as my main goal is to become a chef and own my own restaurant.

I am big on watching movies, so that occupies my time. But at night, I feel that should be husband and wife time. I make dinner, we have a conversation about the day, etc... But he eats his dinner whole watching whatever. I just kinda sit there (o try not to watch stuff when I'm eating) and wish he would realize I want to just talk and enjoy our meal. I've mentioned it already to him before, but he didn't seem to worried or concerned. Once dinner is done and it's past midnight, I get ready to go to bed. But he starts gaming with his buddies until 2 or 3. I have asked numerous times if we can go to bed together and cuddle. He says ""but I'm gaming right now"".

423,"So , I like to draw.

I often carry sketchbooks around with me at school. 
I draw and often complete my homework on one page and on another one sketch a drawing.

People (teachers and kids) very often stop to look around and admire my things and gather around like a small crowd , which makes me really happy. 

They often congratulate me on such things and tell me I should keep it up, and that motivates me immensely. 
I’m just extremely grateful.

But there’s this one girl in my class. 
She just started drawing a while ago. 
She absolutely despises me. 

She always finds something to nitpick on me , whether that’s me sitting on a bench, saying hello to her or whatever she finds to say. 

It’s very petty and immature, honestly.

The thing is, all my classmates are like this. Gossiping machines that find nothing interesting in their lives other than getting into others’ problems or making drama , and this girl is spreading these kinds of things about me for some reason.

I really don’t want to care about other students’ opinion though. Only teachers’ advice counts for me, I want to be a teacher, too.

But I fear that this might get spread around everywhere like she always succeeds to do, as she also is the class representative and can communicate with the teachers about it (another petty thing to do).

But mostly, don’t all artists draw for attention in a way? You don’t just keep your message around to yourself.

427,"I’m a senior in high school and am hoping to move out of state for college. I’ve wanted to move out of my town for a very long time, as well as wanting to get away from my family for personal reasons. Basically, it’s just not a good environment for me to be in. College is my only way out. Without college, I wouldn’t have enough money to be stable while living on my own. I also don’t have a job that pays well enough to give me the money I need to live away from home. College would give me a reason to leave, and even though I really want to go to college, leaving this state is my biggest motive for actually wanting to go. I’ve done some rough calculations and it seems that going to school where I want would cost roughly 100k for all 4 years (including room and board). Honestly, I can’t afford that. I’m ok with leaving school with around 10k-20k in student loans, but I can’t have more than that. My parents keep trying to convince me to stay in state for a year or two so I would be able to leave without loans. I don’t want to get too much into it, but staying here just isn’t an option for me. To put it simply, being here, being around these people, being so secluded, makes me depressed. I dread being here, and I need to get out. 

I found an app called scholly which helps make the scholarship process become a lot more simple. Aside from that, what are ways that I can reduce the expenses of going to college? 

Either way, I’ll be 18, so I can legally go against what my parents want, and just go. But I don’t want to create more tension than there already is in my family. I just want my parents to be ok with me going to school. I want my parents to be happy for me, and proud of me. They don’t want me to leave because 1.) they think I need more time to mature and 2.) They don’t want me to be in debt. I think if I can scrape together enough money to at least ensure I’ll be leaving with less than 20k in debt, they will be ok with me leaving.

So I left the Corps thinking I could live a better life with this woman and my family who love me, also with the big conclusion that I doubt our involvement with other country’s such as the whole Iraq war, Afghan, etc. I didn’t want to die questioning my sacrifice to this country, but maybe I’m wrong and overthinking.

Anyway, my supervisor tell me to go to her supervisor to help out, so I'm throwing stuff off a conveyor belt onto another. She's like 3 belts down from me and I heard her kinda shout stop, and started calling out random names like she was trying to get someones attention. I saw her looking over at me for a few seconds from my peripherals but felt awkward at that point so I just kept going, maybe I was throwing off the wrong stuff.




After that, the supervisor asked me to do that same in the trailer she was in. So as I came over there she was like "" what's your name again?? Lol "" I told her, and she was like "" I called you every name book, I'm sorry lol ""  After that I saw a box on the floor and picked it up, put it on the belt at a bad angle and it started flipping around and she looked at me and pointed past me and was playfully like "" see what you did?? Lol "" So I fixed it and laughed. So she went back in her trailer to finish unloading, a guy friend of hers was in there ( I dont know if she's single but I do know they are just friends ) so I was looking in the there direction to see which boxes needed to be taken off and for some reason I kept seeing her glance at me briefly and say stuff ( I couldn't hear )  and her friend would kinda turn around and grin or chuckle. I dont know if I was being roasted or seriously insulted or what. I do have the tendency to zone out alot so maybe it was that? She wasn't  smiling or laughing nor was she giving me dirty looks she just had a neutral expression. I started to feel a little self conscious, but I didn't show it. After a while she said "" I'm so sorry honey were almost done unloading the truck. I was kinda confused, but my eyes were blood shot and I get told I look upset eventhough I'm not so perhaps that was it, Idk. I felt like she was trying to be funny and felt made fun of. Afterwards when we finished  as I was getting my water bottle she said something and then faced towards me and asked if I was ok, so I said yeah and she asked why my eyes were red, so I told her it was my contact lenses, and she was like oh just rinse them out in the bathroom, do you have your container and solution with you and I said I left them at home lol, she then face palms, smiles, shakes her head and walked away. So in my head I was like ooooh k then.. ""



After that I worked in a trailer with her guy friend, he seemed pretty cool, and asked how long I been working there and etc. We say whats up to eacother during passing.

There was a time when I came in, she's part of the safety committee and when it was my turn in line she grabbed my hand from my side to put the needle in, and was trying to place my fingers on it ( I dont think she was flirting she probably was making sure no one was poked ) and I was kinda nervous and wasn't grasping the needle and was like "" grab it lol! "" I laughed and then I had to pop a balloon and answer a safety question, so I did and forgot a few of em and then she made me repeat it. As I was saying the answers I kinda had a nervous smile and she kinda smiled to.


Other time, she was talking to my supervisor and I came up to him waiting for him to say what to do next. I noticed she was looking at me, not smiling but had a pleasant expression on her face. I was about to look at her and say hi but she looked off and looked back again when I was talking to my supervisor.

Our last interaction, pretty similar. I'm in her area to help out, and I see her talking to her supervisor and I approach him to get further instructions, then she asked to see my water bottle ( I have the one that keeps the water cool ) as I was talking to her supervisor I see her fiddling around with it, looking confused trying push the buttons, after I was done talking and the supervisor walked off she asked what the button did,  so I explained it but was kinda nervous so I didn't speak to loud and she kinda leaned in and was like "" ok say that again lol "" and I did and she was like oh ok your fancy "". Later on I go to the bay door wait for the truck back in, and she walks up and I see her looked at me from my peripherals for a split second so I turn to her and she says "" Ok like so how are you just going to come here and steal my truck lol? "" So I said the supervisor told me to be here lool "" and she said something else I forgot and  I felt awkward and just smiled and looked away from her and she was like "" I'm just messing with you, I like talking shit lol. "" I helped her pick up a box with a blade sticking out and she told me to be careful. Then another co worker of hers came and she started talking to her.



I'm kinda confused by her, she seems pretty outgoing and social and definitely not shy, I see her trash talking her friends sometimes. We rarely are around eacother though, but I notice she never says hi to me or anything but does to others. She never really has though, only time she talks to me was when I was in her area helping out, but if we pass eacother she never greets, or looks my way, but I never greet her either.

I’ve been trying to change myself instead of giving in since a long time which works for a while but then I get back to depression and then to insanity. It’s just a cycle that I want out but I don’t have any help from anyone so I can be happy after changing myself for the better. I always question myself but lately I’ve been looking towards religion like Buddhism. Sorry for writing too much but I’m still not sure if it’s a good idea to post this even if I got nothing to lose.",21Jan2020,1
434,"I'm 17 (f) and I live in California. My dad is verbally abusive and financially manipulating. My mom has refused to leave him over and over regardless of the things he says about her or me, but in the recent months he's been owing her a bunch of money for rent and car payments because he has a bad habit of gambling all his money away. I finally got through to my mom we can't keep living like this, so she's looking for a new house to rent. If you didn't know, California is the most expensive state to live in the U.S. and rent just keeps going up. My mother works minimum wage to try and support the family because of my dads constant unstable construction jobs. I'm worried that once my dad pays her back the money, she'll go soft on him again and say we shouldn't move, or that even if we do move he will continue to bother us and harass her for money. He has always been controlling of us, and when I was younger I didn't understand why he would always throw tantrums at me for the smallest mistakes, but now I know it's all about gaining power through fear. Since high school started, I've spiraled into a negative state of mind where I've lost all motivation for anything. I had straight A's all throughout middle school, and had no problem with academics. Once high school started I started to feel dumber, and my dad would constantly tell me how useless and unworthy I am, going to school just to come home and ""fool around on that phone"". I started skipping classes and didn't care about how it'd affect me. My grades kept dropping for the past 3 years and when I applied to colleges my GPA was around a 2.5? I realize how stupid it was to let go of myself and just lounge around like a sack of potatoes, but there's no turning back time. I'm 99% sure I'm going to be stuck in community college for 2 years and then get accepted to a mediocre university if it all goes well. This isn't the path I want for myself though, I just don't feel like anything interests me, and my parents refuse to let me get a job. So moving out once I turn 18 is impossible, I'd have no one to rely on and no where to go. I'm sick of always feeling like I have nothing going for me in the future, and I just want to get out of this miserable house. I often cry myself to sleep thinking how it would all be different if I was born as someone with a better family or if I was smart enough to get a high paying job right after high school. I can't handle being yelled at and controlled for every little thing I try to do in life, I barely have friends or a personality due to his brainwashing. Ultimately, I could've done better if I tried but now it feels like I'm too far down the rabbit hole. I just want to start living, and for myself, not for how other people want me to live. What can I do? Is community college even worth it? 2 more years of boring subjects in class and listening to my dad say that I'm trash compared to my brother. If I were to get a job with no experience once I turn 18 will anyone hire me?? I wish I just strike a gold mine, money would solve 99 if not 100% of my problems. I used to think that if I killed myself then all of this would go away, but I want something more than this. When will my life really begin??",21Jan2020,1
435,"Hey, I’m a 17 year old girl and in May 2019 I found the band Hatari, which I have absolutely fallen in love with since. I booked tickets a few months ago for a concert they’re having in a week and a half on their tour, with the intent of goint with someone, but she cancelled a few days ago, so I gotta go at it alone. 

I’m really nervous to say the least. 1. this will be my first real concert, 2. it’ll be my favourite band and 3. it’ll be some of the most intense music I’ve ever heard. I’m also going to a meet and greet with the band after the concert, which I am obviously really nervous for too! I also have anxiety and I get anxiety easily in new spaces with new people and stuff. 

How do I prepare for this? I rlly wanna do it, but I have to be as ready as possible yk? How do I not uh faint lol when I meet the band? I’m rlly nervous about it cus idk if my anxiety will take over and make me break down cus of overwhelming emotions (not cus of anything bad, just overstimulation). Any advice?",21Jan2020,1
436,"I’ll keep it simple, here are the main things  that have been nagging my mind alot:

- it makes me so sad that nearly everyone I know has gone/is going through some trauma, is depressed, has any mental health issues/mentally unstable and it just makes me think about how much we have been failed as humans. I know that there probably is no solution to everyone being depressed, but surely everyone wasn’t this sad 50 years ago. I am 16 and have friends who are suicidal, crazy anxiety, depression, they cut themselves, their parents have been abusive/neglecting, had such rough childhoods and still are. I myself have been struggling with my mental health, but I feel like I have no one stable enough to talk to, because they are only just coping themselves.

- I don’t know why but I just get really sad (sadder than normal) whenever I read something about animals dying, or terrorist attacks, or anything to do with death/destruction of environment or even when I hear about my younger brothers’ friends who are being bullied at school. I just can’t help but feel so sad about everything, nothing used to bother me as much but just before I was about to cry because I saw a life insurance advertisement where the son was talking about his dad. I just question whether we as humans really deserve to live, with all the horrible things we do, It just makes me sick.

I just feel so hopeless, lost, and stuck. The only thing that is keeping me alive is my love for space. In the future I want to make a difference for humanity in space, potentially even work under Elon Musk. Space travel is my main interest, and so I want to be an Aerospace Engineer. I don’t even care about myself, I just want to do something for humanity. But even then, I’m not even sure that humans deserve to occupy space. 

Is this just a phase? I’m not really sure what to think about it all but I just can’t stand anything anymore. Any advice on what to do, any insights or opinions are appreciated, thankyou.",21Jan2020,1
437,"Hi so Long story short I have a small online store with a friend and we hand make earrings. So for Valentine’s Day we wanted to do something to launch during the season and we decided we were going to do bouquets of flowers together with our earrings. However when I was at the florist I had an idea to do floral hoops which I think were a better idea than conventional bouquets. 
This is where it gets tricky. My friend had done floral hoops before and she mentioned that she wants to start a business with it but hasn’t done so. So i suggested hey why not we do floral hoops instead, and she was like she dosent wanna mix “her” floral hoops business with this earrings business . In a way she is telling me I can’t design floral hoops and sell them. 
But she hasn’t started anything. 
Obviously I wouldn’t want bad blood, but I think it is absurd how she claims the business to be her own when she hasn’t even started anything. 
I am thinking Of talking to her about this but I can’t think clearly at the moment now, any advice on how to solve this in most amiable way?",21Jan2020,1
438,"Ok, a bit of background. I am in my first relationship ever, and so is she. We both go to the same college and other than the sex aspect of it, our relationship is great.
The three times we tried she was experiencing a lot of pain with the penetration and so I didn’t go any further. But the fourth time I felt as if it were my fault. I can’t seem to keep my erection long enough to put on the condom, and I can’t seem to stay hard in the condom either, like if I’m not doing anything sensual with her my erection just instantly goes away. This has happened the last 4 times we tried, it hasn’t been hard enough, but 3 of those times she was also experiencing pain. 
The thing is, I know from just being a guy having boners from time to time, and things like the morning wood, that I am physically capable of sustaining an erection for a while, yet it doesn’t happen with her. I’ve tried to get comfortable with condoms and even masturbated into one to get over any kind of block that I had with them, but it still seemed to do very little. 
It’s worth mentioning that I do watch porn and masturbate to it. Before I went to college and met her I’d do that pretty regularly.
I still do it somewhat regularly 

But yeah, I’m not sure what to do about this because this is stressing me out.",21Jan2020,1
439,"Some background context: My girlfriend and I have been together for a year and 3 months. We met last year in college and due to unforeseen events, we had to live together in a dorm 3 months into our relationship (we’re gay). Things were amazing for the first year. She was the reason I wanted to wake up everyday and it was great being roommates since we’d always be together. We transferred to a different school (she also wanted to transfer &amp; decided to apply to the same school as me). We had to live our first-year at our new school in a dorm so here we are, roommates again. 

Looking back at last year, I was in a terrible mental state. I was depressed and super stressed due to college athletics, academics, and some family emergency events. Especially being a freshman, balancing those 3 were super difficult. My coach was really hard on the team and it would lower my self esteem. Now that I’m out of that environment, I am starting to lose feelings for my girlfriend. I’m not sure if the reason I fell for her last year is due to me being lonely and wanting love from somebody for my own mental reasons. I have no appeal to having sexual interactions with her and we argue or have small bickering on a daily basis. 

I don’t know what to do since we still have 4 more months of living together in a college dorm. Do I end it and look for alternate living options? Do I bite my tongue and say nothing?

What do I do?

TLDR: Girlfriend and I live together in a college dorm for another 4 months but I have lost feelings for her. I don’t know what to do.",21Jan2020,1

441,"Hey reddit 

This is going to be a long post so get ready to read a lot! 

I’m a mid 20sF of south Asian descent. I was raised rather conservatively. Actually... very conservatively. I was born and raised in the west but all my schooling, after schooling, and weekend schooling was geared towards conservative studies making me more eastern than western. My mom was a housewife and my dad was a business. Both fairly successful in their community and both had a pretty good reputation as well. Very well known and well liked. I was the oldest of 4 sisters but second in sibling line to my brother. But given my south Asian culture, I was basically the eldest child. 

Growing up, I faced a few obstacles. Victim of child sexual molestation couple of times (fucked up culture norms), forced to wear the hijab, raped as a teen, so on so on. I don’t know if those things shaped me... I guess they did. I was a fairly smart kid. Always top of the class, loved to read since I wasn’t ever allowed out, and quite artsy. When I reached college, I had no idea what to do with the newfound freedom. I went wild. Fuck studying. Crazy party and drugs. Slept around a lot. Left my super conservative religion. I quickly became heavily addicted to weed (yes, it’s possible. Just ask a chronic weed smoker to quit for a month and see what they say). Towards the end of college, I met my fiancé and quickly realized I really needed help. I went to a couple of therapists but I never clicked with them. I could pick apart all therapists and critique them one by one but at the end of the day, I just wasn’t ready to change. My final grades were okay. I was smart. I got by. I did the typical hard south Asian major, didn’t do amazingly well because I hated it, but at least I earned a hard degree (yay me...) 

I graduated. Fell into depression severely because life back home was actually more horrible than I remembered. I gained 30 lbs. Then my dad had a heart attack. Not because I gained weight though. Goodness, idk how I survived that. I’ve had a debilitating fear of his death since I was a child because he’d use his death as a way to make me do what he wants. He doesn’t mean it. He’s just broken emotionally. I guess weed helped me. I was super suicidal but never acted on it. I’d never. I don’t have the guts. My fiancé and family wouldn’t be able to live afterwards. Life’s hard though... my dads fine now thankfully. I worked in my major for two years. Went to therapy at the same time. Quit my addiction. Great money. Super shitty job. I moved out with my fiancé. Didn’t tell my parents. Then we got engaged and religiously married. My parents now know. They love my fiancé even though he’s not from the same religion. 

Fiancé is making decent pay so I left my job to join my dads business but I’m having difficulty adjusting. I don’t have motivation. I don’t have the same pay. I’m worried about failing. I think I might be depressed. Having a hard time getting out of bed. Lots of crying. Been losing weight. Lots of unhealthy thoughts. 

I’ve been stressed. Paying for a wedding. Switching jobs. Not knowing what job I want in life. Paralyzed with fear of failure. Low self esteem. Inability to cope with hardship. Worries of the unknown. The list is endless. I feel like a failure. People with worse make something of themselves. But I have a lot and I haven’t been able to do anything. 

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just not cut out for life. Maybe I’m too lazy too dumb too insecure too something. Idk. It’s hard. But is it really hard? Idk. I keep comparing myself to my former classmates. I don’t have social media of my own but LinkedIn is the death of my self esteem. Goodness. 

I guess I just want advice from people who went through a rough patch and made it through. Or I guess I wanna know if this is just how life is and I have to grow up and face it. I probably left out a lot of life details but I said enough to paint somewhat of a picture. 

TLDR: my life was hard but not as hard as most people had it. I somewhat made it out but now I’m heavily depressed and paralyzed with fear. Idk how to keep going. Need advice.",21Jan2020,1

443,"Hi all. Quick background before I start. Also it's gonna be a long one!

I F23 have been with my company for 16 months, the first three of which were spent in another country training as it is a graduate program. When I started I was told they were branching out into my country and had a couple employees but wanted to start some graduates off. I was also told my countries market was ready for this company and many projects would be soon underway.

Important to note - employee's are booked on projects by program managers and when you're not on a project you should be doing some form of independent learning

Cut to today, I began working in the office here to realise nobody in my country uses it and I had the option to work from home instead so I took it. If I had know this before I wouldn't have wasted 6 months rent living in a much pricier area because I thought I had to be in the office. 

There has been some minor support work I have done for existing clients in my country but  nothing to the extent of a 'full project' while the one project I have been booked on is based in the other country so I've travelled over and back a few times. (this project has been going on for 11 months) Except before Christmas the work started to dwindle and we were waiting for the client to get back to us so my 'billable' booked time has gone down to 1-2 days a week if I'm lucky and is looking to be the same for the foreseeable. On top of that the lead is retiring and expecting me to take everything on once that happens which as a junior I know I cannot do.

Around November I was scheduled to start a new project (wahoo) which kept getting pushed out until this week. I spoke with my manager about it and she said to just wait it out instead of looking for new work as the project would start soon. Well this week it began and turns out they need a Finance junior, which I am not. So I'm basically in the shit even though I have proof of trying to work I have barely any billable hours to my name. I'm working from home without any human contact and it's really getting to me, I'm feeling more depressed than ever and it just sucks.

Here's the kicker - why don't you just quit? Well a few people from the program have done so and we're hit with a snag in our contract claiming if we leave before we've been employed for 5 years! then we have to pay a fee for all the training and expenses etc. which for the last two graduates has been around 6k, approx 3 months wages for me. My bf wants to move to the US and start something new which I'm all for but 6k on top of Visa application fees and starting a new life in a new place means money will be a major issue.

After typing it all out it's kind of a no brainer that I have to quit but I'd love to hear some other perspectives if anyone has any.

Thanks all",21Jan2020,1

452,"I have been trolling and annoying people, both in real life and on the Internet, for a long time. I started doing it as a kid to help with the circumstances I was in, a combination of being alienated by everyone at school and puberty. I have also been occasionally tryharding to get a cringe reaction, which I used to find humorous, but now I find it cringe and stupid myself.

I am now a young adult and, although I have improved and am under way better circumstances, where this behaviour is completely unnecessary, it stayed with me and I am finding it more and more cumbersome. It makes the life of those around me harder, and I feel like I am weighing them down. That, in end of itself, is exactly the opposite of what I'm trying to be. I understand that it's impossible to not be a pain at least sometimes, but I feel like my behaviour is unnecessarily cumbersome to everyone, including myself.

I do martial arts(which gave me the ability to be mature at least sometimes) and I have considered joining the military, as I've been told that it helps people become mature, but I can't do that due to medical issues.

I've been told to simply stop caring about it, as those who can't accept me the way I am can't actually be my friends, but I don't think that's right. I'm trying to improve, and this is the main thing I find that keeps me back.

453,"Ok, so long story short. I took my girlfriend on vacation with me to my other side of the family in South Africa.

Fast forward to the last day of the trip I go downstairs at 1am to find them in bed together. Now she swears sex didn't happen and that they only made out. I check her phone to find out that they had been secretly texting eachother behind my back and sleeping together for at least an entire week. She told me not to take the texts out of context that it was only foreplay not sex, of which I'm sure she's lying about. 

The messages also showed how my cousin had been manipulating her into sex from almost the first day we arrived.  When we finally left we all left on a horrible note and I haven't spoken to either of them since. I hate the feeling of tension and know I probably won't be healed one day unless I can find a way to forgive them both, but I really don't know if they're worth it.

Then I find out that season 5 is the final season. I've only watched 1 episode. So, I can either, get it over with and finish it all, stop watching the show and slow come back to it, or very slowly finish the season. I've found out that the less I watch the show, the less interested I'm in it. That could probably help with the regret.

455,"Hey! This is quite an interesting predicament I'm in. In all honestly, it kinda blows that I'm in it. I would have never expected to be in this from the start. But, here we are. For some background, I'm an 18 year old male. 

I've been on and off with girl A, let's call her Annie for months. Annie has had some problems at home and there was plenty of drama. Annie was mentally unstable at the start of the relationship. Of course, I wanted to help her. I ended up giving her advice that she eventually took to become mentally stable and get out of the toxic environment. Annie became very grateful for my help and saw me as her hero. However, we lost touch due to familial issues. I didn't hear from her for three months. I was distraught. However, in the last week, I heard from her again. I was overjoyed. We started dating and everything was great. We usually had drama going on. However, after she made some improvements herself and took my advice, she's stable and focused on wanting to make the relationship work between us. She has some dark secrets, but she left that in the past. 

About two days ago, girl B, let's call her Bonnie, called me. Bonnie was a girl I dated about a year and a half ago. With me, I don't date girls that do weed. (I know) When we started dating, she claimed that she would stop it. She tried to. However, the peer pressure was too much and she started again. After a tumultuous relationship, I broke up with her. She lied often and I disliked it. I got in touch with her about six months after the ordeal because I missed her and wanted to make sure she was okay. She was with another guy at the time so that ended badly. Bonnie decided to call me two days ago after she saw my contact in her phone. We spoke and I wished her the best; since I've become a very chill person compared to the grudge holding dude I used to be. After a while of talking, Bonnie made it clear she still had feelings for me. She wants back with me. 

Annie waited for me those months we couldn't talk for my knowledge. It means a lot that she didn't try to get someone else. 

Bonnie, on the other hand, dated numerous people in the year and a half I wasn't with her and had sex with two other men; all while she claimed to still be thinking of me from time to time. 

Both Annie and Bonnie know me really well. I know both of them rely on me for support in different ways. Annie relies on me because I've always been there to help her through her life and issues; I never gave up on her and she appreciates all the effort. Hence, why she changed how she was totally from the beginning of the relationship. Bonnie is relying on me because she lost everyone she cares about and associates me with the stability she had in the past; as I always made it a point to try taking care of her. 

Both Annie and Bonnie completely changed how they originally were. That's what's making this decision hard. I care about them. I don't want either of them to hurt. You may ask, why not stay with Annie and be Bonnie's friend? Well, Bonnie's dream is to get married and have a family; a dream she has made it clear she wants with me in the future (like hell I'd have kids this early) and that's the only way to her happiness. I have to make a choice between one of them.

What do you guys think I should do? Thanks in advance.",21Jan2020,1
456,"This is something really hard to explain, but basically my boyfriend has been acting strange for a few months (periodically), ever since we went on a holiday together. His behaviour is becoming very strange at times, and sometimes he almost frightens me, as in, I fear there's something wrong with his mental health. 

However - he and lots of his friends work in healthcare, he's been to a therapist, and no one finds him strange at all or thinks his behaviour has changed. He is only strange around me, when we are alone. He doesn't abuse me or anything like that. He just behaves weirdly.

I am wondering if there's something seriously wrong with him or if he's simply turned into a weird human and there's no reason for concern. 

So. Prior to our last holiday a few months ago, we had an awesome relationship for almost 2 years. We've been friends for about a decade and I'd say I know him extremely well. Around 5 years ago, he went to rehab for alcohol addiction and I supported him through it. He stopped drinking. Things went well. We got together two years ago. Last year, he started to have drinks again. In moderation, no getting drunk, just a glass of wine here and there. Everyone was chill about it and supported him, though of course we were keeping an eye on it. But he didn't fall back into addiction, and it seemed he was fine. 

A few months ago, we were about to leave for a holiday together, just me and him, when he had a sudden massive mood swing of sorts. It was completely out of character for him, but he refused when we were supposed to leave for the train station. He said he'd changed his mind and did not feel like going anymore. Then he started unpacking and putting his clothes back into the drawers like nothing had happened. I was dumbstruck. The evening before, he had been just as excited about the holiday as I was. When I tried to talk to him about it, asked what was going on, he - again, very out of character for him - shrugged it off. He said nothing was going on, ""I changed my mind, why can't I just change my mind?"" It felt very odd to me. Tried to pursue the topic further, but he changed the subject every time and I gave up and accepted the fact that he'd changed his mind, for whatever reason. 

Life went on and nothing out of the ordinary happened for a few weeks. Until I got a phone call from him. He'd been in a traffic accident and needed me to come pick him up. When I got there, there was no police, no ambulance, nothing. Just my boyfriend, sitting by the side of the road, and his bike, laying in the middle of the road, no obvious reason for the accident to be seen. I asked him what happened. If he needed to go to the hospital. He firmly denied needing to go to the hospital even though he was bleeding, and he said ""nothing happened."" I told him that was bullshit and that clearly, SOMETHING had happened ... it took a moment but he then admitted that he'd seen the ghost of his mother on street before him, and he'd swerved to avoid her and lost control of his bike. I initially thought he was drunk and hallucinating, but he hadn't had a drink at all. 

After this, he got into several more accidents with his bike, always on his own. The reasons for the accidents were odd. One time, he was waiting at a red light and next thing he knew he was on the street and didn't know how he got there. All the years I've known him before, he's not had a single accident. 

He keeps mentioning talking to his mother. She's been deceased for about 7 years now, and they didn't have the best relationship. He says she's not threatening and he finds her presence peaceful. At this point, I'm completely okay with him talking to the ghost of his mother. That's how crazy our life is. 

When he's on his own, he starts talking. Not to himself; he says he imagines a character in front of him and just plays out their dialogue for both of them. He's not hallucinating; he swears he just likes pretending someone is there. He calls it ""having fun"". When he thinks I can't hear him - like when I'm in another room with headphones on - he likes to sing to himself, only it's not a language anyone can understand. He says he likes to make up his own language.

He's frequently very ... intense towards me, to the point where I have to leave his apartment because it's overwhelming. I've stopped staying nights because the second I lie down to go to sleep, he starts acting up like an overtired, hyper child begging for attention. He doesn't like me sleeping because it means I won't be able to listen to his stories anymore. He talks almost constantly now. He makes stories up but mixes them with the real world so it's sometimes impossible to know what's real and what isn't. 

In all the years I've known him, he's never been like this. I thought surely our friends have noticed this too, but interestingly he doesn't act like this around them at all. Nobody has noticed a change. If I told them how he is at home, they'd think I've completely lost it. At his job, he's also brilliant as usual, and his colleagues haven't noticed any weird behaviour. When I asked him why he's only like this with me, he said it's because he feels safe to be himself around me. And when I pointed out that he's not acting like himself at all, he said ""I've changed.  I don't understand what you do to me. But I feel more free now than I did before, and I'm sorry if I scare you sometimes. I go a little bit mad around you because you let me."" 

I don't know what to do about this /how to handle it at all. He's freaking me out more than a little bit and I'm worried he's officially losing his goddamn mind. 

Do you have any advice for me? Can I help him somehow? He basically says I'm the cause for his strangeness, so I feel like something I do is encouraging him somehow ... what could that be? Do I need to be less understanding? More understanding? Do I need to have him committed to a psych ward? Do I talk to our friends and try to convince them he needs help?",21Jan2020,1

460,"I don’t post a lot so unsure if this is the right place for this, but here goes.
A friend recently send another friend an unused (but still relatively new and good quality) TV through a courier. They said it would take 2-3 days for delivery, but it never arrived. My friend contacted the company but they said give it up to a week. After a week she called back only to be told that it’s been ‘missing’ since collection and that all she can do is put a claim in.
 Now, this was a pretty big TV so we can’t picture it being easy to lose, especially for a company which is designed to move packages, so we heavily suspect it’s been stolen.
 Myself and some other friends have said that she should try to call the police about it and maybe they can investigate a theft, but my friend isn’t sure and thinks the internal claim might be all that she can do. 
 Perhaps it was just lost but if it was stolen, somebody should be held to account. 
So, what would you do, Reddit? Could the police even do anything?",21Jan2020,1
461,"Ok, so long story short. I took my girlfriend on vacation with me to my other side of the family in South Africa. We stayed there for a few weeks and on the last week of our trip I find them making out in one of the bedrooms. This led to a big fight which in turn led to me forgiving them both. Fast forward to the last day of the trip I go downstairs at 1am to find them in bed together. Now she swears sex didn't happen and that they only made out. I check her phone to find out that they had been secretly texting eachother behind my back and sleeping together for at least an entire week. She told me not to take the texts out of context that it was only foreplay not sex, of which I'm sure she's lying about. 

The messages also showed how my cousin had been manipulating her into sex from almost the first day we arrived.  When we finally left we all left on a horrible note and I haven't spoken to either of them since. I hate the feeling of tension and know I probably won't be healed one day unless I can find a way to forgive them both, but I really don't know if they're worth it.

463,"Be prepared for this will be a long tale. My mom died when I was 16, making my sister my effective guardian. We have never been close, and have only ever talked when she needed me to fill something out or I needed her help to pay for something. 
Now that I am 18, I am receiving my half of my mother’s life insurance (~$50k). I’m planning on purchasing a cheap starter home and living with my fiancé (house I’m planning on buying is $27k). After telling my sister this news, she began telling me how I was fucking her by moving out and I had to pay her back for every expense she has made on me (equaling ~$13k). I understand that this was part of her half of the insurance money she was spending on me, but it also seems kind of ridiculous to make me pay for her being my guardian.
Naturally, as I am purchasing a home I do not want to spend nearly all of my left over savings. I was planning on giving her $6,500 instead, but she’s pretty pissed about it.

466,"Warning: Most of this just backstory because I am fuckin in love with this girl and the way things panned out melts me every time I think about it. Feel free to skip to the bottom for my question.

I met this girl in September on tinder. To be honest I have used tinder before but nothing serious ever came of it. 

We chatted for awhile shared music taste etc. At first she was reluctant to go on a date with me (she later admitted she was just really nervous) but eventually her and I went and sat at a park/lake and just talked. I brought her flowers and she brought me an iced tea. She spoke maybe 3 sentences for the majority of it. I however spoke A LOT but we were there most of the afternoon and awhile into the night as well. Even though she didn’t talk much eventually she started getting comfortable and we just clicked. 1 date turned into spending the next 4 days together. 

The second one was the same except we tried to out do each other by bringing more snacks/drinks for each other. The third one (since I live in a town over) she decided she wanted to drive to me. I was ecstatic because I had never seen that amount of effort from someone interested in me. I took her to the tallest point of my crummy little mountain town and we ended up spending the night together up there without planning too. We laid out some blankets on the back of her truck and just talked for awhile smoked a J that a friend had given me that day and had a couple of mikes hard. It was an amazing time we just laughed together a lot but eventually it got really cold and windy. We were just laying down trying to stay warm. I finally got the courage to ask if she wanted to cuddle (using the excuse of warmth kind of) and at first she didn’t really say anything. About 2 minutes later she lifted up the blanket and just rolled over into my arms. We just laid there like that for a long time and eventually it was getting bonechillingly cold so I said we should get in her truck. She quickly agreed and when we both got in I asked if she wanted to come and cuddle some more since it was still cold. She agreed and slid over into my seat with me and fell asleep in my arms. It was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had to do and got 1 hour of sleep but it was soooo worth it she was so fuckin cute just sleeping all cozy. 

None of that was planned and not long after that night it turned into the most wonderful and loving relationship I have ever been in. My last relationship hurt most of the way through it and it utterly destroyed me afterwards. However this girl gave me everything. She makes me feel a certain way that I can’t describe. truth be told it’s all of the happy and exciting things I can think of just mashed together. She saved me from myself. But before this gets to long considering I’ve been writing this for a couple hours just gushing over her and then deleting because it’s not important to my question. what would you do for a significant other that you want to give the entire world too when nothing feels good enough?

467,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit, I was initially unsure of where to post this so I hope it's alright here. I'm currently looking for advice after four years of dealing with a manipulative and possessive ""friend"". I'm really sorry that this post is quite long...

We are currently in our last year of school and I look forward to cutting him from my life after I leave. I know I can block him but I'm still worried that he could find ways to contact me, and I know if he does harass me then I can contact the police but I've never done so before and unsure how it would be handled? It makes me anxious not knowing what could happen. My plan was the month we leave to just block him and change my usernames on the accounts I use / open new ones so that he wouldn't  know it's me? I'm very unsure of how to handle this abe probably sound very silly but honestly I need some direction, I dont know who I could talk to who would take the situation seriously. 

I dont want to have any contact at all with this person as for the last four years he has literally been a plague in my life and has forced me away from my group of friends (one of which I am still very close with but this person has threatened us both in the attempt to try and stop us from being close.) And has demanded my immediate attention every single day, even through preliminary exams and actual examinations. My main reason for not blocking him currently is that he will yell abuse at me throughout the day and between classes like he has down previously in the last years that I've tried to block him, and simply being his ""friend"" is the only way to stop him from doing this. 

I'm sorry for being such a bother but can anyone advise me on the best way to get him out of my life? Additionally is there any precautions I can take online to keep him away, and offline too?

471,"Hello, I want to ask for advice regarding career choices.

I’m 25 years old and I graduated with a major that I do not love but had to take up just to have a degree, since my mom didn’t want me to go out of our city for college during that time. I’ve always wanted to take up fashion design since I was young but there weren’t any colleges that were offering that major at that time so I gave up on the thought. 

After working as an English tutor (not my major) for about 2 years in the PH, going to Japan to study Japanese and to look for more opportunities teaching English (which I failed to attain and my student visa was expiring), I went back to the PH, working as an English tutor once more until being laid off due to a fluctuation of tutors and less students. 

Now that I am getting older, I want to have a more stable and sustainable career. I am torn on either opening a small shop which specializes in gowns here in my city which means partnering with a local tailor or taking up nursing for 4 years (since my parents won’t help me financially if I study outside of the city and the only course offered here is a 4-year degree) then working for about 2-3 years with a small salalary in the PH first then going abroad. I know I should have taken up nursing before but I was young and naive back then, plus there was a decrease in the demand of nurses back then, but now I realized it’s just a cycle.

I can only study in my city as it’s expensive to do so outside of the city, as I have to pay for my rent, transportation and other expenses. I still stay with my parents so I can save more money if I study here, also my parents would help me with the tuition if I study here so I can study sooner. (This is not uncommon in the PH). There are pros and cons for each like for example:

Fashion Design
PROS
*  i can practice my passion
* if i become successful i’d really earn a lot

CONS
* no stable income for the first few months or years
* since I don’t have a degree and don’t know technical stuff, I have to either take a 3-year course here in my city or take up a shorter course in the future in another city (my mom won’t help me financially if I study outside the city at the moment, so I have to save up for my tuition if I want a shorter course)
* my city is small and not that fashion forward, although I am planning to design gowns particularly debuts and weddings which I think has potential for success here

Nursing
PROS
* i’d have a stable career
* i’d be able to work abroad, which is also one of my dreams since I’ve always wanted to work outside my city

CONS
* i have to take up a 4-year course because that’s the only course being offered here in my city
* another 2-3 more years for hospital experience here in the PH
* difficult to have kids at a later age (during the time I attain my goal of being a nurse abroad I’d probably be 34 already)
* I’d probably have recurring WHAT IF thoughts since I didn’t pursue my passion

Also, I’m also thinking what if I become a nurse now and do fashion business when I retire as a nurse? I’m really torn. What are your thoughts or if you were in my situation, what would you do? Thank you!",21Jan2020,1

   When he ended things, he did it through snap. An hour earlier, he'd said that he loved her so so so much etc.

They went into the bedroom after flirting heavily and stating B was horny. A and B have been around alcohol more than I have and hung out multiple times before also A knows how B gets. After 30-40 minutes I just left due to being uncomfortable. I come to find out the next day that they had sex but B didn't remember until later in the day. I'm guessing that A told B what happened. B has a STD that's uncureable but is sure A won't get it.  I remember everything from that night and after learning A is pissed at B for telling A after they did it and B is really really upset, idk how to handle the situation.

so heres the thing :
i have another reddit account and i once posted about him for advice on when i should confess my feelings for him. and i stupidly gave my reddit user to him the night before. lo and behold, he freaking saw it. he even replied to it. i thought it was just another random redditor but then i noticed his username, which was the same as his twitter. to make sure, i stalked more and i saw in his comments that he had commented his instagram username. i really thought my life was over. however, he pretended nothing happen when we were talking. 

so 1-2 days ago when i met him, he said to me “ive actually saw your reddit before” and he just stared at me. i quickly replied “im gonna take a trip to the toilet”

he never ever dropped any hints. and also i dont want to over think, but when i boarded the train after our meet-up, he texted me : “wow no goodbye hug?” i felt so happy but then i thought to myself that what if he did it to his female friends too?

I still loved her after that i would visit her every time i'd come back home and visit every day she'd cook me dinner you know she was a very warm source of love. She never ever even raised her voice at me or looked at me bad or disappointed no matter how much of a screw up i made.

I also have replaced emotions in the same way a program is replaced in a computer. **This was done at a great cost to my mental health, I'm not implying that I'm special** (Like software being altered by a non-amateur-but-not-expert) refer to below for more

I can also take care of my mental health (meaning that I can function long term) so just say whatever u can think of.



Below: I understand that emotions are basically the ""soul"" of a human being. A robot without its programming to move is ""potential ability"" (hardware capabilities). So I have added alternative programming to my mind in the form of .. **I'm mentally ill** so theres an advantage -- for example there are people whose imaginations are so powerful they seem real. Emotions are sensations - and I can imagine sensations - **dissociation** is also needed (maybe? I dont remember it's like my signature ability though *see: pokemon) - **delusion** is also needed - **habit** is also needed.

I am the only one who likes this band so its not like he wants to come for the band or anything. Plus I feel like it's weird why she is acting like he will die if she isn't with him for 3 days. Should I just say nothing even though I would rather him not come? I want to spend time with my sister and it'll be easier if we stay with her and cheaper. Plus I never see my sister and want to spend as much time with her as I can but if her boyfriend came we couldn't because its a girls only dorm... What should I do?",21Jan2020,1

493,"24, It looks like I got meth mouth even though I've never touched any. Dad was never keen on dental hygiene and an enabler, so it went by the way side and I had the privilege of never running out of sugary stuff to eat/drink. and since then I've taken up smoking so that's not good either. It's affecting my self esteem, brushing regularly ain't helping with what I got going on: they're gross ngl. Braces scare the shit outta me, and tbh I'd rather just get some dentures or veneers but that shit is expensive, and i cant pay for basic dental work, even from a college.

**lssues:** 

front teeth are gaped, and chipped (hit a chain riding my bike and effectively 360 flipped over the chain while it was in my mouth, landed flat on my ass, woke up and got to play ""dig my teeth out of my gums"". Its part of my fear of braces)

cavities, across the board pretty much. 

bottom right wisdom tooth has a giant cavity in it. top left wisdom tooth is starting on that path.

and the wisdom teeth are pushing all my other teeth inwards.

which causes me to bite my lip every time I chew, so for the past year and half my lip has had a swollen knot on one side like I have a dip pouch in there. think I read that could give you cancer? 


I only blame myself, but how do I even start to dig my way outta this one? like I said, I've been keeping on brushing; but it aint working. and I'm not working either cos no one wants to hire my gross ass.",21Jan2020,1
494,"So my Gf and I went through troubled times.
She had cheated on me for 7 months...but we are trying to fix this.
But she still wants him as a friend, and want to see him more recently. We talk a lot about that topic and feelings. And I communicate that this is fine to keep him as a friend, but I dont wanna see him.
Now I start worrying again, cause they do want to see each other very often and they chat everyday.
And she does not want to have sex with me. Sounds weird, but we had a very active sex life until that affair.
She still got lust, just not for me.
I dont know, this whole thing seems to be fucked up.
It feels like nothing, or maybe a metronom because its always like heaven, or like hell.
Were trying since 3 Months to work on this. 
And I must confess I still have trust issues but I try to work on them.
But all in all, this relationship feels like nothing but I dont wanna leave, cause we worked so hard on this, weve been together since nearly 3 years and I love her.
Is this feeling normal? After got cheated on? 
Or do I lost my feelings in all this?

495,"  

Little background: I’m from the U.K and I’m about to move to the USA to live with my fiancé. Due to the particular visa I’m going on, I won’t be able to get my green card for several months (apparently the wait time varies) I’ve worked with coding/databases for a couple of years and will try to get a job in the similar field. 

I’m a little worried about what I’m going to do with all this free time whilst my fiancé is at work and would really like to apply myself to do something productive. I have a few hobbies that can keep me a little busy but I really don’t want to turn into a complete bum.

I wouldn’t mind doing some volunteering/taking a course but feel I need a few suggestions. What do you guys think?",21Jan2020,1
496,"PLEASE READ FULLY. 

I already posted about this on here before, but things didn't turn out as I expected. Firstly, I made a mistake with waiting a few weeks hoping that she'd stop dating this adult that she's known for only a few days. 

However, to my absolute terror, she told me that he took her virginity and had already slept with him twice in a week. Mind you, she has had sexual experiences before that left her feeling dirty and violated although it didn't lead to full-on sex. 

Secondly, I hoped this man would be someone who would at least treat her well if I failed to convince her to stop dating him. Sadly, I had the chance to meet him with another friend of mine and he turned out to be the worst person I've ever met in my 16 years of living. He's an avid Trump fan and is highly narcissistic and, for lack of a better word, sociopathic. He claimed that he was better than everyone, going as far as to call himself God. He was also very rude and belittled my left-aligning rules (but that's besides the point). He also said that people who work 9-to-5 jobs are pathetic slaves, despite being a college dropout living in his mother's house with barely anything to call a job. Yes, he's a massive asshole. 

What's most terrifying is, he kept calling my friend (his girlfriend) Bitch and telling her to shut the fuck up sometimes when she spoke (in a public setting by the way). My friend even admitted that they physically fought, although play-fighting, the first time she was in his house (he's a trained MMA fighter by the way). Moreover, my friend that accompanied when we met him said that she'd beat him up as a joke, but he took it seriously and put her in a headlock in front of everyone. Afterwards, she told me that it hurt really bad and was so shocked at his actions. 

The guy also has 2 other girlfriends, according to my best friend (they are in an open relationship). 

(I looked up his facebook account and I saw that he was also very racist, who used the N word often. The jokes he made were also very unethical and full-on concerning at times. He made a joke about beastiality as well)

Anyways, after we met up with my best friend and the jerk, they then met up with 2 of my other friends. They told us later on thru messages that the asshole kept ranting about how he should've beaten up ""that fat bitch"" aka the girl he headlocked. 

My friend who got headlocked spoke to my best friend later in the evening to convince her stop. She admitted that she was dating him because she's so bored with her life and it made her happy even though she knew it was wrong.

She started crying and after an hour of talking, she promised to end things with him. She called him on the phone but supposedly, it caused an argument and she called back saying she decided to keep dating him. 

This all seemed really bad, so my 2 friends and I decided to take actual measures to end their relationship. We were thinking of telling her parents, but decided to tell a teacher that we trusted instead. He advised us to stay by her side, because she showed signs of being a victim of an abusive relationship and said that usually these victims find it hard to get out of them because they feel like they don't deserve better. (For context, her parents are very strict and used to beat her up a lot, with her mom always shaming her weight and calling her stupid) 

The teacher told us not to tell her parents, because it'd make things worse, and just support her in everything else she does and try to limit the time she spends with her boyfriend by hanging out with her often. 

We've been trying to do this, but it hasn't worked out well. Just recently, she sneaked out of her house at 2 am and met up with him only to get caught when she came home at 8 am. Terrified that her parents would found out about her relationship, she lied to them, saying she was going to kill herself but decided not to. Her parents were deeply hurt by this and her dad beat her with his belt. She showed us photos of her multiple bruises and it was all very horrifying. 

She also quit the debate club to spend more time with him.

So, telling her parents is out the window. Imagine what they'd do if they find out she's dating an adult? Moreover, my other best friend is completely okay with her relationship, claiming that it's the first time she's seen her smiling so much. But I believe that even if she's happier, this needs to end because he might end up beating her or maybe even raping her later on and that's so scary to me. 


What do I do? I'm literally at a loss, because everything I've thought about always leads to a dead end. 

Thank you,
N.",21Jan2020,1

I've had girls approach me and text me but i'm to embarrassed to even think of starting a relationship with someone since I don't do anything and would have no way of getting to them.

I do get out and have fun but it is mainly with family. I am very shy and bashful to the extent that I get anxious messaging my own SISTER. It's hard to get started in life because I feel to shy to express what I'm interested in or would love to go to college for (If I had the opportunity to go to college).

Recently, I've noticed that she tends to stray away from me most of the time like she was weirded out. I really don't know the cause (probably my friends who keep teasing us cuz their a bunch of lovable fricktards but I'm not really sure). She went in a ""who are u"" mode and pretends like we are just some classmates that met in the first day and like she's forgotten everything we did last year. 

Until today, it was really obvious that she knows my thing with her, she strays away in an obvious manner and has a magical way of ignoring me even if I ask a question. Tomorrow, I'll be straightening things out and hopefully it doesn't get more awkward and will ruin everything I've built. Our classes will end  in April and probably would see her again in the summer classes that we are required to take.

I don’t have any children on my husband’s side of the family whom I’m closest to, I moved abroad to be with him and honestly my actual family are toxic and I never really learned normal life coping skills growing up. 

Anyway I sometimes wonder if it’s an actual baby I want as in having them, or if I just wish I could have a baby/small child in my life? I’m not sure if that makes sense. None of my close friends have children and I don’t have many. I work a full time job so I can’t necessarily volunteer with kids to spend time with them, and I’m the youngest and have never really spent time with children so I’m too nervous and shy to do so anyway. I do know people with kids but I’m pretty sure if I approached them with this they would just think I’m weird plus not to mention the impracticalities of me actually spending time with their kids.

They've always had a problem with my mom, but I also feel like they've never made an effort to be close to us and would rather not be around us at all. They behave like acquaintances when they aren't being passive aggressive. 

A few days ago I found out that my father's younger sister just came into town - her sister in law told me and seemed surprised that I didn't know (everyone knows what everyone is doing). My cousin from my mom's side was sitting with me and she was startled that I didn't know either.

I felt very hurt. She's always extremely friendly with everyone around her and she's made the time to visit my friends and finish her shopping but not to touch base with me. (She's come down to help with her sister in law's baby). Even earlier when she used to live close by she never made an effort to check on me or keep in touch. I always visited and made sure to call as she seemed slightly forgetful and childish. BUT she was in touch with everyone around her.

She's extremely pally with my inlaws - I feel like even more since I've been having a problem with them. She doesn't like my mother at all for some reason. If she has a problem with my parents it's one thing. I don't get why she's this way with us though. Anyway I made an effort to visit her and invited her to dinner.

I get kinda bullied about it online, makes me want to cry sometimes that I’m getting judged for it, and people will see it as a weakness. And it’s not like I just want the sex part, in fact the biggest part I want from it is just someone to hold/hug me in bed, make me feel safe, warm and cosy, and have the feeling that I’m making them feel the same way, that they trust me and want me. 

I don’t really know what to make from all this. I tell myself that I’m cynical about love. But I know I’m a romantic  and want to express it to someone. But I’ve never come across a girl like that and I feel like I never will.",21Jan2020,1
530,"Vivid dreams (which I've had all my life) combined with a recent change in schedule (needing to wake up much earlier than I'm used too) has caused this phenomenon to occur nearly every morning.

This confusion tends to draw me back into sleep, even if I woke for my alarm. I have tried various alarm tones and placements. I'll usually wake up instantly even at the softest tone, but fall asleep again immediately even if the tone is obnoxious and loud. Do you have any advice that might help?

532,"Throwaway account just in case, but I’m in need of advice on how to deal with an old friend of mine who’s decided to visit.

So a quick bit of background:

My childhood friend is visiting my city over the next 2 weeks. We haven’t lived in the same city or really made active contact with each other for the past 5 years however when he said he was coming over I felt obliged to offer to put him up for a couple days of hanging out and doing what we used too for old time sake. Only problem is this was 3 days ago and he’s showing no signs of wanting to stop, he has family which he’s staying with but tell me that he’d rather “just sit around with me” than be at his parents place, and then he’ll proceed to complain to me later that day that we’re not doing anything or going anywhere or that he’s hungry (this is a fully grown man we’re talking about here). Keep I’m mind that I’m not on vacation right now, I’ve taken a few days off work but my life is very much still business as usual. He’s also quite sheltered I think? I’ve had to work hard to get where I am now and even still struggle to make ends meet, my friend on the other hand has had most of his expenses paid for and will pay no mind to my financial situation and expects to be driven to the local sights and our old haunts on my dime. I’ve brought it up to him multiple times that I didn’t anticipate the sheer amount of stuff that he was wanting to do and that my bank balance can’t justify it, however this seems to just go in one ear and out the other. 

My attempts so far to shake him have been met with being placed in awkward situations where I feel like I can’t really say no to what he’s asking (i.e: asks to stay one night that we hadn’t discussed in front of his immediate family without asking me prior). He’s also incredibly quick to judge me and my friends current friends life decisions regarding our studies and the fact that we enjoy a beer or two and will sometimes share a joint around, I initially attributed this to him suddenly (and recently) becoming Christian but even my other friends who’re religious have witnessed him judging basically all of us for seemingly normal things as mentioned above and have felt the need to address it to me after the fact. This is especially rough because I’m not even sure if he’s aware he’s doing it, and he’s a nice enough guy to the point where I feel like I’d freeze telling him what I really think.

Basically I feel like he had planned this vacation around staying at my place as well as relying on me for transport and the occasional meal. The advice I’m ultimately looking for is:

. How can I politely tell my friend that I don’t want to be his personal concierge / taxi over his vacation

. How can I politely tell him that I think the both of us have changed over the past 5 years to the point where I don’t really think we can be friends

. How can I tell him that I don’t appreciate his constant judgement of my friends and family without sounding like a dickhead.

534,"So I have a friend that's with an opposite gender of mine (I'm a guy) and I've always loved her because I'm always there for her through thick and thin and she is always here too to help me with my problems and always gives me advice and I honestly thought that she will be my friend for the rest of my life.

So after all of those things I noticed something that up until to this day still makes me sad: I started noticing that she hangs out more with an another girl she met (I know the girl and were friends but not that close) and for me its all fine because its not like I'm that selfish to just take her for me. Weeks have gone by and I started to notice that she just talks to me less than other people and she started liking the other girl more.

The reason why I posted this is because I don't know what to do, she is the only friend I have (because I'm introverted and anti-social so making new friends for me is so hard and no one wants to talk to me) and but I don't have the balls to confess because I feel like she is going to hate me more.

535,"I'd gotten fairly good at living the solitary life, but in the past few years I'd made friends as part of a small community. 

Lately these people are retreating from the friendship increasingly and basically I decided it's easier for me to ""rip the bandaid"" and just block and delete all of them, and avoid public spaces where I might see them for a while.

What I'd like to know is has anybody done this without the accompanied self destruction I seem to be going through. I keep trying to get up every day and make good decisions but it seems so much easier to stay in bed, play video games and drink. I've been thinking of getting a new pet dog, as my last dog died in 2019, but I'm open to anything honestly. I had to make a throwaway out of fear of someone seeing this as my girlfriend knows my user, but I've grown so attached to having some sort of contact outside of my relationship, and despite being together for such a long time my relationship isn't as strong as it could be.

539,"This is a long one sorry :/
I am looking for advice and opinions on what I should do next in this situation.

I live in another state from my family now. I started building a life here and got some part time jobs after moving. They were paying the Bill's fine and one had great potential for a full time if I was there a little longer. 

A family member has a startup and said they had an investment which allowed them to hire a full time employee. They offered me the job as I had assisted them with the company many times in the past because it's the family thing to do. 

I was offered a nice starting salary, health insurnace, standard holidays/sick/vacation, and the stipulation was in was required to be in the state they live in for at least 50% of my work. I was hesitant as I live half a country away at this time but they said the company would pay for the flights. I said I'd give it a try as I knew they really needed someone at this stage in the startup. 

I flew in and unconfortably lived at their house for over a month while I did work in their ""home office."" During that month I was informed they can't actually provide me health insurnace. They did not look into it prior to hiring me and found out they cant get a group rate for one employee.

It took over a month to get my first paycheck as the boss (my family member) was still learning how to do payroll. 

I flew back to my home right before the holiday season. I used my slotted vacation time for thanksgiving week and christmas week. But still worked on and off during both weeks despite using my approved time. I worked after hours and on weekends to get projects and tasks done as they come up as some cannot wait till a normal work day or because they wait till the last minute for a deadline then pass the project onto me.

For example we recently had a big presentation at a convention and I was asked to assist with making the presentation and spent two days editing videos and other tasks for the presnetation three days before they were to go on stage and present. The email about the presentation was sent about 3 weeks earlier so their was ample time to work on it prior to 3 days before. 

It's now january and my employer has only payed ke that one time. I calculated they are 8 weeks behind on pay. I have had to ask my parents for monetary assistance and have deeply dipped into my savings so I can pay my personal Bill's during this time. 

I was aggravated and annoyed and started applying for part time and full time work in the state I live and I called to quit this weekend after a snafu with a flight back to their state during a major snowstorm. I kept saying it was dangerous and the airlines were giving the option to change the flights and kept being told how nice it was where they are and that it's not a problem. 

When I called to quit I was upset but it was very appropriate. I have not been payed and have been very accommodating up until this point as they learned and figured it out but I am now in an unfavorable financial position. They have promised to mail me the same check written in november since November. Last week I was told it was in the mail. When I called to quit during the weekend I was told it was still on their table and they apologized. Even if they finally sent out this one check they will still be behind weeks of pay as this check was written for work done in November before the thanksgiving holidays. 

I was told I cannot quit as they run a professional buisness and quitting without 2 weeks notice is unprofessional and unacceptable. I am being required to work out at least two more weeks, and am being talked into staying and ""giving it another shot."" 

I have no problem doing the work. I am actually excited for a project coming up but I cant keep leaving my home I pay for to live in their house or a 10x10 room in someone's backyard and not even be payed. The company is growing rapidly and by next year could be a million dollar company. But I could loose everything in waiting for the growth to happen. 

The worse part is, the rest of my family keeps telling me to stick it out and give them a break because they are family. But if you take the family element out of the situation they all say wow when you out it like that I'd tell you to leave immediately. But then follow it up with but that's not the case they are family so it's not the same. 

I really don't know what to do. My employer expects me to get on a flight today because they feel it is a rash decision for me to quit and I should be grateful for the amazing opportunity and that living away from my home (in another state) more than half the time is normal. As they said ""its 2020 that's what people do."" 

I was fine with quitting and my partner of 14 years actually wanted me to quit sooner from not being payed this whole time. We can survive without me working for a while as he has a stable well paying job. But I keep feeling guilted into not quitting because its family. I was given waterworks about how this would help us reconnect as a family and be a fun project to be apart of etc. I was told when I quit my boss/family memeber became depressed by the notice and I ruined their day. Even family members who were behind me quitting initially are now telling me maybe I should give them another chance.",21Jan2020,1

542,"My sister moved in with me ~6 months ago after reluctance from her boyfriend at the time to find a place together. I agreed to her staying with me for a bit of a bargain and she agreed it wasn't a permanent situation. All I asked was that she clean up after herself.
Since then, she has been an utter mess. She leaves trash everywhere. Empty boxes, empty cartons, used lemons, used q tips, and even clotted menstrual blood in the shower. She leaves trash on the floor, in the sink, on the couch. She has taken out the trash twice since she's been here and I had to ask her both times. I only know that bc I try to take out the trash once in a day or 2. The menstrual blood thing; I have a phobia of blood. She has left blood in the shower twice now for no short length of time, and it's not just a little blood, it's a succession of blood clots. I physically cannot type more about that.
On another note,
She takes my things without asking and without replacing them. It's usually beers or snacks I bought for myself, but last time it happened, I was walking to to the bathroom and I saw her trying to open a bottle of wine I bought for myself only for her to ask ""do you have a bottle opener. Can i have some of this?"" She didn't ask before she grabbed it or was looking for a bottle opener herself.
I've tried to talk to her about cleaning up her messes, which ends up with her saying, ""I'll try to do better bc I don't want to upset you."" Only to leave the job half as clean as it started with or not clean at all.

I'm beginning to get really irritated with her disgusting habits and lack of awareness. I don't know how to approach her in a way that's respectful but stern bc I cannot allow this to go on.

I'm considering an ultimatum and I really don't want to go down that route. I can see that I'm bottling things up, and I need a healthy way to express my need for cleanliness.

There's more. So much more.

 A friend of mine is wondering what's the best Lehre/Formation for her son, he is 14 and looking for a Lehrestelle in Zürich. (In Switzerland you start early at 14-15, work half time and school in job field half time)

He does a lot of sport, he has a temper sometimes but he likes to help and is interested in wood, metal, elektro-construction. He likes to work with his hands. I think the temper is mentionable because maybe he needs a flexible environnement.

I don't know a lot about these jobfields, but the important to me is, that he can have respectable work hours, that he is in a field that isn't endangering his health on the long term, that he can slowly grow into a comfortable living situation, possibly having has an edge long term with Weiterbildungen(after formations) that allows him to be independant.

546,"I’ve been with my husband for about six years. We’re beyond happy and I feel completely satisfied with our relationship. He’s my world and I would know what I’d do without him. We’ve just bought the perfect family home where we plan to start our own family. Things are just as magical as when we met. We still have food fights when we make dinner, pull pranks on each other, surprise each other, try to romance each other, fool around, and keep each other gasping for air from laughter almost daily. My favourite part of the week is when he comes home on Friday, we cook up a fun ‘Friday’ meal like tacos or a massive bowl of buffalo dip, and we stay up all night going down the rabbit hole of documentaries, knowing we have nothing to do in the morning. His hugs and kisses after he comes home from work are the best thing in the world to me. He’s seriously my best friend and soul mate.

Never once thought about my exes until about two years ago. Out of nowhere, one night, I had an intense romantic dream about my most recent ex before my husband. We had forgiven each other and started sneaking around behind the backs of our new partners. Nothing sexual. Just stealing kisses and holding hands and smiling at each other. I was feeling butterflies.
When I woke up I figured it was a one off and didn’t pay it any mind. I found it odd because in reality, I saw this ex as immature in multiple ways and kind of a dick. Even before I met my husband I had known I would never want take this ex back. 

But then a few months later it happened again. Same ex same deal. Same intense feelings. And it’s continued to happen. It only started out once every few months but has slowly increased to a few times a month. I started to think it meant something. I felt ashamed and mad at myself. If I could I wouldn’t be having this dreams. I’m wholeheartedly happy in my marriage, why would I subconsciously feel the need to have these dreams?

Then last week it switched up. I dreamed about another ex I had completely forgotten about. In real life he had really poor hygiene, expected super old fashioned things of me (like to fix his plate for him at dinner) and he was pretty pushy in the bedroom. I felt relief when I got out of that relationship. Yet in this dream of mine, I found myself clinging to his side. I woke up again feeling repulsed. Seriously, he was a jerk who made me so uncomfortable in real life, why am I dreaming about being so head over heals for this guy? I felt sick all morning because this guy was so pushy when we were together, I felt violated by dreaming that way about him.  The next dream though went back to my most recent ex. 

But then last night I dreamed about a new ex. My first high school sweetheart.  My first love. We were back in high school and all I felt was nostalgia and heart ache. I went to the gym to find him sitting on the bleachers. He smiled at me as I walked up the steps and he shot me a concerned “do you need help getting to our seats?” Type look that both melted and shattered my heart at the same time. For a brief moment I realised I was dreaming at told myself “don’t get too comfy, we both know how this ends.” As if I was talking to a younger me. He held out his hand and pulled my over a few seats to where he was. We were waiting in the gym to go on a field trip. We get on the bus and go on our merry way. My high school ex had a really specific sense of humour that always cracked me up. In the dream he started making jokes and stuff and had me full on belly laughing. But, I guess I found them  really REALLY funny because I woke up both myself and my husband by full on belly laughing in my sleep. 

What do I do? I’m so sick of these dreams. I feel like a horrible person. I wake up feeling such extreme guilt like I’ve actually been cheating. I feel like a terrible wife who’s letting her marriage down. I just want them to stop.",21Jan2020,1

I was thirsty last night, and got up to make myself a cup of tea, stood up, went in the kitchen, felt completely fine, started making it and all of a sudden it hit me like a train.


I felt confused and disoriented, my body started to feel heavy and abnormal, my vision started getting blurry, about this time I kinda realized what was happened and called for my roommate, I don't really remember anything after that.


I saw a bunch of bright colors almost, like seeing stars and everything was pressing down on me at once and I blacked out.

My roommate said when he got to me I'd fallen forward and bashed my head a bit on the doorframe, then he tried getting me to my bed but I fell onto the floor, which he tried to make as soft as possible.

I came to with him gently shaking me and saying my name, everything was dark and I didn't remember even moving from the kitchen.

At one point I think I sent him away so he wouldn't worry, and then kinda blacked out for a second before coming to again, I asked him to help me up and into bed, then asked him if he'd lay beside me on my bed for a bit.

After that I fell asleep for a bit, we went to the store later and between that and now I don't remember a whole lot of anything, like the drive to the store, coming home, I don't remember ever getting back into bed or anything, woke up around 4 AM and I've been up since, my head is throbbing where I think I might've bumped it and I feel a little dizzy now and then.

I am scared and I don't know what is wrong with me. I am disgusted of myself. I already have it hard and I don't want to put myself in psychotherapy because I am afraid they will mark me as sick to the core and will lock me up... After that, It will be very hard to continue with my life since I won't be able to get a job or study (as expertise from psychologist is needed and when they see the past, they just don't accept you).. What is wrong with me?

TL;DR: I am/can be completely emotionless. I imagine torturing others. I hear voices. What's wrong with me?",21Jan2020,1

My friend had been getting especially close with my ex boyfriend. When confronted she had said she would never do anything with him and do that sort of thing to me.
I recently found out that they did it while she was saying those things to me.

564,"In September I left a job I was at for 5 years to take a new one with WAY less pay for way less stress - because it's a remote position. I adopted a new dog in May and she has some needs so I cut my losses and accepted this new position, being really happy to imagine being home with her, amongst other things. 

The role requires a 120 day training period in-office, then you get your monitor and laptop, get set up at home and that is that. There are 4 other women on my team who rotate one week in the office one after the other so there is one of us on site always to deal with faxes from the other team members and stuff. There is another small team of people in this same office and they're super nice but distractingly loud and it's not very easy to get work done. I started September 9th and have been looking so forward to January 9th since I started. 

So the week of January 6th I emailed our IT guy to make sure he knew my schedule so he wouldn't arrive with all my equipment when I happened not to be in the office and he said he had to order me a brand new laptop which wouldn't arrive till 1/20 and asked if I minded. We agreed to that, and then I tried to talk to my boss, asking to go over ""the checklist"". This is a medical office so it's important that I agree to all the HIPPA conditions to work remotely. He brushed me off and said we would talk soon. I reminded him my go-home date was 1/9 (which I expected to be Monday 1/13). 

He wasn't in the office 1/13 or 1/14, and Wednesday 1/15 he announced he is resigning and moving out West. His last day will be 2/27. I asked him if I'm still on schedule to get home and he said ""the moment I handed in my resignation I don't have a say in that anymore."" 

His boss, whose head is spinning, told me she doesn't plan to make any changes to what his plan was for anything, but is really hard to connect with, and I don't know she would know what to do for the HIPPA checklist anyway. I'm so angry with my boss because he essentially recruited me and was so positive about how this experience would be for me - and is just so checked out for the last month he's here he isn't even trying to finish anything. There's a lot more he let us down on too. 

Just wanting to know if anyone thinks I have a leg to stand on when I talk to his boss about why I should have this resolved when I expected to. My reasons feel flimsy to me- I want to be home with my dog, it's distracting to work in this office, I was promised this which is why I left my other job, I'm basically the bitch of the whole team constantly interrupted with emails from them to fax for them, it's MF cold and icy outside and misery to get to work and it makes me v mad that I should have been sitting in my pjs with coffee looking at the snow outside by now - like all of my team members. 

Anyone have any advice if those reasons sound absurd, or if there is something else I should say as to why this should be followed through on?",21Jan2020,1

570,"Hey there Reddit. I feel like as I've slowly crept into adulthood that things I used to be so excited about have left me with extreme anxiety and worry. I'm 23 years old and I live with my girlfriend and a few other family members. The first biggest step I took was taking out a loan to get a reliable car. I went from a very crappy 1996 mazda to a 2019 kia with only 6k miles on it. The decision took me a good 6 months to work up the courage to accomplish, and the first month after I did all I could feel was regret. I was constantly worried about how I would afford it if I lost my job or if I got into a wreck etc etc. I am now facing the dilemma of moving out. I have a good amount of money saved to be able to accomplish this, but I cannot seem to work up the courage to actually go through with it. In the back of my mind, all I can think about it what will I do if I lose my job, will I actually be able to afford it, and will I enjoy life with less $ in my pocket. 

Do you guys have any tips on how to get over these fears and to calm myself down? I don't want to watch life drive past me and leave me in the dust. I want to be able to take steps or leaps in life without worrying about the potential consequences (and to be able to jump the hurdle when/if those consequences happen).

572,"I have a friend,  Jay, that I've known since high school. We have been really good friends for as long as I've known him.  Always a very loyal, good friend to me.

Jay has always been a ""ladies man"". He currently gets a lot of his action on Tinder, OKCupid and from going out to bars. He dates them sometimes, usually just having sex with the girls. The ones he does ""date"" don't last longer than 2 or 3 months.

Jay has always gone for the younger girls. He is late 20s but the girls he usually picks up are early 20s, his most recent girlfriend was actually an 18 year old who recently moved to the city to attend the college here. 

Some other friends and I began to talk about his taste for the younger girls, and we all noticed some things about all the girls he hangs out with: they all look &amp; act extremely young.  Very tiny(skinny or short 99% of the time), usually extremely immature. But to be fair these are just the one's we've met.

All his ""exes"" that I have met, all have some serious insecurities. Jay revealed most are foster children, or had a terrible childhood (I don't wanna go to details, but it's exactly what you're imagining), so even Jay himself noticed a pattern with his girlfriends.


Out of our 6 person friend group, 3 of us including myself have daughters. This revelation that our friend might be a predator has made us all uneasy, including my wife. One of our other friends asked him ""Why do you keep fucking with children?"" But that just made Jay mad and he ignored the question.

Spent 4 months practically just trying to get over her, we kept in touch very rarely via e-mail, I asked her a few times if we should meet up to fix things she said she didn't want a relationship.

7 days of no contacting her at all she calls me, ( after New Years ).

She says she wanted to fix things and asked if i wanted to meet up, I said yes.

We have met up a few times now, kissed, she gave me head twice, but she keeps saying she doesn't know what she wants.

She said after each time we met how amazing it was and it was better than before.

Yet she still keeps saying she doesn't know what she wants. She tells me she loves me, if i dont message her she will message me, she loves calling me, we meet up, potentially will be having sex but she still says she doesn't know what she wants and if it will work again.

Am I being led on? It's not a question of if she is attracted to me or not as she kisses me gives me head, tells me how much shes missed us being intimate...

583,"I am FUCKING PISSED. I know the situation may not be related to me, but it still makes me very angry to see it. It sucks so much. It's just not fair. Screwing over someone's future like that. 

Ok, I'll stop ranting and actually say what happened. In my school, if you get caught cheating, you get a 1.1 and can't redo the test. And that brings down your average by a lot and may even get you kicked out of the school, therefore screwing your future. 

During a test, I was sitting in front of this guy (Let's call him Steve). I was around half a metre away from him. And our teacher was at the door, around 8 metres away from him and talking to another teacher. And suddenly, she turns around and starts screaming at him ""GIVE ME THE EXAM PAPER, YOU WERE WHISPERING TO THE GUY NEXT TO YOU. CHEATING RESULTS IN A 1.1."" 

But when I was behind him, I didn't hear him say anything. The classroom was dead quiet and I'm *sure* I would have heard something if he would've actually done something. 

So this teacher is saying she can hear him whisper from 8 metres away when no one that was sitting close to him could hear him say anything?! That sounds like bullshit to me.

If she really would've thought they were cheating, she would've taken away both of their papers, not only Steve's.

She wouldn't even let him explain. He tried to talk to her, even after school he went to her office to try to explain, she flat out ignored him.

Is there anything I can do about this?

584,"Last year, I ended a friendship with one of my close friends. Part of the reason why I decided to stop being friends with her was that she didn't really know how to apologize.

I finally got tired of having to put up with her attitude of being unable to apologize/at the very least be apologetic so I started ignoring her. Later on, I talked to my mother about it.

589,"Before I start I’d like to say that my sister has been seeing a therapist and has been on anxiety and anti-depressants since 8th grade. 

So last year, during the first semester of our I sophomore year of high school, my twin sister, we’ll call her A became extremely close friends with another girl named N. N and A had a great friendship for the first semester, and, both being gay, developed crushes on each other (as my sister puts it, she “fell hard” for N) before winter break. They never told each other so nothing romantic ever happened. I know this sounds super teenage girl-y, but trust me, it’s all about to go to shit. 

However, upon return from winter break, N started acting extremely cold to A. Whenever A would try to talk to her, N would give her the cold shoulder, respond in one word answers, or looking at her like “I was the scum of the earth” according to my sister. 

This sudden rebuke of my sister caused my sister to experience extreme anxiety before school, to the point where she was vomiting. My sister suffers from an eating disorder (too skinny) and has had many issues with her stomach in the past, but we took her to the doctor and they said that she was healthy, and that the vomiting was a psychosomatic symptom of anxiety. She missed a significant amount of school because of this. 

In addition, my sister also admitted to “playing it up” to get out of school and out of seeing N. Her vomit incidences would include vomiting (of course) extreme nausea, and curling up into the fetal position, feeling dizzy, and claiming to have the inability to walk. 

When the behavior started, my sister started asking N if she had made her angry, if she had done something wrong, etc. N would then reassure her and say that A wasn’t doing anything wrong, and that she was just “going through somethjng right now” and “was going to try to be a better friend.” However, after these conversations, N would always go back to the way she was treating her before and nothing would change. This happened several times throughout this time. 

N continued to treat A like this for a while, until one day in March, N asked to meet with A after school on a Friday. There, N told A that she would try to be better and she still wanted to be friends. They hugged and A was happy. However, the NEXT MONDAY, N went back to her old behavior. That night, my sister texted N to ask point blank if she wanted to be friends or not, and recieved this response:


“(last friday i was actually going to say that i didn’t want to be friends) i did enjoy being your friend at first though but i just don’t enjoy being around you anymore.
i guess i just snapped one day. everything that may have once been funny just became really annoying and i didn’t want to be around you anymore. i feel like you were always around me and i could never get a break, which is not totally your fault i guess. however, i didn’t know how to say that to you and i chose an awful way of expressing it, which i do feel bad about. we also have nothing in common anymore. i have no interest in any of the things you like and can find no common ground between us. i have no motivation to talk to you about anything, and i feel like there’s no reason for me to.
and i mean this isn’t really That Relevant but. i understand the need to talk to people about things like this but you told so many people when none of them were involved in any way. you’ve also talked badly about me like right in front of me multiple times which sucks?
i feel like we’ve both made many mistakes (mine were the worst) and i just want this to be over.
this probably doesn’t make much sense so i’m sorry”

Heartbroken, my sister cried of course, but then did okay with going to school after that. However, at our birthday party in early April, my sister full on disappeared, scaring the absolute shit out of me. We had a party-wide manhunt for her, until a guest found her crying in a closet. She later said that she started crying because she started to wonder if all of our friends would “leave her the way N did.” She had more vomiting relapses in May. 

When school let out, I was relieved and hoping that she would heal over the Summer, but that didn’t happen. She was supposed to go to this art camp at school (art is her favorite subject and where she met N) but she got sick before the camp and only went to 1/3 days. She said that the mere thought/idea of school made her anxious. 

When the school year started (our junior year), A found out she had another art class with N, and also shared a lunch with her. Yay. She had more vomiting incidents in September, but then did better for a while, but then in the past few months it’s all gone to shit again.

N has another friend that we’ll call U. U was friends with A, and actually supported her when everything with N was starting sophomore year, but it seems that N had turned U against A, and now U is treating A the same way that N does. (Fascinating little tidbit: According to U, N did the exact same cold shoulder treatment to U when they were in middle school, but U held out long enough that N decided to be friends with them again) 

Now that A has that double whammy of two people “hating” her, it’s harder then ever to get her to school, or doing ANYTHING at all. A has started vomiting before school again, a few times last semester, and A LOT these past two weeks. In fact, it happened this morning, which is why I’m writing this. 

In addition, she’s also gone home early without telling anyone because of anxiety attacks (we walk to school, so it’s easy to just go home). She also has been having full on sobbing/shaking/curling up into the fetal position anxiety attacks before events. For example, I hosted a climate strike last December that I had her do art for, and she didn’t go and had a sobbing panic attack. I had surgery last December, and the night before we wanted to do a family fun night thing where we went out for dinner and went t see Christmas lights, and she had another sobbing anxiety attack. Eventually, she was able to pull herself together though which was great. She’s also missed several concerts and other events. 

She’s also gotten more creative in her ways of staying home from school. She says that she has nightmares that give her anxiety attacks, and last October she acted like she had a headache so bad she couldn’t dress herself. 

A is still EXTREMELY bitter and angry over N and U. Every art class, she texts one of our close friends to complain, saying stuff like “I hope N and U are never happy again.” And “I bet they think they’re good people, but they’re not.” She has also urged her friends that are also friends with U and N to abandon them (which none have done, but several have distanced themselves, including me)

So far, since the school year started everything is terrible. Along with dealing with N and U every day, my sister also has to deal with an awful bitch of an art teacher (so her favorite subject is basically ruined) and she chose to take AP Calculus this year, and she’s having A LOT of difficulties in their and her grade is struggling. She now says that she “can’t handle school” and wants to do online school. She has reiterated that the idea of going to school gives her anxiety, and she claims to have nightmares about N and U, and that gives her anxiety attacks before school. 

So, what the FUCK is my family supposed to do? We’ve tried attempting to get her out more, she’s in the therapist and psychiatrists office constantly, her anxiety meds have changed time and time again, and she still can’t go to fucking school. I’m currently having a tearful breakdown in the middle of class over this bullshit and writing this instead of doing my work, so sorry if this is kind of a mess. 

TL;DR: twin sister had her heart broken by her bully of a friend/crush last year and vomits and has anxiety attacks before school to this day. In therapy and on meds, nothing is helping.",21Jan2020,1

593,"Not sure where to ask this so just gonna ask this here.

About 2/3 years ago, I went on 2 dates with this girl. The first date was great. We had coffee together and spoke the whole time, I thought she was really cool and I liked her. After that, I asked her out on a second date and she said yeah. At the time, I think I was 17 or 18, I was going through a weird time in my life, I was very depressed and anxious and using drugs as a means of escape. I normalised my drug use and even made it a part of my identity so that it would seem normal to others, but on the inside I was actually quite depressed and using drugs to escape my life. Thankfully, I am no longer depressed and I now have a much healthier relationship with drugs.

On our second date, we went to a cinema to see a film. I stupidly suggested that we each take a bit of acid and she was up for it. Looking back on it, I think I wanted to take the acid to maybe help with my social anxiety or maybe for me to have an excuse for being anxious. Anyways, we both took the acid, I don't remember exactly how much but it was enough for us both to trip (get high). The date was going good at first, we were talking and having a good time, we went to see the film and I think I started to really feel the acid at some point during the film. After the film had finished, I felt so out of touch with reality that I could barely talk to her. I remember she told me that she wasn't feel the acid very much, which I was surprised about considering how much I was feeling it. But basically, after the film, we spent the rest of our time together awkwardly sat next to each other in silence on a bus for about an hour. After that date, I don't think she messaged me again (but I'm not quite sure because it was quite some time ago). In hindsight, I should have messaged her and apologised for being so awkward however, I felt so anxious that at the time I wanted to just pretend like it never happened. It's one of those experiences that I randomly remember when I'm lying in bed at night and just cringe at how stupid I was. Honestly, I really regret it because I thought she was a great girl and I liked her, I just allowed my own anxiety and escapism to get in the way and fuck things up. But thankfully, after a lot of maturing &amp; personal development, I am able to look back at this and realise my mistakes.

I'm still friends with her on Facebook &amp; Instagram and I occasionally see something she's posted and I'm reminded of my foolishness. I'm considering messaging her to just kinda apologise and explain basically what I've said here and to hopefully convince her to give me a second chance, but I'm not sure if that would be a weird thing to do.

I don't chat/call with him. But I fail to understand why a 40 year old man would add such images. ( He used to act very religious during our marriage, so this is very surprising).

The most obvious answer would be to block his number so I don't see what he is doing on social media.

597,"i honestly can’t tell if i’m just a bad person, but it’s a combination of little things and particular scenarios that just i can’t help but be bothered by. I’ve never talked to anyone about this but it’s just been building up and i need to talk it through with someone because it’s really bugging me. 

i will try and keep it concise but there’s a bit of history behind it. basically it started when she sort of phased into my male friend group, before that i never had these thoughts or feelings, and since then i just don’t like her behaviour. 

it started out with her leading on one of my male friends in secret, she kissed him (as far as i know) and generally lead him on for approximately 2 months (again as far as i know) which alone to me is just unacceptable behaviour and i of course felt bad for said friend but everyone moved on from the situation pretty swiftly. 

however in the group chat we we’re all in she would send progressively sexual pictures to the chat and just being overtly sexual and flirtatious. i know that’s not what she’s like as she’s my sister so i can’t even accept that “that’s just who she is”. 

anyway further down the line, now this at the time really upset me but it’s all settled now so to speak, but in this group there was a guy i had liked for about 2 years but i never said or did anything, but at one point me and this guy were talking a lot and hanging out and i felt like it could lead somewhere. one weekend we all decide to go out drinking and she is constantly flashing her tits in a not so subtle way but trying to be subtle pretty much to impress the guy i liked and just generally being very flirty with everyone but especially the guy i liked. now, she definitely knew i liked him and how long i liked him because i had told her multiple times, in fact it was only after i had told her that she took an interest in him. the night ends in tears for me as the whole night they were dancing and it got to the point where he had his hand down her trousers. the breaking point was where they were flirting in the smoking area and i overhear him saying he wants to kiss her, i just break down crying and go home. and no, she didn’t even like him, she explicitly told me this so i have no idea to this day why she did it. 

these days it’s calmed down but there’s still behaviours that bother me, for instance telling stories about how all these men stare at her and stare at her boobs and generally just tell everyone how every man is so attracted to her. it’s subtle but not so subtle if you get what i mean, i just don’t understand the need to tell everyone these stories? 

FYI i’m not a jealous person at all, i’m in a happy relationship now, it’s just these behaviours IMO are trashy and low class and happen in my male friend group where to be frank, they all gossip about her saying she’s a slag and in fact one of the male’s girlfriend wants to confront my sister. 

so, am i crazy to let this stuff bother me? thanks in advance.",21Jan2020,1
598,"Hi all,

So I'm having an issue with my apartment complex currently.  If it matters, I am in Alabama.  I signed an addendum that allowed me to extend my one year lease, and in this addendum it states that I must return all keys and vacate the premises by January 31st, 2020.  In the original lease however, it says that I must give a 30 day notice before leaving my apartment.  Since we both signed the new addendum that states that I must be out of the apartment by Jan. 31st, I let them know yesterday that I will have the keys to them by January 31st and will be out.  They are now trying to charge me rent for February for not giving them a sufficient notice.  Am I at fault here for not giving them a notice when I signed the addendum that requires an exit date?  This seems a little off to me so, I'm trying to get second opinions.

599,"Last week I (24f) reconnected with an old boyfriend (24m) and we decided to go out for drinks, but a few hours before we were set to meet he sends a message asking if we can skip drinks and just have a quick hookup, no feelings or attachment. I agreed as it was more what I had in mind when we started talking again. But never having been one for hookups I was feeling a little nervous, which he said he also felt nervous so we talked irl and just kind of caught up for over an hour, during which conversation he continued to say things like ""I am having fun just talking to you, it doesn't have to be more"" but it did eventually end up with us hooking up, it was great for both of us and afterwards we laid around for a few minutes before he asked of we could shower, which struck me as super weird and I was not expecting it at all. But I agreed because I didn't know if it were normal for after hookups or not.. So we showered and after the shower he says something along the lines of ""I finally got to actually shower with you instead of just sitting outside the bathroom waiting for you"" and after getting dressed again instead of leaving which I expected as he claimed not to have had very much time we kind of cuddled on my couch and talked for a little over half an hour more before he left, which he seemed disappointed by and asked if I would text him later.

So I just need to ask if this is standard or if there are feelings underneath all of this? Am I reading too much into it?

TLDR: hooked up with an ex boyfriend, he said things that made me feel like he had feelings still, am I reading too far?

INFO: I thought it would be okay because we hadn't spoken in nearly 8 years before reconnecting

Also INFO: I had been in a relationship since High School and haven't had any experience with adult hookups and dating.",21Jan2020,1
600,"Okay, you are in for a treat here folks. So I turned up to college yesterday and met up with my mate. This is about 5 minutes before clas sand nobody else is there. It's just me and my friend. It's pretty clear something is up. He checks his phone and realises that all lesson have been cancelled. We leave. I then realise I have no money to get the bus home, he then kindly gives me some. He lives down the road from me so we got the same bus and went home. I then wanted to pay him back just to be kind. So I walk him to my house and I was literally just gonna quickly run in pay the man and then leave it and enjoy my day off. But my Mum decides otherwise. She invites my friend into the house for coffee. Okay fine he accepted the offer but baring in mind he didn't even want payment and now he is sitting in front of my parents drinking coffee I found this a bit OTT and incredibly embarrassing. So I spent most of yesterday with a mixture of sadness and embarrassment because of the admittedly minor incident. Skip to today. I go into college with money this time, just in case something happens. I get the bus home, with the same guy, and guess what. My Mum is waiting down the road to fucking welcome me home like a soldier returning home from Afghanistan. I'm 18. If I was 10 I could understand it. I admit once I got home and my mate went off I completely lost my rag shouting at her saying how ""I'm 18 I don't need you to nanny me my whole life.""

So when he does anything to anyone I feel horrible for the person he is targeting. For example today he threatened to fight the teacher and told him to shut the **** up multiple times. The teacher also has a hard time hearing as he is a older person and this kid makes fun of that all the time. I’m scared and can’t focus at all during class. The staff also can’t do much because he doesn’t care about any punishment he’s given. For example, he gets suspended. He takes that as free time away from school as he doesn’t care about graduating or grades. He gets detention. He skips it and doesn’t do it. He gets in trouble and has to write an apology. He just does that when he’s in a good mood and writes a message that has no emotion and is just carelessness. The school can’t punish him and he is just basically in control of everything.

I'm overweight for my sex, height and age. I eat junk. My mum is often out and so we just order takeaway/delivery food when she gets back. This has lead to me becoming slowly heavier over time. I'm now visibly chubby, though some of my weight is masked due to my height. My friends make fun of me every day. I hate them for it but they're my only friends. Also, during P.E. lessons, I am the last person to finish the lap. 30-ish other lads laughing at you while you are walking the second half of a warm-up lap is not a nice experience. Despite this, I don't go to the gym, despite having enough money. I just sit and play games instead.

I have poor hygiene. I only shower once a week, and that's because my dad makes me. I don't brush my teeth, because I forget. But even when I remember, I just can't be bothered. My friends also poke fun at me for my lack of showering, and have spread word throughout the entire year group that I don't shower often. Everybody knows thanks to them.

Considering moving again. I was unable to get restraining orders or police protection (complicated state laws and magistrates who outright ignored the law). 
My lawyer is working on getting my new physical address legally protected by the state behind a PO Box. I had to change all online accounts as they were hacked or had attempted hackings (most recently an attempt on my tax account, which rattled me as it has my employment and address info- after that I changed their address on file to a friend’s in another state). My ex continues sending me harassing messages through new numbers, stalking any social media I have left, and trying to break into anything online he can find. I don’t let apps or online things track my location. He hides behind proxy VPNs so his attempts are nearly impossible to prove legally, but all involve account names that are very specific to him, go after details only he would know, etc. Only my immediate family has my actual mailing address in a building with entrance code, and I don’t park there. I changed my car and the one I drive is not in my name. My name is not on the official apartment lease (I sublet). I shift between cities at random intervals and make sure my employment is mostly independent contractor type so that I can bounce. I changed my appearance some. I’m considering legally changing my name, if only I could do it without it being public notice. All of my friends know my situation and information is not being passed to him through them. I’ve run out of legal recourse. I own a gun. I don’t own a dog anymore and can’t at this point.

For some background, my boss (26F) and I (22F) quit our jobs in early December because we felt unsafe at work. We were actively involved in a harassment investigation against the vice president of the company who worked in the same building as us. He knew we were the reason for investigation, but he has a long history of harassing our team at work. He is extremely powerful and essentially untouchable; loads of city government contacts, company secrets, etc.

My boss and I have both feared retaliation since we left, and since he has a lot of money and lots of connections, he could easily retaliate without it ever pointing back to him. The man has all the characteristics of a narcissistic sociopath. I dont know what hes capable of. 

Last night I got home from a class at around 9:30. Since I live in a downtown area, I have to park in a parking garage. On the way up, I saw a woman in a car with her car on, headlights on, window down, and she was legit watching me as I drove past her. I've never had this happen before. 

I reached the next level where there was aan in his truck, turned on, watching me the entire time I drove in his field of vision. I'm getting freaked out. 

I park and wait a minute, locking my doors, hoping it was just a weird, creepy coincidence and that they'd go on their own ways.

634,"Hi everybody? My daughter recently graduated from college, and she got a job about two hours from home. She doesn't want to commute, so she's thinking of either renting or buying a place near her work. At first I advised her to buy, but as I've reconnected with her after 4 years away in college, I'm having second thoughts. She's 22 and single. I'm afraid at that age, being single and new to the workforce, things could change pretty quickly, so buying a place  might be a risky commitment to make. My fear is she'll want to sell in a year or two when there is not enough equity for her to make up for realtor commission and closing costs, and that she'll lose money. On the other hand, her job requires her to travel a lot, so renting seems like she's ""throwing away"" the money since she's hardly ever home. She's living with us right now, and my mom part would like her to stay, even though I'm glad she has the desire to become more independent. I just think staying with us would give her the opportunity to save money and a safe place to stay while she decides if she really likes her job, the city where she would move to, etc. She says staying with us is not an option.

636,"About 2 years ago, when I was in college, I spent a lot of time with one professor that would teach me whenever I came with questions. We hung out a lot but ALL of it was academic related. Yes, we would go to coffee or a walk but only to discuss academics. Plus this is pretty normal to do at small colleges with professors. 

Well a handful of professors did not like this professor, one of the only ways to fire a tenured professor is to have them abuse Title IX, in this case, that a professor had ""coerced me to sleep with them"". So next thing I knew I was swept up in this drama. First of all, the college did not follow Title IX protocol and they have updated their process. But by the time the college actually informed me what was going on, I was told they didn't want to hear from me and they wanted to insulate me from the investigation. Pretty much, I didn't matter nor did I have a voice, yet I was the supposed victim!  The professor I liked was uncomfortable around me or talking to me, other professors gave me side eye and avoided me etc. I eventually saw the evidence and realized I had been watched for months by the accusing professors. The rest of that year was filled with being bullied by the accusing professors. I even filed a complaint that went no where.

The good news was once the president got word of this investigation, they were appalled and dismissed the whole case and placed the entire department in mediation. It was clear to everyone that the accusation was bogus and that they were trying to get this professor fired. It was also clear that I wasn't a victim but merely a pawn. From that point on, the a\*\*hole professors were extremely uncomfortable around me, probably shame?

I graduated and I finally thought I was free from this. The good news was because of the drama, I actually became friends with the accused professor when I graduated. I came back to campus one day and accidentally crossed paths with one of the a\*\*hole professors that accused me and only hours later... the accused professor was emailed by the college that their personal life should not be at work and that I should no longer visit campus. (tell that to the professors that have students watch their babies in their office for free)

Basically, I am banned from my alma mater because I was used and made people uncomfortable and the college nervous.

Because of those accusations I lost focus and got off track in life and never really recovered. I feel like I don't matter, and the professor I am friends with to this day has some uncomfortableness of being seen in public with me. I really can't seem to move on. Any advice?",21Jan2020,1

We've already got a position description written up for her that the CIO is aware of. One that is much more fitting for her career goals and would hopefully make her much happier. 

But...my team, X, and I obviously have strong ties with Y and don't want to burn bridges. The bridge with Y is pretty important to all of us, both at work and personally.

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated. X is a great coworker and a valuable asset to any and all the work we do, despite not even being on our team, and we don't want her to quit without exhausting other options.

638,"To start off, my best friend(f43)and I(f44) have been more like sisters for 30 some odd years. I was dating a guy for about a year, we had moved in together but broke up due to his problems with drinking and verbally abusing me when he was drunk. I had enough and moved out. She knows all of the events. Was there for a few of them. 

Well, I just found out she's become friends with him in the past few weeks. Borrowed money from him, they talk about me and she gives him advice, etc. And, honestly, I don't care if they're friends. What I care about is she borrowed money from him to drop her son off at college, a trip she invited me to go on, without telling me the trip was being financed through my ex. And since we have been back, she has been ignoring me. And now I find out they have become good friends since this trip and she hadn't told me because she was afraid I would be upset. Wtf??? She texted me the other day to tell me he hired her to work at the restaurant he runs. But left out how much they had been hanging out and how close they had become. I told her I don't care if she's working for him, a job is a job. But to hide the fact that they've become good friends is insulting to me.",21Jan2020,1
639,"20F. I help working the lifts and snow tubing so I am on my feet in the freezing cold for around 7 hours. I understand this isn’t that long of a shift but for this kind of job it feels longer than it really is.

I know for a fact that if I leave my video games I can easily bump up my grades to 75 or 80 percent according to my calculations.

I would register at local colleges, but then surgeries or just plain extreme pain really prohibited me from completing anything.

646,"Now we all know do what you like, but think quality of life wise here as well, before you answer.

I used to want to be astronaut and I even started this last year my ECE engineering (in English language, I'm not native) studies to get there. But for few years I got lingering thoughts I don't really care about that.

That's beacuse I have second nature of being therian and well lets just say that on top of that I'd really like to work with animals. I have unfortunately high points from physics and math from equivalent of SATS, no biology or chemistry so for exmaple I can't go to veterinary school. But even though it's very hated and disliked subject (zootechnics) I'd like to work either in wild or in zoo. I know veterinarians can do that, and I was always good from biology and I could learn it from scratch easily, chemistry would be obstacle though, possible, but it would take all my time (that's of course for veterinary) So That's why I want to learn either veterinary or preferably study zootechnics as from what I know it allows for such jobs and I even wouldn't need to learn anything and have enough points to get accpeted ( I didn't do nation wide search yet, but where I study now I would get enlisted)

Now the main issue here is that I want a big house with garden (albeit far from city which reduces price) and to live with my animals. I really love them and that's all I need, but that's not a cheap dream and low wage won't cover that sufficiently. On top of that I would have to feel wrath of my parents which while already know about my therianthophy, think I still want to do same stuff (even though I really don't). I just asked father to send me my exams results ( I lied that friend asked for them) and they joked they wouldn't mentally surive if I wanted to change course and I know that they are serious about that part. Not sure how that would influence my life. And I'm not inventing new jobs, beacuse I slacked now, no, I have 4s from most subjects and I'm quite good at this stuff, but I just hate every subject and next years they will just get worse.

I just don't know what to think right now. My current studies will give me job that will fulfill my dream (and earn me tons of cash), but I'd hate my education and job. My more or less dream job wouldn't cover my dream (really low wage), but at least I would do what I like generally. Sure more research is needed here, but I need someone impartial here to point me out with some though-provoking statement.",21Jan2020,1
647,"Extremely long story short...I live in a small beach community where most residents are locals. A man in his 50’s has been approaching women of all ages, unsolicited, and attempts to follow them home, walk with them, counsel them, and try’s to get them to his home. This has been going on for over 30 years. People have allowed this behavior to continue but over 80 women in my community want it to finally stop. 

Some women have their young children with them when he approaches and tries to speak to them. Let me be clear, he is of sound mind and is not at all mentally challenged. I met him. He is a psychopath. He is persistent, manipulative, and cunning. I recognize this type of behavior from the child predator I put in prison last year. He looks for vulnerable women who aren’t with a man or who seems like an easy target. He is actively searching for a victim and playing the numbers game. He talks to older women and younger women. It’s like watching a program on predator 101 when you see this guy in action. 

I was harassed this last summer by him and I’ve seen him do this to two other women with my own eyes. I’ve taken photos of these encounters also. Over 80 women have said the same thing has happened to them (his MO is the same every time) and we all are getting increasingly more concerned. He lives down the street from me in an abandoned looking apartment complex his parents gave to him years ago. It literally looks like the place where women could be found locked up. No joke. 

I’ve been to the police, women are posting to the NextDoor app, and they know who this guy is. However, since he hasn’t done anything illegal, yet, there is nothing they can do. They have spoken to him but this behavior continues. 

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? What other precautions can I take to help the women in my community to feel safe? Although many women know who he is and to stay away from him, more don’t know and I want to know how I can educate my community against this type of behavior. Any advice would help.

648,"Its my first time renting an apartment, and its mostly pretty good, and I have very few qualms with it, but there's one thing that bothers the hell out of me. 

I'm generally a very considerate person, to a fault, and I worry constantly about every single noise that I make while in my apartment. I'm a nocturnal person, so I'm up during the night and I work from home, so I'm often working quite late.  I try and take extra steps to keep myself quiet because I know my sleep schedule is weird. 

I walk quietly from my office to bathroom, to kitchen, and I even closed the window in the office to try and keep the noise of me typing from waking people up (Im an incredibly fast typer and own a mechanical keyboard which...late at night can sound like someone sifting through a canister of legos.)

I know I need to do my work, so I try to type slowly and quietly, but even that I feel is too loud.  I never do anything super loud super late, one night I quietly swept up something that spilled, but I tried my hardest to be as quiet as possible about it. I make dinner as soon as I wake up and then cook nothing else, and wash the dishes immediately after before it gets too late.  I don't watch TV past ""quiet hour"" which starts at 8pm (which I think is rather early, but I signed the lease so I deal with it).  

During the day I sleep, and I drown out all the daytime noise (my complex is FAMOUS for constant hoards of screaming children) because they have the right to live and don't have to acquiesce to my bizarre circadian rhythm. I do manage to sleep fine after a bit and I've been this way since I was a kid, and nothing I do will keep me sleeping like a regular human.

I guess my question is how do I stop constantly worrying about disturbing the people downstairs? Not one of them has said anything to me about it yet, and its been half the month about, but I can't help but worry about it. Sometimes I'll relax a bit, and go about my day (night?), but then remember what time it is and go back to being as quiet as I can. 

I know apartment living isn't fun for anyone, and when you get an apartment you basically sign up for a certain level of noise, But I just wish I could relax into a quiet routine without basically helicoptering over and needlessly punishing myself.

652,"Hello Reddit,

The title pretty much tells the story, but here are some other relevant details for y'all. I am currently a student attending university in a town where the cost of living is very expensive. I am an only child and an only grandchild, so my family was able to save quite a bit of money to help me with school, including housing, and I am very, **very** grateful for that.

I am also an excellent student. I usually get straight A's, I'm on the Dean's list, etc. I genuinely enjoy learning. My family wants me to continue to do as well as possible, but they also subtly try to dictate what I should do with my life. This includes comments about when and where I should attend graduate school and pointed questions about ""what sort of job will I ever get with that sort of education?"" Side note, it's not like I'm majoring in underwater basketry or something, I'm in a STEM field, just not engineering. 

Lately, my family has fixated on the idea of buying a condo in town and letting me live there while I'm in school. For some more info, I cannot pay for my own housing. And yes, I have a job. Even if I were to work full time during the summer and quite a bit during the school year, I still wouldn't be able to pay the cost of rent in my town, plus my other expenses, especially if I'm trying to save money for when I graduate. So, my family is paying for housing one way or another, and they're glad to do it. Either they're paying out of my college fund for me to rent a place for a few years, or they can buy a place and rent it to someone else when I leave and hopefully recoup the investment when they sell.

Still, I know that living in an apartment owned by my family will come with some serious strings attached. Right now, I'm the stereotypical student floundering around and figuring out what I want to do with my life. However, I don't want to cause any huge rifts in my family.

So, folk of reddit, should I try to shut down this apartment idea in favor of me renting a place from a stranger, or should I just try to talk to my family about their unrealistic expectations for me. If so, how should I go about that? Thanks, Jdim8",21Jan2020,1

657,"In the last few months I have been liking on a guy who I've never even spoken to. I probably just like him for his face, confidence and popularity. I don't know what is going on my head, I don't even know this dude, never spoken to him, yet I've Facebook stalked him and I am NOT proud of it. I am aware he has a girlfriend, and for some reason I'm not even jealous of this. It's not a case of being able to avoid him, I've started a night course in the same university where he works, so seeing him time to time around the place is inevitable. I'm positive he's aware I exist and there is a possibility he knows my name (which I hate), through mutual acquaintances and fuckin' social media. So here comes the problem. I cannot stop crushing on him and it's pathetic. I am letting this obsession take over my head indulging in a lot of daydreaming like a teenage girl. I often deliberately go to wherever I know I will see him, making extra effort with my appearance, you get the idea. And in the events that I try to avoid running into him or if I do see him accidentally, I get incredibly awkward. I avoid eye contact, divert my gaze somewhere else, or deliberately act like he doesn't exist. No matter how much I try to forget about him I can't, and this is a pain. I have no interest in dating him, so that goes to show how superficial this crush is. However what I would like and what would probably help me stop fancying him is to say hi or have a conversation with him once. I can't see this happening anytime soon... Although I've stopped the social media stalking, I can see he's incredibly popular and well liked among his peers and friends, as well as being incredibly attractive. Meanwhile I'm quite shy, and fairly awkward. I always avoid looking him in the eyes if I'm ever near him, but then if I tried to be a normal person and smile or at least look somewhat friendly I'll come off as a creep. 

I am tired and hate this running my life. Every minute of the day this guy is running through my head. I am tired of wanting to see his face all the time, I am tired as coming off as incredibly socially retarded, rude and inept in the occasions that I do see him. Help me please.",21Jan2020,1
659,"So recently I have been striking out in the dating game. I understand that this is normal for basically everyone, but this dry spell has lasted for quite some time and I'm starting to feel concerned. I've begun having self-imaging problems, confidence issues, and have felt increasingly lonely over the past couple of months. This last point is emphasized often as I see more and more friends who have been in happy, long relationships or are recently married appearing so happy. I'm feeling rather lost and need some advise on how to prevent myself from going down what appears to be a downward slope of self-pity and depression.

Before I get into the details of my situation, let me give quick descriptions of myself so you have context. I am a materials engineering graduate student at a Big 10 school. I'm a 6'3"" bearded white man of average build. My best friend from undergrad (probably the only person who knows what I'm struggling with) said she'd rank me at about a 7 or 8 out of 10. Not amazing, but far from anything what you'd say is unattractive. I'm also you stereotypical nerd (e.g. I love video games, board games, and am a movies nut).  Pretty easy person to picture right? 

So let me give some background on some of the things that have clued me into the aforementioned issues. The first thing that happened to me was that recently I have been trying to reconnect with someone who I had once been very close to going out with. We had broken off any romantic relationships as she had been having a rough time when we met and felt that she wasn't at a point in life to pursue anything serious, but also expressed that if things had been less stressful, she thought something would have come of us. After giving her about a year where we were just friends, I asked her again if she wanted to try something. While she said she was improving, she declined for similar reasoning. We decided, however, to try and reconnect socially. I have since invited her to do several things, but she has been very aloof; promising to do something like watch a movie with me and then never responding in my attempts to schedule. However, whenever I am close to saying ""screw it, just break the connection"" she replies apologizing and the cycle begins anew. I've never been good at burning bridges or cutting ties, but I'm starting to think in this case I should, for my own mental health. 

The second thing comes from Tinder. Before I begin, I know that Tinder is always a rough area for dating. However, I have actually gotten several bites through my profile and had okay success in getting into conversations with people. They almost always teeter out in the end or feel highly one sided, but this happens to most people. Recently though, I got into a conversation with a girl in which we had a decent amount to discuss. She seemed interested in me and even gave me her number after I asked out to dinner. However, similar to the previous girl, she ghosted me the moment I asked for specifics in scheduling a date, despite me feeling that I had done nothing different than our previous talks. 

These two people led me to believe that I had two different dates for this past weekend, and it ended up that I had none. These trends of people say yes initially to my advances and then declining or ghost me later has happened again and again over the last few years, which to me hits harder than someone just straight up say no. My best friend thinks that I am some how attracted to these women, as unhealthy as it seems, and I am beginning to find truth in her words. She basically stated ""you should search for a mentally healthy individual."" It seems that I am attracted to the forbidden fruit in a way; people who are either already in a relationship which I would never ask out for obvious reasons or people who show little to no romantic feels toward me. She has even suggested that I see a therapist about these problems out of concern for my mental well being. 

These problems, I feel, have begun to effect the rest of my life. I've been feeling increasingly lonely, despite having numerous friends who I often hang out with. I have begun to have an increases lack of interest in several areas of my life as well. I know these are all telltale signs of depression, but when I think of going to a therapist, I don't really know what I would say for my reasoning for visiting is as these are really quite recent.

So what I'm ask for advice on is: how should I approach this? Does it sound like a situation a therapist would help with or does is just sound like a stream of bad luck and a funk that will go away? Also, should I break ties with the first girl? Finally, where should I go to meet people who wouldn't have the same problems as I described above? I am more of an introvert and have never been amazing at going to the common places people suggest like clubs, the gym, etc., though I'm willing to try. Any help or words of advice would be greatly appreciated. 

 TL;DR : My recent romantic endeavors have been failing, potentially as a result of the women I pursue, and it seems that other areas of my life are being effected by it. My friend has even suggested I see a therapist about my problems.",21Jan2020,1
660,"Disclaimer: not asking for money. I'm asking for advice on how to help my situation.

I recently got my hours cut down from 80 to 64 per paycheck, and it has seriously affected my budget. Rent for me is $800 and I barely make $650 a paycheck. I have no health insurance and was denied again last night despite my decrease in income, and I can't afford my work insurance. Couldn't at 80 hours either. 

I'm gonna need to cancel my internet, buy only canned foods, if I can even afford that. My hobby has been destroyed because of this. My hope of starting a YouTube channel for cosplay tutorials is currently diminishing. I've become horribly depressed and my bipolar disorder is out of hand, I'm so worried I won't be able to afford my prescriptions soon and I've been getting steady, concerning tooth aches from the half tooth I have and the one below it that is crumbling away as well.

Problem is, I absolutely adore my job. It's a dream to be able to work on artwork while at work, and I love being the one to look over our location's numbers at the end of each day and being able to locate problems and most of the time solve them. I'm a good worker and have been there nearly three years. But now I'm so depressed that my apartment is disgusting. I can hardly convince myself to eat or even take care of my basic needs. I can't leave my apartment to do anything besides go to work. All I do is sit and vegetate and feel either numb or sad.

662,"Hello, I live in a mobile home park. I have three cats, and one dog. I’ve lived in this park for 19 years, and have always had multiple animals, mainly cats. Now before, there already was a limit on how many dogs you could have and there were breed restrictions. The limit was two. Now, out of nowhere they changed the rule. Only two pets allowed, both need to be registered and you’ll be paying $10 for each. $100 fine for any unregistered pets. Before cats were an exception to the limit, but now you can only have two animals. I have four. Two are older cats that my family and I rescued from this park years ago when they were kittens. Third cat is a few months old kitten that we rescued at the factory my grandma works at. This kitten imprinted on me and became my little baby so fast, I love her so much. She climbs on my shoulder and cuddles so sweetly. She helps tremendously when I’m having bouts of anxiety and sadness. Our dog is a very, very old mutt that my grandma adopted.

I don’t want to get rid of any of my pets. I’m not willing to. For one, I don’t know anyone that would take my pets in, and I especially want it to be someone I’m familiar with if I ABSOLUTELY have to. I don’t trust just anyone to care for my pets and  treat them as they should. I definitely do not want them to end up in shelters, especially my two older cats and dog. I know the chances of them being adopted are very, very slim. My boyfriend offered to take my kitten in, but his parents said she needs to stay in the basement, and I’m also very worried they will try to declaw her like they’ve done to their cats before. 
I’ve talked to people in the park that also have pets, and a lot of others are upset about the new rule as well. I even commented on the park’s Facebook, asking them to reconsider, I even told them how hard it is to rehome elder pets. Their response was that they’d “speak with upper management.” Haven’t heard anything else. My grandmother’s friend also tagged our local humane society in the post, and the Park suddenly made it so only friends could view the post. This leads me to suspicion that they’re maybe doing something they shouldn’t be doing.

He got mad when I didn’t send a heart at the end of a message. He made me hang out with him. He told me he had anxiety and depression from being bullied at a previous school, but no one else from his previous school knows anything about this bullying. He also lied a lot about things ranging from little to big. He even forced me to let him touch me up.

I broke up with him in November and he threatened suicide multiple times, and begged and begged to get back together. Then, he told me it was all my fault and he would never acted this way if I had shown him more love (even though I hung out with him a lot and we texted for about six hours a day on average!). 

Ever since then, I’ve been filled with a deep sense of guilt and I cry randomly. It isn’t from heartbreak because I was happy when I finally got the guts to break up with him after being unhappy for multiple months. 

What can I do to get over these feelings?",21Jan2020,1
664,"My boyfriend and I share an apartment with one of my friends. Lately my friend's girlfriend has been over A LOT. Like I don't know the last time she went home. She lives with her parents but I'm not sure she's even been home in weeks. She's also here by herself a lot which our roommate didn't ask us if we were okay with. Idk if she has a key or anything but she's over here all the time while no one else is home. 

They mostly keep to themselves other than leaving a gross messy kitchen which has slightly improved since we talked to them about it. The girlfriend is nice enough, just kinda weird.

We've had a discussion a few months ago about the girlfriend moving in, we said we'd be okay with it but there needs to be an adjustment in rent if that happens, because we don't think it's fair for a 4th person to live here for free. Even if they're not taking up extra space, it's not fair to have someone using the utilities/internet/etc. on our dime.

Well the girlfriend has no job and doesn't seem to be looking. And now she never goes home. She seems to be living here for free. How do we approach this without being jerks? We live in the Denver area so I know it's not the easiest place to get a job but it's also expensive as hell to live here. I want to be sensitive to her not having a job but it doesn't seem like she's looking, and it's not like she has no place else to go (it sounds like her family life is perfectly tolerable so there's no huge reason why she can't continue living with her parents into she's financially capable of paying rent here). She also doesn't have a car but there are plenty of places to look for work within walking or bus distance, we're right next to a major bus route that goes to the light rail station so you can get around pretty easily with public transportation from our apartment. 

I also kinda feel like they might deny that she's actually living here because I don't think she's really moved in much of her stuff... what metric do you use to determine where someone lives? Is it where they keep all their stuff or where they sleep most nights? Should we put down ground rules about how many nights she can sleep here before we determine that she's technically living here?

Also we're not sure what a fair adjustment of rent would look like. As it is the rent is split evenly 3 ways... what's a fair proposal for splitting the rent going forward if our roommate's girlfriend is living here now? My boyfriend wants an even 4-way split but I kinda feel like rent should be somewhat proportional to the space that you occupy (if one person gets a tiny room and the other gets a big room, doesn't make sense that they should pay the same rent). The girlfriend doesn't take up any extra space, they're both in the master bedroom together and haven't requested any extra kitchen space or anything. My boyfriend and I took the upstairs area which is a bedroom, bathroom, and office space. I just think there needs to be some adjustment because if it were the other way around, it wouldn't be fair for my boyfriend and I to move in a 4th person but still expect our roommate to pay one third of the rent. 

Sorry for bazillion questions but this is our first time living with a roommate and we've been here about a year, we're not sure what the etiquette is regarding frequent visitors.",21Jan2020,1
665,"Hello. I am a 23 yo male and I have a penis problem. 2 years ago I masturbated too much to the point of hurting my penis. I stopped masturbating for some weeks to reset the system but since, my penis is in pain when erect, significantly smaller in size, it is a bit demorphed in some spots like there is something that inhibits the blood from flowing, and when flaccid it is stiff/hard. I've gone to two urologists, they say I'm fine and the ultrasound shows everything ok. But I am still in pain (sometimes mild sometimes strong) and I can't have sex like this. When I masturbate I am also in pain and I feel like I have a small ring around my penis pressing it. My confidence is below the bottom, I am anxious all the time and I can't stop thinking about it. My mood is just bad since it happened and my life has gotten a lot worse. I also believe I am addicted to porn. In 2 years the penis thing was supposed to have been fixed.

670,"My little brother is a sophomore in high school. He's been failing nearly every class and having to take credit recovery classes. He has said he's not going to college, which is fine. College is not the right path for everyone and there's other options. The problem is he doesn't even want to finish high school. He wants to drop out. 

I told him he's going to end up being 20 years old finishing high school. He told me he doesn't care and that he'll just drop out. I've tried to tell him he will not be able to get a job to sustain any sort of at least semi-comfortable lifestyle without an education. He also mentioned doing online school which might be the best option for him. He's in a blended class (half online, half in the classroom)  that he has an A in, although it's not a core academic class. My mom probably won't be on board with online schooling though.

Our mom also doesn't want him to get a job because he's failing his classes, though I think him getting a job might benefit him. He's failing even without a job, so what's the difference at this point? Plus getting a job might show him what kind of income he'd have if he drops out of high school.

He has not mentioned wanting to get a GED instead. He repeatedly says school is not for him and blames his high school. I've offered to help him with his school work, but he declines. He won't ask his teachers for help either. He wants to transfer to another school because he thinks it will be easier. I guess he has a couple friends there who ""do nothing"" and are still getting better grades than he currently is.

TLDR: Brother is failing almost all of his classes and wants to drop out of high school. How do I help him see the importance of finishing?",21Jan2020,1

672,"My mother constantly uses our family as as a venting outlet. I suspect this is the reason why my father spends as little time home as possible. On most days, she will find something to complain about and vent at us to relieve her frustration. It could be anything, something that happened at work, someone didnt call her when they were supposed to, someone dropped something on the floor, etc.

To give you an idea, multiple times throughout the day, she will walk into my room for the sole purpose to complain to me about something. Most of the time, its about something really minor. I dont want to sound callous, but really, its getting old and im tired of listening to these minor complaints that are on the level of ""someone did something I didnt like at work"". Shes not asking for advice or anything, she just wants to vent at someone.

It gets particularly bad when our family does something she doesnt approve because she will launch into a 15+ minute tirade and I will be thinking ""this is something minor, why complain about it?"". One day, she walked into my room multiple times just to complain that I hadn't eaten any bananas that day and this was really unfair because she had gone to the trouble of buying them from the supermarket. 

She just made it seem like a huge problem and it got worse when I tried to tell her that I did, in fact, eat one that day...she didnt believe me and kept saying she didnt ""see it happen"". The constant interruptions over a bunch of banans were utterly pointless.

674,"I’m looking for some advice, maybe someone that can speak from personal experience, or just something to keep my friend going. I’m on mobile and a bit emotional so pardon formatting and mistakes and all of that. 

My best friend, ade, has a younger sister, kat, that’s clinically depressed. Ade is 22 and Kat is 20. In sum she’s tried to overdose 4 times, once today actually. Twice on ibuprofen, once on her antidepressants and once today with her brothers antidepressants. Outside of attempt of overdose she actually bought a gun, called her brother and told him she was going to kill herself with the gun and then hung up sending ade and I on a wild goose chase trying to track her down and “save” her. Every single attempt has been unsuccessful. 

Some background on family: their mother is garbage to put it lightly. Takes their money, very rude and inconsiderate, tells Kat constantly that she’s a disappointment and has called the police on her multiple times under false pretenses when Kat isn’t obeying her. 

Things that have been tried: 
She’s been to multiple therapists, psychologist, psychiatrists and claims that she just doesn’t like them or they make her uncomfortable or they just don’t help. 
She’s been on several different medications but refuses to take them consistently and again, claims that they don’t help. 
She’s moved all over the United States, literally, in search of a more stable environment. She was living with her mom but that didn’t work for obvious reasons so she moved in with me and Ade but that wasn’t working so she moved BACK with her mom and again it didn’t work so she moved to California to live with her dad but claimed she didn’t like it over there so she comes back to Texas to LIVE WITH HER MOM and now she’s back with us again. 
She’s been checked into inpatient facilities willingly but leaves maybe 2 or 3 days into treatment because she hates it there. 

I’m to the point now where I honestly don’t want her around me. I’m afraid to walk around my own house in fear of finding her overdosed somewhere. I sadly don’t care for her anymore because she’s made ades life very hard. He’s putting all of his goals and dreams aside for his sister and she’s just draining him. 

I’m confident I’m missing important information so just ask whatever you might need to know in the comments and I’ll do my best to be as forthcoming as possible. Thanks in advance.

675,"Looking for relationship advice. My best friend (f) and I (m) have been friends since college and have had a great platonic relationship over the last decade, one that I was always proud of as an example of how men and women can be just friends. I always tell my friends that I love them when I say goodbye, but recently she told me that she ""loves me"" loves me and wants to go full throttle and start dating. I understand that feelings get caught but the tough thing is that I work for her and ever since I told her that I have no interest in being more than what we are, she's been difficult to be around. I know that she took a chance sharing her feelings and that she might need time to figure out how to be herself again, but every time I have seen her since then she always makes some passive aggressive dig on me about some shit that only she knows bothers me, or if I do something that upsets her and then I apologize, she won't accept the apology and tries to be mean or hurt my feelings intentionally. It's getting difficult to navigate this because she has anxiety and depression and one small thing will set her off for weeks at a time. She also hasn't spoken to any of her friends about her feelings so I have to be the one to talk her through how to process me turning her down and the fact that I work for her makes it feel impossible to speak up for myself when I'm being mistreated.

I feel like I'm missing out on the inquisitiveness of youth, all of those things I could do if I had my own kitchen and living areas.

The situation is that I cannot move out because the whole reason I moved in is because I wanted to be close to my partner, but my partner's family relies on him heavily to keep their home heated (wood stove), and help renovate the house still (it's very old, needs work).

685,"I’m embarrassed to post this, because I’ve been trying to work on it a lot recently and haven’t had too much success. Please pardon the length of the text, i have trouble explaining it well. 

Recently, I’ve been trying to improve my diet to stay healthy and instill lifelong good eating habits. I have always been a very plain eater, meaning I stick to the same kinds of foods. I don’t eat any junk food, just vegetables, meat (chicken and occasionally beef), grains (quinoa), some dairy, and carbs (pastas, bread, oatmeal). I haven’t had any diagnosed eating disorders, but I sometimes don’t eat enough. I eat most common foods, but get stomach aches after eating foods like pizza and fried stuff. I’ve been trying to eat foods that are both healthy and  convenient. My typical meal requires a bunch of prep, which I’m happy to do, but I need to adapt for different life circumstances. By this, I mean if I’m traveling or eating lunch at work, I want to be able to take sandwiches or salads or buy these at a restaurant. 

What is the most difficult for me is the texture and consistency of the foods I’m trying to eat. This sounds weird, but eating any kind of fruit or raw vegetable just make me really uncomfortable. The physical act of doing it makes me gag sometimes. I have successfully tried some new things, like yogurt and spinach, but have done so by eating yogurt that tastes like vanilla and cooking my vegetables with spices and oils to taste good.  I have tried to eat some fruits like bananas and oranges, but the consistency and texture again just throw me off. I put bananas into smoothies to make sure I’m getting the nutrients from it, but still can’t eat them by themselves. The same goes with things like sandwiches and putting vegetables and cheese in them.  I also can’t eat salads. 

I have been trying to improve myself because my friends and family eats these foods for their meals and I don’t want to inconvenience them or myself. I tend to make meals like quinoa, broccoli, and chicken, but the process take a while. It separates me from everyone when we all go somewhere to eat or plan a meal in the house. 

I feel like a little kid. Shouldn’t I be able to do this? It’s just food for Christ’s sake. I’m in my twenties and get so upset with myself. I know I need to learn how to eat these foods for my health and convenience sake. How do I work on expanding my eating habits?",21Jan2020,1

697,"I’m a F with only one friend. My friendship circle used to be much larger, but as time goes on it dwindled down to one real best friend who knows everything about me, and a couple who I’m somewhat friends/acquaintances with. I love my best friend so much. She means everything to me, she is so funny and beautiful and has such a strong and raging personality that is hard to ignore. She is always the center of attention not because she wants to be, but because that is just her. It perfectly combats my tendencies to be more introverted and we are so close we have secret languages just by giving each other looks or saying certain words. I can’t see myself being so close with anyone else.

Currently I am living with my cousin who is M and about our age. My friend and my cousin used to have a “thing,” they talked, fucked, hung out on their own, etc but never dated. Eventually that ended, which was fine. No hard feelings.

But then, on New Years, they both got really drunk and fucked in the shower. My friend thought there was more to it, but my cousin said he was just drunk and doesn’t feel the same way sober. My friend said she felt used and started hating my cousin.

Recently my cousin asked me to spend the night at my friends house so I could drop him off at some party along the way. So I asked my friend, and explained the whole situation to her, which might have been a mistake. There have been other situations in which my friend believes my cousin used her, but I won’t go into that. She got mad at me, saying how much she hated my cousin and how she felt like the both of us just used her for weed/dabs, an excuse to go places, a place to stay, sex (just my cousin obv) etc. 

Now she is not speaking to me. I got into a huge argument with her and I tried to explain to her how I could never use her, how she means so much more to me, and how I could see how she got that impression and I was sorry for that. I think I convinced her that my intentions never were to use her, but she doesn’t want anything to do with my cousin and since he lives with me and I’m so close to him, that includes me too.

It is true that my cousin uses people. He is not the best person, has a felony, and probably will not finish school. He lives with us because his dad does not want him. I love him but he has admitted to me before that he uses girls and people to get what he wants. 

My friend told me that she needed space but she didn’t tell me for how long. She said she wanted to remain friends, but not be as close. I can’t imagine my life without her. She keeps me sane and I would go crazy and be so lonely if I didn’t have her. I feel like a clingy girlfriend in a relationship, but I love her so damn much and if she didn’t want to be as close I would be so depressed and not know what to do anymore. I have a tendency to fall in and out of depression, and when I do, I lose all motivation to do good in school and I don’t want to ruin my education/career/life over this. I had been doing so good on keeping up with school lately, but I’m scared that losing her will push me back into that rut. 

I feel like I am caught in the crossfire of a terrible situation that I am not involved in, and I am the one paying for it. I know I need to give her space which is fine, but what if she never comes back or it never returns to how it was before? What if I lose her, my only best friend? I do not know how to make more friends at all. A lot of people know who I am, but none have made an effort to be friends with me, so I feel it is impossible to make new ones. How do I get my best friend back?",21Jan2020,1
698,"Firstly, and I know this is VERY wierd, but I would like to know if it is normal to feel a... I guess physical attraction... To a non-existent cartoon character. I feel a strong connection and attraction to the character itself instead of the voice actor. I think this is wierd, but I am wondering if anyone out there has experienced the same or similar circumstances?

Here is where I need advice.
My boyfriend and I tell each other everything. I haven't told him about the physical attraction I have to said character, however, we know most, if not all of each others ""kinks"" or interests. I dont know if I should tell him this. He may think it's weird. This is why I was asking (above) if this was normal, so that I could make a rational decision, coupled with the advice I may or may not recieve.

I know this topic is a bit strange. I have kept this a secret from everyone for a few years. It is getting to me. I dont know if I should tell anyone though.

To those of you willing to help and give some solid advice, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",21Jan2020,1

It’s sad, but happens all the time. Finally he said something to me one day and I asked him if his WIFE would think so too... since then he has been such a dick to me. Without getting into too much detail, he did me wrong and practically ruined my character within my company because he’s a gossip QUEEN and spews out incorrect information to our other coworkers. I let this all go because I didn’t have proof. 


Well.... today he was talking to someone on the phone (judging by the convo, it did not sound like his wife) and he started asking her what she was wearing and doing. She said laying in bed, he said send me a pic, she sent a pic (I could tell by his response to her) and then he kept responding by saying send me a pic of your V, then he said “I’ll go into the bathroom and send you one. I’m at work right now, but send me pics now”... talking about how he’s going to take a pic of his D and send to her. 

So here’s the catch.... I got an audio recording of all 9 mins of this. Look, I’m not trying to ruin the guys life- I just need advice on how I should use this to my advantage and for future issues.

700,"I have a friend who I have known and been close with for almost my whole life. Our relationship has always been fine. However, we were recently working on a short film together. I had written the script for it, as well as putting everything into action. I saw it as my project and that she was just helping me out with it. But she started taking over the project and acting like I didn't know what I was doing, even though the whole thing was my creation. She also started conversing with a couple of the actors behind my back, changed the script several times, and said awful things to me and some of the actors.

I finally decided to cancel the project because it was getting to be too much for me. Everyone else involved with the movie is fine with quitting, but she won't stop trying to get me to start it back up again.

705,"So recently I have been striking out in the dating game. I understand that this is normal for basically everyone, but this dry spell has lasted for quite some time and I'm starting to feel concerned. I've begun having self-imaging problems, confidence issues, and have felt increasingly lonely over the past couple of months. This last point is emphasized often as I see more and more friends who have been in happy, long relationships or are recently married appearing so happy. I'm feeling rather lost and need some advise on how to prevent myself from going down what appears to be a downward slope of self-pity and depression.

Before I get into the details of my situation, let me give quick descriptions of myself so you have context. I am a materials engineering graduate student at a Big 10 school. I'm a 6'3"" bearded white man of average build. My best friend from undergrad (probably the only person who knows what I'm struggling with) said she'd rank me at about a 7 or 8 out of 10. Not amazing, but far from anything what you'd say is unattractive. I'm also you stereotypical nerd (e.g. I love video games, board games, and am a movies nut).  Pretty easy person to picture right?

So let me give some background on some of the things that have clued me into the aforementioned issues. The first thing that happened to me was that recently I have been trying to reconnect with someone who I had once been very close to going out with. We had broken off any romantic relationships as she had been having a rough time when we met and felt that she wasn't at a point in life to pursue anything serious, but also expressed that if things had been less stressful, she thought something would have come of us. After giving her about a year where we were just friends, I asked her again if she wanted to try something. While she said she was improving, she declined for similar reasoning. We decided, however, to try and reconnect socially. I have since invited her to do several things, but she has been very aloof; promising to do something like watch a movie with me and then never responding in my attempts to schedule. However, whenever I am close to saying ""screw it, just break the connection"" she replies apologizing and the cycle begins anew. I've never been good at burning bridges or cutting ties, but I'm starting to think in this case I should, for my own mental health.

The second thing comes from Tinder. Before I begin, I know that Tinder is always a rough area for dating. However, I have actually gotten several bites through my profile and had okay success in getting into conversations with people. They almost always teeter out in the end or feel highly one sided, but this happens to most people. Recently though, I got into a conversation with a girl in which we had a decent amount to discuss. She seemed interested in me and even gave me her number after I asked out to dinner. However, similar to the previous girl, she ghosted me the moment I asked for specifics in scheduling a date, despite me feeling that I had done nothing different than our previous talks.

These two people led me to believe that I had two different dates for this past weekend, and it ended up that I had none. These trends of people say yes initially to my advances and then declining or ghost me later has happened again and again over the last few years, which to me hits harder than someone just straight up say no. My best friend thinks that I am some how attracted to these women, as unhealthy as it seems, and I am beginning to find truth in her words. She basically stated ""you should search for a mentally healthy individual."" It seems that I am attracted to the forbidden fruit in a way; people who are either already in a relationship which I would never ask out for obvious reasons or people who show little to no romantic feels toward me. She has even suggested that I see a therapist about these problems out of concern for my mental well being.

These problems, I feel, have begun to effect the rest of my life. I've been feeling increasingly lonely, despite having numerous friends who I often hang out with. I have begun to have an increases lack of interest in several areas of my life as well. I know these are all telltale signs of depression, but when I think of going to a therapist, I don't really know what I would say for my reasoning for visiting is as these are really quite recent.

So what I'm ask for advice on is: how should I approach this? Does it sound like a situation a therapist would help with or does is just sound like a stream of bad luck and a funk that will go away? Also, should I break ties with the first girl? Finally, where should I go to meet people who wouldn't have the same problems as I described above? I am more of an introvert and have never been amazing at going to the common places people suggest like clubs, the gym, etc., though I'm willing to try. Any help or words of advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR : My recent romantic endeavors have been failing, potentially as a result of the women I pursue, and it seems that other areas of my life are being effected by it. My friend has even suggested I see a therapist about my problems.",21Jan2020,1

713,"So I met this girl through my boyfriend. At first I thought she was really cool, so sweet (I still think this) But after over a year of friendship I started to realize it wasn't a friendship. She would always come to me only when she had issues or problems. I also noticed that she had a lot of healed self-cutting scars but I did not comment or say anything because I know that everyone has their own personal problems. She comes from a very privileged background.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to notice she would invite all her other friends to these events her summer home and vacation but never bothered to invite me or my bf. She would never ask me how I am doing only when and after she talks about her personal issues (issues that in all honestly were not real issues, but issues she would create for herself.) We were supposed to do something for my birthday this month but instead she cancelled last minute and decide to go on vacation with herself and a mutual friend. I thought that was shady as hell and decided that personally she wasn't a friend and that I would distnce myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Than I wake up to frantic messages from her, and videos of her crying and drunk.. (she has a substance problem) not sure why. My bf perplexed tried to listen to the videos 5 times and we both couldn't make out what she was saying it appeared that she didn't 'feel safe' even though she was currently in a million dollar summer home overseas. I just don't understand this person and I feel used, like she only comes to me to be her therapist and as I get older I just did not want these types of friends around me. WHy does she always come to me with this heavy stuff, i asked my bf why can't she go to her friends she goes on vacay with? Who sends someone 6-10 videos of them crying having a breakdown?

Was I rude to ignore her? Am I a bad friend? At the end of the day i consider myself to be a good kind person who wants to help others but not at the expense of myself.

718,"A little background before I get into my main question:

In late July of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with Epithelioid sarcoma. For the purposes of this post, all that really matters is that since diagnosis, he's undergone chemo and radiation but is now considered stage 4 because the cancer metastasized. Since the radiation and form of chemo he was on clearly wasn't working, he finished his third round of chemo in the beginning of October and will soon start an experimental trial.

Ever since his diagnosis, I've been bombarded by people asking me how he's doing. I completely understand their concerns and do my best to provide updates via social media to cut down on the number of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, acquaintances, etc. individually reaching out to me. It's not that I don't want to talk with people about what's going on, it's just exhausting answering the same questions and trying to calm other people's fears. Most people seem to have caught on to this and will wait until I've posted an update before asking new questions.

Then there's my mom. We talk on the phone at least three or four times a week, and every single time, she asks how my husband's doing. When he was still going through chemo and radiation, it made sense for her to ask multiple times a week how he's feeling; however, it's been nearly four months since his last treatment. Yes, he's undergone a tumor removal surgery since his last round of chemo, but that was two months ago and he's been fine for at least the past month and a half. It's getting to the point that I'm admittedly getting a bit curt when she asks how he's doing. I mean, if he was fine two days ago, what makes her think he's suddenly not going to be OK today?

I guess the biggest reasons it annoys me when she asks how he's feeling/doing are:

1) It's a constant reminder that he has cancer. She certainly didn't ask how he was feeling/doing multiple times a week before he was diagnosed.

2) If he's not doing well, I'll let her know; there's no need to prod me as if I'm hiding something.

3) He's been working full time and we've even gone on a family vacation since his tumor removal surgery (he also worked on and off between his chemo and radiation treatments). If he wasn't doing well, he wouldn't be going on with his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to *nicely* ask my mom to stop asking how my husband is doing? I know that once he starts his new treatment plan I'll likely be getting a LOT of questions from people who mean well but don't understand that there are times I just want to live life without thinking/talking about cancer; the last thing I need is my mom compounding the situation by asking every two days what's going on.",21Jan2020,1

I was trying to get my teachers attention because I needed to go to the bathroom, all while my friend was sitting behind me talking to another girl. Right before i am about to leave to go to the bathroom, her friend says out lound that were were flirting (because I threw the hat). And i blushed so god damn hard, making it look like i actually was «flirting». And right after that I go to the toilet since that was my mission all along. When i come back, all of the class is whispering and EVERYONE knew what had happened. They all asked me why I went to the toilet right after i blushed so hard, and now everyone thinks i like her.

721,"First a disclaimer, I'm on mobile, so formatting might be off. English isn't my native language, so if you see any mistakes, please point them out so I can change them. Tldr at the bottom. 

I (28,F) got a job just shy of a year ago. I had a bumpy start, but things are going well now. Or so I thought. I work in a profession in which I have a schedule and people can make appointments to get advice or a specific product. This is as specific as I'm gonna make it, for privacy reasons.

During my year at this firm, I have learned a lot and still have much to learn. Overall I get along with the people working here very well. Lately my schedule has been quite empty, also due to the fact that I have to be at a certain location which doesn't draw to many people. I do however need to be present at that certain location because of deals my firm made in the past. When the other location is busy, I bring in work I can do, but otherwise I have to just sit and wait there.  

Every now and then, a certain coworker will ""joke"" about me not working hard. When he does, I ask him if he can elaborate on that, but he always say its just a joke and that men will tell those kind of jokes. I always let it slide, cause I don't know what to do with it. I don't plan my own schedule, so I can't help it if it's empty. 

Today a different coworker asked me if I would be at the busy location Friday and if I could perform a certain measurement. I told him I couldn't do that, because I have Fridays off since the beginning of January. He responded with a joke about how women work less and that they should better stop working overall. I responded that not everyone would agree that quitting my job would be best. He asked for an example, so I named my coworker, onto whom my entire workload would fall. He then responded that it wouldn't make any difference, because it wouldn't add any workload. With this he kind of insinuated that I don't do anything. I just looked at him, not quite understanding yet what he implied and he left.

I just don't know what to do with this. How should I handle this? This conversation left me feeling terrible and I don't know if I should say anything and if yes, how I should mention it. Any advice is very welcome!

I know her account is real, but what if she doesnt actually like me? How do I know she isn't just playing with me?",21Jan2020,1

728,"Now we all know do what you like, but think quality of life wise here as well, before you answer.

I used to want to be astronaut and I even started this last year my ECE engineering (in English language, I'm not native) studies to get there. But for few years I got lingering thoughts I don't really care about that.

That's beacuse I have second nature of being therian and well lets just say that on top of that I'd really like to work with animals. I have unfortunately high points from physics and math from equivalent of SATS, no biology or chemistry so for exmaple I can't go to veterinary school. But even though it's very hated and disliked subject (zootechnics) I'd like to work either in wild or in zoo. I know veterinarians can do that, and I was always good from biology and I could learn it from scratch easily, chemistry would be obstacle though, possible, but it would take all my time (that's of course for veterinary) So That's why I want to learn either veterinary or preferably study zootechnics as from what I know it allows for such jobs and I even wouldn't need to learn anything and have enough points to get accpeted ( I didn't do nation wide search yet, but where I study now I would get enlisted)

Now the main issue here is that I want a big house with garden (albeit far from city which reduces price) and to live with my animals. I really love them and that's all I need, but that's not a cheap dream and low wage won't cover that sufficiently. On top of that I would have to feel wrath of my parents which while already know about my therianthophy, think I still want to do same stuff (even though I really don't). I just asked father to send me my exams results ( I lied that friend asked for them) and they joked they wouldn't mentally surive if I wanted to change course and I know that they are serious about that part. Not sure how that would influence my life. And I'm not inventing new jobs, beacuse I slacked now, no, I have 4s from most subjects and I'm quite good at this stuff, but I just hate every subject and next years they will just get worse.

I just don't know what to think right now. My current studies will give me job that will fulfill my dream (and earn me tons of cash), but I'd hate my education and job. My more or less dream job wouldn't cover my dream (really low wage), but at least I would do what I like generally. Sure more research is needed here, but I need someone impartial here to point me out with some though-provoking statement.",21Jan2020,1
729,"Hello All!

So, I have been trying to be more self-disciplined, though I can't ever seem to hold myself accountable or punish myself for not completing what I set out to do, and it's starting to annoy me and also affect my work (since I am self-employed).

So I am wondering, is there any bootcamps, or something that could help me become more self-disciplined, or at least, make it a lot more serious? As I know it's absolutely fundamental for my success though I can't seem to take it seriously and I don't want to leave it until its too late

734,"Disclaimer:  I am NOT looking for legal advice or more money.  The will can’t be changed even if I wanted it to.  I’m not looking to take money out of my aunts’ pockets

My grandpa recently passed away, and one of my aunts had a discussion with me the other night about his will. I should really start by saying that my relationship with my grandpa has always been strained. I felt that he had a weird focus on me growing up and he has always been highly critical of others. His family (and me for sure) were no exception. My mom had a difficult relationship with him as well, but I’m less clear on the details. She passed away 6 years ago.


Anyway, after my mom died my grandpa had mentioned something about her portion of his will would now go to me, and that my 3 surviving aunts would still get their 25% each as planned. Pretty normal as far as wills go. Well, my aunt told me that my grandpa changed it, and that now I will get 10% which will be in a trust (where she would be in control) that I will get when I’m 39. I will also receive a cash portion in the coming months. She said his reasoning was that it my mother borrowed a lot of money from him, and that he spent a lot on her cancer treatments.


Part of me is angry. My grandpa made no secret of telling me how disappointed he was by my mom. He hated that she and I both dropped out of school even though I’m now going back and my mom ended up creating a good career for herself. The amount she borrowed from him is a drop in the bucket compared to what he had.  And of course, she couldn’t help getting cancer.  I feel a bit punished to be honest. I feel that she would have been punished. But on the other hand, I feel guilty for thinking any of that at all. I don’t want to complain about getting money. I’m annoyed that I would have to ask my aunt for anything from my trust. I feel like I’m not seen as an adult. I don’t want to bring it up to my aunts, even though I think they’d want to know my honest feelings. Well, I know for sure the one aunt would since she said so.  How do I deal with this? Should I bother saying anything at all?


TL;DR I’m not sure if I have the right to be upset about my grandpa’s will",21Jan2020,1
736,"Long story short, my guy friend would do all the things a guy would do if he was interested in a female. Some things he would do,  pull me in for tight hugs, broke the touch barrier etc.  My friends even thought he had interest in me. 
At first I didn’t have feelings for him but I started to catch them the more closer we got. He never clarified what we were (I should have asked him sooner).
Recently he stopped making effort to come and talk to me, so I decided to ask him what I am to him so I knew where I stood with him. He answered saying I am a very good friend to him. 

I’m not sure what to do from here. I have these strong feelings for him and It’s really painful. Should I continue to be his friend and ignore the pain or should I stay away? I would appreciate some advice thanks.",21Jan2020,1
737,"So I work at a retail store. My job here revolves around e-commerce website management, social media marketing (with zero budget, so I'm really just posting on social media and making youtube videos), sales, inventory, etc. General retail store things. I have been here for 10 years. It's a store that I genuinely love. It's a staple in our city and has been here for 55 years. At one point, it was the biggest store in its niche throughout many states away. 

Firstly, our manager does not trust anyone. I am frequently told to ""watch that guy who just walked in because he looks suspicious"". This also is the case with all of our employees. Zero trust.

Secondly, we do consignment sales. We have no barrier for this and incredibly rarely turn down consignments. This means I have hundreds of broken, awful, eyesore things taking up an immense amount of space within the store. Junk, essentially. I'm fine with junk stores, but this store is a high end retail store selling things that on average cost $1000+. Most of these huge consignment items have been here for 5+ years, taking up a ton of retail real estate that could be used for things that would actually sell. Another issue with our consignments is that the boss frequently marks them up - we do a 70/30 split on consignments where the customer gets 70% of what the item sells for, but quite often he will mark up a product 2-300%, and not tell the customer that he sold it for much higher. We also don't call consignment customers when their item sells because he wants to ""float the money""

Thirdly, as I alluded to above, I am a social media marketing manager. The store has a zero dollar marketing budget. We advertise in 1 single way, and that is sending out a sales flyer to people who have purchased something from our store in the last 3 years, twice a year. We do absolutely nothing in relation to new customer acquisition. He relies on old customers who have done business with us for years and years as a catalyst for most of our sales, but then he gives them insane discounts to the point where we make little to no money on anything.

Fourthly, we're stretched incredibly thin. Off the top of my head we have 7-8ish different services that we offer - retail, training, installations, repair, probably close to 40-50 different product lines (high end products that cost a lot of money) but we're a family owned store that only has 2 locations.

Fifthly, our store layout is TRASH. There is cardboard taped to our displays to prevent products from falling over, nothing makes sense, we use too much real estate in the store for old broken crap, none of the products in relation to one another are together, the flow is completely off. I have spent days in the past combing the store and fixing this entire problem only to have it go back to the same old crap not even a week later. He's using a $4000 consignment product as a shelf for some crap that he didn't have any other place to put. It's insane.

And lastly on my rant, he hires 17-18 year old kids who don't care about their job and are incredibly lazy and incompetent so that he can pay them nothing and they won't question it. 

We have 12ish employees and about 5 of us are adults who really understand the business and could seriously turn the place around if given the chance, but we're just so pigeonholed into wasting time doing nothing that it's ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'll get the usual ""10 years are you crazy just quit"" thing, but this store has the potential to be super high volume in a pretty great area. I just don't know what to do about the boss.",21Jan2020,1

she hides it too. she’ll buy some and not take it out the bag till i lave the room or she’ll put it in different places each time.

When school ended she stopped talking to me, suddenly. At first I just assumed she wanted a break from school and wanted to spend time with her family boyfriend who is moving away soon. Anyways school started recently and i went to ask her why she began avoiding me. She gave me this vague answer about how she thought our friendship was getting weird or something. I really don't know what she meant, I don't think I ever disrespected her relationship, I was never disrespectful to her. We trusted each other with a lot of things, for example, on her anniversary she handmade this amazing present for her boyfriend with cute notes and expensive chocolates, and he gave her these cheap flower that he didn't even hand deliver to her. She got justifiably pissed off and she told me how she felt. Even though I thought she should break up with him before he left because she might get hurt with a long distance relationship, I never said anything because I never wanted her to think I didn't support her relationship.

I know how unfair it is to hold these feelings towards someone and they have no clue what for. I really don’t want to be the crazy jealous friend who fantasizes about having a beautiful relationship with his best friend.

747,"Hi kinda looking for a awnser here but I'm not sure if Ill like it. 

Scenario:

Been talking with this woman for couple of months now and she lifes in another timezone.
 
She has more then 1 child and is around 5 years older. 

Over the course of the last 2 weeks I'm realizing that I might catch feelings for the person that are more then just a friendship. 

I've been l there for her in some tough times and I know she would have my back as well. 

We've talked about a lot of intimate stuff  (non sexual), about life and choices. 

So I feel that we have a very good friendship. 

I'm at a point where I cannot think straight tho.
I have her on my mind constant and I care for her a lot which is weird cause in retrospect I don't even know her that well. 

I'm even starting to dream of her and I honestly think I'm loosing it. 

I get happier every time we talk or write with each other. 

So I'm not sure if I should tell her or not cause that could ruin a very good friendship and I can't stand the fact of not being able to be there for her and if I'm honest I can't stand the fact of loosing someone that would be there for me if I ever need someone to talk to on bad days. 

I fear also that she thinks that a relationship would not be good because of the kids, which would be no problem for me cause I want kids on my own, but it's still a decision I can respect if she thinks that way or is scared to go into relationship  territory. 

Maybe I just need someone to tell me I'm an idiot. 

Maybe I need someone to tell me that I'm stupid for not telling her. 

Maybe I'm just loosing my marbles. 

But I'm up for all the ideas/thoughts I can get!

Please don't hate my English!



Edit for some clarification:

We talk/write atleast once a day with me starting most of the time but not all the time.

Not sure of the me starting conversations because she has a lot to do in life with her kids and other stuff, so maybe that's just her being busy, or maybe a sign of not being that into it. 

She told me that I should come over to visit at some point so she can show me around and treat me to dinner. 

We are watching some Netflix show together as often as we can with the time difference and jobs we have. 

She trusted me with very personal stuff that I'm sure noone else knows about which makes me a little proud.",21Jan2020,1
749,"right so I(m18) met this girl(f20) the other night, she seemed nice and we talked briefly but she had to go to get a bus, I then talked to her friend for a bit (a guy who gave me his snapchat) before getting on my bus and going home.

two days later I'm talking to the guy that gave me his snapchat, I ask him if he could send my number through to his friend and tell her I say hi, he responds by asking if I wanted he's Snapchat, I said yes and he sent it. 

so I message the girl that night and strike up casual conversation(which isn't my strong suit), we mostly just made Smalltalk although she gave good responses (often writing several lines in response to questions that could be awnsered with yes/no) although when we met the other night I realised that we have a decent bit in common. I responded to her last message the following morning, which she hasn't replied to (it wasn't a question and didn't really require a reply but I was still hoping she'd message me back). 

I was wondering how I would go about asking her out, maybe seeing if she wants to get a drink or at least start up another conversation and get talking to her again. she lives a fair journey away (about 45 mins by bus) although regularly comes through to my city for volunteer work. any advice? I don't know her that well and dont want to come on too strong. cheers!

753,"My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been dating since November 2018, after being best friends since 2014. When we started dating his mother turned into a jealous and control witch, and as he was still in highschool and living with her and her husband (his stepfather) she had control over his... everything basically. He wasn’t allowed to text me for a while, then changed to texting on the weekend, then eventually seeing eachother once a week. The only other times we’d see eachother would be at church, which she controlled more by not wanting him to sit with me. We talked and decided to wait it out until he moved out after graduating highschool. (There’s a history of emotional/mental abuse from his mom and stepfather, and he had decided to cut them off once he was able to move out). His mother has been horrible to and about me, which has led to a lot of hurt on my end throughout the relationship so far. This has been hard for my parents to watch, as they hate seeing me get hurt. 

Life got in the way, and instead of being able to move out this past August, my BF won’t be moving out of their house until May. Things have gotten a bit better despite him still living there, after graduating highschool, buying his own car (which they do not have any legal control over) and paying for his own phone (all of this helped by his grandmother, who his mom ostracized once getting married). He texts and calls me all the time, and we go out and spend time together a lot. His family still acts bitchy about us being together, but he doesn’t care and just tries to be out of the house as much as possible (there’s a lot of other stuff they do to him besides hate our relationship). 

Now for what’s going on now:
He and I haven’t been going to church together, as his parents left our church (no one liked them anymore after they started showing how hateful they are in public), and make him go to their church instead, using a few things they still have control of (health insurance mainly, but that’s a much bigger story). We’ve both missed sitting in church together, and it’s really important to me to sit in church as a couple. 

My BF had come with me to a family event Saturday night that ran really late. We both decided we each wanted to sleep in and then go to the 10am service together. Sunday morning I couldn’t sleep so I was awake around 7, and he started texting me around 7:20 yet he didn’t sleep well either, good morning, etc. And we text throughout the morning as I start getting ready to go to church. At around 8am he texts me that he decided to go to the 8am service at our church with his whole family. This was kind of a smack in the face, as he had the whole morning we were texting to tell me, and he usually warns me if his parents are going to be at an event he knows I will be at. I then ask him if he was staying for second service so we could sit together and he said he was staying but wanted to volunteer in the kids ministry. 

I was very hurt as he didn’t tell me until he was already at church, then told me he didn’t want to sit together although he’d be able to. When I left his text on read he went off about how he should be able to go to church and volunteer whenever he wants without me shutting him out. This whole situation felt like it games out of nowhere and I was very hurt. I went to second service at our church and sat with my family. He then texted if I saved his seat, to which I replied I didn’t think you wanted to sit with me. And left it with that

We didn’t talk in person after church. But I wanted to talk about whatever the hell was happening, so I texted him asking to meet to talk on Monday. He texted sure then asked if I was going to break up with him, to which I said no, I want to talk this out. 

We met on Monday and actually did talk things out. He feels like shit and knows he massively screwed up, and knows there’s nothing good enough to do to fix it, but wants to make things good between us again. He hates that he hurt me and hates himself for hurting me. We also talked through and broke down some walls in our relationship, things he hadn’t been able to speak about yet, and things we both want to learn to deal with and work through while in a relationship without shutting the other person out. I walked away feeling better and more comfortable in our relationship. Things aren’t great, but I want to take some time and see how things go. 

My parents are incredibly upset I didn’t break up with him. To them this was the final straw, that his mother has hurt me enough, but this time he hurt me and I can’t trust him or our relationship anymore, and my dad is convinced he’s trying to get me to break up with him. 

I cannot find the right way to be able to communicate how our long conversations went on Monday and he is and things are between us now to my parents. Even telling them I want to see how things go for a little bit, then see what I want wasn’t enough for them. This whole situation is a giant mess and I do not know how to handle it.",21Jan2020,1

I have social anxiety and extreme trust issues due to multiple Trumas in my childhood,on top of this when I first joined my workplace it was my first proper full time job in my chosen career so I didn’t know how to portray myself so I stayed in work mode the entire time rather than showing my trye personality and Trying to get to know people on a personal level .

In many ways I regret this because I feel so alone when at work as people have already made their impression of me and I don’t know how to combat that as everyone I very cliquey. I tired a few times to get involved but i always felt out of place and sad . On top of that I’ve noticed that I don’t get treated the same way others do at work because I’m not as involved socially as they are.

My workplace has a program where they send new people to do extra work training to advance our skills, my bosss has signed me up for this . The thing I’m worried about however is that if I do this training I’ll have to remain in the company for a year if not I’ll have to pay it all back , and I’m not sure if I my mental bath can take it .

I’m already paying a super expensive but good psychiatrists very week which takes almost half my paycheck just to cope with the depression which also triggers my SA, I sometimes feel so stressed out and uncomfortable I start thinking about how nice it’ll be to just not have to exists anymore .

I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to be stupid at Leage my job considering that if I move to a new workplace the patterns could repeat itself again but at the same time I know my mental health is Important .

758," I need employment like most people.

But I have messed up.

I am now in a situation where my credit is ruined, my resume is ugly, and I'm starting to get desperate. If there's a more appropriate sub for this please let me know I will crosspost.

This will probably pan out to be a very detailed post. Don't read on if you're in a hurry. It's as much me venting as it is a request for advice. I half don't even care if my identity could be discerned by somebody close enough who stumbles upon this, I need help!

Background info: I think I've been depressed most of my life. I had an unusual, but not physically abusive upbringing, I do feel that I was emotionally/socially neglected. I have felt like I was two steps behind everybody when it came to knowing fundamental things about how to interact with others. Most people have always felt alien to me. But I'm 33 now and this should no longer have any baring. I did well in high school but flunked out of college, wasting a lot of my own and others' money. Given a second chance at college I would not screw it up!

But I don't even know what I would do if I had that second chance! I've been endlessly putting thought into and nothing stands out as an occupation that would make for a satisfying life. In my worst moments I've put serious thought into faking a college diploma, but I'm not even sure what job I would pursue that would be doable without a college degree but still requires one, or where to go get one. I'm plagued with indecision. I know how rare a shot like going back to college is, and understand the consequences of messing it up. I wouldn't want to do that again, so I wouldn't fill out a FAFSA and bend over for more loans without a rock solid plan that I'm thoroughly committed to. But I don't even know where to start to create that.

I find modern work culture contemptible. I am able to force myself to work hard, and over the years I've proven that to all my employers. But long hours is not a badge of honor. Seems like all jobs want to screw you over in one way or another: unreasonably long hours and difficult expectations, disrespect, low pay/dead end, or some other unnecessary, over the top challenge.  

Although I can force myself to work hard, I really don't deny that I can't stand it. During times of healthcare coverage I visited a doctor and had blood work done for anything that could be causing me to be unusually tired. Nothing was found. The next step was to get tested for sleep apnea, but that didn't pan out because the healthcare got cut off before I was able to make the appropriate arrangements.

I have difficulty with motivation and ambition, to such an extent that I believe there's something wrong. I have no idea what though. There are things I could be doing right now to improve my quality of life. Over the past year I taught myself to code in python, and managed to impress myself with my progress. I came up with a useful, unique idea, and successfully implemented it. But as I was working on learning what I needed to know to make the UIs I got lost in the weeds. Keeping that going for 8 months was pretty good for me, but I always seem to end up burning out. I am susceptible to addiction to wow classic.

My resume is patchy with too many gaps. I have an interview today delivering pizza. It seems like the next best available step down to my previous occupation, delivering mail. I'm doing it because I know the area well, I need a paycheck, and I'd like something flexible enough to pursue a good opportunity on the side, should I find one. Perhaps even college or trade school.

I've looked into the trade programs and apprenticeship opportunities available in my home state of Ohio. Most of them seem to only want recent high school graduates. Most were very far away (I'm in a rural area). I found a free opportunity to apprentice as a computer programmer once, but you had to have half a year's worth of living expenses saved up. For as abundant as these opportunities seem to be at a glance, I'm disqualified from the vast majority of them. Trade school, while far more manageable than college, would still require that I also have a job.  

And honestly maybe I could live on nothing, deliver pizza, and make trade school work now! I'm not certain, that's not off the table. but then there's the issue of what trade do I choose? I don't want to work 12 hours a day all the time. I enjoyed all the walking of my last job. I like to be outside. I'm open to just about anything, but I need to know that it's something my seemingly always tired ass can sustain. I enjoy thinking, and I enjoy minimizing interaction with other people. I'm not obese but I'm not in great shape. I smoke way too much. I'd like to quit but I don't see it happening any time soon, I won't make excuses for that. I HAVE TO MAKE THE CORRECT CHOICE!

I don't do people well. There was a time when I very much would've liked to, and tried very hard to improve at this. Improve I have! Often times I feel that I've given a passable performance, permitting me to blend in smaller crowds without standing out as the obviously eccentric, strange guy who just doesn't seem to be getting something, or allowing me to squeak past a phone interview or 1st interview. But I'm never going to be able to consistently socialize effectively and that makes it difficult being in a position of reliance upon other people. All progress I've made in this area was hard fought, the result of deep introspection and excessive over-analysis. It's obvious that people don't have to try as hard as I do to achieve basic social function. I've done the internet self diagnosis thing and come up with 10 possible things that could explain it. I've also visited a therapist, and they didn't seem to think there was anything wrong at all! I know there is though.

Difficulties with working with people is part of the reason I quit my most recent job, carrying mail.

Four years ago I got a job as a rural letter carrier's substitute. I was more desperate than I am even sitting here typing this today, so I was absolutely determined to make it work.  

Leading up to that, I had just quit a job that involved working 70-80 hour weeks steady. The job involved driving a van full of people around. It paid well, but it wasn't safe. I know for a fact that other managers were using drugs, and I had to get out of there as I had started to dabble too. But I've been clean of everything except marijuana for at least 5 years now. I don't even drink.

A random friend that my Aunt had met online a year previous, but that I didn't know very well, offered to let me move in with him, preventing me from going homeless at that time. After a difficult half year of no income I managed to get hired at a dollar store, where I stayed for a few months until I talked the local postmaster into the position I was just describing. So I was stoked and nothing was going to prevent me from making a go of that!

Unbeknownst to me though, that roommate, who I had believed I was on good terms with, was apparently developing a heroin addiction. I came to find out later that he had called my boss and slandered me, and who knows how my reputation in that city, an hour and a half away from my hometown, suffered without me knowing.

So I can only guess that this is why management in this facility hated me soon after hiring me. And it's the postal service, the cliche came from somewhere. I was harassed unrelentingly for the duration of my two years in that office. I was clearly unwelcome. Nitpicked daily, held to excessively challenging standards. You see, with the postal service, once you've made it a certain amount of time they can't fire you; so if they decide you're unwelcome they have to drive you out by making you hate the job.

But I loved what I did. One year into the job I had to move unexpectedly to my sister's an hour and a half away, thanks to the heroin addicted roommate. I suffered that commute the entire year without missing a day of work. Even though I was a rural carrier, they'd come to rely on me on a daily basis by that point.

Carrying mail is honestly the best job I've ever held. I got a sense of satisfaction from the work I did, and felt an unfamiliar sense of respect from others around me when I told them what I did. I did not want to give up this golden ticket to the lower middle class.

I did everything as best as I could the entire time and they asked alot, while badgering me the entire time. Other coworkers witnessed this, the union stepped in a couple times, there was enough feedback for me to conclude that the situation was really bad and it wasn't just me perceiving it that way. I feel that it left me traumatized. I had to move on.

Determined to carry mail, I did literal due diligence on 3 offices near my hometown. interviewed a couple times, and chose my next office carefully after explaining my situation to a couple of postmasters and becoming acquainted with a couple of letter carriers, and asking a few other parties. I settled on an office, put my two weeks in after being hired at the new office, and became a city carrier assistant in a city near my hometown.  

The position was ridiculous. They expected 6 day weeks, 10-12 hours a day during the slow season, more in winter. I had to piss in a bottle and run to make times, this being a position where you walk, instead of drive around in the country. But I was treated with respect, and that was enough to keep me going even in these conditions. I hated life and couldn't accomplish anything outside of work though. My body was stiff all the time. I was in the best shape of my life but the situation was honestly not really sustainable.

All was peachy for a year, I developed a routine and got used to the new demands of my job, outrageous though they were. Until a new postmaster arrived on the scene and took over. As the low guy on the totem pole I had engendered the least trust. It seemed that his assumption was that everybody was slacking, even me at the pace I described above, and acted accordingly. They tried to ask even more efficiency of me! This broke me. Shortly after being converted to full time career status, things started to go down hill. They were continuously unrelenting in their demands.  

Eventually I turned in a medical restriction from my foot doctor limiting the hours I could work. I regret doing that, but taking the position then going to a foot doctor did reveal that I have a strangely shaped foot, and my foot did hurt. They did not like this at all, and eventuality found a legal technicality they could exploit that permitted them to ignore it anyway, so it only made things worse. I'm sure this new postmaster called my old boss and that didn't help things.

So things went downhill and I saw them slowly becoming more and more like my previous office. I did not have any more of that shit in me, so with some money saved up, and with my girlfriend's permission, I left, irresponsibly because I had nothing else lined up, but still turning in appropriate notice.

That brings us to today. I've managed to nurture a wow addiction, wasted several months, and am preparing for an interview when I get done writing this. I'm absolutely heartbroken and disgusted with myself that I decided to leave the postal service. I'm doing a lot better today than I was when I started the postal service, and I have some time, but I know it's only a matter of time before I'm right back where I started, and I need to figure out how to prevent that.

Previous to that the longest I'd ever been at a single company was also four years, at a payday loan place.  That ended in a way that I'm not proud of, and I probably should avoid writing that one down. I've also had a variety of other low paying jobs, mostly in food service. There are gaps on unemployment in my resume but for the most part I've a lot more of my life than I haven't. I feel that my resume disqualifies me for the best non degreed jobs available in my area.  

I could go to UPS, or FedEx. But Amazon Sundays were always the least enjoyable day for me, when we delivered exclusively packages. FedEx pays as much as pizza delivery, and UPS is unionized. I've learned from the postal service that union work isn't really for me. If you get on a company's bad side they have the leverage to make your life insufferable. I'd prefer that they have the power to just fucking fire me if they feel that strongly about it. Additionally, I don't want to work the kind of hours these guys demand. I want to go to trade school or something on the side. I'm willing to put in the hard work, even though I'm convinced that it feels inordinately difficult for me.

My girlfriend is the best thing that ever happened to me. We've been together a year without a single argument. I used to think that loneliness was a contributing factor to what I think is ongoing depression, but she has certainly disproved that. I'm a little happier with her around. I don't feel that I deserve her though. She's the first person I've ever been serious with, due to social issues described earlier, and a huge part of why it is so important that I succeed. She's willing to support me financially if I need it, but it hasn't come to that yet, and won't for a while longer, hopefully never.  

But something is wrong, something always has been wrong. But I don't feel that it can be addressed until I've gotten myself financially stable. Yes, once my income slips below a certain amount I'll be eligible for medicaid in my state, and could seek mental help. But I don't feel that I'll get as good of service as I would with private insurance. I need a psychiatrist that's damn good and reads me like a book, doesn't have a crazy work load, and can help me figure out my issues. The one's ive tried want me to tell them my issues, and I'm not even certain what they are!

But it's wearing on me. The continued uncertainty, after I thought I had it handled in a job I could make work for a year, and the financial stress. Early last year a cousin that I was close to took his own life. Later in the year an acquaintance that I bought weed from did the same. Then two people I didn't know but were in my small area overdosed, and one guy that I was very close friends with at one point but had fallen distant passed from a heart complication related to drug use. The timing on all this has really hit me hard, and if it weren't for the fact that not all hope is lost, I may have took my own life as well by now. I often consider whether or not I could make a move like that if it came down to it. But I still have a couple loved one's left who need me around.

All hope is not lost. I have a wonderful girlfriend who often makes me happier than I expected I could be, if I'm sufficiently distracted from the stress. I have a decent chunk saved up, but I can't access it yet for capital gains reasons, and I'm looking at a decent tax return this year. If I can find a flexibile enough job, I can maybe enroll in something on the side.

But I still have no idea what, or how to decide. There's other factors worrying me too, but too far a tangent from the discussion at hand.

Advice givers of reddit, how do I decide how to move forward?! Can I move forward from here? Was the postal service the best realistic shot at a decent living I was ever going to see? I am very lost and seek your counsel.",21Jan2020,1
759,"I've been weighing up asking for advice on this touchy subject for a while because it's not really my place to be asking, but here goes

Context: We live in Ireland and we're both in the middle of our degrees and work part time for just above minimum wage

My girlfriend's father is abusive to their entire family. My girlfriend in her childhood would live with her grandmother more than her mother and father because of it.  Normally it would be just abusive speech, swearing, and an occasional thrown item or such, but a few times it went too far. My girlfriend at the age of 10 was held in a chokehold until she blacked out, and in another occasion she fell off their shed and said her head hurt but her father shouted at her for crying and refused to take her to the hospital. Refusing to get it looked at has resulted in her now suffering from Chronic Migraine and she has to take medicine daily to even operate at normal capacity.

In her teenage years she went through more strife and developed self harm and suicidal tendencies which were only made worse by her boyfriend at that time who at one point asked them to be in a suicide pact. Her school found out about her tendencies and told her parents and ever since she's been threatened with never seeing her two younger sisters again and her father threatened sending her away somewhere.

We met in her first year of university and after a year she opened up about her situation. The guy has only been polite to me but i have heard the arguments he has every saturday night with his wife through the phone.  She's been saving up money to move out but she refuses to leave without her two sisters and getting a house for 3 is not financially viable on her part time job and full time university work, even if we factor in my pay.

She has been telling me it's okay for a while and i don't like getting involved but this last weekend he got drunk and started telling her younger sister she was a mistake and she should have been aborted. My girlfriend got the sisters out of the house for a few hours hoping he'd be asleep by the time they came home, but instead she heard him ranting to the early hours about how she's a B\*\*\*\* and how she should think again before running her mouth in his house.

I've told her to contact the police about it and perhaps get counselling for the father but they're in a bind as the father is a tradesman and makes enough money for their nice house and the mother is depressed most of the time so doesn't work. She fears that if she goes to the police the sisters will end up in foster care or they'll all be homeless and their quality of life will ruin their development. As a psychology student i know that this kind of enviroment is the worst place for a developing child.

What, if anything, can i do to help the situation and how can we avoid ruining everyones lives involved?

tl;dr: Abusive father, gets drunk and hostile with girlfriend and sisters but we don't know how to get out of the situation safely

760,"I work in a place where I handle small ornaments all day long. I take them from the boxes that came out of the room where the casters melt the lead and mold them. Then I put them into the packaging for sale in shops. The ornaments are made from an alloy that is 53% lead, and the rest is tin and antimony and some other stuff maybe. Anyway, I've been doing this for a couple years and nobody really told me the lead was harmful. So I've been blissfully unaware whilst handling this stuff. Now I'm paranoid after reading 100s articles online that I'm basically going to die from this because apperently it's very very toxic. I spoke to my boss about it and he said ""as long as you aren't eating the items you're okay"". And literally everyone else in my workplace seems to not care at all that there is half lead items. (btw these are the only things we product and sell and theres less than 10 staff members). Everyone has told me I am over reactings and they don't seem to agree on my concerns. But according to internet articles it's bad to even have lead anywhere near you or you will die in many years. Well really whenever I try to find answers about lead and it's effects on health, all the articles are about children and lead paint. So totally irrelevant to my situation. I can't find any proper answers as to the harmfulness to adults. Every where I go is screaming that lead is super super horrifc and to avoid at all costs and it's driving me to crazy anxiety. Enough that I want to almost quit my job. So I guess what I'm asking is, how many years until I need to quit this job or should I leave now? Thanks",21Jan2020,1

Let me explain
At times my mind just goes really far in terms of imagination. It feels like a tap of water that only sprays more water with each second and I can't stop the tap from flooding my brain with ideas.

 It happens at random times and I can force it to happen, however I can't force it too stop. 

It also gets tronger with coffee or other stuff that gives you energy


It's like roling a snowball down a cliff and the snow bot only gets bigger, but also picks up anything it's way. It doesn't stop.

It's like machine that keeps making ideas


The ideas aren't always great. Just weird and different.

Sometimes they look very vivid and it can be quite scary.

771,"I find it difficult to focus on one thing at a time. I often get distracted. For example with reading, I tend to lose focus and have to re-read sentences because I completely lose the meaning. I find also that I’m very fidgety and move around a lot which is related in a way. I find it hard to sit comfortably without having to readjust frequently to avoid discomfort. 

I also stroke my hair a lot and have a breathing tic (where I breathe out my nose forcefully and multiple times in quick succession) as well as a couple others, again interfering with my ability to concentrate.

Another thing which I’m not sure if it’s related is that I overthink about everything I do (namely my behaviour and the way I interact with other people). For instance I’ll go crazy thinking about the best way to behave in order to remain fully focused. But when I try new behaviours I quickly see the faults of them:

E.g. “should I just focus on sheer concentration and putting all my energy on the task at hand?” The fault with this is that it takes a lot of energy out of me and wears off after a while. 

“Should I stop overthinking about how I could improve my focus, because it is only making things worse?” This doesn’t work because I end up realising how inefficient my reading/studying etc. is becoming if I don’t make an active effort to consider the best way to focus on something.

This thought process is something that occurs when I sit down to watch a TV show or film too. Every time I lose focus and have to rewind to grasp a meaning, I get angry at myself, change my mindset like before, and repeat.

As you can see it is a constant back and forth struggle of overthinking about not being efficient enough. And it occurs not only with studying or reading but also with socialising (just to give another example): every time I perform poorly in a social interaction I beat myself up about it, overthink about it and blame the behavioural approach I used. 

E.g. if I went into an interaction with the mindset “I’ll put all my energy into my speech so I sound better” if it doesn’t work because I’m nervous I’ll hate myself afterwards, and if I say something like “don’t even think about an approach” (trying not to overthink) similarly if this doesn’t go to plan and I have an embarrassing slip up I’ll think of another approach.

It’s so frustrating the amount of nonsense that goes on in my head. With a few things off my chest, it might be clear the cause of my lack of focus is probably the fact I *overthink so much*. 

I hope you could understand what I’m trying to say here. This is definitely one of the biggest problems of my life. I’d be happy to elaborate if you need me to.

773,"I’m the CEO of a startup in the Bay Area, and like most startups we are very scrappy. Every employee starts as a contract for 3 months with no benefits, at which point we don’t need them anymore or we hire them full time. We do offer benefits but admittedly they aren’t gold standard, but nobody at our startup is over 40 or pregnant (almost entirely males under 30) so not a huge need for fancy stuff there. 

Anyway I believe in open feedback and that every employee should have just as much skin in the game as me. So at our quarterly All Hands I read anonymous feedback from employees and almost all pieces of feedback said the benefits were terrible and perks were nonexistent. Fair but harsh. I want to do better. 

The truth is we are too scrappy to provide much more in benefits without getting something back. Yes we do pay under the “average” but the average for the Bay Area is insane. We can’t afford to pay $50k for a sales person...anyway, I devised a system of tokens where certain activities award people more tokens which they can redeem for perks. It’s also good for career building so for example 20 tokens gets you a 1:1 lunch with me the CEO which I pay for. 50 tokens gets you an extra PTO day (currently we provide 10 per year which is plenty generous.) for 100 tokens you can come with me to a sporting event (whatever is coming up) but you can’t bring a +1 (also it’s free for the employee.) 

Activities done to earn tokens include cleaning the micro kitchen (3 tokens), subbing for someone who’s on PTO (10 tokens) and working overtime without extra pay (4 tokens per hour.) 

I thought this was a great idea to be honest, and it’s literally only an improvement from what they had before.

However, I can't ignore how overworked I felt last semester. I read an article on the signs of overworking yourself and here are some of the signs that I could relate to:

I never felt that I had a break, I was constantly on edge 

My social life was deteriorating 

My to-do list was extremely long

I was anxious and depressed

There are more but those were the main ones.

I am constantly shut down by my friends because their work is a lot harder than mine, but I still felt extremely overwhelmed. Here is what I think may have caused me to overwork myself:

I was taking the maximum amount of credits at my school (18 is the max). I am double majoring in two somewhat easy majors (psychology and sociology) and I am also double minoring. My classes were slightly more difficult that last year as I am moving up in my majors.

I live on an off-campus apartment, which means my walk to class is 20 minutes. Since my classes were very spread apart last semester, I would walk 20 minutes to class, 20 minutes back, 20 minutes to class, 20 minutes back, etc. I think I would walk a total of 1.5 hours everyday. 

I started going to the gym along with taking yoga classes. I would go to the gym 6 days a week and go to my yoga class twice a week.

Since I lived in my own apartment, I would cook my breakfasts, lunches, and dinner. I never ate out and this meant I had to go grocery shopping once a week. 

I also began attending therapy, which was an hour a week.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what my busiest day looked like:

Wake up at 8:30 am

Make breakfast (15 minutes)

Get dressed, brush teeth, etc (10 minutes)

Go to therapy (1 hour)

Walk to my first class immediately after therapy (20 minutes)

Attend class (50 minutes)

Walk home (20 minutes)

Make lunch (15 minutes)

Do homework (2 hour)

Walk to second class (20 minutes)

Attend second class (1 hour and 15 minutes)

45 minute break

Attend third class (50 minutes)

Attend fourth class (2.5 hours)

Walk to gym (10 minutes)

Workout (1 hour)

Walk home (20 minutes)

Shower (10 minutes)

Make dinner (30 minutes)

Homework (3 hours)

Go to bed.

Within that time, I only had a 45 minute break in between my classes. I don't know what question I'm asking. I just feel like I overworked myself but nobody seems to think my schedule is hard. I think it is important to add that I got straight A's, so I am studying a lot.",21Jan2020,1
782,"I am a tax accountant and gearing up for my first tax season. I am also obese and trying to lose weight. I work 9 hours days and eat my lunch at my desk while working instead of taking a lunch break, as is the norm in my office. During tax season I will need to work 10 hour days instead. In the past when I needed a break I would run to the local coffee shop and get a sugary drink or to the store and get junk food as a treat. I need to find an alternative that doesn't involve food since I am really trying to be healthy. I live in a cold and snowy area, so going for a walk around the block doesn't seem like a good option. My only other thought is to go to the coffee shop for a black coffee, which seems silly because there is free coffee at my office. Any other ideas for taking a break from work?",21Jan2020,1
783,"Like I said I am a disabled teen. I have SMA which means my muscles degenerate over time. I am quite weak, can’t walk or raise my hands over my head and it is slowly getting worse which can be quite upsetting. I have dealt with depression for a long time and honestly high school has made it worse. 

It takes so much self care for me to not be miserable all day and I don’t find I have time. I have so many issues on my plate caused by my disability that it is just so difficult. School on top of that really adds to stress and frustration.  I go to a fairly fancy school which asks a lot of it’s students and while I think it’s a good school I have been having trouble recently doing any work as I am focused on making myself less depressed. 

I don’t care terribly about getting into a great college. I care more that I enjoy life because it is hard enough already for me. I’m wondering if you all have any advice for how to care about school or weather I should continue like this and let my grades fall a bit. 

I should say that I’m a pretty average student. When I enjoy something I can excel but much of it I find boring so I don’t put in the effort.",21Jan2020,1
784,"My family of four lives in a state that we do not want to live in. I'm a new-grad medical professional, and I just started my job in August. I'm having a lot of anxiety about moving and getting a new job set up, but we def don't want to stay here. The only reason I took this job was because it was close to family to help w our youngest who was born in Nov. Now that we are past the newborn stage, we will be ready to leave again by the middle of this year. Problems:

1) I don't know how to go about scheduling interviews for any new jobs out of state once I start applying (as far as requesting PTO for my current job as they want requests in 2 months in advance - how do I tell them I'm looking for a new job without risking my current job security?)
2) My lease ends in October, but I also have to give 2 months notice of intent to vacate to the landlord.
3) I know it's standard for a job to give you 4 weeks to relocate and start work for them. But as you can see, I don't know how to make that work with taking off for interviews and giving move out notice to my landlord. 

How do people do this? What's the best way to go about it all? TIA.",21Jan2020,1

My question is, if I get to fifth base ( sex ) should I go for it. the last thing I want is for it too be a horrible experience because we’re both young and don’t know what we’re doing. (Pregnancy wouldn’t be an issue because I have access to contraception)

789,"Many years ago, this woman was a total bitch to me. Think bullying in high school but we were in our thirties. She really hurt me. It took me a very long time to get over it, and even longer to regain my confidence. I haven't seen or spoken to her nasty bitch face since. Clearly, I'm still salty. 

I saw her at my gym. She saw me too, recognized me, but didn't approach. In fact, she left right away. That leads me to think she might realize what she did was out of line, and has some apologising to do. 

So my question is this: should I ignore her, and hope she just keeps her distance? Should I pretend that I don't know who she is if she approaches me? It has been at least 7 years since we've seen or spoken to each other. Or should I rip a strip off her like I do in my head every time I think about how hurt my feelings actually are?

803,"I joined college few months back and found a solid support system consisting of three friends and some good friends here and there. My three good friends and I almost do all activities together. We hang out and have all our meals together. Things slightly changed two months back when one of my friends got into a relationship. She now spends more time with her boyfriend but also makes efforts to catch up with us. Another friend became a part of the group slightly late, so she has her own set of friends she hangs out with but she too makes it a point to spend time. But the third friend of mine is a problem. 

Let's call her Z. Z is the baby of our group. She is super optimistic and lovely but childish and introverted. Z and I end up spending more time together because our other two friends aren't usually around. Now, things have started to get a bit boring and constricting. Z tries to stick to me as much as she can. Initially, I was fine with it but now it's getting boring and frustrating. I really want to expand my social circle, develop more friendships and find people apart from Z to do things with. I asked Z if she was open to socializing and bringing in more friends, but she says that she is in her comfort zone now and doesn't want to find other friends because she finds it difficult to like people. I have some people in mind with whom I can form great friendships but my conversations with these people are restricted to classes and I don't get to hangout much with them after class.

 Another problem with Z is that she won't have her meals if I or my other friends aren't free. This sort of makes me guilty and pushes me to go with her every time, since I don't have commitments like my other friends. Hanging out with Z is getting really repetitive and I don't know how to break out of it. If I tell her honestly, I think it will hurt her feelings. Z is a very good friend of mine and I don't want to lose her. But I'm afraid that hanging out with her every split second will deteriorate our friendship. If I have plans with someone else for breakfast or lunch, I have to take Z along too. I just want to hangout with people who aren't common friends with Z and do things with them which are exclusive between me and them. How do I tell Z or how do I spend time with others for eg having lunch,dinner etc without her feeling hurt and left out?

Recently I have began to realize that there are a group of people whom dislike me very much. I consider myself to be a hard worker. The thing I think they dislike is that I’m not afraid to ask questions and offer my own insight. I think it offends them. 

I have been told by two people that they are simply intimidate by me and I shouldn’t worry about it.

However, recently I ran into a small issue: Are these pastries enough to be thrown out? Or could I put them in the break room to be sampled out? This led me to call Asset Protection and see what they had to say. Sally (Alias) told me that it was fine. The next day Sally went to my coworkers and told them that what I did was wrong. She also mentioned that it was considered stealing and that I should watch my back.

I have since then talked to HR about the drama that has been going on with them. I also mentioned this very incident.

818,"Hi, I need advice and help. I am a freshman in college and for the past year I’ve gotten into weed. I’ve been smoking everyday and now I want to quit. My memory and mental health have been affected my ability to remember and learn. What can I do to better myself?",21Jan2020,1
820,"Sooo long story short I was traveling last year and immediately was smitten by the place. I also met a guy and well... I caught feelings. Which genuinely doesn’t happen very often for me. I don’t develop crushes easily and although I enjoy flirting and dating I don’t really pursue anything serious most of the time.
Him, however - saw him and was smitten in that moment. For whatever reason ever this beautiful, intelligent, awesome guy also felt attracted to me and spent the rest of my stay there with me. He’s definitely the casual dating type and his looks/ attitude reassure me that he doesn’t have any issues finding women. I thought it was a holiday thing and that it would be over soon. 

However, after I left, we somehow kept in touch, sometimes sporadically, sometimes non-stop and I feel like an idiot because I can’t stop thinking about him. I met him again during a work trip and although we didn’t ~ do anything ~ we made sure to spend as much time as possible with each other and both told each other how much we missed each other.

I felt like I was catching feelings, but once again I thought it was a one-time thing. But still, he didn’t leave my brain when I got back home. I tried everything, visualizing how many beautiful girls he was probably seeing, dating a bunch of people myself, throwing myself into work - it didn’t help.

Now, I have a job offer in his country. As I said in the beginning I was completely smitten with the place right from the start, so I don’t think that it’s just him. I love traveling and new experiences and moving. But him being there is a factor that makes me reconsider.

As of now, I can’t obtain a visa for longer than a year and I won’t ever be allowed to work there long-term (this offer is a project-based exception). My only option would be marriage which I am not planning for and even if I did I wouldn’t want to become a citizen there because I don’t think it’s safe enough to build a family or commit to long-term. I don’t know if it’s worth risking it. What if this whole thing wasn’t just in my head and we’d really work out? What if we don’t but I fall in love with the place and make friends and have to leave everything after a year? I usually feel neither as strongly about places nor guys I accidentally met, so I think there’s a lot at play for me here and I don’t know if I should really risk my heart getting broken (which is pretty likely with this set-up).
Anybody made similar experiences? Or maybe just any advice in general?",21Jan2020,1
822,"So recently my life has been kind of a mess. I’m going to start from the very beginning for allot the info. So my friend and I, have known each other for 4 years. Since 2 years, him and I have been closer. In 2018, years he went to a different school. Before that we were at the same school. Our relationship was mostly healthy, we had a couple of disagreements here and there but he was a good kid. While he was at a different school, I made a couple of other friends. Last year, at the beginning of 2019, our relationship was still mostly healthy, but he was getting kind of selfish (like he wanted him to be my only friend). As I was saying, at the beginning of 2019, he switched to my school to be with me. We didn’t have any classes together so we were kind of away from each other. The first month of he came to my school, he got into trouble with other kids, trouble with the staff, and then I played a prank on him. He got me back and I thought we were cool. Then he went around and said that I said racist slurs. Then people came at me. I got him back by giving people proof of him actually saying a racist slur on message. Then we straightened things out. After that though, he started wanting to do things he didn’t want to do before. He changed. He really did. By the end of the school year, him, two of my other friends, and I, had a small friend group. Over the summer, we were cool. I have to mention that during 2019, we started having a lot of sleepovers. Too many. Again, over the summer, we were cool and we were all still friends. This year starts, and we’re still cool, until October. In October one of my other friends left the group, because my main friend and the other friend were harassing his girlfriend because my main friend had a crush on her the year before. So he leaves and then my friend starting calling the other friend a racist slur that the other friend didn’t care too much about. Then, the other friend decided to leave us both to join our other friend. He told him everything my friend had ever done and put some of it on me. In November, my main friend and I had gotten into a lot of trouble and I was advised to cut off my friendship with him by my parents. In December, the friend that had first left our group told me that if I cut my main friend off, me and both of the other friend could be friends again. I said ok. But then only me and him were cool, not the other friend and the ex main friend. I thought it was a good choice, but now when I look back, I miss being friends with my main friend. When everyone was cool. But if I wanted to be friends with him, he would be the only friend I have. And he’s not the same anymore. He’s different. His habits are bad. I’m so confused on what to do and I’m upset as well. Thank you for reading this far, and please let me know your opinion on this situation in the comments.",21Jan2020,1
823,"Hey, I'll try to keep this short, am on mobile.

So, to keep it simple, I had been trying to help my friend with self harming. The way it works is that I sometimes check up on her, let her pour her heart out to me, I comfort her, no self harm. The thing is, whenever she's talking to me about how people treat her like dirt, I often dig deep into my shit life in order to think of what to say. Now, I didn't have a problem with depression for a year until now, but these days it's coming back, and worse than ever, and there is no doubt in my mind that my attempts at help are causing it. The two things I now can do is to A) keep talking to her with me still depressed, or B) go back to normal, but cut her out of my life.

My plan is to give him a small baggie on valentines day with some treats and a little card with my social to see if he takes me up on the offer

Assuming he took me up on it, I was thinking hey, maybe ask him on a movie or smn. Gives something to talk about

..But like, what does one *do* on a date? My first relationship was with someone I was a friend with first, and this is a totally different situation. I have no idea what the generally accepted way of doing this is.

826,"Homestead, FL job: 75k/year plus federal benefits. 13 days of vacation a year, plus all federal holidays off. 3 day weekends every other week. Near Miami (I love the beach and associated night life.) No state income tax. High cost of living area. I have prior federal service so I would be working towards a 20 year federal pension that I have accrued about 30% of time for.

Houston job: its the same exact job with a few more responsibilities and has a much stronger impact on my resume. 82k per year. 8 days of vacation time per year, and federal holidays off. Typical benefits package, 401k but not going to be matched near what the government would offer with their Thrift Savings Program.

I know hardly nothing about Houston, but I think I would like it there. I'm much more enticed to the beach, but houston has water front. With the cost of living difference between the Miami area and the Houston area I'm thinking that my money would go further and I'd be happier.

This is not exactly an existential question, but I'd still appreciate stranger's insight here..

(I'm 16F, using a throwaway.) I'll try to be as simple as possible. My grandfather loved his dogs more than his family. (Not anyones's assumption, a verified fact.) We also had a dog. He died this fall, cca a month after my grandfather. My mom (his only child) seem to be more devastated by the second thing to happen. She said something like ""I was his only human, and he was mine.."" when talking to my grandma (not sure if she knew I was there). She has depression, Asperger's syndrome and God knows what else, she dislikes physical/eye contact and all, and we're not like super close.. I don't wanna sound ungrateful though, I've always had everything I needed, so it's pretty much fine other than these few things, but everyone has something, right..

So. This may sound stupid, but am I being an idiot or is it possible she loved that dog more then anyone? It probably doesn't matter, I just wanna someone else's opinion if I'm having a point or terribly overreacting (and you can imagine I can't ask anyone personally).

833,"Sorry in advance for the long post but it requires some back story.
 
(context I am one of 6 children. My 3 older siblings all lived in the custody of their respective fathers and this isn't everything that's happened just things that really stand out to me)

My mother and I never had a great relationship. She claims it was because my father was over protective of me and wouldn't let her near me when I was a baby up until I was almost 5, when he left her.

When he left (from my limited memory) my mum tried to build a decent relationship with me, but soon after having my twin brothers I was pushed aside.

I remember having very few toys and I would play with my brothers baby toys as they grew, my mum would busy herself by playing video games or just generally ignoring us. When her friends were around things were different, she was a model mother. Playing with us, laughing and talking. This stayed pretty consistent until I was 13.

Not long after I turned 13, I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression and I was put on medication.
My mother refused to believe this saying ""being sad and shy doesn't make you depressed"" and didn't let me take my meds.

One time when she started yelling me while we were doing the dishes by hand saying that I was being an ""annoying waste of space"" and told me the world would be a better place if she made the right choice and had an abortion when she had the chance. The whole time she had a sharp kitchen knife pointed at me. 

When I was diagnosed with PCOS my doctor recommended that I went onto birth control to try and regulate my periods so that I could increase my possibility of getting pregnant when I get older. My mother refused to let me try the birth control because I was 15 and she was worried it would encourage me to have sex and ""no daughter of hers was going to be a whore"" (as a result of this Im typing this at 19 years old having just found out that the cysts in my ovaries have gotten so severe they both have to be removed)

In more recent years I've had everything thrown at me. ""its your fault I forgot this""
""it's not my fault you're incompetent."" ""you look like a whore dressed like that"" ""why do you have your phone locked, we don't have secrets in this house.""

She regularly threatens to kick me out of the house for refusing to do things for her and has even gone so far as smashing one of my phones when she found out I was speaking to my estranged siblings 

It's actually gotten so bad that my long distance boyfriend (we've been dating 5 years in secret. He's flown over here a few times to see me but my mum has no clue... She would kill me if she knew) wants me to move to the US to him so I can get away from her... But she's still my mum... He insists she's being emotionally abusive but I don't know... I need some advice. Is she being abusive or am I overreacting? If she is being abusive is there anything I can even do about it? Confronting her just doesn't seem like it would do any good.

She's not like this with the twins. It's like they bend over and the sun shines out of their arses...",21Jan2020,1

835,"Hi all, on mobile so sorry for any layout weirdness. 

So a little back story a year and six months ago I started a new job as a junior.  Through out this time I’ve progressed, been given a dual role, two pay rises and three bonuses. I get along with absolutely everyone and adore my team, however I’ve had on/off issues with my line manager since I started. After being warned by my peers that she could be nasty, I decided to do my best to not cause any trouble. (Will admit I became a bit of a kiss ass). Every month I’d have a meeting with my line manager to discuss my progress etc. At one point she began to set me challenges to eat lunch with other people because I have anxiety and she thought that is how it would be fixed. She had mention concerns about my performance with one of my roles however we came to the conclusion I just needed a bit more support and mentoring. However this never happened and I stopped getting work in that role, so trying to be proactive I started working on some stuff for the company and show some initiative. This all seemed to be going well (I was given a bonus and pay rise in November). However yesterday I was booked in for a meeting with my line manager who straight up said my performance hadn’t improved and I would be getting a disciplinary which would then mean they wouldn’t ever give me a reference if I ever did decide to leave. This conversation then turned into “you should think about if you what to resign because your skills don’t match the company” to “when you resign”. After an emotional night freaking about what I’m going to do with no job and trying to support myself and my full time student partner, I today handed my notice in. I generally don’t know how to feel. I never got any verbal or written disciplinary warnings and feel like I’ve completely black mailed into handing my notice in. I feel so worthless and like I’ve just let my other half and everyone else down. I just don’t know what to do and I’m ready to just give up because I’ve failed everyone and myself.",21Jan2020,1

I don’t even know where to start. My sexuality is not fully developed I think. Ever since I’ve been little my parents haven’t been good at hiding their intercourses, it’s always been very loud and weird. When I was about 11 my dad accidentally sent me a dick pic. Telling me afterwards not to tell anyone and I didn’t. When I was about 13 I found a lot of toys I my mom’s drawer because I was going to borrow a sports bra. Like really weird, massive dildos vibrators, beats and powerful vips. It meant that when I lost my virginity at 14 I did not enjoy it and I didn’t for many years even though I was pretty active. At 16 I found out that they were swingers explaining the “visiting friends” at 7 pm.  I am F20 now and it is first recently that I’ve learned to kinda actually enjoy sex and even then I very quickly loose sexual interest in someone. But even how hard I’m trying I can’t talk about what I like, what I want and if there’s anything I want to try. It also very hard to take the initiative to have sex and I have absolutely no confidence when I’m on top or anything like that.

844,"So my boyfriend and our two friends who are also a couple.. were working hard together the past few weeks to get social media and equipment to become streamers/youtubers. On a live stream last night (thank god no one was watching) The dude friend started telling and EXTREMELY personal story mostly about my boyfriends past with mental illness a dark time in his life before he had a girlfriend .. and it slightly involved me, but it made me uncomfortable to the point of no return. No matter how much we protested he kept listing of details and getting more elaborate, but making up pieces of the story that never even existed, which made it even worse! So I left in the middle of the stream. We started texting, and he apologized but made it out like it was our fault, we acted so unprofessionally, he was so disappointed in us. “I won’t tell your stories anymore” and “never do that again”. “ if you get mad you wait til the end of the stream”. There was no way to recover, the stream would have been dead even if I stayed. I wouldn’t have talked much, tensions would be high. It wouldn’t be the same. I couldn’t have stayed. We were all in complete shock. And after agreeing to all take some time to cool down and try again tomorrow and having the video deleted.. they decided to message us later in the night (before sleeping on it) and broke up with us completely. Said unfriend us we aren’t going to get anywhere if you can’t take a joke. “It’s not just the streaming”. I’m all for an embarrassing story but you need permission. You can’t just start telling a story that I left with you in confidence. My trust was shattered and I was still willing to get over it. But the more time that passed the angrier they got at us. They had to make the bigger and more extravagant exit. This isn’t the first time they’ve wanted no contact with us, we didn’t talk for like 6months but then we started hanging out again. But for them to do this in the middle of making a brand, was something I never expected. Do you think they will cool off and want to be friends again?

845,"So, this is gonna be a long one. TLDR at the bottom. My family has always been super dysfunctional. My parents are in the process of a divorce, my older sister (20F) lives 7 hours away, and my brother and I live full-time with our mom. Both my sister and I have struggled for years with mental health problems (OCD, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm, and she has borderline personality disorder). She managed to go to college but dropped out a few years in. Currently she has an apartment, a boyfriend, a job, and is going to start online classes in the fall. So, she’s doing MUCH much better than she was. I graduated high school last year but decided not to go to college. I have a part-time job, a decent amount of savings, and a car, so I could probably move out if I wanted to. I’m also on medication and in therapy, doing so much better than I was last year. I’m thinking about moving to Denver to go to college, but that’s a whole other advice post. 

As for the rest of my family, my parents both struggle with their own issues. Both were badly abused as children, and never really sorted through that trauma. My dad is a very angry person; he has a super short fuse and just doesn’t know how to process and control his anger. His abuse is the reason my parents split up. Mostly verbal but occasionally physical, most of it directed towards my brother. My moms issues are a whole different beast. She doesn’t blow up like my dad does, but she has extremely violent mood swings and often threatens and insults us. She also has a habit of gaslighting us and telling us that we’re the abusers. So, no surprise that the three of us are all kinds of fucked up. 

Now onto my brother. He and I are decently close. If he’s upset, he’ll talk to me about it. I try to help him as much as I can, but I can only do so much for him. At this point I really don’t know what to do. Im pretty sure he’s depressed, and he recently told me that he believes he has adhd. Our mom took him to see his doctor for depression. He prescribed him 25 mg of Zoloft. Our mom also made him an appointment with a therapist next month. But I really don’t feel like she’s doing enough; his room is absolutely disgusting. Like I’ve had a messy room for most of my life. Old food, garbage and all that shit. But his room is on a whole other level. You literally can’t see his floor. He has trash all over his bed. Old food. His cat threw up months ago and he never cleaned it up. He uses his laptop as a tray for drinks. And then there’s the weed. He started smoking a few months ago. My mom found out and didn’t do anything. He is a HEAVY user. Every day I believe. The whole house stinks of weed and my mom hasn’t done a thing. I’m really not anti-marijuana. I don’t smoke it myself but I really don’t care if other people use it. But he’s using it as a means of escape, which has escalated to serious abuse of it. He is seriously jeopardizing his future. His grades are in the toilet; he’s passing two classes, one of which is gym. The other he’s 5 points above failing. There’s a good chance he’s going to have to repeat the grade. He’s also got what I’m beginning to realize are some pretty serious anger issues. He got a new phone about a week and a half ago because he broke his old one. Three days after getting the new one, he slammed it into a wall in anger. Surprise surprise, that one broke too. Today, I was talking to him from the doorway of his room and noticed a GIANT hole in the wall. It looks like he kicked it. Just before Christmas, he threw an Xbox control at his $500 monitor and broke it. 

I honestly don’t know how to help him. I’ve talked to him and made it very clear that I want to help him, that I’m on his side. I’ve offered him solutions. I offer to help him with his homework because I know he can’t focus. I’ve talked to both of our parents about the situation, but they refuse to talk to each other. They’re both INCREDIBLY childish about this whole thing. My dad has become very uninvolved in our lives, so he has no idea what’s going on with my brother. My dad thinks my mom is an idiot who has no idea how to parent. My mom thinks my dad is a child who has no right to be a parent to us. Whatever stupid shit they’ve got going on, they aren’t helping my brother. Although I’ve got to give credit to my mom, medication and therapy were definitely a step in the right direction. But day-to-day she is taking a very hands-off approach which clearly isn’t working. 

I apologize for the rambling wall of text. I’m sure I left important details out so feel free to ask questions about any of it. 

TLDR; My younger brother is depressed and our parents are doing more harm than good. On top of the depression he’s got some pretty serious anger issues and an apparent drug problem.",21Jan2020,1

 A little back story about myself, since i was a child i have been tormented by Spirits. I have ultimately seen it all as far as your basic ghostly encounters. (I can share stories about it but for now that's not really so important) now fast forward to me being 22, i came face to face with the Entity that has been feeding off of me. It nearly killed me until a women (Her name is STAR) who is 72 yrs old saved my life. I got a phonecall from her and she explained to me that i was in grave danger and that i needed to see her as soon as possible. I went to her house and she removed that thing from me and has since then taught me so much. She has helped me hone in my abilities and continues to pass down knowledge to me. 

Let's talk about dreams. I told you i was tormented since a very young age. I actually almost took my own life because it. This bothered me so much so that i would sleep as much as physically possible. 
With this i learned how to lucid dream. It took me years and years to get to the point where as soon as i closed my eyes i realized i was in the dream realm where i could do absolutely anything i wanted. To be honest i enjoyed spending more time asleep than awake. Nothing could bother me there and i had the ability to control everything. I began to notice some strange things with this though. If i 'slept' for two hours i would actually feel the whole two hours. Time wouldn't speed up as it usually does when you sleep. This never bothered me much, though i was always tired because it never felt like i actually got rest.

After i had met STAR i had completely lost my ability to lucid dream. I went a week straight without dreaming anything. That may sound normal to you, but for me that was absolutely terrifying. After that week of silence had past that's when i started to see it. I have had a few dreams (not in control) of the world ending. In the most graphic detail and it was so vivid. I saw how it ends. I saw how i die. I know when it will happen. My whole life i was deadset on destroying the planet because I hated being alive. STAR has shown me that i actually don't want that to happen, instead i want to save this planet.

You don't have to believe a single word i have said but if for some reason you do then i need you to do something for me. Comment, reply, message, anything at all. I need to figure this out and i have been told to reach out to as many people as i possibly can.

*i have left out so many details because this is 22 years in the making and i can't possibly tell you everything. But if this resonates then ask, and i will try to share as much as i can.*

My friends and family tell me to move on like he did and that it’s wrong to keep contact with him, but it is hard to move on without knowing if he really forgave me.

855,"Hey guys, longtime lurker, first time poster.

Ive been coming to Reddit for such a long time because of the fantastic and informative group of people from all over the world- it really does make me feel like I belong to something ineffable.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways the reason Im here:

I've been pursuing acting in Los Angeles for nearly the past 7 years and went to an acting studio in Texas(Dallas, where im from) for 4 years.

The gist of it is Im closing in on 35 years in March and I have literally sacrificed everything monetarily and materialistically by pursuing this dream: Depleted my life savings, sold my house (it was a rough couple years) all the while dealing with new bouts of depression and anxiety. It didn't start because of this journey but just leftover unprocessed childhood emotions that left me emotionally stunted. Im not over it but absolutely doing such a better job of coping through therapy and medication.

Ive slowly but surely gotten back on my feet the past year- I was living underneath a house until October and my current roommate situation is great- the roomie looks after my dog and is in general a caring individual who gives me the space I need from time to time. My car is soon to be paid off and my debts in total are down to a manageable couple grand.

Throughout this time I picked up a theatrical agent who sends me on TV auditions of Marvel &amp; Stephen King caliber, I CAN NOT stress how  grateful and fortunate I am to have one, as I know so many talented individuals who are not so fortunate. Basically im ethnically ambiguous and that really is in great demand right now. In addition I was able to develop a serious interest in Photography, I've even had patrons purchase a couple of my prints, and change careers from the service industry to basically an app Handyman(Task Rabbit) which has allowed me to not only get this new pricier but great spot but also jump back in the acting class marathon which runs about $350 a month and take any last minute auditions because I have the ability to control my schedule. Seriously Im lucky!

Reality is I haven't booked really anything, like commercially only through friendly projects or roles that were given to me. Im at that point where it isn't fun and almost can be demoralizing.

Ive been considering switching schools to improv, we have some legendary options, (UCB, Groundlings) or just calling it a day and buckle down and head to the photography route?

I hope this doesn't come off as whiny, because I fully realize how fortunate I am to be in the position im in, but I haven't felt the desire to stay in class the last 3 months and Im still not booking roles.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice GREATLY appreciated

Thanks in advance to anyone taking their time out of their busy day to ground a dreamer.

857,"I (f,16)  started college with my bf (m,17) around 6 months ago. He introduced me to his friends and I liked them straight away. But after a while i noticed they didn’t talk to me much and still to this day they won’t talk to me unless I initiate conversation. They only knew my bf a month longer than me and still he is invited to every “night out” and is in every group chat when I’m not. Even when I bring it up it becomes awkward. It started making me really upset and jealous because of it to the point where we spent 3 Ish weeks away from eachother so I could meet more people while he hung out with his friends. Now seeing that I came back not getting to know anyone else well enough he wants to ditch all of his friends for me. So I don’t feel alone and jealous. I really don’t want him to so I stopped talking about how I felt but now he doesn’t go to parties with them unless they invite me (meaning I get an invite but only because of him). He asked them and they all said they liked me but don’t know me well enough...even through it’s only 1 Month difference. 

This has happened all my life. In primary I had a big group of friends and when I was 9 they told me they only hung out with me because they liked my best friend, this hurt my feelings and really knocked my confidence so me and my best friend only hung out together until a year later when she moved meaning I spent the last year desperately trying to make friends. In high school I got a group of friends but we got split into years halves so I never saw them and I found it hard to make more friends except one girl who had friends in her lesson but not out of her lessons so we were eachothers friend. In college I had no friends and really struggled making any so I moved to my bfs college and now this.  

I’m polite and I don’t consider myself to be annoying or offputting, but I’m very  quite although I’m not shy and have no problem starting conversations but the people Ik stop at acquaintances; people I only “chat to” but don’t hang out with, I really don’t know why. I asked my bf if I was overthinking or if it’s true and he eventually told me it’s true but he likes me and doesn’t know why people wouldn’t blah blah.... 
I start conversation with people as much as I can and I text people lots too but people are blunt with me and if I make plans or stick around people usually leave. I feel so lonely and it’s really destroying my relationship with my bf...what can I do?",21Jan2020,1

862,"So I’m in college and I live with two roommates. Recently, one of my roommates seems to always be in a bad mood, is constantly complaining about things that are fixable, and gets offended by everything, including little things. It’s starting to take a toll on me and my other roommate because we feel like we’re constantly walking on egg shells around her. We never know what we might say or do that could set her off. There’s been a lot of tension in our house lately because of this. 

For example, she complains to me all the time about how our other roommate never does her dishes. She’s been complaining about this for almost a whole year. So rather than saying something, she’d rather just bitch about it to me. And I’m tired of hearing about it and it’s not my job to tell the other roommate what she has a problem with. The funny thing is, the roommate that complains about the dishes is just as guilty of the exact same thing. That’s just one example. There are plenty more just like this. 

I feel like whenever we go anywhere she finds something to complain about or someone to talk shit about. She seems like she’s always irritated and in a bad mood. She might be in a good mood for part of the day, but then one thing goes wrong or somebody says something that pisses her off and her whole day is ruined. When she gets angry, the way she expresses her anger is by going upstairs to her room and slamming her door. Like a middle school girl. She gives people the silent treatment or stays up in her room for a while and then comes out and acts like nothing ever happened. 

I know that this past weekend she was talking shit about me to our other roommate because my boyfriend and I were tripping in our house. But we purposely stayed up in my room with the door closed so that we wouldn’t bother anyone and we wanted to be alone anyway. So it’s not like we were downstairs talking to her or anything. She told my roommate she was leaving for the day because she didn’t want to be around acid or hear about high we were (which first of all, that’s not how it works. Second of all, we were IN MY ROOM AWAY FROM HER, NOT TALKING TO HER, NOT BOTHERING HER). We had even told her beforehand that we would be tripping at our house this weekend but that we would mostly be staying in our room or going outside and she said she was fine with that. So I’m not sure what changed. 

Anyway, I’m just tired of her complaints and the shit talking and the bad attitude. I want to be able to relax in my own house and not have to worry about constantly upsetting her because she’s so unpredictable. I need advice on how to approach the situation and talk to her about this. If I don’t have a conversation with her soon, I WILL inevitably end up going off on her and hurting her feelings. Although talking to her about what’s been going on will also probably hurt her feelings. 

How should I approach this? What should I say so that she doesn’t immediately feel defensive?",21Jan2020,1

864,"My best friend moved 100 miles away to Lincoln 8 months ago, and obviously I was incredibly upset when this happened. We finally met up for a brief afternoon last Saturday, but since then I have been in absolute grief and anguish. I've cried myself to sleep 3 nights in a row, broken down in tears in 3 of my classes this week alone, and I have no idea how to get over it. I am in desperate need of coping measures, and quickly. Thanks in advance.",21Jan2020,1
865,"It's something I struggle with when I talk to certain people. For example, say you're at work and there's the basic conversational greeting with a co-worker that goes like this: 

P1: ""Hey, Sprig. How ya been?"" 

P2: ""Hey, Floopin. Can't complain, you?"" 

Then they say a quick line, you both fist-bump and don't see each other for the rest of the day. 

But, the tricky thing for me is when you aren't leaving them straight away and you accidentally (or really on purpose because you(I) don't know another way around it) keep ending conversation-trees at the start. Here's what I mean:

P1: ""I love listening to music and stuff... Say, do you play any instruments?""

P2: ""Sure do, I play piano, guitar and the triangle. You?"" 

In saying ""you?"" you're passing the conversation ball back to them. I do this because I really don't like talking in social situations not because I don't like people, but because I can easily put my foot in my mouth several times per conversation. But the side effect of this when used on someone who is like me is that we get in a loop of saying ""you?"" at the end of every sentence and cover no real ground. Or, and this happens CONSTANTLY when not talking on the phone or face-to-face is that we start having multiple conversations at the same time with the same person. Here's what I mean: 

P1: ""Oh man, that movie was crazy. Crazy movies sure make me feel on edge, you?"" 

P2: ""Tell me about it. I was on edge the whole time almost like that one time where I sat at the end of a seat and dropped my hot dog on the floor. Have YOU ever dropped a hot dog? 

P1: ""Oh man we sure were both on edge back there. Reminds me of the time I was late for work and [tells story] also yeah I've dropped a hot dog a few times when [tells other story]

P2: ""Wow no way you [says line from first story P1 said] with me, [tells late story] but it wasn't as bad as [tells own dropped food story] made me feel like that time I [tells story from childhood]

P1: ""lol oh damn, you..."" 

and it continues from there. It's terrible(?) I feel like people aren't supposed to talk to one another via 9 paragraphs of monologuing that gets answered by 10 paragraphs of monologuing and so on. Especially when I see people post their conversations with ""normal people"" and it looks like this: 

P1: ""lol fr, sht wuz cash, fam [insert 50 emojis]""

P2: ""Word"" [then sends 2-4 different texts with no more than 2 words in each]

P1: ""Yeh""

And that's it. Then they go to a party or something. I just don't get it. I have so much to say/so much I want to hear from people. When I am given one-word replies that tells me they don't want to talk. But when I trap someone in this crazy string of sending walls of text back and forth, that doesn't feel right either.

870,"I’ve always kind of just gotten by in every aspect of my life, but I was content with myself as a person and was generally doing ok. I always had a job/some sort of romantic relationship (always been in long-term relationships-never really settled or just dated) and had a consistent social life. I got along with everyone and was typically well liked. 

In high school I was diagnosed with IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) but for almost 10 years it was never really severe until around 26. It became debilitating and no treatment had even helped, Nevermind put me in remission. The last resort was to have my colon removed, which happened at 27 due to the horrible condition of my bowels. Result was a permanent Ostomy. 

I had moved out of my hometown/state and started to have a lot going for me. Good job/potential career, a great girlfriend with a great family who accepted me as one of their own. I was living in a place I loved (wide open, not too busy/crowded) and was really happy until my surgery. 

I lost the job as a result (we parted on great terms/no bad blood), and my relationship had deteriorated. My mental health, which had always been somewhat of a hindrance, had begun to rapidly decline while I was really sick and didn’t get any better after surgery. I began to push away my girlfriend; she had essentially become caretaker and I felt extremely guilty. She was roughly 7 years younger, was in college and I felt like just being with me was holding her back. Despite her fighting my attempts to push her away for a few months, she eventually had enough and gave in. 

No job (or ability to work just yet), no more relationship, no income/savings I was forced to move back in with my parents back home. I isolated myself, depression/anxiety became crippling, and so I’ve just been useless.

I see a therapist, work on the side when I can (I’ve had 2 knee surgeries and now have a knee replacement scheduled for the end of March) but every time I start to make any progress at getting better, something seems to happen to delay or stop me. I keep trying to pick myself back up and fight, but it gets harder and harder every time.

Now I’m 31 and I’m back with my parents which I’m grateful for their support, but it makes it extremely difficult to be independent. My license is currently revoked, my car was totaled by a tree falling on it during a tornado - rare where I’m from), so I’m dependent on rides (no public transportation here). 

I want so badly to break this cycle, pick up where I was and begin to move forward again. Regain my independence, socialize again, find a career, find love, and most of all find myself/find peace and happiness. 

Any suggestions on where to go from here? Short-term/long-term strategists? Success stories? And advice will be greatly appreciated and I will take it all into consideration. Criticism is expected, but nobody has been harder on me than I have been on myself. Thank you.",21Jan2020,1

Being a broke college student, I graciously accepted this offer. I know, I don't have any shame, but I'm okay with that.  

What I need help with is this; I have a few options im considering regarding what to do with the money. 

option 1: i still have a joint bank account with my family. It's my own account, but my parents can see what I spend and what I put into my account. How would I explain this large sum of money to my family? 

Option 2: I would consider investing this money. Putting it away so that I gain interest on it for x amount of years. I'm horrible with finance and things like that. I can't do it on my own unless I get help... Which is through my father who has a degree in finance. How would I explain this to him? Or should I find a way to invest on my own?

Option 3: paying off part of my student debt with it. However my parents will see this since they help me with student loans. 

Option 4: opening a separate bank account under my name and not telling my parents about this. I could however, slowly over time, transfer bits of this money over to my account that my parents know of and hope they don't suspect anything from it.

875,"So, this is obviously a throwaway account. What the situation is that back in October, I changed jobs for one in a major pharmacy chain. I'm in a position that's best described as 'the face of the store'. I technically report to the pharmacy manager instead of the store manager and spend about 90% of my workday inside the pharmacy doing things like cashiering, hanging will call bags and things of that nature, though I'm supposed to be on the sales floor helping customers find products, or promoting sale events/immunization services and the rewards program. We're a higher volume store in our district, handling between 2500-3000 prescriptions a week. We're never at a loss for things to do.  


Now the job itself isn't too terrible, the biggest complaint is that a large number of our customers come in stinking like they just smoked entire cartons of cigarettes. The problem is with some of the pharmacists and pharmacy techs. The stuff that gets said behind that glass is beyond foul. I don't want to say anything verbatim in case my coworkers are redditors, but the R word gets thrown around a lot, as well as some conversations involving sexual humor. In the roughly 3 months I've been there, I've gotten pretty frustrated because it happens at least once a week where someone says something that makes me personally uncomfortable. Most of the time I try to shrug it off but sometimes it just gets under my skin in the worst way.

 The most recent example was early in the morning when the pharmacy manager had come in. I didn't have a lot on my plate at the moment so I was just enjoying the PA music. I mentioned how it was one of the singer's earlier songs that I really enjoyed, and the pharmacy manager turns to me and says ""Yeah, her sex tape's pretty good too. I heard about it on Howard Stern."" - All I could manage to reply with was 'Goddamn it'.

Another earlier issue was when one of my pharmacy techs was regaling the whole pharmacy about a story she had read on facebook about a man who had injured himself with an oversized adult toy. This was while I was ringing patients, mind you. When it caught my ear I snapped and shouted ""Jesus Christ, PATIENTS IN EARSHOT!' - and the story continued uninterrupted.

There are other stories I could tell but I think this gets the gist of my situation across. I hate the team I'm working with only because they can't keep their mouths clean on duty. I would rather not work there any longer, but like everyone else, I have bills that don't pay themselves. I'm not getting a lot of responses to the resumes I'm sending out, unfortunately. If I were to report the issue to HR, they'd be able to figure out who reported it pretty quickly, and since I've only been with the company for 3 months, I might just look like the jerk who can't take a joke. My opinion is that I should look for a new position and make a quick escape, but should I report this up above?

How should I handle this?",21Jan2020,1
876,"I have an interesting and slightly embarrassing new problem related to the smell of my finished laundry. Maybe the trusy Reddit community can help. Here are the details:

For the last year, I've been living in a garage converted into a studio on a property with a main house. In the main house lives another renter who I will refer to as my co-tenant. He is two decades older than me, who also rents. We have our own laundry machines in our individual spaces. 

When I first moved, I noticed that his place had an odor to it. Not a bad/offensive odor, but a strong noticeable odor, slightly on the musty side. I don't think HE smells, just his place. I attributed it to people and people's homes just normally having different smells. 

The last three times I've done my laundry, I notice that my laundry is coming out smelling like his place. I have not had an issue like this before. The last things I washed came out with such a strong smell of his place that I can consistently smell it while I wear the clothes. I plan to re-wash these clothes tonight and see if the problem persists. 

Other possibly relevant information:

* I know that we share the same water system. 
* We both also have dogs, and the dogs have dog doors in and out of both living spaces- only my dog is allowed in my space, but my dog goes into his space with his dogs regularly.

I started this new school half way through the year in year 11 , so Ive only been around for two terms. i made a few class friends but they don't want to hang out with me in recess or lunch (I can tell bc they don't even BOTHER looking at me when they're all talking together and even walked away from me once. and another group of girls that I asked to hang out with said yes but all they were talking abt was drama then when I tried to know the tea they say 'we can't tell you' and leave me out of the convo. so I ditched them). of course I could stay with them and force a friendship but it just makes me look kinda pathetic and they make me feel so bad. besides those two group of girls I made 2 other friends but they only talk to me in class and we don't have the same personality at ALL, its a bit boring talking to them, but they are the sweetest but they both have two different group of friends that I tried hanging out with and the same problem happens, no LOOKING at me, TALKING to me, and even walking away from me. so I stuck to only talking to them in class. basically im alone at breaks bc I feel like everyone hates me.

also I was so comfortable in my old school and I would have no problem asking questions and speaking in class, but since I've started this school, I can't seem to say a WORD in class. even if I don't understand something. I feel like im starting to slowly develop anxiety or something because every time we're having a class discussion, I WANT to participate but then I start thinking things like 'but no one cares' 'stop talking' 'they're going to laugh at you' 'you're new no one wants to hear your voice' to myself and it seriously bums me out so I don't talk. 

its weird because im NOT an introvert but half way through 2019 till now I've been acting like it. im too scared to even ask to go to the toilet. I was so loud in my old school. and its not even that Im the new kid here an dim just adjusting, its starting to physically HURT if someone looks at me, I have to answer a question in class, talk to someone new. even outside school.

I want friends I really do but either everyone doesn't even TALK to me when im part of a group, even if I try to join in the convo, OR I feel like rather dying than speaking. its so weird.

the saddest day at school last year was when we had a carnival day with rides and free candy and stuff and I went but my sister stayed at home (who I hung out with sometimes at recess and lunch when I feel extra lonely. btw we both started at the same time and she's already the most popular in her grade, one year younger than me heh). anyways I went to school that day because I heard you can go, get your name marked on the roll then go back home so that's what I was planning but NOPE. they locked the gates and I had to stay there the whole day with everyone going on rides and eating with their friends while I walked around by myself looking like a loser. I ended up eating popcorn in the toilet stall by myself and crying feeling so embarrassed. + there was this Kpop dance circle going on where everyone was dancing to Kpop (obviously) and I got out the toilet to watch bc I didn't feel like crying anymore. I started cheering the people dancing coz they looked cool and I heard my voice going 'woo' and I almost broke down. even though im SURE no one heard my voice bc everyone was SCREAMING. 

why does everyone hate me and why am I starting to become shy even though I love being loud and making friends? help.

878,"My friends and I are planning our senior trip for this summer after we graduate. Currently the people going are my core friend group except for one (9 people including minus the one so 8 of us) and one other friend we all like and hangout with a lot. We having been discussing inviting another guy some of the group is friends with who I really don’t like. Before we started discussing this I had jokingly said that if this guy came I wouldn’t to which my friends. Then when it became a serious thing I told my friends I wasn’t gonna make it an ultimatum but that I really didn’t want him there and would never push to invite someone if any of them really didn’t like them. For the most part they just brushed my feelings completely aside. They still haven’t invited him yet but I don’t know how to further get them to understand that I don’t want him there. It partially seems like they want to invite him to offset the cost of our one friend who isn’t going but that amounts to about $30 dollars a person. I also feel like if this was any other meme her of the group that didn’t want him there and not home that this wouldn’t even be a discussion. I’m really bummed out about it because I was really excited for this and seriously don’t think I’ll have a good time if this guy is there. This is already getting long so I’m gonna quickly sum up the reasons I don’t like this guy: he makes jokes about type 1 diabetes (the genetic kind), he roasts me as if we are friends and he knows we are not and when my friends do it he piles on, he simply annoys me with other things he does which to his defense are just personality things that I don’t vibe with.

Around two years ago I was almost a 27 years old millionaire. I had a nice car, travel a lot and living the live. I had a goal to make that million euro and retire. At my peak I had like 800k e and started to make a lot of bad decisions. In 2019 I started gambling and play on stock market and forex with too big leverage. I think you know where this story is heading. I lost fucking everything. Everything that I made by myself in the whole life - gone. When I lost this I had full mode depression. A lot of drugs, alcohol, stop talking to friends, family, girl that I loved. I was totally devastated and 50k in debt.  Now I moved to another country , get a job and slowly paying the dept but I cant stop thinking how I fucked up everything.

After 10mins of literally insisting, I finally took out the cash. (We were in the woods). He jumped on me literally and started pulling the cash from me. I started shouting and crying ""I fucking worked for this money"". He threatened to shoot me with his gun (im pretty sure he didnt have one) if I dont stop screaming. He was squeezing my neck a bit. I said I didnt fucking care if he killed me (only said that cuz i knew he didnt have a gun). After 5 mins of him trying to take money from me and me holding tight to it and screaming (no one was around to help😭), I finally told him ""ok ill give it to u if u stop touching me"". He left me for 0.1 second during which I ran as fast as I could. I bumped into a guy whom, while I was crying, I asked to walk me to the station.

893," 

Hey y'all  


I have posted this same subject to another subreddit, but am trying to not place my egg only in one basket. Rather have more suggestions and advice from other people and places :p. So apologies if some of you have seen this before.  


&amp;#x200B;

I have seen, especially as of late, a lot of women on social media come forward with their frustration and fear of other men catcalling them or just downright approaching women incorrectly.

Thus, I would like to ask on the correct way to approach women? There are some things that I would, ignorantly, think is ok but is not. Hence my ? . I'll also post something down below as to what sparked this ? that I saw on Twitter this morning:

"" I just left the gym and a guy in the parking lot yelled “damn you must be heavy set!” so feeling powerful and also annoyed i said “go fuck yourself” and he said “alright go to hell then” and it just dawned on me that he actually said “heaven sent” but whatever whats done is done ""

At a glance, from the ending statement of her realizing what the guy actually said I would be led to believe that this would be fine, however after reading thru the comments I found out that this is another form of catcalling. Hence, why I want to be educated on the matter.

Also, so that it will not be a ? on \*what should I tell him?\* know that I have absolutely zero experience with women (26 yrs &amp; 0 girlfriends or dates) whether it be Romantically, Physically, or with just basic conversation. My usual screenname is \*UglyVirginLoser\* so you can kind of figure how experienced I am with women in general lmao, but I needed an account that I could use at work so here we go :p. Anyways, just wanted to give a lil background on me just so that I may, hopefully, get the feedback I need so that I may be educated on the matter. Rather know ahead of time when I finally work the courage to talk to women and not make a brutal mistake like the other guys that rightfully so prompted the \*Men Are Trash\* movement.

Side note: No, I am NOT exempt from the issues that men have caused other women. Though I rarely interact with women I am SURE that at some point in my life I have at least 1 interaction where I made a woman feel uncomfortable regardless of how often or not I interact with them outside of work. Especially considering since i'm a giant nerd I already dislike going outside (BLEGH) I did not want to give off the notion that I am \*an innocent bystander.\*",21Jan2020,1
894,"I usually refer to myself as a girl by convenience. I guess it's just a practicality? I never really had a concept of myself, partly because I have a huge fear of lying about something on accident and that has caused me to mot be sure about my own identity as a person.


I usually ask myself what I feel like, but the answer is usually oddly objective. Like ""how do I feel like?"" A human I suppose. ""But I have a vagina! Do I feel uncomfortable with it or just the opposite?"" idk man... It's just a reproductive organ. I don't really care about the structure.

I should mention that I don't particularly... Have an image of myself at all. I have no idea even about the things I like - it's like someone else is taking the reins and I'm just the passenger who complains about where we're going. So yeah...


Can I ask a question? How would you describe knowing what gender you are? What you feel like? I don't know about it at all - maybe what I'm feeling is normal.

I really wanna use things like they/them pronouns to see if they help, but I'm terrified of my nb friends (and my partner) making fun of me (don't get me wrong, they're wonderful people, but I feel like me deciding to use these pronouns is an insult to the people that already use them).

I am currently in college and I just got a part-time job in my field which I am so excited about. 
However, they asked to see my high school diploma or transcripts. When I graduated in 2016, my mom (which she has just now revealed the amount) still had a balance of $20,000 owed to our school. Now, they will not release a transcript of any sort or diploma. This is not a legal battle because technically the school is allowed to do this. Each time I need my transcripts I have to pay in excess of $500 and this has brought me so much stress each time as I do not make hardly any money as a student.

897,"\*\*\*This is on another account because I don't like personal stuff out in the void, but I cannot figure out a way to fix this or make it better.

So to be frank, my mother is dying. Stage 4 cancer that chemo is barely touching and prognosis went from maybe 5 years to months since Nov of last year because of some complications. My sister and I have been doing the best we can to take turns caring for her as we both live in different states from her. Our older brother is being an ass to be blunt. Before the complications arose, he had come down with me and his animals to my husbands and I's house as part of a plan that should anything go wrong, we could drive back up there together(My car is not street legal and is in my mothers state since a PCS). We have not asked him for money to help with bills, only to buy groceries once when his boys were up for a holiday, and just asked he take care of his dog and to give us a heads up if he was going to disappear for a few days. Even gave him a house key (he didn't want it) because getting up at 1 am to let him in was not going to keep working. My husband and I have 2 dogs of our own who just turned 1 and we are trying to keep on a schedule. All we asked was that he be respectful and to take care of his dog because the cat is easy and his dog is not. 

Well, he met a girl on a dating site and shit went sour. He started disappearing for days with no notice, leaving my husband and I to take care of his dog, and would only come home randomly to take a shower, wash his clothes, workout, and eat our food. Then would be rude when I asked him to please come back and take care of his dog and to buy cat litter. That's when mom took a bad turn and we are where we are today. He had been staying at GF's for a week I would say at that point without any communications and then showed up one day with her in tow to grab/wash clothes, workout, eat and shower and told me that he would be driving up with her(she was going to visit family in a state near my mom with her kids, and she would drop him off at my moms) and would be back the at the end of the month when she picked him up again. I brought up the previous plan that we had and he got huffy. I told him I'm not going to care for the dog because we had other stuff going on and he is neurotic when my brother is not there. Again he got huffy and left with GF because something was going on with her kids, and the dog. He gets up there and  after 1 night says hes going on a date with GF(Who had to drive from another state back to him) and disappears for 2 days, comes back and sits in the basement for the next 3 days while my sis does everything. As well as cleaning up after him. 

Then he disappears again and doesn't tell anyone where he went. Turns out he had GF come pick him up and take him back to her family in the other state. We didn't find this out until after the new year  because he had lied to my mom and sister, saying he came back to my state, and not saying anything to me. He also asked mom for money. WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. Then has the balls to say ""I didn't feel like I was helping"", and getting huffy with all of us for being irritated and disappointed with how he's acting and calling him out for asking mom for money. It gets worse... he tried calling mom after her last surgery to try and circumvent the new issue (Has helped with some of the symptoms) to ask her for money again. My sister, who generally doesn't give a crap about most things is even pissed. He recently called again to ""tell mom he loves her"" and ends up trying to guilt trip her because ""I'm depressed I can't come up there because I have no money"" and ""I don't have any help right now"". This is after sis and I were trying to talk him into being logical and realizing he has help at my house and all we wanted was to be treated fairly, and that he shouldn't be asking our dying mom for money. He won't talk to me because I called him out again and he didn't like it, and whenever my sis tries to reach out he just complains about money and how depressed he is... News flash Bro, all of us are depressed and hurting. This isn't the first parent death we've dealt with, but at least we have a heads up this time. 

What can we/I do? I'll be up there in march as my husband has training for 2 weeks soon and can't come up any sooner. My moms doesn't deserve the guilt trips. He has made this so much harder for everyone involved and we all have to tip toe around him because he'll threaten self harm. Now I need to be clear with something, I, in no way, blame the GF. I think she's sweet and is being used by my brother. I don't know her info so cannot contact her to talk to her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",21Jan2020,1

902,"Quick context:

I (23) moved out when I was 17. My little brother (19) moved out last year. Since we both left home my parents marriage went through a very rough patch where they nearly divorced. 
In the end they didn’t though and now it sometimes feels to me like they are desperately trying to keep our family together. I am also very different from them and don’t connect with them super well anymore, even though I still love them cause they are my parents.

Me and my brother basically live on the other side of the country and don’t see our parents nearly as often as we should. Especially me since I am not the best at calling or texting my parents either. 

The story:

Couple of months ago my mom approached me for a family vacation. She told me they would pay for the flight and apartment which I already found a bit strange cause they aren’t super well off (but not poor either) so I offered to pay for my own expenses but she insisted they would pay.

So now today while on the holiday my brother told me my mom borrowed 600 euros from him last week just before we left. She didn’t tell me about it and I feel upset about it. I offered to help pay but she refused and asked my little brother. My brother gave them the 600 euros from his savings account he was using to save money to buy his first car.
They also payed for a lot of the food/trip etc expenses we have done the past few days together.

Now I am not extremely well of either and I realized after thinking a bit that they probably didn’t want me to help pay for it because if they approached me and asked me to go on vacation with them and pay ~300 for my own expenses I would’ve probably said no. Which is true because that is also money that I don’t really want to blow at this point. 

But still it makes me angry she borrowed that money from my brother and did not tell me about it. I realize she did this out of love for us probably. I notice they are both having a difficult time without kids in the house anymore. 

Would it be fair to approach them and say I will pay 300 back but in phases of like 100 a month. And talk to them about keeping financial secrets from me like that? I’m afraid my parents won’t accept my offer and refuse to let me pay for anything.

Sorry if this may sound a bit incoherent I just found out and am both angry and kind of sad at the same time. They both taught us to not spend money we don’t have and yet here they are spending money they don’t have.",21Jan2020,1

Everytime a see something about marriage or dating, i think about her, and i dont like her, i love her. Im scared to say anything to my classmates because they will make fun of me and she might not have the same feelings for me.

priority, he was my everything and id do what i could to help him. 
while hes at therapy i made a whole plan on how to help him, read articles, wrote him a long message. 
he comes back im so excited to love him, instead: “i dont know how to phrase this. im breaking up with you.” my heart dropped to my toes. i was in his sweatshirt, it smelt like him. i thought he was making a mistake, so i told him.

“but you love me”
“i do love you, we cant be together i cant be in a relationship”

fast forward a little bit. he loves me so much, but doesnt think we should date. im too hard to take care of. he wants to be my best friend in the whole world he says. we casually talk. 

he deleted all traces of me, even comments, and went on an app and started talking to so many girls (completely unlike him, he hates shit like that, hates porn, hates most girls, especially the type he was adding) it was all so worrying. 

yesterday was my birthday so i asked to play games with him and he flipped tf out. saying he wasnt ready yet that i cant expect that. 

“YOU broke up with ME”
“it would be different if we were just friends. you make me feel safer than anyone ever has.”

he blocked me because he said hes afraid ill make him too happy and he’ll date me again. if i make him so happy and safe and loved then WHY cant he date me? all the relationship issues were virtually gone before the breakup. so why?? he wants a future he said, and he isnt sure if he’ll ever stop loving me. 

guys, i dont know how to feel here. is it worth it to hold on to him? i feel deep in my soul he’s my soul mate. should i hold on to us having a future eventually? i think hes making a huge mistake and trying to fill the void losing me caused. do you think he’ll come back? 

why did he leave me? and why cant he love me?

found out on accident that he doesnt have my number blocked. what does this mean? why doesnt he block my number? has he not let go?",21Jan2020,1

He is mentioning how he will never date and he doesn’t think girls like him and stuff and while that’s a whole seperate thing he never talks about guys and I want to ask him if he still interested in guys but like he hasn’t mentioned it since atleast we were seniors and even then he said if he went to prom he wouldn’t wanna go with a guy.

okay so I'm 15 about to be 16. my best friend is 15. she's been seeing this guy, hes no good for her. hes manipulatative. he wants her for sex. he doesn't like her being around me.

I told her those were all the signs my ex showed. that I ignored. he raped me at 13, he was 17. he was the exact same way. 

she told me she knows what it's like. but she doesnt. she wasnt raped. she was assaulted, not full on raped. I'm in therapy, I'm on PTSD meds for my nightmares, antidepressants and anxiety medication because of all of this.

I've been on her case about it, because she told me she would drop him after 3 times of them breaking up. she went to a basketball game, knowing I wouldnt go, and got all over him. 

she has a boyfriend. it's not this dude. I hate this dude. he hates me. I'm onto him and he knows that. we were talking about it in a Google doc at school, and the principal picked up on what we were saying.

I mentioned me getting raped. so I got called into the guidance counselors office. I told him what the dude did to her. 

shes mad at me now. she thinks I'm trying to ruin her or something. she thinks I did this on purpose. I've been trying to tell her hes no good for her. 

hes straight up told her he wants her first sex and nothing else. this will put a huge strain on our friendship. because that means when he moves back to our school, he'll hang around us. my brother and his best friend (her current bf) hang with us. the moment he comes along they wont be around. I wont be around. I dont like him.

hes violent. hes tried to blackmail her. 

I dont know what to do. I cant bring it up in person without her interrupting me and not paying attention. I cant bring it up over text because she leaves me on read. 

she asked for my help. I'm trying to give it to her. shes ignoring it. I'm distraught. hes going to hurt her. 

I've had 2 panic attacks over this. I'm so afraid of her getting hurt. but she wont listen to me. she says hes changed. hes told her that a million times before. he hasnt changed. 

I don't know what to do. I need help. I'm so distraught. I dont have another therapy appointment until my birthday in a few weeks. 

help please?

918,"Tldr at the bottom. 

This  is something really hard to explain, but basically my boyfriend has  been acting strange for a few months (periodically), ever since we went  on a holiday together. His behaviour is becoming very strange at times,  and sometimes he almost frightens me, as in, I fear there's something  wrong with his mental health.

However  - he and lots of his friends work in healthcare, he's been to a  therapist, and no one finds him strange at all or thinks his behaviour  has changed. He is only strange around me, when we are alone. He doesn't  abuse me or anything like that. He just behaves weirdly.

I  am wondering if there's something seriously wrong with him or if he's  simply turned into a weird human and there's no reason for concern.

So.  Prior to our last holiday a few months ago, we had an awesome  relationship for almost 2 years. We've been friends for about a decade  and I'd say I know him extremely well. Around 5 years ago, he went to  rehab for alcohol addiction and I supported him through it. He stopped  drinking. Things went well. We got together two years ago. Last year, he  started to have drinks again. In moderation, no getting drunk, just a  glass of wine here and there. Everyone was chill about it and supported  him, though of course we were keeping an eye on it. But he didn't fall  back into addiction, and it seemed he was fine.

A  few months ago, we were about to leave for a holiday together, just me  and him, when he had a sudden massive mood swing of sorts. It was  completely out of character for him, but he refused when we were  supposed to leave for the train station. He said he'd changed his mind  and did not feel like going anymore. Then he started unpacking and  putting his clothes back into the drawers like nothing had happened. I  was dumbstruck. The evening before, he had been just as excited about  the holiday as I was. When I tried to talk to him about it, asked what  was going on, he - again, very out of character for him - shrugged it  off. He said nothing was going on, ""I changed my mind, why can't I just  change my mind?"" It felt very odd to me. Tried to pursue the topic  further, but he changed the subject every time and I gave up and  accepted the fact that he'd changed his mind, for whatever reason.

Life  went on and nothing out of the ordinary happened for a few weeks. Until  I got a phone call from him. He'd been in a traffic accident and needed  me to come pick him up. When I got there, there was no police, no  ambulance, nothing. Just my boyfriend, sitting by the side of the road,  and his bike, laying in the middle of the road, no obvious reason for  the accident to be seen. I asked him what happened. If he needed to go  to the hospital. He firmly denied needing to go to the hospital even  though he was bleeding, and he said ""nothing happened."" I told him that  was bullshit and that clearly, SOMETHING had happened ... it took a  moment but he then admitted that he'd seen the ghost of his mother on  street before him, and he'd swerved to avoid her and lost control of his  bike. I initially thought he was drunk and hallucinating, but he hadn't  had a drink at all.

After this,  he got into several more accidents with his bike, always on his own. The  reasons for the accidents were odd. One time, he was waiting at a red  light and next thing he knew he was on the street and didn't know how he  got there. All the years I've known him before, he's not had a single  accident.

He keeps mentioning  talking to his mother. She's been deceased for about 7 years now, and  they didn't have the best relationship. He says she's not threatening  and he finds her presence peaceful. At this point, I'm completely okay  with him talking to the ghost of his mother. That's how crazy our life  is.

When he's on his own, he  starts talking. Not to himself; he says he imagines a character in front  of him and just plays out their dialogue for both of them. He's not  hallucinating; he swears he just likes pretending someone is there. He  calls it ""having fun"". When he thinks I can't hear him - like when I'm  in another room with headphones on - he likes to sing to himself, only  it's not a language anyone can understand. He says he likes to make up  his own language.

He's frequently  very ... intense towards me, to the point where I have to leave his  apartment because it's overwhelming. I've stopped staying nights because  the second I lie down to go to sleep, he starts acting up like an  overtired, hyper child begging for attention. He doesn't like me  sleeping because it means I won't be able to listen to his stories  anymore. He talks almost constantly now. He makes stories up but mixes  them with the real world so it's sometimes impossible to know what's  real and what isn't.

He has also  gotten very forgetful. A lot of what he tells me he doesn't remember the  next day. Or what happens too. Sometimes he has a good laugh about what  I tell him happened the night before, and he just can't believe he'd do  something like that.

In all the  years I've known him, he's never been like this. I thought surely our  friends have noticed this too, but interestingly he doesn't act like  this around them at all. Nobody has noticed a change. If I told them how  he is at home, they'd think I've completely lost it. At his job, he's  also brilliant as usual, and his colleagues haven't noticed any weird  behaviour. When I asked him why he's only like this with me, he said  it's because he feels safe to be himself around me. And when I pointed  out that he's not acting like himself at all, he said ""I've changed.  I  don't understand what you do to me. But I feel more free now than I did  before, and I'm sorry if I scare you sometimes. I go a little bit mad  around you because you let me.""

I  don't know what to do about this /how to handle it at all. He's freaking  me out more than a little bit and I'm worried he's officially losing  his goddamn mind.

Do you have any  advice for me? Can I help him somehow? He basically says I'm the cause  for his strangeness, so I feel like something I do is encouraging him  somehow ... what could that be? Do I need to be less understanding? More  understanding? Do I need to have him committed to a psych ward? Do I  talk to our friends and try to convince them he needs help?

**tldr:  my boyfriend has been acting weird (getting into accidents on his own,  talking to imaginary people etc) and I need help deciding whether or not  this could be a psychiatric condition we need to get help for or if  he's just being a weirdo and it's not a cause for concern.**",21Jan2020,1

924,"Hey y'all. I am in dire need of some real advice. I mean it in the sense of needing some cold hard harsh truthful advise. Also apologies for grammar and such I'm just pouring my soul out here and hoping it's in an understandable format. Also im on mobile. 

I'm struggling. I recently posted on r/relationship advice about a recent blow out my significant other and I had.. if you would like to read it I could link it but I'm on mobile so I'm not sure entirely how. 
I semi know the answer of what I need to do but I'm scared of making a mistake. My partner has a lot of trust issues. We have been on a  off for close to 8 years now. I'm 23f and hes 24m. As you can imagine theres a lot of history there. Most recently back in September we got back together officially after a 2 year gap.( We've lived and been together 3 years prior to this.) I suffered a lot those two years and the first few months of our breakup was dragged on by him keeping me in his life and me going over to his home to mainly have sex. I wanted the feeling of the relationship and truthfully I didnt want him to forget me so I took what I could get. I wanted more and towards the end of us talking that year I definitely felt he sensed that and he ghosted me. For months. Needless to say I was devastated. He appeared and reappeared at his convince for a long time... I made so many mental excuses for him I even convinced myself I understood why he was going about this way. It wasnt until the beginning of 2019 with the help of the wonderful people around me that I really started to take control and regain my life while pushing him out. I began to go on dates, casual things really to just gain my confidence and meet people. But he always existed in the back of my mind. I recognized this but I also told myself the feeling would be there but I knew he wasnt what was best. In retrospect I have no idea where that woman with logic went. The issue with letting go was the fact that when he asked me to leave our shared home and I had to move to back in withmy parents there wasnt much room for the items I had... (I would like to add that during out time living together I saved and moved myself out he moved in and I never got the chance to officially ask him to move in. I was the sole provider and the only person with a job. He had a band I wanted to support his dream. During our last year I became unemployed and we moved into one of his estranged father's houses.) I still had items at his home, up until July of last year (he kept flaking on me picking them up) There was a spark of hope for me I wont lie I hadn't seen him in a year and I felt like I've grown and changed I hope he saw that and maybe for once we could sit down and talk about what happened and how we feel. This didnt happen we again just had sex and he didnt even say he missed me. But again I thought this was the last time if see him and it was the first sexual I've had since our breakup. I was devastated and broken afterwards. A text exchange between us after this lead me to believe all he ever saw me as was sex and a trusty emotional crutch he didn't have to worry too much about. It broke something deep within me. I cared and love this person and while I was going through so much pain so much anger and confusion over our situation I still kept it guarded and didn't direct it towards him for his sake. I worried that if I let out my emotions I would hurt him when he was already hurting. 

Now this part is where the potential abuse began.
After realizing what little I had been to him I really tried to move on. I went out and dated someone somewhat seriously for a few weeks and even took it a step further (something that in the past I'd been to scared and felt too guilty to do). One night while out with a friend I bumped into one of his acquaintances, I hit him up we started talking and even set up a date. This date never happened I ghosted him after I realized this would not be a good decision. In the midst of all this my partner finally confessed his true feelings hed been to afraid to disclosure in the past. My whole heart lit up. This had all been worth it. 

But then he started digging after a comment I made about hanging out with a mutual male friend of ours he started with the accusations. It lead up to a point where after a very heavy argument he took my phone and went through all my messages, social and beyond. He found of course that I'd been talking to other people before we got together. He was furious and began to call me names and make more accusations. We tried to work it out but that was back in September only a few weeks after getting back together.. Up until recently nothing had changed hed male constant accusation and threats that if anything ever ""came out"" that I'd lied to him about sleeping around we would be over permanently. I reassured him many times in tears feeling completely broken and frustrated. Most recently this fight occured. [the fight ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/erh8hw/i_23f_dated_my_boyfriend24m_friend_behind_his/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Dueing this fight he yelled at me at the top of his lungs like he has many times and said so many things that affected me so deeply I relapsed in his restroom... I did something I hadn't done in years to cope with the full body pain I was feeling. I honestly feel like something deep inside of me has broken because of this situation.

I'm so confused. Part of me understands his point I was deceitful about a few things he would ask part of me knew he didnt have any right to my past dating history and part of me just wished it to be over. So I would give him answer that at times didn't add up, didnt make sense. Not lies exactly just not the truth to avoid a blow out because in my mind these things just didnt matter and I knew the truth. At the end of the day he was upset over things that occured before we were together.. I knew my truth and I know even if I had slept around he would have no right of judgement. The logical part of me knows this situation is unhealthy and I have to remove myself but I love him and I know hes not a monster. The times we are happy are just so wonderful and I can see myself being with him for the long haul if we can work this out. But at this point so much of my self esteem is broken. I feel like his perception of me is so warped and I may never feel.or be able to be comfortable around him again. 
Is this salvageable  ? Should I just give this time? He is not a bad person just damaged and in his early 20's if I know my truth and I know I'm not the person he has tried to make me out to be there could be a chance of understanding? Please help.",21Jan2020,1
925,"Over the last few years I've been gradually stealing more things from the stores I go to. I don't want to do this, but I get a thrill from it. The most stupid thing about all this is that I don't even want the things I steal.

I just feel like I need to steal because it's the only exiting thing I have in my life.  
I don't plan on stealing in the future, I'm still shaken from getting caught today. The problem is that I don't have anything else in my life to even keep me busy.

I have been having flashbacks and trigger thoughts that cause hyperventilation and my heart to race. One time when I was trying to go to sleep I was having flashbacks and triggering thoughts and I was reacting the way I usually do, but then I suddenly started shaking and my entire body went numb like when you sleep on your arm. I couldn’t control my muscles. I dropped a water bottle I tried to pick up because I couldn’t close my hand right enough, and I couldn’t open my eyes, they would just flicker open and closed. I can’t sleep at night because of the anxiety and memories. I hate having to deal with them so I just sit on my phone I will 7-8 am. Usually when I got to sleep it was fine because I wouldn’t have nightmares, but lately I have started to have triggering dreams which makes sleep even harder. I just sit in my bed all day and night and don’t bother to socialize or go out. The outside world just seems too dangerous or that people can’t be trusted. I also have extreme social anxiety which doesn’t make things any better. Ever since it happened I have avoided any romantic or sexual relationship of any kind. I have never had a girlfriend, let alone had sex. It’s too stressful to even think about. It makes it a million time worse that I was abused by another male. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I don’t want people knowing I was overpowered and molested by another male. Makes me seem weak, even if he was older than me. I feel disgusted with myself. I have terrible mood swings that go from sadness and hopelessness, to anger and need for revenge, to panic, to just emptiness. Very rarely will I ever feel hopeful at all, and it only lasts a few seconds and is gone. I used to face a part time job, but it became absolutely unbearable. The constant memories left me on the verge of breaking down constantly. I can’t sleep at night so I would never feel rested. I don’t know how I could ever manage a full time job for years when I couldn’t even handle part time for like 2 months. The embarrassment and shame I feel makes it hard to tell people. I have only ever told two people, and it was by text. I cannot even admit it out loud, let alone talk about it. Sometimes it feels like it happened to someone else, someone that used to live in my body before but now I do. Sometimes when I remember it, I see it happening from outside my body. I also feel like I am making all of it up. Like all of thee things I am feeling are just made up by me. Like I am just doing it for attention. I feel like an imposter because he didn’t perform any sex acts on me and he didn’t touch me for very long. Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve help. I’m also scared that if I do get help they will tell me that there is nothing wrong with me, that I am just imagining all of these struggles. It also just seems so overwhelming, especially because I would have to find help on my own, because my mom doesn’t know anything about what I am going through. And on top of all of it I am constantly exhausted. I never have the energy to do anything really. And even if I did, I don’t find the same joy in the things I did. I have stopped watching hockey or hockey related content that I used to watch everyday. I have lost interest in snowboarding that I used to beg my friends to go and do. All I want to do is sit in bed. I am safe in bed. No one bothers me, no one to betray me. I talk online because no one knows me. I can share everything without real life consequences. It has been an outlet for me. Anyways, thank you for reading for those that do, and thank you for the advice those that choose to give it.",21Jan2020,1

935,"Hey there Reddit-

Last Friday, I went out after work to go drink a few beers and to go play some pool, and while I was outside taking a break, I ran into a customer of mine. 

We started talking, mostly small talk, and then we parted ways. However, when I walked back in to order another drink, she flagged me over, started talking again, and wound up having a couple of drinks together, and she started getting a little more friendly. 

Long story short, she kissed me, I kissed her, we wound up making out and exchanging phone numbers. She told me to keep in touch, and to text her the next morning. And I did. I also woke up to a friend request from her the next day. 

We exchanged a couple of texts, but then I never heard anything back. Upon looking at her Facebook, it seems she's been in a relationship for a while now. 

Do I let it go, and just remember a fun experience I had, or should I pursue the matter?",21Jan2020,1

939,"Hi,
I'm a dude graduating from high school soon. Just this year, I've been noticing something really weird. Generally, I smell fine (I hope) but lately something strange has been happening. When I leave my school to go out to lunch and enter any other building, i start to have this really funky smell that continues until I take a shower. It doesn't smell like typical BO either. It's this really sour, almost rancid coffee-like smell. I really don't know how else to describe it. This only happens when I enter other buildings, or at least that's when I smell it. It's like my body has a reaction or something. When I looked it up I found some stuff saying anti-perspirant can cause even worse body odor if you don't apply it the night before, and I put on anti-perspirant in the morning. But I'm not sure that fits my very specific case. It's pretty much only when I enter buildings after leaving school. Any help here? I know it's super strange.",21Jan2020,1

944,"It didn't actually strike me as a problem for a looong time since I basically grew up with it. But my dad is an alcoholic. And he apparently doesn't see it as a problem worth solving. But recently I realised that it will be his death.

He can be fine for a few months, but as soon as he gets upset with the littlest things he relapses and just can't stop until he's just a disgusting dead weight mess. And when he's finally sober he's easily angered, like a landmine - step wrong and you get a boom. And it's all over again.

Recently he's stopped smoking, which should be a good sign, but he just doesn't seem to want to stop drinking.

There's no AA community or anything like that in my area and he hates seeing doctors (not scared but actually hates). Though he does realise that it's not a healthy way of living. We tried taking away his money, asking him not to drink, confronting him when he's sober etc etc. At last we can't really lock him away, he's still a human after all.  
It's all a dead end, I don't know what to do. Should I convince him to go see a specialist? Or is there another way? Can someone be an alcoholic without an actual reason or can he be depressed?",21Jan2020,1

When my sister came out as gay, he screamed at her and claimed it was just a phase. He hasn't read a full book in years and acts like a product of that. He pays no attention to any of my interests and constantly claims that me standing up for myself in arguments is ""hurting his feelings"" while he yells incredibly hurtful, personal things at me. He works jobs that garuntee that we almost never see him again and said that my 23 year old other sister (who is mentally ill) moving away was her ""running"" away and invites guests who invade the rest of the families privacy and are just as obnoxious as him.

Despite this argument happening months ago, she claims she’s over it yet still does things like talking bad about me behind my back, etc. but recently, her and some of her friends were at my boyfriend’s house for a movie night (I was not there). I knew of the people there, but there were 3 I’m not close with, and 1 who I know of but haven’t had a conversation with. The girl and my old friend group were there, and they told everyone at the party that I was bisexual, and while I’m not hiding my sexuality, I want to tell people on my own terms at my own pace. She told everyone I was “gay, bi, pan, or whatever the f she is” then proceeded to make fun of me for being bi. I don’t know if she’s only told them or if she’s told a ton of other people about me. 

Do I just put a stop to it by coming out to my school via social media (my school is not accepting, so I really don’t want to do this) or should I just wait it out?

948,Ive been having a lot of trouble with mental health for quite some time now and I really dont have anyone to talk to about this so thats why I turned to this reddit. So Ive never been able to really make close friends with people due to trust issues and trauma but for a new years resolution (2019) I decided to make more friends. And trough that whole year Ive made one friend. Only one but Im happy. The person is a transfer student and they never really taljed to anyone and I noticed something was wrong so I mustered up the courage to befriend them. It took me a long time. One reason was because Im obviously kind of shy and the other is sometimes they miss school for months and it bothers me. Lately they have been missing from school again so I decides to check up on them. I know that they go to the doctors every month to another city but I dont know exactly what and I think it would be kind of rude to ask so I didnt yet. I talked to them again and the reason theyre skipping school now is because of mental health and that really hit me hard. Idk how to help them or what to do or what to say. Ive been so worried sometimes it leads to insomnia but I still havent texted them again because I just dont know what to do. I just feel lonely and my anxiety has been getting worse and I dont know how to gix anything honestly I rarely care about a person this much and why it bothers me too. On the surface we dont have a lot in common but I never met a person who had the same point of view on certain things or someone who can understand things just the way I do so thats why I value them so much and I dont want to lose them. Please someone if you know what could help please respond I really dont know what to do at this point. Thank you.,21Jan2020,1
949,"Me (M20) and my girlfriend (F20) were together for over two years and only broke up four days ago. We're not only each-other's first serious partner, we're also best friends and connect in ways we've never experienced before. Maybe that's how all first relationships are, I don't know. We go to different universities about 200 miles away and while long distance has been surprisingly easy for the past year and a half, I've been dealing with some mental health stuff for the past few months and thought it was worth separating for a while. As much as we love each-other, we never wanted to marry each-other so we knew it'd have to end eventually. But since we broke up, I've felt terrible. So scared and alone and regretful. I can't tell if it's just normal breakup grief or if I really made a mistake. I mean real connection is so rare, maybe I should hold on to it no matter what. All I keep thinking is how I'm going to end up alone and bitter and miserable and I might as well just kill myself. That last thought is getting worryingly frequent.

I do not feel comfortable giving this kitten back to my parents. We took him home, fed him and cleaned him up a bit. He is the sweetest kitten I have every seen. My fiancé and I already have two cats and a dog (we’ve kept them completely separate because we don’t know if he’s sick.) We are not in the best place financially, but I am worried that if we surrender him to the ASPCA he will eventually be put down. I want to keep him, but vaccinations for kittens are so expensive. I have found a free clinic that does vaccinations, but we don’t know if this clinic will be available for the next round of shots he will need (if I remember correctly they get 3-4 sets of shots in the first year).  I don’t know what to do but I feel responsible to make sure this little guy has the best possible life he can, and that this never happens to him again.

I’m 18(M) and I accidentally knocked up my girlfriend...18(F) 
Both of our families are extremely religious, we’re both struggling already in college and I really don’t have a plan. 
Abortion is not an option to me, and neither is putting it up for adoption. I will love this kid, this is my kid, I made the mistake of creating it and yes I’m terrified but now that I’ve came to terms with the fact I’m having a baby there’s no way I could give it up. 

I don’t have a plan but I do think I could drop out of college and work for my father. We own a farm, fairly big and I could take the reigns from him one day. It’s a solid career, but I do not want to do it... i want to go to college and get a better suiting job. 
By no means is our farm going to be a bad job though, my father makes 100-200k a year from it depending on the prices of beef. 
It’s just not my thing though. I don’t know if I could do it. Especially not like he does it.

It’s extremely noticeable, as I mentioned my pale skin and I have natural blonde hair on my head. Not only is it very dark, it’s almost impossible to get rid of. If I exfoliate, shave with a high quality razor, and moisturize afterwards it will stay away for maybe 12 hours at the most. The most success I’ve had is with wax strips, which kept it away for almost a whole two days but the cost isn’t really worth it. I just can’t find a way to control the fast-growing hair, and it’s extremely thick as well. I’ve never been in a relationship, as I’m afraid any boy would just find me disgusting. I actually find myself disgusting because of this. I just want to go to the pool sometime or even just wear shorts without worrying about looking like some kind of bear.

960,"We got together 27th of March 2019, met about month before. I never really had a relationship, was a virgin, a bit awkward etc... She has had a few, lost her virginity at 14 (I feel as this is important idk why) And has an addiction to weed. I'm rather anti drugs and we've had a few fights about it and talks. She's from the Netherlands while I'm Belgian so there is the cultural difference too. And also a 1h travel that costs me €30.

In the beginning everything was great, the first time I saw her irl (we met on Tinder) was at my birthday party. She was 18, I was turning 20. We kissed that evening.  
A bit later we got together (trough text) and a week or 2 later I was at her place (she lives on her own) and we had sex. There is a whole extra story about my lil bro down there but i don't think it's important for this. But long story short, I have trouble coming (when having sex). We had a good time, did lots together and we chatted a LOT via Whatsapp. She also smoked less and less because of me.

But in december, things started shifting. The winter depression started kicking in, she wasn't really feeling it anymore and it made me really sad, her best friend was also a bit pushy about ending it (learned that later when I checked her phone while she was sleeping, very idiotic I know, but I was afraid) Then things got a bit better and she wanted me back, the smoking got really intense again. A joint a day. Because of all of this, I started to notice things that were always there way harder, like how she doesn't compliment me often or rarely tells me that she loves me.  
She does have autism (something we discovered together... kinda, she was late with doing the tests), panic disorder (because of a rough childhood and parents that weren't all that great) and a few other struggles. They aren't the easiest to live with along with the addiction but I manage. Things like the autism might be the reason she doesn't really compliment me as often as I would like to be complimented. I compliment her all the time, tell her how I love her, I hug and kiss her lots, but lately she mentioned it to her friend (so I also read that of course, not proud of it, but because she isn't always very vocal about her needs, it gave me a LOT of insight and it helped me understand her. She it really is a double edged sword.)

Let me clarify the reading of the messages between her and her friend. It was around xmas and we haven't had sex for like a month despite seeing each other a few times, we had the moment where she was like, idk if I still love you, I started noting things and she was very quiet that day. I was afraid that something big was happening so I decided to check her phone. I read a few things and felt so disgusted and sad that I accidentally made a 2 sec voice recording in Whatsapp, tried to delete it but it will shill show up as a deleted message. I panicked and didn't tell her. Of course she saw it and connected the dots. Dumb me lied about it, but she noticed and a small fight followed that evening.  
Let me repeat, I'm not happy that I did that. She told me she just needed time for all that that I didn't give her. But if she things something should change and doesn't let me know, when will she.

During New Years Eve, we did truffles together with 3 of her friends, she also smoked a LOT that night. I enjoyed myself. The day after I had to leave because she would go on vacation with those friends and others. When she came back, she got sick and also didn't smoke because that would make it worse. We called and she was happy that we did, she also told me she loves me. That really is something that is so extremely rare (she does tell me often but it's usually a, I love you too after I tell her i love her)  
And it made me so extremely happy. But after 6 days of not smoking, it started again and she we started talking less again. Ups and down the last days where we would talk for a good while and then barely at all. I also don't always want to be the one who starts the talk.

She rarely ever starts a conversation or says goodmorning first. It kinda bothers me but I don't really want to bring it up because it feels weird to tell someone like, hey I want to wish you a goodmorning when you wake up.

We have a lot of things planned for februari and march, including our 1 year together. We will also spend valentines together so the next months will be very important for me. If nothing gets better it would really suck, as we already bought flight tickets to go to her grandma in Spain.  
It would really suck if we broke up before that. We did so much together already, I even helped her to get her new apartment ready.

So yeah, what do you guys think? I might have been a bit unclear because I'm writing this on a bit of a bad day where she is texting barely anything back while I'm trying to plan things and she doesn't even let me know she's busy or anything. Something she used to do sometimes. So please, ask me anything if things aren't clear. I'm also studying for exams (she isn't) she replies might come with delays.

961,"Me and my ex dated for a few months about 8 months ago. We ended things when I moved home from college for a semester, but now that I’m back, we’re friends again.

962,"I don't know where to start. I have so many things I want to do and so little time. I'm 20 already and feel like I haven't done anything. Everything seems to be falling apart recently. My girlfriend broke up with me and that's kinda got me in a rut. I'm approximately 20 grand in debt from student loans and that number is estimated to double by the time I'm done with college. I'm God awful at time management which is horrible because I have so many things I want to do but never get to them which makes me feel like shit later. I want to change my life for the better and introduce some kind of routine to it.

Now, I've been saying that to myself for the last 5 years but I really want to do this now. Cuz in a couple short months I will be 21 and then everything will start getting heavier and I want to have some things that I can rely on and think of as a constant before jumping into that reality. So I want to start running, running after the glimmer of a dream I have at the moment. I dream of making something out of myself and helping other people. I don't know why but seeing other people thrive make me soooo happy. I also want to start a business, learn how to market a product and gain influence in the social sphere. I want to create music and write stories that people can talk about and relate to. I have pretty much nothing to my name at the moment but some day I want to help people, donate to charities and support the issues that matter to me most. 

To do all of this I need some background knowledge and that's where Reddit comes in. I want to be part of communities that align with the skills that I want to develop. I have done some research and joined some communities already but there is always more to learn and find so I hope to discover some really great communities out of this. And if anyone has any advice on how to better this shit-show of a life of mine go right ahead, I'm all ears. I have recently started reading ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and that has really motivated me to move and get things done.

Recently she popped up in my reccomemded people to follow on insta gram and I added her and she followed back but like I wanna to get to know her better whats the way to approach or should I not slide in dms or see how face to face Interactions go",21Jan2020,1

966,"Since middle school, i have always had trouble staying awake in class. Unless Im really sleep deprived, I wont doze off fully but rather enter a weird fuge state in which Ill still try to take notes and absorb the material, but Im also half asleep and my notes are illegible and my eyes were closed. I also dont notice when this is occuring until afterwards. This happens for 15 minutes at a time max before I finally snap out of it and take notes normally. Its been a bit worse than usualy because of the unfortunate combination of having neighbors who are constantly lit, and building construction always starting at 7 am on the dot.

This usually isnt an issue in 200+ people lecture halls, but I recently registered for a class with like 15 people, and I sit in the front because thats usually the only free seat by the time I get to class. Ive noticed that whenever I snap out of my sleepy state, my prof kinda just, stares at me? Like he'll be explaining a concept and then makes eye contact with me until I nod in agreement or something. Ive never had this happen before, and I dont want him to dislike me as hes a lovely old british man who teaches a lovely class. Also hes gonna grade my papers. 

Do I write him an applogy? Or hope he never noticed and its all in my head?",21Jan2020,1

I've been playing along very well for the last 11 years. I can talk theology at times and take part in prayers. However, last week I had lunch with my cousin, who is a priest. He told me he's been having meetings with his friends where they talk about the bible. He showed me a list of seven questions that they always go through, such as ""How have you answered to God's suggestions lately?"" He asked me if I'd be willing to do this with him, one-on-one at first. I foolishly said I'll think about it, but not trying to find new commitments to my busy life right now. He said it's not a big one, just one hour per week, and I said it sounded doable.

Now he sent me the questions and asked me if I'd be willing to do this. I think this is where I want to draw the line. I really like my cousin as a friend and have no problem seeing him, but meetings just for the sake of bible stuff sound very taxing to me. He also takes spreading God's word very seriously, and has said that it's essentially the meaning of life.

When I’m in class I’m focused and that’s fine, but sometimes I can’t eat and I know I haven’t eaten anything in a while, i was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help get my appetite back. When I used to smoke weed a lot, I would get incredibly hungry, and it was amazing since I’m skinny and short, I weigh about 118 pounds. And I think I’ve lost weight cuz I’ve been so nervous about starting college, even smoking weed doesn’t make me THAT hungry anymore cuz of my anxiety, “jeez Rick, I really wish I could eat,” lol, if u watch rick and morty totally something morty would say jk but....
Obviously exercise would work, it’s just that I JUST moved in I don’t even know where the gym is but I’m gonna try working out to get my appetite. 

Also on a side note, I can’t sleep sometimes because of my anxiety... first night in I semi slept I think I may have dozed off for like an hour but it was 7:30 AM and I still haven’t slept, I think I got 3 hours of sleep. 

TL;DR So basically my question is, how can I relieve anxiety to the point where I can swallow an entire meal, and be able to get sleep?

But at least once a week since we broke up I have a dream about her. I remember every aspect of the dream. What we talk about, what she smelled like, where we where. 

I have only dated once since we broke up and it didn’t go well as I guess I talk about her in my sleep. Even one night stands that stay the night ask me who so and so is in the mornings.

I understand it's a lot of school work but I also have to go to my retail job to finance my schooling without burdening my family (I come from a low-income family). So I don't even have time to find a group to study with.

If I were to stop and save money, I'll end up spending more because i lose my two scholarships that makes it's affordable for me to go. 

I don't have any close friends I could talk to to relief some mental stress and my loving gf for 1y 9m broke up with me not too long ago, but we decided to stay as close friends. Two days ago she said to contact her once a month because she doesn't want to be there when I'm stressed. Only when I'm happy.

Nursing is very competitive and I fear no matter how many sleepless nights I do, I'll end up failing in the end. Unable to get career I want and having to pay back the loans I took anyways. I have no one to talk to relief some mental stress, little time to complete and understand my study material and I feel like everyone else is leaps ahead of me.

981,"I have a vacation rental in Hawaii that I heavily discount to my friend's parents every year. It usually rents for about $350 per night but I only have been charging them $150. I've done this for a few other friends and have noticed some of them occasionally bring their friends to stay (it's a 3 bedroom place) for a week or two, as well. That kind of pisses me off because I don't even know the other people. I'm not running a charity for strangers. The discount was meant for the friends, not some random people who I've never met.

On the other hand, it seems kind of tacky of me to say they can stay for $150, but it will be more if their friends join. I sort of think I shouldn't be micromanaging -- and just let them either do what they want or not give a discount at all.

\-Even in the early afternoon like today when I am trying to do homework or study they start with their noises

983,"Hello, I’m (18F) and recently I realized that at the beginning of last year I lost a lot of my drive to work and be productive overall. I used to get a random feeling to create and work but now I almost have to force myself to do what I want. Sometimes I’ll procrastinate really bad and I won’t start something until and few days or even a week later.

984,"Hey, 

So ever since Christmas, my friend has been extremely 'sloth-like' Not sure how to put it, but before Christmas she was enthusiastic, funny and would put a lot of effort into talking to me, bare in mind we still talk to each other every day albeit a little less now. But I've tried to suss out why she's gotten so, lacklustre, spineless and I guess boring, but nothing. No matter what I say or ask her she won't say anything is wrong, it's like she's oblivious to this sudden change in mood. At first I thought maybe it was exam results or something that'd upset her but this has been going on for a month now and it is bothering me because we were supposed to go out tomorrow for a meal and when I asked whether we were still going because we'd had no definitive answer as to when, she just ignored that part of the message. 

**I don't want to confront her about how it's frustrating me because I did that to a previous friend and it ended up with me being in a really awful state after things went sour**, but I can't keep pretending to be ok with this sh\*t anymore, it makes me feel like a puppet or a clown, I just wish she'd update me or something. It has just hurt me, makes me feel so f\*cking sad and frustrated because someone who I used to see 2/3 times a week is yet to even meet up with me since she came back from Christmas, and I don't know what to do anymore, I just miss how things were not even 5 weeks ago and I am only on this subreddit because I care too much about being hurt again, just feel lost and hopeless.

And I haven’t said anything about it, until today when I bring up how she went to the mall with one of my closer friends, and didn’t invite me. (A dance is coming up so we’re looking for dresses and me and my close friend have ours already) I ask her about it and she said she didn’t want to bother me with me having a dress already. I kind of wanted to call her out but didn’t and I feel that was dumb. And not to be bitter but be a little, this chick has I feel, become SUPPER CLINGY with my closer friend. I cannot tell you how crazy she can get. Like clingy to a new level. She has matching pfp with my closer friend, same t-shirts. SHE EVEN SWITCHED TO A NEW CLASS TO HANG OUT WITH HER. it’s crazy.

Towards the end of last year I was finishing my studies in the US and my family went broke as the property market in my home county went flat. They had a few comission checks on the way and so I was asked to find someone who could lend me money while we waited. I was unable to take a personal loan as an internal student. So my boss lent me $6,000 with the intention of making back interest of 15%. I was thankful and he was happy to help. (He is a huge hearted person and wants to help everyone)

It has been months since those checks were supposed to come in and I am still waiting to pay him back. I also had to leave the job because my work permit ended. He is now demanding I pay him back. I dont have a job nor the funds to pay him.

989,"           My entire life for as long as I remember I've never liked school. I know that is pretty common and every kid hates that but I just rubbed it off as immaturity that will heal in time. Unbeknownst to me, I'm finding myself still hating it that many years later. The environment is not for me,as I don't like that there are that many students to teach and I require one on ones since I also have a learning disability. I hate getting up and going and coming back. I started a 2 year program and didn't like it so opted out at the start of the second semester. 

        I plan on getting a job and my driver's license now as I am 18, and only know I'm realizing how much more happier I could possibly be without going to school too. I was always depressed in school as well so it was emotionally unhealthy for me. My reason for this is access to the internet where courses of course can be taken online at my own pace, and I can embark on business ventures such as e-commerce and a board game project I am planning and want to invest in stocks. 

         My brother is 24 and wasted two years of his life at home and is unemployed. He also has anger issues and has become a nuisance for us being constantly dependant on my mother for money.  My parents are afraid I'd do the same but I beg to differ. I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone, I want money and a job. My family are also Pakistani  and therefore more geared towards the traditional style of in person schooling.

    I know there are possible routes besides school such as raising money for such afforementioned ventures but I also want a fall back option. So where should my life go at this point? Should I continue schooling online whilst working, not continue school and stick to my plans (still working) or force myself to fight these 2 years? If any of the former then how can I convince my parents?

We met during high school (we were both 16 years old) we became very good friends and confidants, and we started dating in university, our relationship seemed to be perfect based on honesty, love and affection but she break  up with me in December because I didn't smile Enough and although I told her how happy she made me and I always reminded her that I loved her,  she somehow didn't feel it that way ... I opened up to her as I never had, I told her my fears and insecurities ... I opened my heart ... I also opened sexually with her (we never had sex). I always cheer her up  and cared for her, gave her many presents , told her that I loved her every day, I was always emotionally present, supporting  her in her lowest moments and when she seemed to be about to fall into depression, I encouraged her to continue her dream  career  even when she didn't believe in herself.

She always told me that everything was perfect, she always told me that she loved me ... She even asked me to marry her ... We tried to make the relationship work again but the break affected me a lot and I was emotionally unstable (very sad or very happy) everything seemed to go well until two weeks ago but she had a great fight with her mother and everything went to waste ... Yesterday we saw each other again and she spoke to me in a very cruel way ... Saying that she  didn't think about going out with me again and that all the good moments we lived in these months of reconciliation were to make me ""happy."" she wants me to be happy I know that. 


Today we saw each other again and she said that when she  thinks about love she thinks of me but that she is hurting me and wants me to be happy with someone else but I just want to be with her ... She  told me that she didn't want to lose me because I am the closest to a loving family that she has  ... But she still wants me to go away and be happy with someone else 

She comes from an unstable and violent family, her mother is like a dictator and her father abandoned them, she  has self-esteem issues  and has had depression in the past she goes to the psychologist, she is bisexual and I knew that since day one, I always supported her about that, she has image issues and I always tried to make her feel the must beautiful woman in the world.
