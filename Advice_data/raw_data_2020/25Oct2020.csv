1,"For the past 9 months I've (17M) been living with my mom (47F) alone. She is not physically abusive, but she becomes angry extremely quick and devolves into screaming and shouting, throwing out empty insults, calling random loved ones where she screams her argument to them, and goes back to lying and guilt tripping me and gaslighting me where my end of the story turns out bad when another person is listening to my mom. I have recordings of her lashing out. I don't know what to do. This is honestly the last straw for me. She becomes emotionally unpredictable and everything she says makes 0 sense. It's like one of those photos where you have to identify something in the photo but you never can. It's impossible sometimes to try to decipher what she's saying because she's speaking out of pure anger. She gets in the way of my schooling and has all around made my life extremely depressing. 

I need advice on where to go or what organization I can call or get a hold of? I have no other family members who I can live with, and my dad is extremely abusive as well. I don't know where to go",25Oct2020,1

4,"So I’m 16 and for years me and my brother didn’t really get along , my brother used to always curse at me and call me names and hit me sometimes when he got angry. He also used to accuse me of stuff when he lost them and would get angry when I asked him if I could turn off the lights for our room at 1am because I had school the next day .

Anyways my brother ended up getting diagnosed with pyscosis from cannabis and went to a mental health hospital to get drugs and meds for it ,  during this period he was always very nice to me and even bought me some stuff I really didn’t know how to even comprehend him being nice.",25Oct2020,1

7,"I (21f) broke up with my ex boyfriend (27m) a month and a half ago. 
I’ve tried to reconcile with him but he didn’t seem interested. I pretty much broke up with him in the heat of an argument and now he doesn’t want to get back together because he feels like i’m going to always want to break up when we fight. I’m trying to respect his space and hope he will want to get back together eventually.

But in the meantime, i’m absolutely losing my mind. I can’t sleep or eat and when I go to hangout with friends i’m so absent in their presence because he’s all I can think about. I’m stressing myself out by constantly checking his social media and I see he’s in the gym again, drinking with his friends and he overall just looks like he’s focusing on himself. I want him happy, but it’s painful to feel like he can be this happy this quickly without me. I saw a post he made of him being in some sort of hotel or resort and I can’t help but think he’s with another girl. 

I’m aware this isn’t healthy because we are broken up. He can do whatever he wants now. My question is: how can I get over this faster? How do I move on when I can’t find the motivation/energy to do anything?",25Oct2020,1

I felt like such a baby but it hurt my feelings and made me want to cry. I was tearing up after he left. 

Sometimes when I get mad I also cry.

9,"I’m currently majoring in English Secondary Education at my university, but I’m thinking of switching my major to English with a concentration in literature and language. If I continue with the education track I’ll take an equal amount of education classes as I am English classes and I’ll graduate in 3 years with my teaching certificate. However, if I switch to just English I can graduate in 2 years with a minor in publishing and I’d be able to take 6 hours of graduate level courses during my final year that would be paid for by my current scholarships.

11,"I have no life outside of school, I have nothing in common with my “friends” and I never even see them, when I’m not working on school shit I spend most of my life in my room trying to distract myself from the creeping feeling that I’m wasting my precious teenage years (mostly via yt twitter reddit etc), I feel Ike I’m missing out on the exciting fun memorable high school experience that I always hear about, Whenever I leave my house it feels like I’m in my head playing a video game where everyone around me is the enemy (this usually makes me somewhat skittish around other people, cars, and especially people I know that I see walking around) some times I just go outside and walk into town just to see if I might find some people I know and try to ‘hang out’ or whatever the fuck, and I usually end up just wanting to go home as soon as I see someone. But here’s the thing, I WANT to make good memories, have a girlfriend who loves me and who I really connect with (and one who I don’t get bored of after a few weeks), and in general, just do crazy off the wall shit with my friends and have fun while I’m still alive.

12,"My aunt and uncle's DIL has been driving me crazy this past week. It's too long and complicated to get into, but here's the latest thing she did:

On Friday, she both asked and told me to come over Saturday for supper. She was cooking it Friday night but she wasn't going to eat it until Saturday since it tastes better the next day. I told her I had other plans and would have to let her know Saturday, she told me to text her. So I waited until late Saturday afternoon to text her because she had been jerking me around all week by changing plans at the last minute (I was waiting to see if she changed her mind). So I texted her and simply told her I couldn't come over for supper. She responds with, ""no, I'm not home, come over Sunday."" She didn't even bother to contact me and tell me she had changed her plans. 

At this point, I don't think I want to go over Sunday because she's been doing this kind of crap to me all week. This behavior is highly unusual for her. I know she has an upcoming trip planned, but she's never acted like this before a trip. 

She's the kind of person I could never have an actual conversation with because she's a poor listener, very presumptuous, a know-it-all, super bossy, and manipulative. Because of that, I can't really ask her WTH is going on. I mean, I guess I could, but I don't know if she'd even understand her behavior, why I'm upset/annoyed, and why what she's doing is unacceptable.

She's wasted my time all week and I'm tired of it. I don't know if I should just assume she's stressing because of her trip and cut her some slack. I don't want her to think I'll just sit back and take this crap though. I'm a very quiet and shy person with a debilitating anxiety disorder. Someone has to push my buttons really hard and for a long time before I'll say something (I explode like a volcano). By that time, I'm so ticked off that everything that comes out of my mouth makes me sound like a crazy, angry, hateful person. In 20 years, she's only seen me speak up twice. I get mad at her probably about six times a year, but I just never bother saying anything.

I've been told I need to have more backbone in dealing with her. So I'd really appreciate some words of wisdom here.",25Oct2020,1
13,"
Two years ago, a friend of mine in Nevada asked me to look after his 19 year-old by having her turn up to work with my adventure tour company on the east coast. Our work is a highly trained high-risk activity.

She was horribly abused from the age of 3, which was followed by multiple visits to rehab from the age of 13, including one stint of 18 months for crystal meth addiction. She partook in underage prostitution of her own free will as an initiative to raise money for drugs. She has also been diagnosed with a medical condition that is treated with daily doses of prescription amphetamine. Up until 3 weeks ago I thought she was one of the mature humans I’ve ever met. She has more wisdom than many people twice her age. She is unbelievably capable of anything. 
She ran 50 miles runs at the age of 14 and 15.
She’s incredibly good at our activity for work. 

For the past two years,  she’s had her ups and downs, and we have had an amazing open honest policy about everything. I have been a periodic recreational drug user, at different stages of my life, having never had an addiction problem. I’ve watched others take drugs in the past with me and become addicted.

Part of the reason I believe have never become addicted, is my respect for drugs, with my number one rule that drugs are smarter than me.  I have previously had an alcohol issue however. 
I had used pretty much everything with the exception of crystal meth.

During the BLM protests, Id been drinking too much. She visited me, gave me my first taste of crystal meth, and left me up to my own devices. It was ok but nothing amazing compared to some of my previous experiences with other drugs. 

A few months or so later, she was in a bad spot with drugs, and she moved into the house I’m staying in. We proceeded to do crystal meth every three weeks or so together, being productive in between.

I stressed to her in the beginning, if we are going to do this, how important honesty was. And once the trust breaks, it can’t be restored. We agreed that we were only doing this with each other. Each “session” would be a few pipes. For each pipe, we would make a record of it to monitor usage over time, so we could see historically if it was getting out of hand. The unbreakable rule was no more than being awake for one night only. And we would always have at least a week in between sessions, but most likely 2 weeks

Over the past six months there has been a lot of incidental deceitful behaviour that I always gave her the benefit of the doubt with.

For example:
Lots of secret texting and not answering calls in my presence.
crystal meth was disappearing, with her saying “Nah we smoked it Last time”
A number of last-minute late night disappearances with ridiculous justifications.
Me suspecting she was on Crystal meth, with her saying it wasn’t crystal meth, just her medication.
Taking an extremely long time when she would be going to buy the drugs.
Using her medication as a trade with her dealer for crystal meth.
Spending a disproportionate time inside the dealers premises when obtaining  crystal meth. 

A few weeks ago, it became clear that she had not been 100% honest about her current drug use, which was a little bit more extensive than first thought. It was a massive breach of trust. It was clear she had been using ice outside our arrangement. My best guess estimate is she was using 3-4 times what we were together.

We had a massive falling out with me kicking her out, saying “how can I possibly give you a job now?” 
All of the trust had gone. Looking back at the past six months of her weekend work with me, I could not now 100% say that she had not been under the influence of crystal meth whilst working with me in a high risk environment. I phoned up my friend and told him. Everything. I had told him previously that I thought she was using and that going to use for the rest of her life due to her medical condition. I justified my use with her to her dad as trying to control her intake and exposure, which was true. But the truth also is, I did have fun as well.

She knew that she had ruined her opportunity, however I created an opportunity where she could apologise and try and regain my trust and go to full time employment, along with associated formal training to build her a professional career.

She moved back in, after going missing for a few days, stating as she arrived that’s she just had her period so apologised in advance for being a bitch for the next 5 days. It was clear to me that it was just her coming down off an crystal meth binge.
We did two weeks work hard together and then we had a crystal meth session at my suggestion. I regretted it afterwards.

The next day I said to her, “we need to come up with a plan regarding you and work and crystal meth as the past approach didn’t work. “

I needed to know how bad her crystal meth problem was. I asked her what 30 days going without crystal meth would look like for her. She explained that she would have a few down days every month due to her medical condition, and that she would want to use crystal meth on those days, but it would never impact the job. I asked her what about the fact that it stays in the system for 4-5 days? She said, “it’s no drama, I know my own body I can drink a lot of water and have it out in two days“.
She then offered information that it was well known by people with her medical condition to regularly use crystal meth to self medicate in a responsible manner. I then went and found a scientific paper that In fact stated the opposite.
 I said that I thought the only way forward might be at zero drug policy. I.e she will need to give up crystal meth completely.
I asked her if she thought that was something she could do. I think I could tell she was not too excited by the prospect.
I asked her for her idea on how we could do drug testing.
She then said, “what about we use the record system of last time, but in addition I will tell you why I am using, whether it is for medical or otherwise?”
I was dumbfounded. I am now convinced this is not going to work. She disappeared last night again, saying going to see her friend that’s she stayed with previously (and used that time)

She is coming back today to discuss everything.

She is an incredible human being outright, but even more incredible when you consider the set of circumstances she has been given in her life. It means the most to me and her family to get her off this vicious cycle that she has been on for her entire life. 

However, I do believe that she has previously successfully self medicated using crystal meth, which is more successful than the amphetamines that she has been prescribed for her condition. 

Any advice or insights into crystal meth addiction that can guide me?

TLDR: Should I give a long-term crystal meth addict a job in a high-risk industry when she has lied and deceived multiple times. What are the chances of her stopping? Or do I allow her to self medicate with crystal meth for her medical condition, insuring that it is never possible for her to work whilst under the influence?",25Oct2020,1

17,"21 year old female here.

Found a lump in my left breast last weekend. My doctor examined it yesterday and said it didn't seem suspicious at all but said nowadays as policy, they send anyone with a lump in their breast for further testing. He told me it would be about two months until I get an ultrasound/sonogram, as lm low risk because of my age and have no cancer symptoms (i.e. the lump feels like a grape, movable, no visible changes in my breast). 

 He actually rushed me in yesterday when I finally phoned because my aunt (who he also knew) had breast cancer at 29 (only person on either side of my family to ever have it). I felt initially relieved he seemed so confident I was OK because it had no warning signs and it seemed like fibrocystic breast  disease (which runs in the family) but now Im worried because he still referred me out and if he was certain why would he?  I'm scared that if I have cancer it'll go to the point of no return while I wait. I need help calming down?",25Oct2020,1
18,"TLDR at the bottom. 

Around 2 months after starting at my new job I recommended some of my friends for an open position in my team (same job as me). I got kind of surprised they hired my friend Kyle. Kyle’s very social and makes good first impression but he just isn’t a competent worker. We were drinking buddies in college, he was very lazy and since college he’s been working at his family’s business. 


At first I was really open to him asking me questions about the job and processes but as time went on (now I’m 5 months in and he’s 3 months) I’m getting more annoyed by all his questions. The thing is sometimes the questions are solved by common sense? We both studied IT and we’re working at a tech startup, some technical aspects should be obvious to us so I don’t know why it isn’t to him. He’ll ask me questions before trying to figure things out himself first or just observing how everyone else does it? For example we receive tickets through a group chat, by just reading those responses in the chat you’ll know what to do with certain tickets but he’ll still ask me what to do. 


I know I should be patient and when I’m new at a job I want someone I can look to for guidance when I need it but at this point I’m getting really annoyed with him? 


Lately I’ve been replying to him coldly on chat. Tonight (on Saturday) he messaged me about work, the question wasn’t even something I could solve on my end! It was more of troubleshooting his Adobe! I responded in a cold way that I don’t know. I just got so annoyed because I really don’t like dealing with work things on the weekend and the question itself he could’ve solved with Google or figuring it out on his own. I made a post on IG story to all my followers that I don’t respond asap on messenger due to social media detox (true), if its urgent call me or if its work it can wait till monday. He messaged me saying ‘SORRY :(‘ and now I just feel bad for making him feel bad. 


I don’t know how to gauge if he’s asking too many questions or I just get annoyed to quickly? My boss said that for a new hire I barely ask questions, they just explain things to me once and I pick it up right away. I asked questions at first in my 1st-2nd month but by 3rd-present I figured stuff out already and work independently. I don’t think I’m smart or anything so I kind of expect others to be the same?


I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to encourage him relying on me but I don’t want karma to bite me one day. 


Everything I’m saying in the post are from my perspective btw so I don’t know if I’m being harsh or if perceived differently by other coworkers. 


Other instances why I find him incompetent: 

Our job is is strict with deadlines but he takes so long with them for some reason which clogs up his back lock. I’m kind of upset that I ended up having to pick up some of his tickets, he had one ticket for 2 weeks and I finished it in a day. He said he gets confused with how to prioritize tasks but that’s not good because prioritizing and organization is like the whole essence of our job. 

Our boss’ boss has gotten upset with him a few times. He showed me an emails of her saying ‘this should’ve taken 2 days max!’ and ‘pls we need to move faster with this’. Another big part of our job is presentations and he’s bad at them (even though its just through voice chat now). He presented something and he missed a lot of details and he even gave some wrong information. My boss’ boss had to tell him to email everyone in the meeting the correct information and summary of the presentation because it was dragging and people were confused.


TL;DR: My company hired my friend but he asks me too many questions to the point its getting really annoying and I find him incompetent. Lately I’ve been replying to him in a cold way. He asked me a question that I couldn’t even help with so I said I don’t know. I made an ig story that due to social media detox (true) I don’t reply fast and work related things can wait til monday. He responded with ‘SORRY :(‘ and now I feel bad.",25Oct2020,1

Mostly because I hate the taste but also because alcoholics run in my family and I’m really not interested in the way it makes you act/feel. I’ve never been drunk or high or anything like that. Anytime I’m in a group setting one of 2 things happens: people look at me like I’m super innocent and childlike, or think I’m really stuck up. I realize that when I decline alcohol or weed it looks like I’m against it but that’s not the case at all! I have no problem with people drinking or smoking, I just choose not to do it myself... but apparently that’s a social anomaly. I’ve always been the “goodie two-shoes” of my family and friends as the only one who doesn’t drink at all, and I can’t help but feel super immature around them even if I’m close to their age. On my 21st birthday my cousins took me out and tried to get me to try every kind of alcohol imaginable and I declined every one, and I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed about it because everyone I know has at least one drinking experience, good or bad. Everyone was amazed that I wouldn’t drink anything and still mention it sometimes. I just feel like everyone else my age is a lot more socially experienced than me.

I have tried to convince him to Costco but he says he’s not going and he’s fine I had told him that I am only doing it because I care for him and he could get some medication that could possibly help. I am trying to schedule appointments for him so he could go to the doctor but I cannot get anything scheduled because I am not getting calls back from the clinics and it’s just been a giant mess. My mom doesn’t seem to care as she hasn’t tried to do anything and my brother and sister have it mentioned about helping and don’t know what to do. On top of that I still live with my parents but I have been looking at getting a house or an apartment for myself. But now with my dad going through this, I feel like I need to be there to help him out and I want to spend as much time as I can with him. It seems to be getting pretty progressive and he seems to be getting bad awfully quick.

So there are just 1 million things going on right now through my head. I don’t know what to do.

I made a post about this same roommate on here before. But for example we take turns with chores. And she was exaggerating how she is always cleaning which is a lie because she is always putting her personal packaging boxed by the trash and we have to take it out. Her hair falls out everywhere and she never changes the toilet paper. Everytime me and my other roommate would try and defend ourselves she would just shoot us down and basically say ""you're wrong I'm right.

28,"So I’m 21 now, just turned last week and it made me realize that time is flying by really quick and I’m in the same position I was in 4-5 years ago. 

I graduated high school as a running start student and really had no clue or interest in what I wanted to do with my life. I knew university wasn’t the right thing for me because I never had any real passions so I decided community college would be the better option to give me more time. I continued taking quarters at my local college and trying different classes such as programming and still found that I really don’t have much interest in learning the content. I found myself copying and pasting code just to get the grade. 

Right now I’m on unemployment and living at home with my parents so pretty much have been saving whatever money and have close to 13-14k saved up. I only worked short periods of time, such as summer breaks or whenever I wasn’t taking classes. Typical dead end jobs such as warehouses and retail just to keep me busy. Never liked any of them. 

My social life is non existent as well. I only have a few friends, but none that I actually go out with. Friends that I’ve met at the gym and see every few weeks. My days are just a routine of finding things to waste time and go on to the next day. The only real interest I have had is the gym and working out. It’s the only thing that clears my mind a bit. 

I’m super tired of living like this. I feel exactly the same as I did when I was 18. Everybody else my age is moving forward, but I’m still stuck. I wish I could wake up one day and be a new person with a new personality, new hobbies, new interests, etc. I just have no idea on what step I have to take to change. I really want to change. I hate the life I’m living everyday that I wake up. I know if I don’t change I’ll be 24-25 years old still living at home and working some shit job I don’t like. 

Any advice is appreciated.",25Oct2020,1
29,"I just graduated high school in June of this year.  Quarantine ended, and my mom still did not allow me to see any of my friends and I have lost all contact with most of them. I feel really lonely, as I've only convinced my mom to let me see one friend. I end up meeting a boy and we have been talking for five months, and I really like him. My 18th birthday hit, and my friend (the only friend that I'm allowed to see) couldn't make it. The day after my 18th birthday, my dad reached out to me. I decided to see him, as seeing that he has changed as a person. My mom was hesitant about me going, however I went anyway. I come home and everything was fine. The next day, my mom blew up on me. Saying if I want to see my dad, I will have to stay there for 2 weeks. My mom is very worried about COVID-19, however she takes it to the extreme. The day after, my mom proceeded to blow up on me again. Today, I overhear my mom and grandma talking about all of us moving our own way. My mom uses the fact that I told my step mom that she has not signed me up for college, the fact that I told my mom that I was jealous of my friends who had their dads in their lives, against me. My mom proceeds to come in and out of my room, yelling at me, scaring me, saying that my grandma will end up in a respirator, that both her and my grandma could die, and making me beg for forgiveness. She kept coming in and out of my room to see if I was texting other people about how she was acting. I am so isolated from the world. I have no job, drivers license, I am not registered to vote, and I don't know anything really. My mom has not apologized since. She tells me I can't see my dad, as I've planned to see him Tuesday. She makes me feel awful for wanting to see him. I told her I want to stay with him for two weeks, as he's okay with it. She responded with ""stay with people who love you"". I just want my life to go well, and as much as I love my mom and she has taken care of me for my entire life, our relationship has been less than good ever since I got into contact with my dad. What do I do? Do I move in with my dad? Can my mom stop me from moving into my dads house?",25Oct2020,1
31,"TL;DR at the bottom.


My mom, my brother, and I all baby sit often for my friend. My friend and I were raised like sisters but grew apart in adulthood. We like to spend time with her kid so all three of us take turns keeping him sometimes (once or twice a week). 


My brother and I stopped keeping him when the quarantine started in March. My child has immune system and respiratory issues and my brother has health problems of his own. We would occasionally still see him at my Mom’s house but not as often. 


My friend was aware that my family is taking Covid very seriously (as advised by my child’s specialist) and strictly practicing social distancing. We have stayed away from almost everyone except a small handful of co-workers and a limited amount of immediate family members who we trust and know are also practicing social distancing. 


It’s October 24th. Said friend just now informed us that her Mom had Covid in September. Her mom is her main baby sitter (and is sometimes the drop off person when he comes to visit us). We confronted her and asked her why she did not inform us of this and she claimed it was because they weren’t around her mom.


After speaking to her Mom we find out that she returned to work on October 1st. This means she likely tested positive or became symptomatic 14 days prior. 


After searching back through our messages I see that her kid was at my moms on September 8th, 9th, and around us on the 16th. She also asked my mom to keep him on September 14th, 18th, and September 25th but she declined for various reasons. I know that he was with her Mom (the Covid positive person) on August 29th, September 8th, and September 14th.


Now they are both claiming that none them were around her before or during the time she had Covid (which is obviously a lie but I guess they think we are too stupid to figure out the dates) and that not telling us wasn’t intentional. 


My mom thinks she is being selfish but is accepting that it wasn’t intentional. I on the other hand feel that they are being sneaky, selfish, manipulative liars and to say I’m angry about it is an understatement. I think it was absolutely intentional so that she wouldn’t lose her “backup babysitter” for a month and therefore purposely put my mom, children, and all of us at risk.


Now obviously I KNOW for a fact now that she cannot be trusted and is a selfish human. My question is how should I confront her about everything? What exactly should I say? Should I say anything or just cut her off or what? 


TL;DR
My friend’s mom tested positive for Covid. We take turns keeping my friend’s kid for her. She continued to let people keep him and be around her without informing them of the direct Covid exposure. Many of these people are immunocompromised. My friend and her mom then lied and said none of them were around each other but I have messages from her that prove otherwise. How should I confront my friend about this? Am I right to be this angry?",25Oct2020,1
32,"Yes. It is happening. But I don't wanna be in a relationship or anything right now. I just want advice on how I should conduct myself, because it's my first time going on a proper date, not just some school cafeteria bs. It's been 4 years since I had a crush on her, and we had been great friends even before that, and still are. Some questions that I have are:
 Should I pay?
 How do I greet her?

The goal post always moves with her, so I’m always feeling like I can’t do anything right.

36,Hello everyone I thought I would write this post because I am very frustrated the way my life has been going in terms of my job and making the right decision on what career path I want to take. I am 25 years old and I have been to college 2 times so far in my life but unfortunately I ended up dropping out due to the bad grades I was getting and I felt like it was a complete waste of my money and I felt like I made the wrong choices for my future career. First I went to college in hopes of one day becoming a plumber but that ended horribly after 2 months and then a year later I decided being an electrician would be a better fit for me. My second attempt at college was much better than the first but I failed a couple of classes which prevented me from moving on to the second semester. I didn't want to pay the fees to retake the classes so again I dropped out and my confidence was very low and I felt like a failure. Unfortunately I was going through health problems at the time (epilepsy/seizures)  and I feel it was a big distraction and it was tough for me to concentrate and study during my time in college. Since I've been out of college I've just been working the last few years at my local grocery store because I can't find anything else around me. I absolutely hate my job cause retail jobs suck for the most part and my pay is not enough. On top of it all I don't even have a drivers license due to the previous health issue I had so I'm stuck where I am. I just want to have a more substantial career and be more successful in life. I've been thinking long and hard about going back to school but the problem is that I am undecided on which programs to take. I don't even know what I am passionate about to be honest. I'm not going through health issues anymore so I feel that if I were to go back to school I would have better concentration than my previous two attempts and I am able to go for my drivers license finally after battling epilepsy for almost 10 years. Is college something I should even consider again after failing twice or should I just look for a different job whenever I get a drivers license?,25Oct2020,1

38,"It confuses me, and sometimes makes me feel lonely. I will elaborate.

About a year into our relationship things got a bit sour with myself and one of my partner’s friends. They had made an unnecessary comment towards me and I reacted. I shouldn’t have, but it was instinct. Through my direct reaction, an argument arose between myself and my partners friend. I tried to calm it down, and explained how I didn’t like the comment etc and before I knew it they had blew the conflict up massively. Hurled abuse, the whole lot.

It all died down and I just shunted it off. I’ve a tough skin, so I never took offence. As the days passed I noticed my partner was on video calls with their friend (the one who made the comments towards me, and got rather aggressive during the conflict), and it was as if nothing had happened between me and them. I made a comment shortly afterwards, asking if my partner had confronted their friend about the way they spoke to me. My partner said they hadn’t said anything, and feels like it’s unnecessary to put their friend straight. Again, I shrugged it off and hoped it was a one-off, and after all... I wouldn’t want my partner to lose a friend.

Fast forward another year, and since then incidents have happened where people who live with us (we’re students in sophomore) and are the same gender as my partner have gotten really nasty with me, simply because we had a clash of opinions. So much so, I became rather hurt at the tone, aggressiveness and choice of words used. I didn’t expect my partner to get involved right away as it would have escalated the situation. So I waited, and waited... and waited.

I was still waiting, and nothing was ever said to anyone on every occasion. And I’ve began to notice these are patterns. Every time I have been the defuser, to try calm the situation, to the point where my partner will say behind closed doors to me that it’s unfair how they speak to me, and how aggressive they get. However when my partner has opportunities to defend me, nothing is said.

I have began to question my loyalty with my partner, as scenarios have arose - on numerous occasions - where I feel like my partner is always against me, indirectly. I am never comforted or made to feel like I am not in my own, because their actions never reflect what they tell me behind closed doors. 

I have always said that if my partner is in the right, and I watch/listen a friend (or even a roomie) give my partner shit, I will back my partner till my death. Because why should they experience it alone, when I’m next to them and can “back them up” as such.

It’s hard to explain what truly happens without exposing my identity. So I hope you have understood the take-home message... being made to feel like I’m on my own whenever conflicts happen",25Oct2020,1

41,"TW: mental illness, self-harm, domestic violence

I haven't been feeling good at all mentally. Last night, my boyfriend's step dad hit his 15 year old brother. I think his mom is kicking his step dad out. He has done a lot of sketchy shit before. My boyfriend and I are both scared he will come back and hurt someone. I know that if he does, we can call 911 or CPS. But we really don't want to have to.

I feel like absolute shit. My bf talked to his uncle last night, who said they should move downstate with him. If that actually happens I will lose him. I've felt depressed and anxious and hopeless before but I don't know if I've ever felt this bad. I know my bf is going through a lot and I don't want to dump my emotions on him or overwhelm him or act like this is about me.

This isn't about me.

But I'm so scared. I've known him for years, and we've been dating for a year and a half. I am so scared of losing him. I'm scared of his step dad hurting him. I'm scared of having to break up. I can't lose him. He's my world. I feel so so scared and dissociated, but my brain keeps yelling at me to not make this about me. I can't explain how bad I feel. I want to be able to live with him and be financially stable and have better mental health and be a better person but this world seems so cruel right now and I'm so scared. Nothing is guaranteed and I'm scared of everything going to shit. Sometimes I fear he doesn't love me anymore. Sometimes I feel like he doesn't. I can barely eat and I feel like I'm in literal hell and my vision is blurry and my head is pounding. And whenever I feel bad mentally I feel guilty. I want to feel like he loves me and I want to be happy and feel okay again but I feel so so low. It's 8 PM and I don't have the energy to fix anything. But I'd feel so so guilty and I'd just make everything worse if I hurt myself, which I haven't done in a long time. So I'm just stuck here and I know it's going to be a long night.",25Oct2020,1

44,"I feel like the trend of referring to people as Mr. and Ms. is falling by the way-side. Or at least it's not something often done in my circles, and people have told me it's odd to do so when all the people involved are adults. I had to write a few emails to relative strangers this week and I just can't figure out where the line is. And also don't want to step on toes because some people do not identify with Mr. or Ms. or actively dislike being referred to as such. I have been told several times that my manner of speech is too formal, but at the same time, I don't want to be unprofessional, especially when making first impressions. I'm just starting a job hunt and it's stressing me out far more than it should.

For example, in a job-related three-way conversation thread someone was introduced to me as John. ie. the third person in the chat who was helping us set up a meeting said ""Hi John, this is Kate. I hope you two can have a good conversation"". John is my elder, in a senior position, and a stranger. He was introduced to me as John, but I know his last name and he himself never told me to call him John. In my follow up message to him, I started with ""Hello John..."" but I'm doubting whether that was appropriate.

As another example, I sent an email to a company to inquire about a job. It was to a general email address not to a specific person, so I started with a generic greeting. The person who emailed me back ended their response with ""Thank you for your interest, Tony"" and then had his full name, degree and contact info in a signature below it. Should I refer to them as Tony because that's how they signed their name? Or should I stick with Dr. Johnson because we are not on familiar terms and they are involved with the hiring process?",25Oct2020,1

I'm currently working a teaching job which I promised myself would be a single-gap-year job to give myself time to apply to grad school.

To clarify, I'm now in year 3 of my ""single-year job"".

I have a bachelors in both English and Mathematics. I don't know what I want to do. I'm not sure if this is a case of ""the grass is always greener,"" but I really do feel as though I've painted myself into a corner here. I have no great interest in teaching high school math and English for the rest of my life, but I can't figure out what else I can do with my degrees. All my job experience is in academia, and it feels as though there are no useful real-world applications for my fields of study.

I've wanted to go to grad school for years now, but I don't even know what I want to study. I just want to get out of this rut. Ideally, I'd like to do something to help people, perhaps even to combat climate change (which seems like THE big existential threat bearing down on all of us). The thing is, it seems that every career which seeks to make the world a better place uses a background in science and engineering which I can't afford to get. Like it or not, the undergrad degrees I have are the degrees I'm stuck with. I just don't know what exactly I have to offer, nor how to get from here to . . . there, wherever ""there"" is.

I have been fighting 28 years, I have fought to be myself, I have fought thru mental pain. But now there’s a new one, I was diagnosed with degenerated disc in my lower back recently an arthritis he made sure to make that a point when he was reading my MRI. Anyways I have been in severe back pain for bout 6 months now. Usually stays between 4-8 pain wise, I have had worse pain like inner ear infection so bad I was in the floor of the ER or a ruptured hernia that laid be up for 2- 3 weeks praying for mercy of death. I have never done that before. Now this back pain is continuous rarely eases up unless I take pain medication mixed with muscle relaxers. Back to the problem. I have always suffered with my mental health been that way for as long as I can remember and you begin to cope with it your own way an get “used” to it even tho thoughts of suicide would be a daydream for me. Now I’m dealing with chronic ongoing back pain. Doctors said I’ll battle it the rest of my life.. so lately I have understood mercy killing in a new way. With the mental health spiraling an constant back pain. Thoughts of suicide have came back with a vengeance. I keep telling myself stop pitying myself could be worse. Can always be worse I know. But now I am spiraling and I don’t have any friends. I have a gf. I live with her since March. But whenever I try to tel her what’s bothering me she gets mad at me an snaps at me. So I learn to shut up. Even when she ask what’s wrong. I’ll say I’m sad. And she will say “ we’ll just don’t be sad “ and idk I feel like that just makes things worse so now I just started drinking an reply with “im fine” with anyone including her that ask. And when i do something she tells me to do or wants done she always says I did it wrong. An idk it hurts when she does that or degrade me. Or that’s what it feels like anyways.. prob not it idk we have been together for bout 4 years now. I have been on testosterone for 11 months. And she still won’t hold my hand I’m public. Or even in the car when it’s daylight. Bc other people will see. We been thru a lot together.. an she has put me thru a lot.. she was seeing someone else for the first 3 years she ended up marrying him.. then I left an stoped talking to her an just idk I ghosted? When I found out she got married bc I was heartbroken to the full extent to where I was numb. She then divorced him a month or so after I left an I had to see her at work and when she was upset that I just up an left dumbass me pulled her into my arms bc I truly love her. But I wasn’t intending getting back together I was just saying my goodbyes. Few weeks later she messaged me saying she’s getting a divorce. An idk we kinda just picked back up where we left off. I want to state that I truly am not mad at her or feel any bad feelings toward her I don’t think she’s a bad person. I’m just trying to explain what’s happening. So please don’t think I’m trying to throw her under the bus. I’m just ... idk I don’t think I can take it anymore. I love her unconditionally. She dragged me thru hell. And I still do love her. But I feel like she doesn’t love me. Or doesn’t love me the same as i do her. The way she talks to me is like I’m dumb. Or like my feelings don’t matter. I have told her time an time again what has hurt my feelings an that not holding my hand thing seems like a small thing to be upset over an maybe it is.. but I’d like to feel like she wasn’t embarrassed of me.. that would be nice.. I’m not that guy that just lets the gf tell me how to act or dress. She wants me to not dress in black all the time witch I don’t I enjoy some colors like burgundy, and blue. Anyways she buys me clothes. I wear them if I like them. ( she bought pink shorts for me) I straight up told her I will never wear those. It’s not a masculine toxic thing for me I don’t mind pink. I have a black an pink shirt. But those shorts would make me look like a Kyle disgusted as a chad an id kick my own ass. So I stand my ground. I do believes fixing what’s broken. An after she got divorced long story short we trying again. Bc like I mentioned I do unconditionally love her. And I’m the beginning of trying again after the divorce she was sweet and kind an loving to me. But lately it just seems we have gone back to FWB and I can’t do this anymore. I’m not asking for pity. I just wanted to get this off my chest bc I don’t have any friends. Like at all. She has hers an I’m sure they get a ear full. But I just don’t have any. I would like one. I would like to feel like I somewhat mater and someone does care about my feelings. Would be a nice feeling. I have been alone for so long now idk how to make friends. I haven’t had a friend since high school. And I’m just loosing the battle right now. I don’t want to mercy myself. But if it comes to that. And if any of my family or gf reads this. It’s not anyone’s fault. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. And i do love you mom,dad, big brother, and little brother &amp; sister I know u guys have seen me battle my demons since I was young an you guys say I’m strong an I light up a room with my smile an goofyness. And I’m happy I made u guys smile an laugh. You guys leaned on me a lot. And I always held you guys up. But my foundation is falling. An I’m sorry. But honestly I’m dying on the inside and it’s noones fault. Between my back pain and the mental pain. I honestly don’t think I can handle anything anymore. If I do decide to leave I hope you guys find this one day. And to anyone else reading this sorry for the long confession. But I needed it off my chest. And if you read it, thank you for your time.

54,"f14 have developed severe anxiety about leaving my house. I never really went out much in the first place but it's gotten horrible. Over quartine, I've gotten way too attached to the comfort of my room. I don't like being watched by other people. Even if no one is there I feel as if I'm being watched and judged. I can't even go in my backyard which is fenced. I don't have a very busy neighborhood either, I live on a pretty quiet street. I didn't really notice my fear until about a month ago when I started to feel suffocated in my room but I couldn't stand the thought of leaving it. I just really want to go and walk down my street but every time I think about going outside I get really scared and feel like crying. I can feel it getting worse too. I get anxious about going to the kitchen to eat or drink water if I know someone in my family is home. I don't know what to do. I miss going outside. I used to have a rabbit that hung out in the backyard a lot and I'd spend time with him but he died two months ago. I can't tell anyone in my family because I'm really embarrassed about it. I hate myself because I know I'm being irrational and nothing will happen if I leave but I can't get over it. What do I do?",25Oct2020,1
55,"Good evening gents. I live with a family, and have for many years. They are not blood to me but I consider them as much family as my own. They have a child that lives here, for privacy's sake I'll call him Z. Me and Z have had an interesting relationship, as Ive had to be with him for many hours every single day for years now. He is 7 year old. I have taken to almost raising him as if he were my own brother/child etc. Is this weird? I have most of the big boy talks with him, I've taught him how to manage money, I've scorned him when he does wrong, I've taught him how to shoot, clean his room, etc. It almost *feels* as if I am his father, as he doesn't actually have a father.

I'm the only make in the house that makes money, the other guy is in college and everyone else is a female (not saying that matters, but i figured I'd state it). So it seems plausible that I could be a father figure to this child.

Is this weird? Is this normal? I don't want to feel as if I'm overstepping anyone's boundaries. I basically engage in the raising of this child, so it's habit at this point. just wanted to hear some opinions on this.

56,"Sorry for the format in advance, I’m on mobile and pretty distraught. 

I’m 22, I live with my parents and my older sister. My dad is at the highest risk for getting a severe case of
covid and I’m overweight, almost obese so I’m at risk too. I’m terrified of this virus. My dad almost died a few months ago and it was the worst time of my life. This was before covid, but since covid, I’ve been trying so hard to only go to work and come home, going out when necessary and always staying distant/wearing masks. I’ve slipped up a few times, hanging out with friends and each time I feel so bad and basically isolate myself from my family for 2 weeks. Hell, I even broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years because he wasn’t being safe about covid and not being truthful about it. He wasn’t the only one though, my family always wear masks and all that but they constantly invite people over to our house. My sister always has friends over or goes out with them and my parents invite some friends over sometimes and this freaks me out to no end. I feel like I’ve been doing the most to protect us but I feel like it’s all for nothing. Today is my birthday, I wish so badly I could hang out with my friends (who all hang out with each other/others all the time and have a yolo attitude) but it just all brings me so much anxiety. What’s the point of trying to be so safe when NO ONE around me is being nearly as precautious!? I have so much pandemic fatigue, I’m so fucking depressed and anxious all of the time and I feel myself spiraling. I can’t bring myself to just not care about this virus but I also can’t keep beating myself up when I “mess up”... I just want to see my friends without insisting on distancing to only give into myself, get wasted, throw it all out the window then want to die the next day because I got to close to others. All I see on social media is people having fun with their friends, almost as if covid doesn’t exist and I’m so jealous. I love these people but I’m digging myself into a lonely hole here. No one wants to video chat with me and lets be real it’s not the same as real human interaction. I just need help, its been 7 months and i’m so fucking tired.",25Oct2020,1

60,"I am 15 and in my freshman year of high school. I go to school in a very small town where everybody knows everybody. It is a safe little community. I am quite popular, so I get invited to a lot of parties over the weekend. However, my parents don't let me ever go out. I am only allowed to go out to football games and hangout with friends whose the parents they know. I hate opening snapchat and seeing all my friends hanging out places where I was invited. My parents often tell me about their high school years and how much fun they had hanging out with friends. I just don't understand why they wouldn't want that for me too. Whenever I try to negotiate with them, It doesn't ever work out on my end. They usually ask to meet my friends parents, but it never works out (either they don't like them or just don't trust them). 

I don't understand them. I'm a good kid, so I don't know why they punish me so much by not letting me out. Sometimes I sit in my room and cry because I hate missing out on all the fun my friends get to have. What do I do?",25Oct2020,1
61,"I'm 25M, she's 24F.

I have high functioning autism and do not read signals well. My partner and I have discussed this, and now they tell me when they are unhappy very explicitly.

I also have bad anxiety. To illustrate, we just had an argument after she told me she was unhappy, and I tried one thing to comfort her, got shot down, and then froze. 

After my one attempt got shot down, I got stuck in a loop of thinking ""well maybe this will help. No wait, that might make things worse, don't do that."" This loop more or less went on internally for 20 minutes before she got fed up waiting to be comforted and stormed off.

It's difficult to describe what is happening in my head during situations like this and I'm not sure how to combat it. A ""negative feedback loop"" really is the best way to explain it. If one thing doesn't work, I start second guessing anything else I come up with. After 30 seconds of that, I get frustrated with myself for not being able to be the partner they deserve and it just spirals from there. I get so sucked into these thoughts and frantically trying to come up with some way to help that I end up sitting there in silence, fidgeting and sweating. 

Does anyone else experience these thoughts? Do you have any advice?",25Oct2020,1
62,"hi, this is so weird to talk about. i don’t want anything bad to happen to my niece or sister. but here goes..

my sister is 23 years old and she is about to have her 5th kid. her first born is turning 6 this year, im not going to say my niece’s name just because i don’t want anything bad to happen. i’ll just refer to my niece as N and my sister as S.

anyway, i live out of town so i am always excited to see my nieces and nephews when i come to visit, but there is something that happens every time that breaks my heart. whenever S says its time to go home, N starts crying uncontrollably. she does not want to go with S at all. this is every time, and the cries sounds so... real. they sound like she really doesn’t want to go home ever.

today it happened again. the reason why this time hurts me so much is because N was hiding from S. once S sound N, she grabbed a coat hanger and started threatening to hit her with it. N started screaming “papi hits me papi hits me” but S didn’t care. she just kept threatening her with the hanger. S was just yelling at N, such awful loud yells. N couldn’t even get up, she was on her knees just crying because she was being forced to go home when she didn’t want to. 

when they left i started crying. it sounded like she needed help. i offered to take care of her tonight but they didn’t let me. i asked if i could pick her up in the morning and they agreed. but N sounded so helpless, i can’t stop thinking about it. i just keep hearing her. i want to make sure shes okay and safe there. my heart hurts. idk what to do..

i asked my mom why no one cares when she cries like that. my mom says she does it every time. why isn’t no one listening to her? her cries are so heartbreaking, i just can’t ignore them.

i just want my niece here with me, where i know she’ll be taken care of. don’t have a kid if you don’t have the patience.. ugh i can’t stop hearing her. i don’t have kids but i can hear when a kid is crying for help..",25Oct2020,1

67,So I (21M) work with my dad.He owns a custom closet/cabinet business and I’m there from 7-4 though he says “we” own it. I for one never had any idea of what I wanted to do in life so after high school so without really asking if I wanted to work with him just says you’ll start working with me after graduation. I graduated in 2017 mind you. There’s times like this weekend we have a customer that is not able to let us start work for them until they close which is 5:00. Originally supposed to go Friday but due to storms we weren’t able to make it then today he decides we’re not going to go to start because it was sprinkling somewhere else no where near the job site. So now we gotta go tomorrow. My girlfriend is coming home from college to visit home for a week and I had plans to be with her that night.I never agreed to work weekends but yet I still do because I don’t want to make him mad or upset. He has the audacity to say well I wanna do things too but don’t get to. Like that is your choice your the boss you can fix things.This affects my relationship with my girlfriend a lot which results in us arguing because she wants time with me and if I’m working when I’m not really supposed to that’s time we don’t get. When I do this it’s like I’m making work more important than her which it isn’t but if we don’t get paid there’s no money for living. In my opinion it’s not really my job to do this when he makes the decisions. It’s also crazy because I’m really the only worker and he’ll buy all these expensive machines instead of trying to get more workers. He claims we need to make more money to hire more people but I don’t know. I don’t have any contract with him either and yet it’s like he expects me to do these things like work later to finish jobs or weekends too . Like I said I think I do this because I worry if we don’t get paid then we won’t have money at home.This has been going on for about two years and I just need help there’s a lot more to it but I’ll start from there please give advice or ask me more questions I’m tired of this.,25Oct2020,1

69,"i don’t really know if we do these here, but this is your trigger warning. this will discuss suicide and suicidal thoughts. 

my good friend is 17yo (i’m 18yo) and about once a month, contemplates suicide to the point where i am begging her not to do it. it’s not like she’s threatening me with this, it’s just clear to me that she very desperately needs psychological help. 

she has a really shitty family who is verbally and emotionally abusive, and once in a while will text me saying goodbye, and won’t answer her phone for 10+ minutes, which, if you’ve ever had to deal with this, you would know it feels like forever. 

we have been friends for just down of a year, and she has done this 5 or 6 times. i completely understand that this is no fault of her own, but i do not have the emotional strength to handle this. as time passes, i find myself almost becoming immune to her antics, because i know she will not go through with it. 

i feel like a terrible person to even think it.

i love her dearly as a friend but as time passes and she causes me more and more stress, i feel compelled to stop talking with her entirely.

my dilemma is that i do not want to abandon her in her time of need, but it is too emotionally exhausting to grieve for someone who is right in front of me. 

there is nothing i can do help her long term, but i’m wondering how this relationship affects me. i know it seems selfish, but there are times when i need to put myself first, and i wonder if this is one of them.

should i stay and try to help however i can? or should i up and leave her in her time of need?

if there is something other than these two things that you can recommend, i would greatly appreciate it.",25Oct2020,1
70,"Gonna change some names here, but I'm suffering from some real anxiety and moral dilemma here. This is going to seem obvious at first, but I'm really perplexed.

When I got out of college, I got a job at a corporate office doing general data entry stuff. My boss at the time was really nice and seemed supportive. Over the years, I worked my tail off and he seemed to really like me a lot. I spent the next 9 years working for the same boss, because I thought that boss really liked me. Come to find out boss was just an asshole who liked my hard work and me making them look good, or so I assume. I got 3 promotions in that dept, but it was a really messed up situation. Again, I was a naive kid out of college and didn't know any better, so I thought it was all normal.

I eventually got a new job in the same company because I was able to break out if his clutches and show what I was capable of. Another manager in a similar dept needed my skills and pulled me over. Come to find out, I never got credit for any of my work - I can only assume that boss wanted to keep me around for their own benefit and kept me hidden, all the meanwhile gas lighting me and scaring me into thinking I actually sucked. I would hear things about how I'd never be good elsewhere, or I'd never make a good director but it's okay, because I'd be around forever. He would protect me and make sure I never got laid off and would be safe. Again, naive kid.

The boss also had a way with fear. He would always say things like ""if you don't like it you can leave"" whenever I brought up things that made me uncomfortable. Or would turn it around like I was attacking him and making him wonder if I was really good to keep around. Would always bring up potential layoffs and say you never know whatll happen.

During the 9 years though, there was other stuff that I was taken advantage for. they would ask for personal favors, like carrying their shit or grabbing their coffee. Again, naive kid who didn't know any better so I went along with it, mostly because I believed I would suck at any other job and thought this was the only thing I could do well.

There was also other concerning stuff that came up. Boss once sent me a text asking me which dating site they should be on, or if I could help them find a place to procure something illegal (which...what the fuck, but again, fearful for my job). I didn't do the second, I just joked it off.

Boss also never, ever gave me credit for any of my work. I brought that up one time and was told ""psh, no one cares where the work comes from"".

Boss also kept a weird ass thing in their desk that crept me out. Kind of like one of those weird poppets they use in ceremonies to mess with people. I told them I was uncomfortable about it, so the boss then brought it out to make me uncomfortable when I was discussing things I didn't enjoy.

But what boss did? Gave me perfect reviews. Was always super nice to me about personal stuff. Bought my son presents to take home. Always made me feel ""protected"".

So you're probably asking ""how is op an asshole?"". Well, eventually like I said I got a new position in the same company. I would joke around sometimes with my new boss and say things like ""I'm so glad you don't have a creepy doll in your desk to freak me out with"", and when she would pay me compliments about how smart I was I would become shy. She picked up on that and asked me why and I explained how my old boss used to tell me id never be good at anything else.

One day boss asked me if there was anything else weird my old boss did, so I admitted some stuff half jokingly in a ""man, you wouldn't believe it!"" Type way. Since new boss is so much nicer and fair than old boss.

New boss reported old boss to HR.

So I had to go through and interview. I admitted everything. But afterwards I felt like complete shit. My concience is telling me I shouldn't have said anything. I'm out of the situation, so I have nothing to gain. I did have a decent personal relationship with boss, as said - they did seem to really care about my well being as a person.

So if I did the ""right thing"" why am I so nervous? Why am I so anxious? I feel like I stabbed my boss in the back. I feel like the biggest rat in the universe. I'm also scared shitless about the text or call I'm going to get afterwards from the person. I still exchange pleasantries with them on occasion, they have my personal phone number.

Was what I did wrong? Should I just have kept my mouth shut? Why cant I break this feeling like I'm a terrible person who just ruined someone's life for no good reason?",25Oct2020,1
71,"Today, I was out getting ready for my yard sale tomorrow. I had to go pick up a couple of tables from my church, buy a cash box and exchange some. $20s for smaller bills. As I was driving into a supermarket, I noticed a homeless pregnant women sitting there with a sign asking for help. I had seen her around town before and I know she's not scamming. She used to have a man with her but today she was alone and she's pretty far along in the pregnancy (6 or 7 months maybe).

After I left, my heart kind of sank. Like I should do something for her. So I drove home, cooked up a leftover steak I had made a night before, grabbed some plastic wear and snacks and a bottle of soda (not hydrating but cold). I drove back to the supermarket and gave it to her. She almost looked like she wanted to cry as if it's the nicest thing someone did for her in a long time.

What I am wondering is what other things could be done to maybe help the situation? Is there any kind of help that she could get to get her off the streets?

78,"When I started College I majored in nutrition, but with only two classes left, Covid closed the campus. Microbiology and Chem2B.

They are supposed to be available in the spring but as of right now we are in the purple tier and infections of Covid are rising  even if the classes are available I don't feel safe traveling to their largest campus to take them right now. 

This Fall I changed my major to Early Childhood Education because my classes weren't available, and working for Head Start or something similar had also been something I am passionate about. I have a toddler myself and this age for children has always been my favorite. While challenging at times they are learning so much and it's just so fun.

79,"Hello Reddit, I (18F) am in my last year of high school and the topic of college is now being constantly brought up by my school and by my parents alike. 

When I recently started high school I always had a vision of studying to become a biomedical engineer but, to put it lightly, my grades were not impressive and I even ended up failing two subjects in my first two years, and now that I’m starting my final year I had a bit of an existential crisis, and now I’m even questioning if I’m even good enough for college. I personally don’t think I’m smart enough to manage to get a degree in anything I would be interested in pursuing.

My parents are now constantly asking what I’m planning on doing with my life since I brought up the fact that I’m not sure what I want to do, and they been constantly pushing me, telling me that I need to figure it out quickly. They also like to say that at my age they already knew what they wanted to do. Everyday is a battle of me telling them I don’t know and they are getting tired of that answer, and yesterday they told me that as long as I’m studying something, they’ll continue to support me financially but if not then I’m on my own. 

The last thing I wanna do is continue to burden my parents financially, I attend a private high school, one of the most expensive in my country and it takes a toll on them, even more when I failed those subjects because they had to pay so I could retake the classes. And I don’t  wanna go to a private college because I’m afraid I’ll fail again and continue to make my parents pay for my fuck ups. My parents also have to think about my little brothers education, who also attend a private school, and one of them also wants to go to private high school next year. I would have no problem with public college except that most public colleges are very selective, they hold a nation wide exam and if you want a spot in the bests of the schools you need a practically perfect test score.

I don’t have any real talents, I’m average in intelligence at best. The only things I can do well is eat, sleep and play rugby.  I’m at lost on what to do and I can’t really picture my life after my 20s.
I would be really grateful if someone could give me a little bit of advice on how to figure what to do or where I can start to look to figure it out.",25Oct2020,1

I sent the committee and the people I believed were the reason for firing me an apology since I never wanted to cause any harm.

 I had a breakdown yesterday. My life isn't going well in other aspects (drug addiction, dog is dying, and so forth) and I was looking through old emails in regards to the job I lost and I just couldn't control myself. I literally cried for 2 hours straight and in my craziness I posted on Facebook about how much I hated myself and how beaten down by life I felt and how I felt half my coworkers disliked me. About five people sent me messages to see if I was okay and about ten people commented on the post. I quickly deleted the post and wrote an apology mentioning how I was having a really rough time emotionally and that I was drunk at the time and that I was doing okay.

Say you want to start learning how to drive. I suppose that while most people would certainly acknowledge and get to know the inner-workings of a car, they wouldn't really go beyond that. My problem is that I would focus on learning its inner system and usually get lost in all the details. The problem with this is that I sometimes don't possess enough knowledge to understand every component, and it's then that I usually get frustrated.

I've personally struggled with perfectionism for quite some time, but it's only now, having started college, that I really see the negative effects. While I wouldn't like to completely get rid of it, as I tend to think it could be of some use, I'd like to have it under control. For instance, for tasks that are of little to no importance, as well as some medium-level priority tasks. In addition, what would be your advice on changing my approach from bottom-up to top-down?

Thanks",25Oct2020,1
84,"There are 3 people in total and I’ll be referring to each of them as 1, 2, and 3. I’m trying to make it confidential but would still like advice on what I should do. 
My friends and I have been trying to hang out for awhile (with masks and a place where we can practice safe distancing). It’s a group of us, however, two of them are have an awkward situation. Friend 1 and 2 have been friends for a very long time. They once had very close relationship. However, friend 1 revealed they were only friends with friend 2 so they could hook up. Friend 1’s plan was to hook up with friend 2 before they moved to a new town. This was because Friend 2 was on their “list”(people they would like to hook up with before they get serious with a bf/gf). 
Prior to friend 2 telling me this, we have all hanged out as a group but they no longer interacted as much as they used to. However, Friend 2 would be mature about the situation and would still treat Friend 1 with respect. Friend 1 had always been a flirtatious person, so he would flirt with everyone in the group (still tries to flirt with Friend 1 but they ignore it). 
Now with the information I stated about Friend 2 wanting to hook up with Friend 1. I feel like it’s not a good idea to hang out as a group with both of them. Friend 3 and I have been talking about this but friend 3 believes that Friend 1 &amp; 2 should suck it up and both be mature. Friend 3 thinks that they are old enough to ignore each other. Friend 2 has said it’s okay to hang out with Friend 1 as a group. But I believe friend 2 is not taking their feelings into the situation since they are saying that for the sake of our friend ship with friend 1.
I guess the advice I’m asking for is how to overcome the situation to make it less awkward if we ever do hang out as a group or how to hang out with one of them while excluding the other. 
I don’t want to stop being friends with one or the other but I feel bad leaving one of them out of group activities.

85,"I 17 (f), have had my life planned out. I would go to school, go to uni, then help people as a doctor or scientist. That was my lifelong ambition and I worked like hell to try to reach there. Up until grade 10 everything was going to plan. Sure i was overly anxious and socially awkward but whatever. Then at grade 10 the panic attacks started. I tried to hide it until my final semester of grade 10 when during a test my arm stopped working. It was terrifying. Soon the feeling spread to all my limbs. For a couple of hours I was terrified that I would be paralyzed for the rest of my life. But soon the feeling faded. My parents took me to all types of specialists. Soon it was linked to overwhelming anxiety. I was diagnosed with GAD, social anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. Sometimes my writing arm wouldn’t work but atleast my legs worked. I threw myself back into my work but something was very wrong. Before i loved listening to my teachers and found it Facinating. Now I honestly felt like they were speaking an alien dialect. I literally couldn’t understand a word they said. In grade 9 i had 90s, in grade 10 it became 80s, grade 11 it slipped into 60s despite the fact that i was working the hardest i ever had. But it didn’t matter. Once i got a fail on a test i was due i aced. After looking into my mistakes i relized i has wrote an entire paragraph BACKWARDS. On my final semester of grade 11 we went to the doctor again. They gave me pills and diagnosed me with GAD - severe. I felt like the pills worked but my parents hated them. We would get into huge fights whenever i mentioned a dosage increase. But i understand why. The higher the dosage the longer it takes to wean off. And my parents medical insurance on me will run out in a few months. Now i have started grade 12 online school. I am doing horribly. I can’t bring myself to open google classroom. I blank out regularly. I have like 1 panic attacks on average every day. Topics that i love become mush in my brain during assessments. I got an iep for double time and it stops me from failing. But i am now a low 60 student. And no matter how hard i try i can’t change it. My life plan has burned to hell. Around grade 11 i realized med school May be stressful for me and my marks wouldn’t be acceptable so I thought of switching to psych. But now I honestly don’t think I have a chance at getting into uni. I’m a mess and i hate myself and In 8 months i will no longer have acess to the pills or proper mental health help. I am looking for a job and can’t find one. I have no life skills, I can’t even drive. I don’t know what to do. Its getting hard to breathe just writing this. My parents can’t support me forever. I feel broken. What do I do. I can’t even find a job I looked so hard. I have 1000$ to my name. My life is falling apart and I am the only one to blame for being such a weak person. Unable to handle the anxiety of reality. Please any and all advice is appreciated. I may have missed some details to please let me know.",25Oct2020,1
86,"I have developed feelings for one of my guy friends. We get on really well and I’m curious about how he feels... I’ve seen changes in his behaviour recently.

When he makes a joke or something, he looks straight at me almost to see what my reaction is. 
He jokes around, teases me basically about everything for example my music taste. Also he  tries to make me laugh quite a lot.

When we hung out recently (it was spontaneous and just the two of us) when we were walking, I decided to walk close to him. Surprisingly he didn’t move away, even when at times our shoulders would touch. 

In the past I’ve been hurt by guys pretty bad but he seems great. I would appreciate any answers and what you think about this situation. 
Thank you.",25Oct2020,1
87,"I’m 29F, recently single after a 9 year relationship/engagement.

A year has passed since the dissolution of that relationship and aside from a brief (but epic) FWB situation, I haven’t been doing much in way of connecting with men.

Both of my closest friends are men and we talk very openly and honestly about relationships, sex, dating etc.
On the subject of “red flags”, I asked him what my red flags were, seeing as he knows me so well.

He told me that I can come across quite flirtatious with people, despite him knowing and me assuring him that this was not my intention. I feel awkward about it because I hate the idea of giving someone the wrong idea, and from my perspective, I’m just putting on my sociable mask (rather than my usual apathetic face). I compliment people, ask them about themselves, and make dumb dad jokes. 

Now, I’ve recently made the decision to get back on the dating scene for some casual fun (i.e: libido is through the roof but not looking to settle down). 

I’m having trouble balancing my lack of experience with dating, with my apparently flirtatious nature.
I’m receiving attention from people I don’t want it from, and failing to engage with the people I do.

I think the problem is that when I’m not looking to get to know someone as a potential ‘partner’, I am more comfortable being myself and thus come across like I’m flirting with them.
When I AM into a guy, I come across like an awkward dumbass who hasn’t dated in 10 years (which is pretty much exactly what I am).

So, my question is, what do?",25Oct2020,1
88,"Okay this might seem kinda trivial but anyway. So I (25F) run a team in the overseas office where I work. One of my reps (20M) and I have become good friends, and I recently went to the states to visit my family, where I met aforementioned friends brother (28M). We hit it off really well when we first bumped into each other, but I didn’t want to mess up my relationship (professionally or personally) with 20, so I asked him if he would be alright if I hooked up with his brother. I never confirmed anything, and his brother and I ended up hanging out every day for the rest of the time I was in the states. 
His brother and I have now begun to plan a business venture, and we’ve become really close. 20 knows that his brother and I are close, but it’s sort of awkward every time one of us mentions his brother, because it’s on the precipice of knowledge - he doesn’t know, he assumes but isn’t sure, and I haven’t given any information or signs to confirm nor deny. 
Should I just tell 20 so that it’s less awkward and just smoother and easier all around? I’m not really certain if it matters or not, and I know that 20 already has his assumptions on it.",25Oct2020,1

90,"Well, I don't post much of Reddit, and I didn't know what to put as the title. But that sums it up pretty well. So I'm 19M and currently at university in my second year.

So, to give some context, I met my best mate (19F) around 3 years ago. It doesn't sound like long, but she was one of the few people that is just genuinely a nice person and a 'good' person (if that concept exists). I'd describe her as almost family, since my actual family relationships aren't the best, so I've been fairly reliant on her for support for any issues I have(especially since I broke up with my girlfriend over lockdown). 

She's going out with one of my other good friend (19M) (who I do speak to a decent amount over text) and I've known him for a while. He is a good person, but in the past when we were younger there were times where he was a bit of an asshole, but he has been on of my best mates for a long time. Him and I speak a decent amount over text. 

We all knew each other from before university, but coincidentally we all went to the same uni.  

But both of them are fairly private people and as they are going out and obviously have each other to talk to, and so sometimes I feel like a bit of a third wheel. But it hasn't been that much of an issue and we all have a good time when we do meet (occasionally before covid, and but rarer now).

But recently that has changed a lot with 19F. A couple of months ago it started going from speaking everyday pretty regularly for about 2 and a half years, to two messages a day... and then 1 message a day ... And now even more recently no reply for 2/3 days. It's through text so it would come up as a notification with some of the text showing. I don't really know what to make of this. 

When I ask if she's alright or something, when she does reply, she just said that she's busy. In August/July is was because she was spending time with family and doing gardening. (But this was over lockdown and there was no uni work, and I had a lot of spare time doing nothing, so It didn't feel right that she didn't have enough time to message me. But she did say that it was her fault for the lack of messaging, to which I said to not worry about it) and now recently it was because she's been busy with uni work. Which I do understand, but to not reply for 2 days is a bit too long even with uni work. That's just how I feel anyway, maybe I'm overthinking.

To give even more context,  I have anxiety and often worry about things and make pretty irrational decisions which I convince myself is a good idea but then regret it later. So there were times where I wouldn't reply for a day because I feel like I was getting too attached and annoying and so would just push myself away for a little bit. Maybe this had an effect. 

She's always been supportive and is one of the few people who I actually exchange proper gifts with during holidays or birthdays. And the messages that do get sent or the conversations that we used to have were long, it would be a substantial amount in each text, so this confused me even more as I don't believe she doesn't care. Because the texts that do get sent aren't dismissive or anything, and it would take her a little bit of time to type it. 

Another point is that we used to speak on Snapchat, but I found myself looking too much on snapmaps, 19F had turned off hers for me a few months ago and 19M had never had it on. But I found out through two other  friends a month ago that they both just have it off for me, and that they had it on for both of them. This upset me quite a bit, since i considered them two of my closest friends, but yet it seemed like they were avoiding me. I convinced myself that it was dumb to be upset over snapmaps and so deleted Snapchat and moved to text instead. To stop myself looking at snapmaps and caring about it and also because I just had enough of it. 

But yeah, sorry that it's quite long but it sums it up enough, I hope some people read it through. I'm currently trying to find a therapist because I've had a few childhood issues that are affecting me now. So until then I'll maybe see if strangers can help me out. 

TL;DR my best mate of 3 years who is one of the kindest people I know and I would consider almost family. Who I had talked to on a very regular daily basis for those 3 years has seemed to start avoiding me and stopped replying as much

91,"I'm just gonna go straight to point. My sisters husband tried to sleep with me. I told her no and thats horrible cause he's my brother in law and why would he ever even think about doing that to my sister. He said he needs something ""new"" and is basically bored with her. I avoided them after he texted me that. I didn't tell my sister about him texting me that cause she just had a baby with him and was going through a rough time and he left me alone and said it was a mistake texting me. About a year later she asked me to move in with her to save money on rent. I told her and she shouldn't live with others cause she's married and she asked me if her husband tried something with me. At first I said no cause I did not want to start drama but then she kept asking so I told her and she thanked me then left. She stopped talking to me and even almost tried to say i was bad for not telling her and suspecting if I did something. She stayed with him and he started telling her I was bad I was the one trying to come on to him and all these lies. I didn't talk to her for a year after that. Recently she's trying to talk to me again and said she knows I didn't do anything wrong and that she knows her husbands bad but she's staying with him cause she has 2 kids with him now. I don't feel comfortable talking to her though. She said her husband would be upset if ge found out she was talking to me ????? Like this is insane he's acting like I did something wrong??? I feel like she fed into his lies and treated me bad. I feel bad for her but they seem like their not normal and I feel like I should just not talk to her. I feel bad for her but she won't leave him and even alienated me away from her when I didn't do anything.",25Oct2020,1
92,"
I’ve never really posted to Reddit before. To be honest, I’m nervous. I always hear good things, but I’m too scared to post stuff &amp; not get feedback for some reason. Idk.  

Actually, I’m too scared to do anything for myself. 

I was bullied all my life for marching to the beat of my own drum. I had no choice. My home life wasn’t great. My parents constantly screamed and fought with each other. My mom made me feel like I was lying every time I spoke. My dad was emotionally not there and never said anything. I would get so mad when telling my truth or being true to myself because I was constantly told I’m wrong/I’m lying/I’m not being truthful. My mom wanted an “open and honest relationship” which required her to know everything about me and then make fun of me and criticize my way of thinking. She’d read my diaries/journals. She’d love my friends and hug them, but I had to GTFO of her face. She had a coke problem when I was a kid and I never even knew. 

I lied so much to get myself out of my family. I would hide in the racks at the store in hopes my family would forget me at the stores. 
I would purposely get lost in the stores to walk up random strangers saying I lost my parents. Hoping that when “I was found” I’d get that big relief reaction. That “oh my god, thank god you’re okay!!” reaction. 
Instead, they thanked the stranger, and ripped me a new ass all the way home. 

Kids at school called me IT, like “A Child Called It.” I’d be walking on the sidewalk looking down and all the kids would say “Sh sh, IT’S coming.” Stop talking, then giggled. 
The teachers heard and saw. They just didn’t do anything. 
I would ask to go to the nurse a lot, just so I could tell her I didn’t feel good just to lay down in the office with the lights off and cry. 
She knew there was something wrong. So she never said no. 
I spent so many days in that room crying alone, wondering why I was hated the moment I was born. 

I failed classes or would forget homework a lot because I never knew how my home life would be that night. Instead of teachers asking my parents what was wrong, they gave me 0s and placed me in “special classes.” 
You can guess what happened to me next. 

It wasn’t until freshman year when I had enough of the bullying. I took a swing on a girl in the locker room for whipping her towel at me. 
Got sent to the office for fighting and came home to my parents proud of me because I stood my ground. 
My dad and I would play knuckles a lot. Or we’d have punching competitions to see who hit the hardest. Guess this was the only way I got to bond. 
My brother would squeeze my pressure points behind my earlobe until I was crying for him to stop. 
All my cousins were boys who wrestled and they never went easy on me. 
My sister would say she was my friend, then make fun of me. Tell me my mom doesn’t love me. Tell me I was found in a dumpster. Tell me I needed to find a new family to live with. 
Some people say “oh that’s just sister things.” 
But a lot of the sisters I’ve met have never said the things she’s said to me to their sister. 

Once I started fighting, I had a “who’s gonna mess with me??” Attitude. Always alert. Always suspicious of who was talking about me. I feared nobody. 
Graduated high school and a few years later, I’m moving into a house with my ex and his family because my parents decided to get a divorce. I’m twenty years old. 
The relationship went south fast and the bruises added up constantly. It was as if I met my biggest bully. 

Finally left him close to 4 years later where weed and alcohol became my support. 
I started therapy and my therapist kept leading my life back to “being sexually abused” which I deeply don’t think happened. 
I think I just was never loved or noticed and I acted out with violence and sex and drugs, which made people like me. 

Fast forward and I’m now 28 years old, dating someone new, and literally driving myself insane. I knit pick, I’m OCD how I like the canned goods in the cabinet, I have to have control, I’m sensitive, yet run my mouth &amp; can’t stop. I can’t control my anger. Quotes don’t help. Mediating isn’t working. Therapy can be too pricey. I’m at a complete loss because I’m ruining something with a guy who thinks my quirkiness is cute and thinks I’m a great person.  

I’m constantly looking for reassurance, my mood goes from really high to really bland to really low.  Luckily not all in one day, but weeks. Then I hit a manic anxiety ridden moment where all my thoughts good bad &amp; ugly just hit me at once. Then I’m told I’m too sensitive, too weak, too caring of what people think, too aggressive, too paranoid, too stressed, too tired, too this .. too that. I try to stay true to my boundaries and say no this is how I feel, so not belittle how I feel...only finding myself just apologizing for even having boundaries. I’m always thinking about what’s wrong with me, what I need to work on, what I can do to be a better person, etc. 
My boyfriend says that I need to stop thinking and just start being myself. 
As soon as I try, I’m picking fights &amp; I’m doing something wrong. Or my tone is wrong. My attitude is wrong.
When I point it out that I’m always feeling it’s my fault, I’m told I’m playing victim. 
I can’t be understood without making someone upset. 

They say to love someone you have to love yourself first. 
But what if you’ve never experienced real love from the core people who are supposed to show you?

So I guess to wrap this up...I feel better writing this. I’m still confused on how I fix this or learn to live with this or how to manage this. 

Thank you if you read this. All ages me thanks you for hearing me and not telling me I’m wrong.

96,"My first post on here! Honestly im just posting cause im desperate and wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. A few years ago i was struggling with an addiction.. i wont get into what in this post because that is besides the point,but when i quit, i went through what felt like a ""spiritual awakening"". When i quit i lost 50 pounds unintentionally. I was 175(5""2) and was thick and insecure most of my life. When i lost weight it was from lack of appetite and getting nauseous pretty much every time I ate. Weirdly enough though when i lost all that weight something in my head clicked. I was like holy shit i was so hyperfocused on my weight and it took so much of my life away. I understood what it meant to listen to your intuition. Its like everything slowed down. I was so in the moment I finally felt like I was living again. It reminded me of being a kid. I believed/ knew I could do anything i put my mind to and had so much trust in myself. I started to like all of the things i seen as ""flaws"" previously. I finally realized I had been living for other people, to impress others and cared SO much of what other people thought. I finally viewed myself in a positive life and understood my life can be whatever I want it to be. Fast forward to now and this time in my life haunts me. I feel like all of my toxic habits (besides my addiction) from before have slowly creeped back in the past few years. I developed an eating disorder but was so open about it and seeked help because i knew it was not normal or healthy what i was doing to myself.

Life feels so bland. Nothing excites me. I know its my mindset and i get so down because i remember the feeling of living so authentically but i have no idea how to get back to that.",25Oct2020,1
97,"I know the answer is probably to stay out of it, and that's ok, but I'm pretty worried.

My brother is 22. I honestly completely believe he is psychopathic, very angry, and extremely lacking in empathy.

When my dog was a little bit older but still pretty healthy, he said countless times that instead of humanely euthanizing her, somebody should just bash her head in with a rock and he said it so many times with such anger that I was almost afraid he'd do it.

He's very manipulative. He's pretty much brainwashed his friends into believing that I absolutely hate people I don't know and that I absolutely hate it when anybody touches me. Both of these are completely false. One of his friends was so brainwashed by this that when she met me for the first time, she was clearly very terrified of me, even though the only interaction we had was a very polite and civil introduction. Honestly, he can go do and say whatever he wants to, and if his friends decide to believe him, that's on them and my brother. I think it just shows how manipulative he is that he can convince somebody to be terrified of somebody they never met, and that he chooses friends he can manipulate.

One time, I go downstairs to make eggs. There was a large skillet on the stove and I ask if it's clean (so I know to put it in the sink or put it away). It was clean, so I put it up and get a smaller skillet. He questions why I was getting the smaller one. ""The smaller one works better for the way I make eggs."" His response - ""Why don't you just use the big one? It was too big, but I could still use it. You need to kill yourself.""

Back in June, he was talking to my mom about covid, and he became very agitated and adamant that ""Everybody who's diabetic needs to hurry up and get the virus and die. Life would be so much better without the weak people. They need to hurry up and die.""

Honestly, I'm scared for what he may do to his girlfriend mentally, emotionally, and psychologically, but I don't know if I should do anything.

If I do decide to do anything, it would be ""hey, here's stuff that my brother has said and done"" but I wonder if he's brainwashed her into thinking I'm crazy, which I'm not. I'm honestly worried about her and that she may become victim to his mental torture.",25Oct2020,1

Throwaway because I don’t want this getting out. Politics came up today at a family event. I’m 17M and consider myself a pretty smart dude with the stats to prove it, not gonna say bc I’m not gonna humblebrag. My grandparents wanted a young persons perspective on politics and we went over a ton of issues. They were disgusted with me by the end and my mom talked with me on the car ride home about how my views are radical and i came across as an incel and white supremacist type to them, especially after explaining to them that the Boogaloo Bois were responsible for the majority of the violence this summer and not BLM or antifa. Views in asterisks were mentioned earlier for context. 

I consider myself a neoclassical liberal, but say libertarian to avoid confusion. My views are as follows:

-Amash 2020 then when he retired Jorgensen 2020, but vote biden if you live in a swing state because trump wants to be dictator*

-Anti boogaloo, it’s just gonna cause the Balkanization of the USA and it won’t solve anything

-Boogaloo bois are reported disingenuously by the media on purpose to associate libertarians with white supremacists* (again, I condemn the boogaloo bois, they’re the reason this whole mess started to begin with)

-Weed and psychedelics legal, everything else decriminalized, abolish the DEA, end the failed war on drugs*

-Unban bump stocks and hands off our guns, abolish the ATF

-Illegal immigrants are American heroes and deserve our utmost respect for picking our food and building our infrastructure for little pay, free the kids in cages, abolish ICE

-Riots were justified over George Floyd no matter who started it, end 1033 program and qualified immunity, have community accountability boards, but don’t defund the police, justice for breonna taylor*

-Repeal the Patriot Act, shut down Guantanamo bay, abolish the NSA

-Constitutional amendment to overturn McCollugh vs Maryland, interpret the constitution strictly because if we don’t give it the reverence it deserves it just becomes a piece of paper

104,"Throwaway for various reasons, I (18M) have dealt with depression for the better part of six years at this point. The biggest struggle is my lack of interest in things and generally being unmotivated. Every so often I get really intense interests that I love wholeheartedly for about a month and then it's almost as if a fire just flickered out. I've graduated high school and am living at home, helping my mom work, and I get the feeling she's getting sick of me staying home and focusing on my latest obsession. How can I become interested in things that aren't media, like school or job relevant things?",25Oct2020,1
105,"Sorry if grammer or spelling sucks, as I'm typing all of this on my phone. To give some background, my mom (42F) has been married to my step-dad for a long time. They've also had two children, my little sisters who I love to peices. My mom divorced my bio dad when I was very young, and they both had my older sister (20F), me (16F), and my brother (13M). Both have remarried, and I should also mention that my step-dad was married three times before he married my mom and has a LOT of kids.

My mom's relationship with my step-dad is faaar from perfect. They fight anytime he's home and it's very clear she's unhappy with him. He has bad anger issues, though he's never laid a hand on us kids. I don't know about my mom though, as it's not like she would tell me. Me and my mother are very close, but she also has her own issues. It's not like she's a bad mother either. She's always suppoted us, tells us she loves us, overall a good mother who I love more than I can say. That's why I don't know how to handle this situation. I guess I've always known something like this would happen, but I didn't know I would feel this sick to my stomach about it. It's not like I even like my step-dad, and my older sister despises him. My little siblings don't seem to know the whole situation but they've heard their fights loud and clear before. Which brings me to my little brother. He might be 13, but he still has the mindset of a 10 year old, or so I thought. The way he told me about ""it"" was so...unexpected. He said it in a way like he was telling me water was wet. I asked him to tell me how he knew, and he told me that he found text messages on my mom's phone when she was outside doing something. They were very explicit and it was obvious that my mom and this random guy were ""together"". She was saying she loved him and he loved her. For anyone that might say that my brother may have made it up for attention or to pull my leg, that just isn't like him. He wouldn't make something like this up. I think he just doesn't understand how serious the stuff he's hiding is. 

I don't know what to do with this information. Do I ask my mom about it? Do I just keep quiet? I feel like I should be mad at her or SOMETHING but I just don't. In fact, I'm happy she found someone that makes her feel this way. She's been so unhappy with my step-dad and she can't divorce him cause he's the one bringing in the money to provide for us. I've been wondering who I could talk to, but I don't have anyone who wouldn't tell my mom or would be biased. So, I'm here, at reddit, hoping for some advice on what to do. Anything would help. I just.....need to know how to handle this. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them the best I can.",25Oct2020,1

I also submitted it to a monthly contest without even thinking anything of it.  Fast forward about 2 weeks, and I found out that I actually won the contest, and my track was on the front page of the forum.  It's nothing major of course, but to me it was extremely surprising.  The reason I'm saying this is that even now, 5 months later, I've barely made any more music after that because I've had many people tell me that it was just a happy accident or a fluke that I was able to make something good for only producing for such a short amount of time.

I'm smart so that gets me by.

My parents have made it clear they cannot help me, but I'm afraid of the world, since my life was basically school up til now.

My mother reminds me of myself, not a good relationship with father but makes excuses about it. Can be needy, can be lazy, offend people without realizing. 

How will my life change? I can leave my parents alone, even though I might depend on them emotionally. I can begin to make choices for myself. I would get hurt at first, I won't have a support system, I will be naive but it is a step in the right direction. It means my life before I was pretending.

But despite all of this and meeting at least 40ish people I haven’t made any good close friends. I have people I am friendly with who I get lunch with sometimes, but no go-to friend or friend group.

118,"i’m an aspiring music producer and i’m absolutely enticed by the thought of producing for major label artists. the problem is i’d be at odds with myself if i went this route, depending on what i’ve decided my ideology is.

i used to think social democracy had to be the answer. after all, the happiest and most economically sound countries (i.e. the nordic countries) are welfare capitalist states, right? i also liked the idea that the everyone should have equal opportunity towards self-determination and establishing private enterprise without fear of their services being completely nationalized.

but lately i’ve seriously been questioning my stance on all that. i’ve been thinking about the atrocities committed by the us military and cia. the sanctions that cuba’s been resisting. the fact that nations that rank high on human development are also the world’s biggest polluters. the gradually widening wealth gap worldwide. my growing hatred for colonialism and the fact that i see its influence everywhere i fucking go.

all of these notions have been building up in my mind and are pushing me farther left than i would’ve expected. the problem is if i follow through with my dreams for being a mainstream producer and simultaneously identify as a communist, the cognitive dissonance would be nothing short of torturous. how can i be here in this record label’s studio if i’m just contributing to shiny spectacles used by the elite to brainwash the public into feeding them money and suppressing true democracy?

i know better than to ask this question on a leftist sub because the responses would’ve obviously been biased. so here i am to ask: is social democracy sustainable? should i have the right to be in the big leagues if that’s what i really want? or is all of this just leading humanity down the path to a faster extinction, one that can only be apprehended by bloody revolution?",25Oct2020,1

Me and my friend had an argument ""I am going to call her Plant"" about something really stupid and she started saying that I was a bitch and stuff like that and then she said ""even if I am not right at least I am not single, at least I am not straight"" and I was so confused and she told me that even if I was homophobic she doesn't care because she likes making me mad and that she doesn't care about telling me cause I don't matter...And she told me that if I told her secret to anyone she would ""Snap my neck"" with one of her other friend. So we continued arguing and then she said that one of her friend will make soup with my organs...a little argument later we stoped talking.

The next day I was on zoom with one of my friend who was friend with her and already knew the situation and my best friend ""who she threatened me not to talk to""was talking about her so I wrote to my other friend in the private group chat saying ""I did not told her what happened with Plant"" and I sent it to the wrong person""my best friend "" by accident. So she asked me what was wrong and I told her the story excluding the gay part.

And we are 13 so I knew she would not but my body was shaking like when you are sick and you get ghostbumps but I wasn't cold and it lasted 1 hour.

122,"Hi, so I’m 15 and I don’t really talk to many adults in my family or get much advice on things. I’ve kind of had to grow up and learn things on my own through the Internet and such. 
 
I’m constantly stressing and worrying about my life after I graduate high school, heck I’m worried now because I need to get a job in order to afford college (if I even go to college). The thing about getting a job though, is that I’m too afraid of being around people. 

I’m not sure what I want to do in my life, I never thought much of it because if I’m truly being honest I didn’t expect to make it this far in my life. 

I have a small interest in politics, and the thought of being a congresswomen sounds really nice because I’d be able to work for the betterment of the country but I’m not sure I’d be able to make it that far. Again, I’ll be honest, I feel like only white and powerful people make it up to the top. I know there are people who are not white nor rich and powerful that make it to the top but I’d say the majority of people in charge are old, powerful and rich white men. It would be nice if more people could be represented in America than just old, rich, white men. 

I suppose I’d like to go into the medical field too, I like helping people and it wouldn’t hurt America to have some more compassionate nurses and doctors. 

Of course, I don’t know much about those things. I just feel like I won’t make it far after high school even though I have a nice gpa and test scores. It’s work ethic and experience that many jobs look for nowadays, but I have too much anxiety to work with customers and such especially as a teen. 

I just feel like I need to figure out my life and then start working towards a goal but I have no clue how or where to even start. How did you guys start your life after high school? I’m kind of afraid of growing up, because I know I won’t have a pleasant experience.",25Oct2020,1
123,"I’m a 19 y/o girl at university and I’ve recently moved into a house share with some of my friends. 

One of my house mates a 20 y/o male, he and another one of my housemates, a 19 y/o male, have been out most of the day so I’ve been left home alone. The 19 y/o male came back about half way through the day and all was good, then he went to go pick up my other house mate 20 y/o male from where he’d been out to. 

It was about 2am, so when he left to pick him up I locked the door and hooked the latch, since we live in an area where students tend to get broken into. When my two housemates got home, the 20 y/o male got really passive aggressive with me for locking and latching the door as he said I shouldn’t have bc I knew they were coming home, and I’m being silly and paranoid for worrying about a break in and started to raise his voice at me.
He was annoyed about the fact he and my other housemate couldn’t get in the front, but they didn’t phone me (which they knew they could) to let them in, and both have back door keys to get in.
The two of them go out until really late hours into the night quite often, so I’m left home alone quite a lot hence why I latch the door.

He’s had issues with me before with me as a housemate, as he doesn’t like it when I turn the heating on. I have Reynauds disease so I try to keep myself warm or my hands and feet really hurt.

I’m really not sure what to make of the situation, or know if I’m in the wrong or not.

126,"This is gonna be a LONG post just a heads up,

Me and my friend (we will call her Sarah) have been friends since we were little kids. We are in a mutual friend group with other people but there were four of us(me, Sarah and let's call the other friends Janet and Tiffany)   

Sarah's birthday comes around. We are planning to have a birthday party with some of her closest friends, decked out with decorations and themed food and drinks etc, which is taking a lot of planning to do. The party is supposed to be a week after her birthday to accommodate some of her friends who couldn't make it her birthday weekend. Janet and I make sure we help Sarah plan her birthday party sending her ideas for decorations food and offering to buy stuff for the party. I am currently studying for a difficult entrance exam for graduate school and it happens to fall four days after the day of her birthday (but it's a few days before the big party). I am putting all my focus on studying, spending 8+ hours a day dedicated to studying for this exam in the last two weeks before the test. Despite this I tell her that I will make time to help you drive around and look for decorations for your party (week before my exam) because I wanted to help. I give her an hours heads up that my eta was 6pm. she says okay, be there soon. She doesn't show up till almost 7pm. I sat in the parking lot for almost an hour when I could've been studying and she just comes the hour late like it was nothing and she doesn't even care that she had me waiting for an hour ( not to mention the 30 min it takes to drive to where she lives). I just put that aside though cause the last thing I want is trouble and it was annoying but not that big of a deal. 

 The day of her birthday rolls around and Janet and I text Sarah at 12 am happy birthday messages and post on our social medias for her. I was planning on studying all day (since my exam is in four days) but I thought I should do something nice for her and surprise her with cupcakes. I didn't text her I was coming over because I wanted it to be a surprise and I just figured she'd be home. I leave the library at around 7pm and head towards the bakery when I look and I see on social media that the other friends in our mutual group (Tiffany and others) had thrown her a surprise party at a friends apartment.  I didn't see janet on the videos so I text her asking if she knew about it and janet was like no one told me. We were like damn we wish we could've been there to surprise sarah too or at least been asked if we could come. Even with my exam I would have at least showed up for to surprise her if I had known. 

The next day I could tell Sarah was kind of off. I text her privately and tell her that I was sorry I couldn't make it to the surprise party and I would have for sure came if I knew but that she looked beautiful and she looked happy and that's all that matters. I also make sure to mention that I had planned on giving her cupcakes but then I saw she wasn't home so I went home so she knew I was still thinking about her. 

Her response however took me by shock. She upset with me that I did not text her asking how her day was or if she had any plans. She was upset that Janet and I didnt take any initiative to plan or do something for her and she was all alone that day until that her real friends found out she was alone and planned a dinner for her and were the only people that cared to see if she was doing anything. She said it was not their responsibility to invite janet and I and it was on us to have planned something if we knew she wasn't doing anything. She said she always makes sure to check up on us and see if we have plans and do stuff or us for our birthday. She said we only cared when we realized we weren't invited. Her words exactly "" If you guys cared like you tell me, you guys would’ve taken some sort of initiative to plan or do something, not just assume I have plans.  If you guys genuinely cared, you guys would’ve texted me way before \[as in earlier in the day\]"".  

I admit that she is right I should have texted her if she had plans or how her day was going. I explain to her that I had no idea that there was gonna be a surprise dinner and I tell her I didn't plan anything big because i've been studying for my exam and didn't have the time to dedicate to planning a surprise party and because I knew she would be having a bigger birthday party the next week so I assumed that that was when we would focus on celebrating it, not on a thursday night.  I also tell her the other friends were not obligated to invite janet and I but it would have been nice if the invitation was extended especially for a surprise party for someone we care about and because we are all in the same friend group. I explain to her that if she was in my shoes she might feel slightly left out too but I tell her I understand that the plans they made were 'last minute' according to them so they could have simply forgot to invite us or just assumed we wouldn't be able to make it so I wasn't upset about that.  I tell her that I just don't want her to think because I wasn't there, that I didn't care. I continued to explain that I was going to stop by her house and the reason I did not text her because I wanted her to be surprised and cause I just assumed she would be home (she usually is) and especially cause the friends that planned the surprise party were the reason we had to push the party a week ahead so I assumed they'd be busy too, not that they would be planning a surprise. I also explain to her even if I had texted her asking what her plans were she would have said nothing, and then I would have most likely ended up showing up to an empty house cause I would have thought she would be home. I tell her I didnt plan a surprise party, along with not having the time, because I was already helping her plan her bigger party and I had all my focus and energy on making sure that party goes well.  She  had also mentioned that she would do so much for our birthdays so I decided to scroll back up in my messages and photos and check and she has never planned anything for me or suprised me or went out of her way to see if I had plans. Once she texted me late the night of one of my birthdays asking how my day was but thats all I could find. (plus with her logic she had texted me that hours after when I had planned to drive to her and surprise her at her house). (also I didn't intend to deflect blame or anything but I feel like it's unfair to expect so much from people and its unfair say i don't care about her when she don't even try to do the same for them.) I end my message however with an apology telling her that I didn't mean make her think I didn't care and that I should've texted her earlier. 

All she responds with is  ""I’m not going to sit here and argue or defend myself, I just wanna move on"" I tell her I wasn't trying to argue I just wanted to explain why I did what i did and apologize and she just said ""okay""

Is it fair for her to be upset at me over this? and to continue to be upset about this even after I explained why? is she overreacting? what should I do? I feel like this is such a petty and small thing to be upset about especially with the context of the situation with my test and her party the week after. idk why she thinks I don't care about her cause I didn't text her asking if she had plans. is this toxic/manipulative behavior?",25Oct2020,1

131,"I've had this friend for about 2 years now, we met at uni, and I really really love her, but recently I've found myself hoping that she doesn't connect with my other circle of friends and it makes me feel really guilty and I dont know what to do. She's pretty extroverted and very high energy, but sometimes it can just be a lot, and I feel like I am a lot more introverted. I really like having separate friends from different groups, but I find she just finds a way to inject herself into other aspects of my life, and it's really getting to me. The worst part is that it makes me get annoyed at her internally a lot more, and now I am worried I'm going to snap at her one day because I find her more frustrating. What do you think I should do?

133,"[F 16] To start with some background information, my sister is 19 and her boyfriend is 21. They have a son who is almost 3. My sister and her son live with me my mom and my brother. I never felt close to her boyfriend because he just gave me bad vibes and I never liked the way he treated my sister. He’s sexist and racist and transphobic . But recently we started getting close. It was nice we would go for cad rides to pick up my sister, he would buy me ice cream, he would even let me come along for their family activities sometimes. But one night I got creeped out by him by 3 things. 1. He came behind me and put his arms around me from behind to stop his son from kicking me while I was holding him . He could have stopped him from the side and I felt like he was in my boundaries. 2. We were making harmless tik toks (note my sister was at work and nobody but my brother was home and he was in his room), and I got sweaty so I let my hair down. He said “you look cute with your hair down.” 3. I was lying on the ground on my stomach pretending to be a snake and my nephew bit me on my shoulder. He then came over and massaged my shoulder while saying “are you okay”. I know that sounds like it could be innocent but the thing is his hand was there for longer than I think it should have been. And he didn’t tap my shoulder he rubbed it. It made me feel weird. After that every night I couldn’t sleep because when I did I had night terrors about him. About him hurting me. So I started sleeping with my door locked (he is allowed to sleep over). It was making me lose sleep so I decided to tell my mom. I broke down crying and my mom instantly told me “you should never feel uncomfortable in your own house.” I felt instant relief and for the next two days kept begging her to tell my sister (like she said she would tell her) that her boyfriend can’t sleep over again.

This is where shit gets real. Today my mom came home from work, came up to me and told me “This has to stop. You cannot accuse people of things they didn’t do. “ right then my sister and brother started yelling at me. My sister started screaming “she needs fucking help she’s psychotic my boyfriend is 21 and she’s so ignorant if she thinks he would be into her *scoff.” My brother (who has had a family member accuse him of being creepy and has dealt with a lot because of it - don’t worry he was proven innocent obviously ) started yelling “I know how it feels, you can’t accuse people of that.” My mom asked me in front of everyone “did he touch you? What did he do?” And I said “he called me cute unnecessarily and rubbed my shoulder longer than he should have and I feel uncomfortable. I don’t want to get him in trouble I just want to feel comfortable in my home.” My mom started switching sides even more “so what he called you cute??? Your brother thinks you look cute in dresses and stuff! Cute is innocent!” Even though my brother has NEVER called me cute. The funny thing is that I told my brother first. I told him that I wasn’t sure if the boyfriend was being creepy or if it was just me and my brother got so upset saying he was being creepy and to tell my mom and that if I didn’t he would. But they just... switched up. I went downstairs and started bawling my eyes out because I felt guilty. What if he is just a good guy and I just fucked everything up. Am I wrong for feeling creeped out? My sister said she doesn’t want me around her or my nephew. I feel isolated. Can anybody tell me if I’m wrong or not",25Oct2020,1

140,"First of all throw away my friends know my normal reddit account. A little knowledge of our living situation before I start: we are in the military living in the barracks and we are currently in training, so we live in the same room (two beds to a room) with our dressers down the middle of the room for a little bit of privacy. 

Right now because of covid and everything we can’t have members of the opposite genders in our rooms (doesn’t really make sense I know it’s a dumb rule). He asked me about a week ago if she could come over and stay the night to which I said no, then the next day he asked if she could “just come to hang out” and I was like “why not” I thought she’d be here for a few hours then leave and it’d be fine. And that’s exactly how it started, but progressively she’s been staying longer, and then a couple of days ago I walked into the room and they were both in the shower, and then the next day I woke up in the middle of the night and she was there and things were going down. I stirred really loudly and pretended to make a phone call then left the room and the “commotion” stopped and I went outside and tried to purge my brain of the memory (unsuccessfully), came back to a rather musty room tried to fall back asleep, then woke up in the morning to her STILL being there. That was this morning. She’s been here in our room ever since. They haven’t left the room all weekend so far. 

I left for most of the day feeling very uncomfortable and gross and just trying to find something to do and ran out of stuff around dinner time. Went back to my room, surprise surprise they’re in there. Do my best to make conversation and not be awkward and put my headphones on and start playin Siege with the boys. I kept hearing something, and thought it was someone walking around til I took my headphones off for a sec and heard definite sounds of things you shouldn’t be doing with your girlfriend if you share a room with another human being.

I was just frozen I had no idea what to even do, I wasn’t asleep, in fact I was talking with other people. They didn’t even try to go anywhere with AT LEAST a door in between us. I feel uncomfortable and gross and like I have no place to simply just “be” right now.

142,"I am 6 months into my current workplace in Malaysia. Please pardon my English if I make any grammatical error. 

I am in the secretary department. I am really grateful to have a job at times like this and with zero knowledge in company secretarial matters. I have picked up lots of knowledge along the way from my really wonderful manager. She has helped me and  guided me with so much patience. Meanwhile, my boss, imho, is a difficult person to work with. He cares a lot about publicity, doesn't trust his employees, and played a lot of work politics behind the scene. The turnover rate for this company is very high. Just last year and this year alone, 5 full timers left and 3 on probations left. 

That gave him opportunity to talk shit about them. He has this habit of asking certain employees into his room and talk dirt about his previous employees, even though those employees left the Company for a year or two ago. He also talks badly about his current employees, sometimes in front of them, sometimes calling other employees into his room to do so. He also often conducts 'meetings' once sometimes 3 to 4 times a day or a week. And those meetings run for a minimum of half an hour to 2 hours. The meetings are usually conducted to hear his displeasure on other employees (on their mistakes that happened a month ago, half a year ago, a year ago... he repeats them in his 'meetings') or his views on the world, politics and government's movement on COVID. Basically, majority of the meetings are a waste of time.

He holds this little 'contest' on getting facebook likes for his company's page every now and then. He will pressure one of the staff member to ask us to report how many likes we have gotten for him and he will keep track of them. He will also bring it up on the meetings and will even have an award session based on the likes the employees have for him. He will also announce everyone's results during the meeting as well.

He also tends to single you out if he doesn't like you. I've seen him done that on his previous employees, and now it's my turn. He was very friendly at first until one day i told him (privately with his wife in the room so that i do not make him look bad in front of other employees) that i don't want to hear him talking bad about his past and current employees because it's affecting me a lot. He didn't apologise and brushed off my comment. That was the last time he was civil towards me. He started to single me out and didn't call me in for any meetings other than company meetings, will treat most of them out for lunch together and purposely left my name out of the list, pass messages to me via my manager and not in person, asks everyone in the room of their opinions in the meeting but me.

It's been a tough 2 months from the 6 months I have been working here and I am feeling really discouraged, small, and fearful. I really want to resign, but I am afraid I can't look for a job given COVID. I don't know what to do..",25Oct2020,1

144,I recently got offered a new job opportunity that I know I'm a good fit for. They want me to start in a few weeks but the company does a drug screen.

I ordered a bunch of detox kits that supposedly can get you clean as quick as a week but the reviews are very mixed. What i don't want to happen is put in my 2 weeks at my current job only to end up failing the test. And then being unemployed.

146,"Sorry if this is a tad long and all over the place, it’s just a reflection of my immediate thoughts which are incredibly scattered. 

I have been unemployed since May of this year and scrapping to get by, as I know many people are due to the state of the world. My boyfriend has helped me immensely when it comes to paying the important bills, but our situation is complicated and he can’t continue to help me as much as he has. Plus I want to be financially independent again. 

I had been applying and interviewing for jobs like crazy since June and have had recent success in finding work.

Ideally I need a full-time job that pays me a minimum of $20/hr in order to continue to afford my apartment, as well as all my other monthly expenses. I also need a job that provides full health benefits (medical, dental, vision) as I have many undiagnosed chronic health issues I have been battling for 5 years and have been unable to seek adequate help and diagnosis due to being uninsured. 

About 3 weeks ago I started a seasonal position at Target making $15/hr. Right now I’ve only been getting two 4 hour shifts a week, which isn’t going to cut it. 

I also recently accepted a position at an acupuncture office which is 2 days a week at $16/hr, that also will not cut it even if I’m doing both that and Target. I am supposed to begin Monday morning. One of the co-owners expressed that I’d be replacing one of their employees who had been working there for 10 years and will be leaving Friday, as she has found a position which allows her to stay home and care for her little ones. She would spend the next week training me before her departure. The situation and need for a replacement is urgent. 

Neither of these jobs I mentioned above offer any sort of benefits, besides free acupuncture and 50% off of herbs at the acupuncture office and knowledge. I want to go to school for holistic nutrition, so I felt that would be an amazing opportunity to learn and pick the brains of people who have had many years of training in Traditional Chinese Medicine. 

I got a call from another job, which is a Full-time position that I believe pays between $17-$19/hr depending on experience and they offer health, vision, dental and 401k. It’s also only 5 mins from my home. The only interview time &amp; date they had available is Monday and I agreed to take it. 

Here’s my dilemma. I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity of possibly having a position with just about all I’m looking for, but I don’t want to skip out on the job I accepted and am supposed to be starting Monday, which I’d have to do in order to make this interview. 

How would you handle this situation? 

This may be a stupid question, but I would feel really bad to not show up and have to call and tell the acupuncture office that I have to decline the position at this time, especially due to their circumstances. 

I feel I can keep Target either way, I’d just need to talk to HR about modifying my availability, so that’s not really an issue. 

Any and all advice is welcomed and appreciated. 

Peace, Love &amp; Light. 💫",25Oct2020,1

I was with my roommate who is like a bro to me, and his gf was with us. I don’t know why but I eventually started imagining us gangbanging her and it made me go crazy.

She was practically passed out on the bed so she didn’t notice at all which drove me even crazier.

I put in my profile ""among us n chill"" as a kind of joke. I only mean the among us part.

It feels backwards, I’m supposed to be the one to initiate everything, but if I were to I’d feel like a horrible person. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do when I want to do anything sexual, and the pain is really bad. No one takes me seriously and says I’m “just horny” but really I want the emotional intimacy. What the hell am I supposed to do",25Oct2020,1
167,I have a female friend hwo is having issues in her relationship to the point where she feels she needs to be literally kidnapped from her life to start a new and leave her husband by doing so is this right or should she try and stay and fix it,25Oct2020,1
168,Okay so few weeks ago I started talking to a guy in instagram and at first our conversations used to be way too one sided. I was the only one who used to go to talk to him and I used to have the urge to know him more better and build a nice connection with him. Slowly we started talking more in phone calls sometimes it would end soon and sometimes we used to have decent comversation. One day when we were  having  a video chat he suddennly left me hanging. I was upset about this situation and later after two days I confronted. My motive for confrontation was not only to sort our misunderstanding but also to have a decent talk then tell him I don't wanna keep up this. I was dissatisfied with the things going on and  I had a very strong instinct that breaking this friendship is going to be beneficial for me as I wouldn't have any distractions and have a peaceful state in my life but things didn't go as planned he apologize and told his battery was dead so he couldn't talk. I was going to tell him that I felt this friendship was way too overwhelming and I want to end it but before I could tell him he bid me goodbye saying he had to prepare for congregational prayer. After that I again had a strong urge to confront about my thoughts and end it so I posted a story in instagram that I wanted to ghost someone he asked me about who it was and I told him it was him but later on I thought it was an immature move so I told him I was joking and don't take it seriously after that we both haven't talk to each other and I feel like this connection is just going to end like this. I honestly don't want to end things like this.. I want to sort out all our misundersatndings and end on a positive note but I don't know how to end it. I was thinking of either leaving a meassage on instagram or have a phone call but I don't know how to put this forward. And to be true the reason why I want to end things like this is probably because I except very much from and I also don't know at what place I stand in his life. I want to have hearty conversations with him.. share all my inner thoughts and have a strong relationship as I also have developed a crush on him but deep inside of my heart I feel like if I except all this form him and give him my time and importance I am going to hurt myself which I don't want at all. So  I want to end things and start a new phase but I am just confused how to tell him about this.  I feel like leaving a message can be quite immature and to tell him all this on phone call I don't think I have guts to do so because I get nervous and go on  a silent mode or talk about unnecessary things and ruin all my plans.,25Oct2020,1
169,"So long story short, I have bunch of blisters and wounds from me scratching my feet. I compulsively scratch my body when I get anxious. About two weeks ago, my PTSD and anxiety was at all time high and I scratched the hell out of my feet. My feet is covered in bloody blisters that are healing but they're so itchy and it's driving me crazy. The itchiness increases at night and I scratch them in my sleep, waking up with even more blistered and bloody wounds. I currently use medihoney cream and cover them up, which helps temporarily and coritzone gel for itchiness, which burns like hell and only stops the itchiness short time. 

Please give me advice on how to stop/deal with the itchiness. I desperately need any advice :(",25Oct2020,1
170,"I'm feeling truly the worst I've felt in my lifetime in terms of how discouraged I feel right now.


Both my leadership positions were passed to other people when I started them. I got them going. I was given false hope being told ""can't wait to work with you"" and stuff like that. I'm honestly sad. I was hurt after the first time in a separate area of study that this was in but I gritted my teeth and decided to put my efforts somewhere else. So i put all I had into getting that going and up and running and they pass me up after they all told me they were looking forward to working with me and how I presented myself so well. 

I would've got over it after the first time, but I'm discouraged now since this has happened on 3 Different occasions. Maybe I don't make any sense idk but I've never felt like I've not wanted to wake up and start my day before. 

How do I stop feeling discouraged and how do I pick myself back up again?",25Oct2020,1
171,"First of all I’d like to say I’m writing this just before going to bed so apologies if I don’t get back to any replies right away. Also I should mention this may be a bit of a badly structured rant but I would very much appreciated if you try and bear with me, haha. 

Now, I’m 18 coming up on 19 and I’m living in the UK, this January I dropped out of sixth form for various reasons that were out of my control. I started looking for a job and after a few months I was offered a very good entry job into the financial industry despite having no A-Levels. Unfortunately, due to COVID, they shut down and said they couldn’t afford to take on more staff when they reopened. Fast forward to June, I started working a minimum wage job, 40 hours a week for a huge international company. Now for my dilemma;
I know that if I were to stay where I am now I could definitely move up the corporate ladder through the company and potentially do quite well for myself, on the other hand I have a feeling if I were to do that I’d always be unhappy because I know that I could do better, I was always considered one of the brightest in school and had offers from multiple russell group universities. My other option is to go back and apply for jobs in the financial sector again, however given the current climate my job would never be secure, in the event of another lockdown I would be the first to go and the job I’m at now I’m secure at. On top of this I’d still regret not finishing my education properly and know I likely always will. 
With that in mind, I’ve been looking at options to go back to school. Quitting work for full time education is off of the table because our current living situation is less than ideal, my family of 3 is living in a 2 bedroom flat and as a result I’ve been sleeping on the sofa for the last year so I’m saving up money to move out and I can’t bear to live like this for the next 2 years while re doing my a levels. The other option is teaching myself subjects at my own pace and taking the exam privately when I’m ready whilst still working full time. However, that being said, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to manage that, teaching myself a subject from textbook and online resources is obviously less effective, especially when combined with a 40 hour work week. On top of this it means I can’t do many subjects as I can only take exams with no coursework or practicals. 

I’m honestly just at a loss right now, I have no idea what to do and am frustrated because this whole situation is a result of many unfortunate events outside of my control. Any thoughts or suggestions on the matter would be very much appreciated :)",25Oct2020,1
172,"  

I was talking to my brother earlier (18) and he is planning on moving away in 6 months and I just, I don’t know. I feel so…behind?  
 I’m 22 and I’m in college part-time (atm) and full time working. I feel like I keep making all these poor choices. Getting a full-time job while in school, getting a new car, and making payments. At first, these all sounded good to establish a work history, work on improving credit. I still live with my parents and I help out here and there with bills. I was supposed to study abroad this year but that didn’t happen because of covid.  I have the chance to do next fall and I want to. I think I can save up enough money to pay my bills while I’m gone, and my parents would be using my car while I’m away.   The other part of me feels like it would set me back. But it’s also a once in a lifetime experience but is it weird that I’d be going at 23 and coming home at 24? At the same time I’m getting down on myself all the time (i.e why haven’t you graduated yet? Why haven’t you got your own place? Why did you get this specific car? Why did you take a full-time job?) I’m not sure what to do to stop feeling like this.  It’s a constant inner battle of I know why I did this at the time, but now it all seems like such bad decisions.   I’m really overwhelmed with my thoughts.",25Oct2020,1
173,"hey all! [16F] here. my former life consisted of hard drugs and partying, it was a world of vile toxicity. i was miserable in all my friendships and yesterday, i decided that i had enough and put my sword down. i left the life i knew before because i was turning into my worst nightmare. but losing my boyfriend [17M] was a very hard loss, because i only have three people left who are truly there for me. i want a fresh start

my boyfriend and i had been best friends since upper primary, we made it official when we were around year 9. we started going down the wrong path around early this year, but i started much earlier and he only joined a couple of months later. this year has been hell for the both of us. we both were just repelling each other, constantly putting ourselves in difficult positions and then he changed, changed for the worst. even i changed. i resented him every goddamn day but it was hard to hate him because i just loved him so much. when he was who he was, he was a phenomenal friend. he was somebody you never wanted to lose. that’s how i caught feelings because of how fucking good he was. i knew i had to let him go for the sake of my own sanity and happiness and so i did. now i feel so alone. 

i don’t know if i’ll turn out okay, and i pretty much am asking for advice on my next move. i just want to find a best friend, preferably female who’d relate to me and hear me out. someone who’s simple minded and nothing like the people in my old life. but the thing is i really outdid myself in isolation and i don’t have many people left. what do i do?

TL;DR got myself too attached to one person and i don’t really know how to function without him since i refuse to open up to anybody, need a fresh start but don’t know how.",25Oct2020,1

175,"Alright, I’ve got some shit to get off my chest. This will be little more than an emotional rant, but I’m typing this out anyways. 
Im 22 and a senior in college. I realize I’ve got a long way to go and a long time to get there, but I’ve had more than enough of feeling like this and I need something short term. 
For the last 5 years I have felt like the lowest form of human being. Ordered around, walked on, and tossed aside when i run out of uses. I have a pretty good understanding of how most people give advice, “make some new friends, join a new group, put yourself out there, step out of your comfort zone.” Ive done that. Ive made more friends than i can name, i was a part of so many clubs i had to drop some to make time for others, i even met someone i thought i could spend the rest of my life with. None of it helped. 
Ive got hobbies, things that i enjoy. I enjoy building stuff, working out, drawing, and playing the guitar. I have officially moved away and dont have the space to build stuff, Ive worked out so much that my right shoulder is so fucked i cant even grab the bottle of whiskey off the top of the fridge with that arm, when i try draw nothing makes sense and last night i put notes together until the tips of my fingers felt like they were about to start bleeding. 
And to be stereotypical, the icing on this shitty cake is that the girl of my dreams, and by that i mean i literally haven’t slept a night in the past week that she aint showed up in my dreams, does not want me as anything more than a friend. At first, that was enough for me. Simply chilling with her was enough for me. Heres the caveat, that aint how i really feel. How i really feel involves thoughts of her running through my head at a minimum of 50% of the time that I’m awake. So much so that its getting in the way of my ability to focus on classes and make the grades. The more i hang out with her, the more shes in my head. I already told her i wanted to be more than friends, but she wasn’t keen on that and just wanted to keep things how they were. 
So that brings me back to now. 
Ive got a very general idea of what i want to do with my life, no actual path to get there, just winging it as i go, and am feeling like every day is nothing like whatever tomorrow is about to slap me with. I aint about to give up, but if life keeps this pace up for too much longer, I am seriously contemplating buying a plane ticket to Alaska, spending whatever i have left of tools, walking out into the bush and living live on survival mode. 
I am open to anything here, good or bad, but not drugs. Prescriptions dont fix, just help you fake. Already kicked those habits, aint going back.",25Oct2020,1

I’m also scared of getting old because of things like illness and disease that comes with getting older. Every night I have a hard time sleeping because I think about dying and my brain rotting and it just scares me I guess. I don’t want to have to be thinking about these things because I just feel like I can’t be happy without a distraction because I think too much but maybe that’s a symptom of technology.

180,"I've been burned before and I (25 F) was cautious about getting interested in a guy again, but ""Alex"" (30 M) seemed nice. We met at an industry conference, and I felt like there was chemistry, but our time together was very quick.

Lo and behold, he went through the trouble of tracking me down on social media a month later, then spent the next 2 months texting me. We finally got together for a date, then a couple more. Everything seemed to be going well, and throughout this period Alex responded to texts within 2 to 12 hours.

Last weekend Alex came over to my house for a date, we got intimate, and he went home at the end of the night. Again, everything seemed to go well, but then I didn't get a text from him until almost 3 days later. I had assumed he wasn't into me anymore and was ready to let it go, but then he sent a text asking how I was, how my week was, and mentioning what a crazy work week it was for him.

I told him I was doing fine, asked him about his week, and sure enough, I am now going on another 2 days with no response.

Should I assume he's just not into me anymore? What I don't get is, if this is the case, then why didn't he just continue to ghost me after our last weekend together? Why did he pop back into my life mid week with his last text to see how I'm doing?

A couple points to consider:

* I don't get the sense that Alex is playing games or trying to hurt me. It's possible that's what's going on, but I've been around manipulative guys, and Alex just doesn't seem that way.
* Aside from some delayed texts, Alex has been completely respectful, consistent, and conscientious with me. In general, he seems like this smart, sweet, bumbling, maybe slightly autistic, tall 30 year old guy who's figuring himself out.
* In passing during a previous date, Alex mentioned to me that he's not very ""phone-y"", and I've noticed this seems to be the case when we're together.
* During our last date, Alex seemed attracted to me physically, was interested in what I had to say, and was eager to share about his week. Nothing comes to mind that went badly.

So what do you think? I like the guy, but I'm very independent and I've got a lot going on in my own life. I am not inclined to get upset with him or send a million more texts. If he's over me, I'll let it go.

Is the spotty texting this week just normal dumb guy behavior? Or should I see it as writing on the wall that he's probably over me?

Tl;dr: Things have been going well with the guy I've been dating for a month, but this week he has barely texted me. Is it over already?",25Oct2020,1
181,"I (26F) reconnected with an old friend of sorts (27M). A brief history: I flirted a lot with him while I was with my ex, I got confused and he asked me if I was going to choose him or my ex. I ghosted him, I chose my ex. 

A year on, I reconnected with him. He was in a relationship of about 2 months? He didn’t know the girl very well and they argued a lot. She misunderstood him a lot. It was lockdown as well so they couldn’t meet. They just video called everyday. I flirted with him again and he’d flirt back, like how we used to, just maybe the flirting wasn’t as intense. By flirting I suppose I mean extremely friendly talking, he didn’t comment that I was cute, or that he wanted to be with me or anything of that sort. But there were times where we were talking about traveling, and he’d say things like oh you wanna go this place too? If we’re single at 35 we could go together. I’d call him out cos it was unfair to his gf, and he’d just be like oh oops i meant it in a more casual way.

We’d talk about our dreams, careers, etc, they were deep and pleasant conversations, and we were very similar and I knew we both felt it, the compatibility, so I felt like there was something more for the both of us. 

Basically, he’d text me whenever they kind of argued or stuff like that, and ghost me after a while. It just went on and off like that, he’d return when he argued with his gf, and then ghost, then return again (they argued v frequently). He questioned a lot about their compatibility, he’d tell me that we were more similar, but he wanted to give his gf a chance. 

They broke up 2 weeks later, and we were texting at the time (since they fought a bit) and once he broke up, he asked me out, said we should meet after lockdown and watched some movies together virtually. I said we could meet with a mutual friend, but he said the last time the 3 of us met he didn’t get to speak to me at all, so maybe we should meet one on one instead. I felt like things were going too fast, I was taken aback and asked if we could be friends first, and he said yeah, we’re meeting as friends. At the same time, he also would tell me he was sad that he broke up, and wondered if he should get back together with his ex. At the same time, I didn’t want to engage him anymore, and he also ghosted me.

I eventually found out that he had ghosted me because he decided to call his gf and ask her to get back together with him. We never spoke again. But I also found out that he had never liked me or saw me as more than a friend, he claimed he just needed to talk to someone when he fought with his gf in those moments, he needed someone who understood him in the way his gf couldn’t. He says a lot of the flirting was induced by me, because I tended to text in a certain way, he’d just text the way I texted, but never meant for it to be anything more. He enjoyed talking to me, and when I initiated conversations he felt happy in a he liked the attention kind of way, but says it could never once compare to how his gf made him feel even in the first time they met (they met on tinder). When he asked me out, he said it was because he wanted to get to know me better, the way you ask tinder dates out, but it wasn’t a date or anything. When he asked me to watch movies together virtually, he said he just wanted to watch movies with someone after he broke up, like a companion of sorts. He wanted to watch one of them with his gf for a long while, but she kept rejecting him. There was another movie that he really liked, and while watching it he wished he did with his gf instead, because he felt like she would have liked it instead. 

I heard all this from a friend who knows his gf. He admitted to her that yes, he was attracted to me in a sense that I could get him the way she couldn’t, but he had no feelings towards me at all. He says it was telling from the way he ghosted me often, didn’t check in on me (I told him I had mental illnesses and stuff), and how he had called her to get back together in the end, even though they fought and she hurt him so much, but I showed concern for him and yet he could ghost me without saying a thing. Was he lying to his girlfriend or did I read the entire situation wrong?

190,"For just a bit of context. My boyfriend and I stated dating in the summer of 2018. I was 27 and he was 23. When we started dating, his little brother had just graduated and had a long standing girlfriend. 

Flash forward to March-April of 2019. Little brother has cheated on and dumped his high school sweetheart and is dating someone new, Theresa. Theresa moved in with little brother almost immediately. Within weeks of them hooking up, no exaggeration. Little Brother is only 18 years old and still living with his parents, paying just a couple of menial bills. My parents would’ve beat me if I tried to have a live with boyfriend under their roof at that age, but whatever, it’s their kid and their parenting style. 

The teenagers have been dating for roughly six months when they start talking about getting engaged. My boyfriend and I are both flabbergasted that marriage is even on their mind and think it’s a horrible idea, but no one else on either side of the family does (in fact, everyone is eating it up), and at the end of 2019, the teenagers get engaged. 

Now, we’re at the beginning of 2020, before quarantine and everything else that came along with this year. My boyfriend’s family has deep roots in Germany and are very proud of their heritage, and even have family they are still in contact with in Germany. One night, my boyfriend tells me that for his grandparents’ anniversary in the summer, the whole family is going to Germany for three weeks. I was initially so excited, what an awesome experience for my boyfriend! My boyfriend says tickets have been bought, gives me some dates and details. I made a small comment about how little brother was gonna handle being away from Theresa for a full three weeks, only for my boyfriend to inform me that Theresa has been not just invited, but her ticket paid for. 

His parents never reached out about inviting me. 

So... obviously this happened awhile ago, and the trip to Germany was cancelled due to covid. But being almost embarrassingly honest, I am still so irritated and offended that I was not, at the very minimum, invited on this trip. Even it was a strictly family event and Theresa had not been invited, my feelings would be different. If his parents had came to me and said, “listen, we’d love to have you come with us, but tickets are expensive, could you possibly pay for your own?” my feelings would be different. Instead, I feel completely punished for not making the stupid decision of getting engaged to my boyfriend after less than a year of dating. 

This is where the advice part comes in. I literally don’t know how to not be angry at this situation and it has made me from a less than positive opinion about his parents, little brother, and Theresa. I hate spending time with little brother and Theresa. They still live under mom and dad’s roof and plan to get married AND move out in 2021. I find them both to be extremely naive, ignorant and cocky for no good reason. But the thing is, most 20 year olds are like this. I look back on how I was at 20 and cringe, really, really hard. So I *try* to take them with a grain of salt and remember that there is a nearly ten year age difference between us. I try, but I often fail at not allowing them to get under my skin. 

My father died when I was a teenager. When he died, we went from middle class to foreclosed, repossessed, bankrupt and poverty stricken. I have no doubt that much of my issue with all of this is the fact that the children get to live rent free in a big, cozy house, and are seemingly rewarded for making poor decisions, whereas at their age, I was scrounging for coins to feed myself. 

I really, really don’t want to go to the children’s wedding. It’s out of state, which is already inconvenient (still poor af), and I don’t agree with their actions or their marriage. My boyfriend knows all of my feelings on this, understands where I’m coming from and has been genuinely respectful through this entire saga. He’s said I don’t have to come to the wedding, which was basically like being given a Christmas present, but there’s no way I can avoid going to the wedding, right? My best bet is probably going to be to drive out that day, stay for the ceremony and a smidge of the reception, and drive back.

I think maybe I ate something bad and felt nauseous, that combined with the body heat from everyone on the plane + knowing that I’m 3000 ft in the air and can’t go anywhere private to take care or myself, it all just made me have a super big anxiety attack. And I mean BIG. It was a 6 hour flight, and I was pale, had cramps, and just felt very panicky and sick the entire time. Ever since then, every time I feel sick or have an anxiety attack, I remember just how bad that flight was and it makes it all worse. Sometimes I just suddenly start thinking about it and it causes an anxiety attack.

On that same note, there have been many times where I’ve eaten something and had a bad reaction to it, and ever since then I can’t eat or even talk about that food without feeling sick. That can range from complicated dishes that I had once in a restaurant, to common things like cheese or certain meats.

Can that plane incident or having bad reactions to foods be considered a trigger? My family kind of ridicules me for the food thing, and just tells me to get over myself.

I know that “triggers” are serious things that people with actual PTSD suffer with, so I don’t want to disrespect anyone. I’m genuinely asking..",25Oct2020,1
192,"Yesterday, I contacted my father who has been almost entirely absent from my life. He is an evil person. His crimes included fraud and potentially drug trading. He is wanted by the New Zealand Police and he can't ever set foot in it ever again.

He is also manipulative, but I still contacted him. Why? I'm not sure, I'm twenty now but was nine (2009) when I last saw him. My mother separated from him in 2006 and I haven't seen much of him since, I can't even remember his voice or personality. My grandfather died last month - who essentially acted as my substitute father - I worry I was insanely reckless by inviting him back into my life. I worry I am being manipulated by him.

He was also violent. He attempted to strangle my mother and fleeced the family bank accounts before leaving New Zealand. He strangled my mother and physically assaulted my sister. He also asked my younger sister to undress infront of him. 

I've been flooded with emotions since this happened. I don't know what to do, maybe I am far more psychologically damaged than I really thought. 

My mother had a facial expression I had never seen from her. Her reaction was completely dejected, having almost pure hate towards me. I should have never told her.

What do I know of him? his employment often changes but it includes work in Cambodia and potentially other Asian countries, including Australia. 

I am also being flooded with other thoughts. Will my mum treat me differently from now on? will he try and manipulate me? am I an evil person for contacting him? have I damaged my mother for telling him?",25Oct2020,1
193,"I'll just cut to the chase because this is going to be long, sorry. So, my friend and I were reading fanfics online with some other folks on a Discord call (mics on, cameras off, I was hosting by sharing my screen), and in one fic stumbled upon a statement that she claims is mocking of LGBTQ people. Obviously, this is a serious claim. However, here is the statement in question (sort of, as I corrected the grammar a bit):

""Hmm wait, could it be that you're gay? Don't worry, there is a section on P\*rnH\*b for that.""

Because to me, that statement means that the speaker is trying to assuage someone's fears, and point out options to that someone.

My friend claims that somehow this is ridiculing the LGBTQ community because supposedly the aforementioned site is very clearly anti-LGBTQ, and openly mocks the community.

This was apparently such a big deal to her that she cut myself and the Discord pals off from reading past that line, in order to request that we choose something else to read instead, insisting that that statement was so bad. Please note we were six chapters in at this point. So, I request the others to pause and occupy themselves while my friend and I sort this out, in order to minimize potential drama. Well, when I explain my view of the statement, and request that she explain past ""it's offensive,"" she clams up. In order to not turn this into an argument, I dropped the subject, and the group kind of halfheartedly moved on.

Now, I myself am not part of the LGBTQ community. Neither is she. I cannot guarantee that she is misinformed because I do not visit that site. I want to know her reasoning as to if LGBTQ people do not, in fact, have a section on that site, and whether or not that statement is offensive. Could anyone explain to me why that statement is mocking? Or even *how* it is? Seriously, any explanation is appropriate here.

But wait. We aren't done. Somehow.

So, I look for more stories. Well, one member of the call had mentioned a particular Harry Potter fanfic before the friend showed up to join us. One written by an overzealous Christian woman to be focused around Christianity as opposed to magic and Hogwarts. We had agreed beforehand that it'd be a worthwhile read, and that we could have fun reading it aloud in sections (one person is narrator, and several of us would handle any dialogue). Well, as soon as I ask that one call member ""hey, did you ever find the link or title for that Christian Harry Potter story?"", my friend interjects with ""you shouldn't make fun of Christianity like that.""

May I ask you folks of the internet, *what the hell? How is that offensive?* Did just saying the word Christianity in the same sentence as Harry Potter somehow become sacrilege recently? After that remark, the call member speaks up to try and explain to my friend that the fanfic in no way makes fun of Christianity, and in fact is about nothing but praise for Christianity. The friend, however, is still mad and is still requesting that we look at something else. I immediately mute us as soon as I can request it without interrupting anyone.

Once more, this is to minimize drama - after all, the two of us are communicating to the call members through my one microphone. I made it clear to everyone that my friend would be joining us beforehand. This was the first impression she would make on any of these four people. She is a guest on this call, and we are doing our best to include her. Everyone had been accommodating to her so far, if begrudgingly in one case.

Well, I tell her that I do not see that as making fun of Christianity at all, and for the second time this week, I inform her that I myself am Christian, in an effort to better explain to my her perspective. I ask her to explain *why* exactly she finds it offensive (she is definitely not a hardcore religious person). In response, she just requests that we drop it to avoid a fight and look for new stuff to read again. So, at this point feeling more than a little awkward, I un-mute us and we (the group) look for something else. Of course, there are a bunch of things we could have read. However, I don't pick them. At this point, I don't know what will upset her. The others in the call are just going along with it, knowing that I have control of the screen, and that for whatever reason, I keep having to mute us to ""discuss something"". I'm pretty sure one person got so bored at this point (the entire point is to be entertaining) that they passed out on call. One person just straight up left the call at some point while I was conversing with the friend because they were so bored and it had been several minutes of silence. It was silence because the other two members don't generally get along. I had gotten them to agree earlier to play nice, but with nobody else talking, it was just them stewing in awkward silence.

In the end, we resort to just choosing some online version of supposedly bedtime stories. *Because what else can we do?*

Now, I need to mention that when we are reading this, we have a set way of doing it. A way that I have reminded this friend of numerous times, be they last night (with a different group of three and a different fanfic), or earlier tonight. These rules are:

1. If something is misspelled or written incorrectly (such as a lack of an apostrophe in a contraction, or two words without a space between them), pronounce it the way it is written, as it may be worth a laugh. Admittedly this one is minor.
2. If you are voicing a character, and it is the narrator's turn to voice a line, *you let the narrator say their lines before you cut in. You do not get to cut them off*. This one is somewhat bigger.
3. If someone has a question and needs to interrupt, you must let them speak. You absolutely do *not* continue speaking while they attempt to ask questions.
4. When we assign a character's voice to a specific reader, they are in charge of voicing that character and it is up to them whether or not someone else will take over for them. *You do not just willy-nilly take over someone's role.* If the character's original ""voice actor"" has to go do something and lends you the role while they're away, you do *not* get to continue reading that role when they announce they are back without expressed permission.
5. If you are the narrator and also need to read dialogue, rule 4 is doubly important. You don't just steal peoples' lines. That makes it boring for them, and frankly, keeps them from having time in the spotlight.
6. If you are the current reader, and stumble upon something you do not like, replace the words with unrelated words. For instance, watching p\*rn (as encountered in the first fanfic today) became watching Spongebob. The idea is that what if one of the younger members in the Discord group joins in without our notice? And on a more personal note, I make it clear to everyone in the group that we avoid scenes like this for the sake of anyone who is more of a prude, such as myself.
7. If you are voicing multiple characters, use a different voice, so we actually know which character is talking.
8. We will not read anything that is NSFW for the same reason as explained in rule 6.
9. Finally, if you are reading as a character or as the narrator, please do not read so fast that we cannot all keep up. This is especially important in case we need to ask you a question, and you won't let us interject. This can cause fellow readers to or listeners with questions to become lost.

Somehow, despite me telling her multiple times that these simple rules are the only real important ones we follow, and reminding her to let the others speak (without interrupting her, of course), she manages to break every single one of them, barring rule 8. In the end, only one person of the four others in the call was willing to keep reading when we found the online bedtime stories. This person was quickly cut out when my friend requested to be narrator, and proceeded to steal several lines of dialogue from several characters, one of which was mine, and two of which were the person in the call.

I just...don't know what to do! I want to know what she meant with both of her statements about these things being offensive, I want to know what I can do to educate her if she's preaching incorrectly. And on top of these, I want your honest opinions on whether or not I should continue to invite her to read with us. She's new, so she can't be expected to memorize the rules, but almost all of them just seem like common sense to me! And she acts like it's no big deal. Sure, she was a little abashed to confront me and warn me that I was somehow saying something offensive by reading ""Hmm wait, could it be that you're gay? Don't worry, there is a section on P\*rnH\*b for that"", and sure, she seemed a tad worried when she attempted to call us out for ""mocking Christianity"", but she never once seemed to care that she wasn't letting anyone else have any fun. She's otherwise really nice, and frankly, I suspect she doesn't have too many other friends. What should I do?",25Oct2020,1

201,"I'm currently approaching 2 months at my first job after college using my degree. 

I'm a research technician and my day goes like this: arrive between 8:00 - 8:30, clock in at 8:30, prep for the day by setting up my biological safety cabinet, run errands for others, receive first specimens at 10:00, process and check in specimens, lunch, receive specimens between 12:30 and 13:00, process and check in specimens, receive specimens at 14:00, process and check in specimens, receive last specimens of the day between 16:00 and 16:30, process and check in specimens, close biological safety cabinet and clean centrifuge, take inventory, take temp in the room I work in, leave between 17:00 - 17:30. Processing specimens means I centrifuge it, and then aliquot off the serum. It takes maybe 30 minutes to do per specimen. I do this exact same thing every single day, 5 days a week. Starting in November, it'll be 6 days a week every other week as the vaccine trial picks up. 

I spend Sunday like I spent Sundays when I was in school; I can't enjoy myself and I spend the entire day dreading Monday. It's so boring doing the entire thing every single day. It's worse than how I felt about high school classes being repetitive every day. One of my coworkers has been there for 22 years and originally planned to go to grad school but never did, and I'm 22 and am planning to go to grad school eventually, so I've recently gotten very afraid of the idea of being stuck there for 22 years, centrifuging blood forever. 

There are plans to make satellite clinic sites but the plans change so often it's impossible to stay on top of the news. We'll have a week with a lot of news, and then nothing for weeks. My supervisor has a habit of not having you trained in a task and/or not having it be known you should be doing a task, and then not being happy with you that you've not been doing said task. 

And I know work isn't about being social and I've heard being friends with your coworkers isn't a great idea, but I'm someone who's always had a hard time making friends and whatever social group there is at work I can't seem to find my way into it, so it's a pretty lonely job too. 

I'm really unsure how to stick this out considering I don't know when I'll be leaving. I'm planning to reapply to grad school for fall 2021, hopefully, but depending on how classes are being conducted then, I may defer it a bit longer. It's hard, though, to stay cheery with no end in sight. I am currently applying to and interviewing for other positions. I feel sort of bad considering I've been trained and, as of now, the plan is for myself and one other person to handle this particular vaccine trial and, if I were to leave, she would have to handle most of it alone until they found a new person that they would then have to train.

What sounded like a good first job using my degree has turned into an environment I cannot stand being in and really dread going to. Maybe I'm just being a big baby about it, but I was initially really excited about this position and it really really sucks that I hate the work environment so much. To people who were in a similar situation, how did you keep yourself from feeling hopeless about it?",25Oct2020,1
202,"I have a group of friends (Group 1) that are pretty much the only ones I have. Through one of them I grew acquainted with a separate group that I sort of forced myself too hard to be a part of even when it was clear they didn't care as much about me as they did about each other or I did about them. I was friends with Group 2 for awhile, enough that we formed close friendships, but it ended with all of them in a very nasty way. Long story short it was was a very rough and cruel ending of several friendships for me and it left me really upset for well over a year. Even now I am still trying to heal.

From my Group 1 friends, some of them know the details and some don't. The person I met them through, we'll call her Susie, definitely knows what happened (not through me) and she knows that I am very uncomfortable if they're around to the point where I don't want to do things if they're involved.

Susie has had a bad record with me before this happened. She's hurt me a lot and mostly intentionally yet she pours her heart out at me and talks to me all the time as if we're good friends. The feeling is not mutual because although I've learned to forgive her since we all make mistakes, I'm wary because it keeps happening and I don't really enjoy her company anymore. She does a lot of pretending she didn't MEAN to do something when there's no way it would've been a mistake. Knowing you hate chocolate, sneaking some into your food, and then acting very apologetic when you discover it--that kind of thing. Very manipulative. I have no idea if she treats others this way or if I'm just the special one. 

Since the bad ""break up"" of me and Group 2 it's only gotten worse. She invites them to things without telling me or to things she knows I'll know about even if I'm not invited. She knows the problem between me and them, going so far as to not mention them or pull other friends into secret chats to talk about them so I don't hear, yet she invites them to everything in a very ""in my face"" kind of way. Sometimes I end up in this awkward spot of having to bow out of social engagements last minute, sometimes screwing other people over by doing so, because I didn't know they were going to be there until it happens.

I've tried to suck it up but I don't really think I deserve to put myself through dealing with these ex-friends if I don't have to. I'd never ask her to not associate with them on my behalf or anything but it's starting to feel very deliberate. Like she's using them to rub salt in the wound. Back when I was friends with Group 2 she was definitely very jealous of it.

And I just don't know what to do about it anymore.

I don't want to lose my Group 1 friends (and I would if I chose to stop being friends with Susie because I watched this happen to someone else) and I'm tired of having to sit out events because of Group 2. But I can't shake the bad feelings in me when I think about trying to hang around with them. I don't really know how to heal from it when it's been constant exposure since it happened because of Susie. They're involved in all of my social hobbies.

I'm just so frustrated at this point.",25Oct2020,1
203,"I'll try my best to give all the appropriate information. it might be a little graphic.

I've been living away from home for college since fall term started. I came home to visit for the weekend and I brought my cat home with me as I regularly do when I plan to stay for awhile. My mom takes care of the dogs, one is mine, the other dog my brothers, because neither of us live in places that allow dogs. So they've lived with my mom so long they're effectively hers. We've had the dogs for 8 or 9 years now, and they've always lived in the house with my cat with no incident. 

On Thursday night, my mom and I left to go get ice cream. Upon coming back, we found my cat bleeding and broken. He died in my arms. I have never felt a grief like this before and it's not even sunk in all the way yet. But I have still not once felt any anger towards the dogs. They are extremely prey driven, they have killed skunks in our yard and other small animals. They once killed a neighbors cat that got into our yard. They've killed a small dog that got through the fence once as well. But never once have they shown aggression or prey drive for anything IN the house. My brother's wife has a small weenie dog that they've never made a move towards. 

I am absolutely devastated. My mom and brother are extremely angry. My mom told me today she made an appointment for Tuesday to have both dogs put down. She said she can't look at them the same way any more, and my brother no longer trusts the dogs around their weenie dog or youngs kids. 

I understand where they are coming from, but I also don't want to lose three beloved pets in the span of one week. My mental state has already been fragile because of well... Look at this year. I've lost my baby, I've never loved anything like I loved my cat, and he would keep me calm during anxiety attacks and flashbacks ( I have PTSD ).  I feel like I have very little say, because the dogs need to stay with my mom. If she can't deal with them here, or find it in herself to love them anymore, maybe it is best to put them to sleep. But all I can think is that I don't blame them, I'm not angry with the dogs. But I also admit, they are dangerous. 

Am I blinded by my grief, that I don't want to lose them? Should I put my foot down and tell my mom and brother this isn't what I want? I'm so lost and scared and hurt. I'm afraid that losing anything else will be too much on me. What do I do?",25Oct2020,1
204,"I have had a very hard time with the transition to online school and the pandemic's effect on my financial stability. I attend a decent four year university and had just decided to go through with a very significant major change this past spring semester right before the pandemic hit. After, I was left laid off for three months or so and struggled immensely with school--as I do not do well with online classes. I tried to take a calculus class this past summer semester and was forced to withdraw due to my laptop breaking and no access to supplemental resources on campus at the time(also due to COVID). I decided to not let it phase me and go for a full class load this fall semester, while also paying for rent, tuition and other life expenses with my restaurant job. It is no surprise that, though back to work thankfully, I was not making as much as I had been pre-pandemic and struggled to make ends meet. I decided to get off my lease in September to couch surf with friends until I could find a cheaper place. This was an awful idea, as I did not keep up with my work, almost at all, as soon as I no longer had my own space--and was stressed to find another housing situation asap. After all of this, I was able to find a place around mid October, however did not know how to proceed with trying to figure out what to do about my classes. I never like to ask for help and was so overwhelmed that I just kind of shut down, except to make it to work, as I obviously need money to survive. The last day to withdraw, I withdrew from 2 of my classes, however decided to keep my Chem 1 class and Chem lab, because I was not quite as behind in them and thoroughly enjoyed them. I think I maybe should have just withdrawn from all my classes, however I thought I could try to summon up the strength to explain this situation to my professors to at least keep two classes and maybe maintain an ounce of dignity. I also struggle with severe anxiety and have honestly been too scared to ask for guidance, which has only made matters worse. I looked into it and my university does have a late withdrawal application I could fill out, as well as a form to elect credit/no credit for a class. I do not know whether I should try to proceed with one of these options, or go through with just trying my best and potentially failing my only two classes left, and retaking them. Any advice would be super helpful, as I want to stop avoiding the situation, as it only makes my anxiety and mental health that much worse.

211,"So I (18F) just generally have really bad experiences with guys. For whatever reason, any guy who's taken interest in me has been extremely creepy/clingy about it (and in my only other post, I elaborated on this a bit more-) and so I've never had a relationship before, and generally I just avoided guys. I'm also bisexual so this worked for me, but this situation has to do with me potentially being an asshole.
So in late July of this year, I met a guy through a mutual friend of ours that we'll call Nathan. Despite the fact that we met through a gaming friend on our gaming server, it turned out that Nathan lived pretty close, and he took an interest in me. I liked him back, and so this weird online relationship started.
And I want to clarify. Nathan isn't a bad guy. He's fun and he has interesting hobbies.
However, in the last month, I've been feeling stressed and uncomfortable about it. He always wants to play games or watch anime, and while I love those things, I'm a very reserved person and I need time to recharge my social batteries. He's begun saying things that reminded me of my old friend, as well, and this friend in particular really hurt me. Once again, she wasn't a bad person, but neither of us were in a good mental state and it ended badly.
A few weeks ago he said 'I'm distancing myself from you until you do what I want.' That set some flags off for me but after some prompting it turned out he just wanted me to initiate conversations about doing things together, and I was okay with that.
But I've been getting a sinking feeling in my stomach and I don't feel like I'm in the right mental space for this. I had a discussion with Nathan and he just wants this to be a break, but when I told him I couldn't guarantee that it would resume again he kind of just stopped responding. I feel so awful about this because I don't want to hurt him, but he also tried to guilt me a little into reconsidering.

As the title states I ate way too many fiber one bars. Ever since I’ve been the most gassy I’ve ever been in my life and a few hours ago started to become nauseous. I tried to gulp down water to help because they pull water from your colon, but immediately threw up a bit. (I held most of it down), however I looked up what to do and found out you can overdose on fiber, and some may even need to go to the ER. 

My questions are;
What can I do to feel better?

219,"My life has been shit for ever... 

Bullied from elementary school all the way to graduation, mentally not physically. I had teachers(3), harass me (2), make fun of me(2), and kick me out of there classe (1), spit on my art because I shaded wrong(1), ""(name) I hate you"". Students also mentally bullied me, ""(name) why haven't you killed yourself already"", ""put your head under the put tire"" ""you'll never be loved"" ""nobody loves you, you might as well kill yourself"". one girl was dared to ask me out to a school dance, she left me as soon as we got to the dance. Girls laughed at me when I asked out someone. One girl went on 4 dates with me, turns out the small things I was buying for her were actually for her boyfriend she didn't tell me about.

I left my religion because I hated it and it was actually truly making me suicidal. After I left my dad told me ""you just disowned your family"", so I know my dad doesn't care for me. I know he doesn't care because he's threatened to disown me 2 times. Once if I dressed a certain way when I was in the 7th grade! I was 12 years old! Then again when my sister punched me and I punched her back, she didn't get in trouble, only I did, 10th grade, age 15. My mom and siblings do though so that's nice. 

In the past two years I've been on two dates... Both ending not so good and horrible. I took her home after a fun group date ""(name) It would be so awesome if you came to church again"", I politely declined and I never heard from her again. The other one she said we were going to go to an arcade and play games with some friends of ours... We went shopping for 5 hours (I didn't pay for anything). I ended up just hanging out with the other dude and had a good time with him instead. My date gets a call and we have to go home (she drove). We get back to her place, and there were 3 police cars and she got arrested. Never heard from her again. She did work where I worked though. So I found out after about 4ish weeks she was let out of holding. She quit the day after she was let go, and moved states! So I dodged a bullet big time.

And this is the last thing. I was diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis) on August 1st. A day before my birthday... It came out of nowhere and hit hard. I have it really bad. In two months the lesions on my brain stem have doubled. It's in my spine. I feel it in both my legs up to my chest, both my arms, my whole back, and the right side of my face/head... 

I'm not suicidal but I don't want my life to get any worse then it is. If it wasn't for my family (besides my dad), I probably would end it. The only reason I haven't is because I don't want to hurt my family/friends. 

And before anyone says to see a therapist, I am he's really helpful and nice. I like him.

Any advice ?",25Oct2020,1
232,"This is a long story. Please bear with me. I badly need some advice.

This all happened way back. I'm J (F21) and I stay in an hostel kind of away from the main city. Once in a while, I go to the main city with a few friends to watch a movie or eat good food. One such day, I went to meet up with another friend L (F21). We hung out for a good while before calling another friend K (M21) to hang out with us. K is the guy I'm having mixed feelings for. K comes in his car and in a while we're all leaving. L lives in the city and we drop her off and K says he'll drop me back to my hostel. 

A little backstory here:- K and I are very close. We flirt like nuts and I had strong feelings for him. I even used to go around calling him ""hubby"" because we acted as husband and wife in a play for the college. He often used to play with me by asking me for nudes (not playfully, I later realized). Our flirting was cute and sometimes, sexual. We never sexted or anything but we'd discuss sexual preferences in a relatively chaste manner. 

Going back to the main story. So, K and I are in the car and we're flirting, as usual. Things escalated a bit and we ended up kissing in his car. Cliché, I know. As explained earlier, I like him a lot. So, I gave in and didn't mind. We did feel guilty, though and vowed never to speak of it again, even though we did. I told 3 close friends of mine about this and that was that. 

Months later, when K and I were idly texting. He revealed to me that the whole thing was planned. He bought the car there because he wanted to get me into it. He hoped we'd do a bit more than kissing but not sex. He was disappointed that we only kissed. Obviously, I was livid. I saw red. I went nuts on him. He didn't get what he'd done and I blocked him. Feeling completely used and disgusted with myself, I brokedown to another friend of mine. She consoled me and asked me to tell this story to one of K's other close girl friends, let's call her M. M is also very close to me. I told M and thankfully, she was mad about it. Enough to confront him about it, but not enough to go hard on him. I did not want to ruin the closeness K and M had. After being assured that K wouldn't pull this shit with M or any other girl, I left it. M and K still talk and are close. K was also furious that I told people about this. He was mad and said that this would affect me more because I'm a girl. 

It was recently K's birthday. M got him a cake and had it delivered to his place for which I contributed. He texted me with a thank you and I replied formally. I don't want to be his friend again and I definitely have no feelings for him whatsoever. However, I do miss him because we were close and he was one of my best friends. I feel a little pull at my heart when I see photos of us together. What do I do? Where did I go wrong? Should I not have let him use me like that or should I have shut up about it? In my defense, back then, it was one of the best moments of my college life.

So I'm not sure when it started, but I believe I was about 4 or 5 when this started. and stopped when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, so when I was 7 or 8. My brother who is 9 years older than me and convinced to do ""things"" with him. He would've been like 15ish.  He told me to call it ""the thing"". He would show me videos of porn and have me do them on him. I would suck his.. well you know and he would touch my nipples. If I did ""the thing"" with him he would do stuff for/with me. He'd watch shows with me or play games, so I encouraged it. I had blocked it out of my mind, but recently I've been thinking about things of that nature. I feel because I didn't stop it I'm at fault for some of it. I'm actually pretty close with my brother who did these things to me, even more than I am close with my brother who didn't.

I know that sometimes trauma in childhood especially when it's sexual can cause hypersexuality which would make sense for me since, well do I really have to say it.

He texted her this before he left: “I was too haha It was great seeing you and my family enjoyed seeing you too! Safe travels! I’ll miss you and I’ll hope to hear from you soon!”

Two weeks later she said: “I voted today and thought of you! Hope you’ve been having a good time on your trip!”

He then said: “Good:) makes me happy to hear! Breaking records already in Texas 😊 let’s turn Texas blue up and down the ballot! Wishful thinking but idc, we all could use some these days haha 

I am enjoying my time up here, it’s very nice:) I actually want to stay longer, like past the election, I don’t want to be in civilization during that clusterfuck haha  
I actually requested and was approved for my mail-in ballot a week ago or so and it looks like it’s already on its way here - which is very quick! The moment it gets here, I am filling it out and literally overnighting it the same day haha”


She then said: “Yeah for real. Well that’s good to hear! I’m glad you’re enjoying it and still doing your duties as a citizen. Enjoy the rest of your time!”


He said: “Thank you:)
Oh yes! I have to do my civic duty - we can’t afford anyone on the sidelines - arguably the most important thing I or anyone could do this year! 
I just checked the mail and my official ballot has come in - wow I can’t believe it’s actually working so far lol 
I am! I am enjoying the rugged beauty up here so far! I’ll come back home before it gets too cold or snowy though! 
I hope you enjoyed your recent travels, that you’re doing well, and work is treating you well - all things considered!”


THREE DAYS LATER She said: “Nice. Saran also did her mail in voting from Denmark and said it was pretty easy. 

I am happy you’re enjoying it! I’m really trying to get my family to do a ski trip. I need a vacation badly. 

Yes work and everything is going well! I’m going to officially become a charge nurse and interview for the position, etc.”

THEN ONE DAY LATER HE SAID: “For an informed person, it’s not too difficult but for sure there are some easy to make mistakes that can occur in the process and simply just understanding how it works is not a small thing! 

Thank you:) 
All that would be awesome!!! I wonder how that would work! No doubt outside is good but I wonder what adjustments would be made for the indoor parts of skiing! Ah but yeah skiing would be a lot of fun this year! 

Wow! That is fantastic! Congratulations!!! I am proud of you:) your progression is remarkable! I hope you feel good with yourself, this is just awesome, so impressive for real! Just Wow!”

There were sometimes where I had a virus, like when I got a trojan from downloading minecraft modpacks, but I resolved that.

2. Impact client (Minecraft)

So basically whilst I was in college, 2013-15, I met this guy and we were absolute best friends, and I got on with him like noone else. At the time I was in a stupid relationship (he was 8 years older and ended up having a secret relationship behind my back).

We went out together all the time, and on one night he told me he always liked me, (still wasn't single).

One particular night he told me it was now or never and altho I was unhappy in my relationship I had to say no. I told him he was the right person, wrong time.

Skip forward too 2017, and he gets engaged (everyone I've asked say she is a less prettier version of me), and we had already stopped contact after college because of the boyfriend I had. I messaged him, mainly out of curiosity and the conversation didn't really go that far but it seemed like he had big plans.. (building a house, travelling etc) and the conversation stopped.

So I haven't really thought about him since and over the last 2 nights I've dreamt about him. Its been so long and it's really confused me, I'm single now but I could be too late, right?

I checked his Facebook and it hasn't been updated since the engagement, should I message him saying that I feel like I missed out? Should I leave it?

I've always felt something for him but he could be married for all I know now..

247,"I could just use some outside opinions on this.


I got laid off from a great job due to COVID a few months ago. I was lucky to find a new job almost immediately. 

I had really high hopes for this new job, but months later and I'm already trying to leave. My boss is cruel and the pay is only decent because I work the over night shift which has been hard on my family.


Then a miracle happened last week. I was contacted by my old job, asking if I'd be interested in a new position with better pay (+2$ an hour) I have an interview scheduled later this week and since I already know the person interviewing me I'm pretty sure this job is basically mine.


Then today an insane thing happened. My boss told me I was being promoted. This promotion comes with an extra 4$ an hour. Then not even 5 minutes later my boss made another person cry.


I feel like I'm crazy for even considering staying at my current job. My old job wasn't perfect but the people were great and the benefits were really nice. But I keep thinking about what all that extra money could go to. 

I could pay off my student loans. 

I could buy a house. 

I could send my child to a good charter school.

I could even achieve my dream of starting my own business.


But would it be worth suffering for? Should I escape while I can? And whats to keep me from being laid off again? My current job is at least very secure as long as covid is going. But I only get to see my child on my days off since I have to sleep during the day. My new job would let me work from home and give me more regular hours. That alone feels worth the paycut. But I still wanna be able to give my child the life I never had like a good education and the ability to travel. 

I wanna do what's best for my family but I keep going in circles trying to figure out what that is. So reddit, what would you do?

I just wish I could hear her voice one more time. To hear her sing to me one last time. To hear her tell me she loves me one last time. We never met but she was my whole life. Just to speak to her with our time difference, I used to sit in my car when it was -40C outside for hours, until my fingers were numb. I’d do it over again just to hear her voice one last time. 

How do you move on? This should be easy, we never met. But the connection was so strong I don’t know what to do. It’s been over a year and no change.

249,"So earlier this week I tested positive for COVID-19 and am supposed to quarantine until November 2nd. I told my roommate immediately when I got results, sending a text since he was at work. I had told him a couple hours prior that I had a confirmed exposure and got tested. He went to work, told his boss, and was told he can stay. So he did. When I texted him that I tested positive, he said fuck, but nothing else. I asked if his boss had been told and he said yea, and stayed at work anyways. After work, I asked what he wanted to do about it, saying how I wore gloves and sanitized the kitchen and wore a mask if I got anything as well as put on new gloves each time. He said that worked for him, and that he’d stay in his room and do the same in the kitchen. 

I thought this meant in general, but tonight he went back to work (he works as a server by the way). I figured hey, maybe his boss made him come in or something. But then he went to a bar with his friends after, sending me a snapchat of them drinking. I texted and asked if they knew I was positive and he said yes. I told him he shouldn’t be going out to bars but he didn’t reply. 

He expressed a distaste for covid tests in the past, and talks about the pandemic like an inconvenience. Regardless of what people think of the virus, I think it’s horribly wrong to go out and expose people that assume you are being responsible. Since our state doesn’t require masks either, this makes it worse, and thus survival of the fittest works. 

We just moved out together a month ago today, and prior one of my first questions was regarding the pandemic, how he felt about it, since I take it pretty seriously. He told me his family was immune compromised, and he took it very seriously. I guess that all went out the window the second we moved out, but I feel personally lied to as well as horrified in his moral decision making. 

What can I do to express my emotions to him? He isn’t receptive to when I try and tell him he’s being irresponsible.

TL;DR - my roommate is going out to bars and choosing to continue working, as well as not getting tested, despite my positive test result for COVID-19",25Oct2020,1

251," F24. Last week I received  an email from the  university that I applied regarding study grant for a master degree. In order to secure study grant, I need to accept the uni offer before the end of this month and pay the initial deposit (top 2 uni in Aussie)

I am having problem with my cashflow. I was unemployed for a few months this year, so I've depleted my emergency savings. I am tempted to ask my new employer —just started this month — for a pay advance so that I can pay the deposit, what do you think? If I don't accept the offer within the deadline I'll lose the 10k grant. 

I crunched the number, I'll have sufficient funds to finance my master degree next year. It's just that  I have a problem with my cashflow. I need 8k for deposit, My monthly salary for the new job is 7k and I am getting paid monthly on 15th. 

I thought about maxing out my credit card, but even if I do that, it's still not enough. I am a migrant,  so student loan is not an option as international student is  basically a cash cow.

Any advice?

Maybe it's just my luck.",25Oct2020,1

261,"Hey everyone. I’ve been overthinking a lot on what path I want to take regarding school. I currently just transferred to a university and on my first semester of my third year. I’m interested in web development, and cyber security. The MIS courses at my university cover more database classes with a few Python and Java classes in the mix as well. For both CS and MIS, there are very few classes regarding cyber security. 

I thought about getting a minor in CS with this bachelors in MIS to add more technical skills. Getting the masters degree in MIS just offers me more technical experience that I feel like I needed after the bachelor’s. However, I’ve been debating on whether to switch completely to Computer Science or continue the route I am on now. I wouldn’t mind maybe extending to another semester or two to complete a bachelors in Computer Science if it is more beneficial to me. 

I tried an intro to CS at my community college and it was hard because I was never really the tech type of person. However. now that I am gaining more interest in technology and computers, I feel like I gave up on myself and didn’t give myself the chance to learn from hardships and push through. Now I feel more motivated to learn more and put more effort into CS topics.

So to wrap it up, would it be more beneficial to continue my current route or to switch to CS? Thanks again in advance for any advice!!",25Oct2020,1

He lied to her about going on vacation with me for a month and said he was going alone. 

Before he left she went to his family’s house for some lab work and they hung out for hours. 

He texted her this before he left: “I was too haha It was great seeing you and my family enjoyed seeing you too! Safe travels! I’ll miss you and I’ll hope to hear from you soon!”

Two weeks later she said: “I voted today and thought of you! Hope you’ve been having a good time on your trip!”

He then said: “Good:) makes me happy to hear! Breaking records already in Texas 😊 let’s turn Texas blue up and down the ballot! Wishful thinking but idc, we all could use some these days haha 

I am enjoying my time up here, it’s very nice:) I actually want to stay longer, like past the election, I don’t want to be in civilization during that clusterfuck haha  
I actually requested and was approved for my mail-in ballot a week ago or so and it looks like it’s already on its way here - which is very quick! The moment it gets here, I am filling it out and literally overnighting it the same day haha”


She then said: “Yeah for real. Well that’s good to hear! I’m glad you’re enjoying it and still doing your duties as a citizen. Enjoy the rest of your time!”


He said: “Thank you:)
Oh yes! I have to do my civic duty - we can’t afford anyone on the sidelines - arguably the most important thing I or anyone could do this year! 
I just checked the mail and my official ballot has come in - wow I can’t believe it’s actually working so far lol 
I am! I am enjoying the rugged beauty up here so far! I’ll come back home before it gets too cold or snowy though! 
I hope you enjoyed your recent travels, that you’re doing well, and work is treating you well - all things considered!”


THREE DAYS LATER She said: “Nice. Saran also did her mail in voting from Denmark and said it was pretty easy. 

I am happy you’re enjoying it! I’m really trying to get my family to do a ski trip. I need a vacation badly. 

Yes work and everything is going well! I’m going to officially become a charge nurse and interview for the position, etc.”

THEN ONE DAY LATER HE SAID: “For an informed person, it’s not too difficult but for sure there are some easy to make mistakes that can occur in the process and simply just understanding how it works is not a small thing! 

Thank you:) 
All that would be awesome!!! I wonder how that would work! No doubt outside is good but I wonder what adjustments would be made for the indoor parts of skiing! Ah but yeah skiing would be a lot of fun this year! 

Wow! That is fantastic! Congratulations!!! I am proud of you:) your progression is remarkable! I hope you feel good with yourself, this is just awesome, so impressive for real! Just Wow!”

265,"He’s not an alcoholic, he never touches alcohol. But his hips have been causing him a lot of trouble for several years, which he refuses to do anything about. He drinks a gallon of sugary drinks, whether it be lemonade or Pepsi, every two days. He eats sugary pastries for breakfast every day, and throughout the day. He watches TV almost all day every day he’s not at work, and he works sitting in front of a computer. He’s a bit of a hoarder and very disorganized.

His mother passed away a few years ago very slowly due to progressive Alzheimer’s. I worry that I am starting to see some early signs of dementia in my dad.

My mom and I have expressed concern for the way he eats and his inactive lifestyle, and his usual response is anger. He becomes combative like we are making fun of him, but we are just concerned. I have noticed that he sometimes hides eating his sugary foods. 

Today, at the grocery store, I made a comment about his choice of foods that he’s putting in the shopping cart. For the very first time, he said “at this point in my life I don’t care. I want it.” I didn’t know what to say. I just said “okay.” 

I am at home taking classes remotely. For the past three years, I was in college 1,000 miles away from my dad. It’s not like I didn’t see him every few months, but it seems like he has aged so much in the last few years. Even every time I would see him while I was away at school, it seemed like he was aging two years every two months. 

I am admittedly not making the most out of my opportunity. My opportunity being, my dad is *potentially* not going to live very much longer and I could be making the most out of being home with him. It’s just hard when I’m watching him accelerate the later part of his life with his lifestyle.

277,"I have an especially hard time doing things when i feel like they don't matter in the long run, and this is making studying for college classes undescribably difficult.

The issue is i don't have a clue what major i want to take, the University has a pretty small selection and i don't really have the option of going to a place with more options (thos univ has the most diverse selection in the country) and none of the options interest me, because i have no clue what i want to be.

I sat down so many times and thought about what i want to be, but i just can't come up with anything. I don't know how to describe this, but basically deapite not knowing what i want to be and what my major is, i want to study. In my earlier school years i was relatively good at studying subjects i didn't really care about because the grades and doing good at the moment were way more important than the long run, but something happened and my braim took a full halt and now (and in my last years of highschool) i could barely study at all. 

I looked at so many articles so many posts, so many videos, but none of them helped. ""Why cant i study?"" ""Why can't i focus?"" ""Why can't i just sit down and do this homework like i want to?"" ""Why can i sit in front of a textbook for literally 12 hours straight and barely study a page because i can't seem to read the words properly?"" It's especially painful because from probably the 6th grade to 9th grade i was such a great student, i could study and memorise and solve homework like nobody's business, but ever since the 10th grade its like my brain said ""Nope, not anymore"" and nothing i tried to do ever seemed to be able to change that.

Not even when i study things i WANT to learn, like languages, drawing, etc. My brain still Nopes itself out and i get frustrated every.single.time.

But at least i try, i WANT to learn this language i WANT to become better at drawing, and my brain knows it, so it allows me to try again.

But my brain formally decided that studying for school was dumb and college classes aren't benefitting me in the long run anyway, so it refuses to focus on anything. The thing is is that i want to study, i want to care, i know uni is expensive and i want to do well in my classes, but whenever i sit down to study i get frustrated so quickly and to the point where it feels like my brain is a boiling kettle with no outlet, and if i don't stop I'll get headaches, cry and feel awful the whole day, or just have to go to sleep because i feel so drained.

My brain doesn't care about school anymore, so its not letting me try.

I tried going to counsellers in uni, but they always resulted in bad experiences that didn't help and i don't really have any other options. I tried just ""faking it till i make it"" but again, can't focus. I tried thinking about the fact that uni is expensive and important and that i should be grateful for it but nope, all that makes me feel is anxious and makes me want to study less. I tried calenders (normal paper ones, apps, even habitica, and nothing) I tried exercising before (just pacing around the house for like 30 minutes) nothing. Pomodoro? Nope, i just feel frustrated at the short breaks and it feels like dragging my selve through tar to continue (and i still can't focus, if i might add) It's gotten to the point where even typing ""How do i focus?"" Or ""Study tips"" or ""How to study even when you don't feel like it""etc etc into google increases the ""boiling kettle""feeling in my brain and i just feel so frustrated i want to cry.

Its been like this for over 4 years now, i worry about this pretty much every day and its only gotten worse. I can't even get up to do things i WANT to do sometimes, my mind drifts off so easily that it happens on autopilot mode at this point, i don't even do it consciously. I can't study the things i want to because i get frustrated and i can't seem to ""study"" right, i can't study the things i don't want to because my mind doesn't care enough or something, and i always get anxious about the fact that instead of sitting here in front of a textbook wasting time because i KNOW i can't focus, i should be spending time practicing the language im learning for example, because my progress on that is going at the pace of a snail dragging 50 tons. Then i get overwhelmed by both choices, end up doing neither and just watch youtube videos all day. And yes, hiding my electronics doesn't help.

Another aspect of this is also the fact that studying even a small part of ANYTHING takes me forever (for example, the 12 hour example above wasn't an exaggeration), so it feels like im always fighting within myself to either spend my day practice my hobbies that will benefit me for longer and at least TRY to make SOME progress or spend basically the entire day trying to study for this course that i won't benefit me in the long run (i know it would lead me to a degree, but my brain isn't satisfied with that) and i would barely make any progress in studying anyway.

Sorry if this is dumb and rambly, i just wanted to fit as much here as possible (and it still feels like i missed some things) because it feels like i scoured the depths of pinterest, google, articles, youtube videos, etc trying to find a solution but never came up with anything that benefits me. I don't know what to do anymore but i really don't want to stay like this. It weighs on my mind everyday because there are so many things i want to do and i want to put effort into things like i used to but i cant, and i really really really really really have no idea why.

284,"I have only ever really enjoyed a handful of videogames, but my boyfriend loves them, so I'm branching out. Sims is by far my favorite, but I also really enjoy Stardew Valley. 

The problem for me is that I love cute games like Pikmin and Moss but I can't play them. When the Pikmin die and make their little death rattle I am inconsolable. I only ever played once, one Pikmin drowned, and I was so frazzled and sad that all of the other ones died too and I pretty much wept. Moss is the same, the mouse is just too cute, when she dies I feel so sad and guilty, even though she comes right back. Especially in VR I just feel so helpless when she gets hurt or dies, I'm apologizing out loud the whole time. 

My boyfriend set me up with Minecraft and my dog died (directly my fault) and I haven't played again since. 

What can I do to deal with video game death better? Is there something I can tell myself to not feel so bad (aside from that they're not real)?",25Oct2020,1

286,"So let me start off. I (17F) started a job at a local restaurant in the gift shop. Everyone who works there is pretty close knit as it’s a family business. My manager in question, is apart of the family who owns the restaurant/ gift shop. My manager has been working there over 10 years. I started about a year ago. 

This manager has severely been overstepping boundaries with me. She is talking shit about all of my coworkers to me alone and constantly repeating, “Don’t say anything but so and so...” 

I feel like I’m going to explode with secrets. I hate that she talks to me about everyone and spills all their tea. It makes me feel awful. She also got extremely mad at me for making a small mistake at work and continued on for several minutes about how I should have known better. 

I nearly was balling my eyes out because the tone she talked to me in was so aggressive. The mistake I made was I parked my car in the wrong parking lot. I’m human, I make mistakes. I felt extremely beat up when she was yelling at me, and I was very close to telling her she has no right to talk to me in such an aggressive tone. I didn’t though, but I felt like I might have been fired. 

I don’t know what to do. I love my job, but this manager is making my life living hell. She’s double my age and continues to make remarks about everyone who works there. What should I do?",25Oct2020,1
287,"Posting this here in hopes of a helpful response. 

Idk how to introduce my issue here tbh. I’m aromantic and I’ve always been uncomfortable with dating and even trying to picture myself in a romantic relationship with anyone. Let me get that out the way. I’ve been in a “relationship” before a couple yrs ago but it was so horrible because I’d get treated like crap and ghosted by the person I was with constantly and I never wanted to kiss or get intimate with them anyway so breaking up was the best thing to happen to me. I think I just enjoyed being close to someone without feeling pressured to date them and without being casual friends if that makes sense. That’s why before we dated was nice. We were just two people with a strong bond and I enjoyed the person a lot (without romantic feelings).

So now, my problem is that I’ve been hanging out with a friend I’ve never been super close to but we’ve been friends for about 5 years. I don’t want to date him or anything, but I’d like to have a stronger bond with him. I wanna be closer to him and I don’t want to say that because I don’t want him to think I have a crush on him. Idk what to do here. Should I talk to mutual friend and see what they think? I don’t even know if this friend I wanna have in my life more will even feel the same way. He’s interested in a girl and he’s talking to her n stuff so I don’t wanna pull him away from her or anything like that cuz I hope it works out, but I do want to talk to him more n stuff cuz when we talk it’s usually in a group setting.",25Oct2020,1

291,"As a family, we recently had to get rid of our puppy. My hubby is active duty military and we are overseas. My daughter ended up spending 45 days in the NICU and we are now headed back to the states. Due to all the circumstances, we couldn’t afford to spend $3,000 on shipping our puppy back to the states. We expected to have an extra year here, plus going through a military flight which is cheaper to ship animals. We just don’t find it financially possible. 

Now that we are heading back though, we have been talking about getting a cat (husband is a major cat person to begin with). I feel a little guilty because we would be getting another animal after getting rid of one. I know that the puppy went to a great home (another golden retriever in the house plus very active individuals) so I don’t necessarily feel bad though I do miss him.

The real question is, should we still get a cat despite my feeling like a bad pet owner? I’d love a cat and would take care of it. And I know my husband finds comfort in cats so it could be helpful for his mental health. In regard to my daughter, she’ll be around cats regardless because of my sister so it would be a matter of in our house or at my parents that she would be around one.

294,"Dear reddit, 
So I'm 23 and im married, kinda crazy huh? I've been married for 3 years now and its been pretty good. I married my bf of 5 years when I was 20 it was fun and romantic and it was a way for us to move out parent approved and blessed with gifts and welcoming. Our relationship was great we talked often, went out saw each other probably daily. There were many reasons to get married and I loved him deeply so much at that time it was so blinding. I thought he was perfect and so was I. 
Our marriage was good year one we traveled over seas that was crazy! I was 20 and traveling across the ocean and taking long trips. Keep in mind this was not funded by my husband we both worked hard and most of the time id put more in since my job paid more. Not to excuse his hard work he works very hard. 
Year 2 was interesting we did more traveling and went to Japan just like he wanted. When we got back I found some things on his phone I didn't like so much. He was talking to girls and trying to meet up with not so much luck from the girls wanting to meet. It still drove me insane and im not sure to this day almost 2 years later im over it. I can honestly try and forgive him becuase I wouldn't say that is very above me either to do what he did although I haven't since being married but in the past I did do some flirt though texts. I dont know why I still felt ultimately betrayed. I felt he was not my ride or die anymore and still to this day I dont think I've recovered that feeling. I always thought it come back and I still think he's my ride but not die. I think he's my best friend but still someone that can hurt me and back stab me. Before I felt he would never hurt me or wasn't capable of going against me like that. 
Later with the resentment came fights that got physical it sucked to be honest. Im 5'2 175 pds and he's 6'0 230 pds lets just say it hurt. This breaks me every time he hit me? The sweet guy hit me? Part of me as a women I want to say wanted to submit because sometimes I'm not going to lie it was easier, to think he was doing it to help me calm down. Keep in mind this was nothing ever to crazy just some spanking and holding down. This became worse over time until it really hurt. Basically I was leaving the house because I couldn't be there and he pulled me back from my back pack that was on and I feel down onto an ammo can and bruised my back. This was the last time he touched me. I yelled for I want to say about 5 mins. It hurt blinding my back pulsated and I bruised and it sucked. 
I know it sounds crazy but I honestly feel he is in a downfall that just keeps going down. He messed up and he doesn't know how to stop. Things like that come easy to me im nurturing by heart but im tried. I dont know what to do reddit. My heart aches for the guy I used to know but what if he's not even there anymore. What if all my pain is for nothing. 
My family is wealthy and I feel I'm providing a lifestyle for him that I would like to keep if I was him. He moved into my house and lives there rent free, I also share things with him in general like a married couple does. He always has walking around cash and we travel yearly. I've also dated girls so know if i provided this to a girl id definitely have a different reaction. I guess I just feel I was put in an awkward situation and my mind goes all over the place.

296,"Repost but if you read the end you'll know why.


Long post sorry.



My supervisor and I clicked from the day we met and sure I thought he was cute but I knew not to make a move. Just a few days after we met, my coworkers started asking if I'm in a relationship, to which I answered no and I knew this had to do with him. So basically the rumor became that he likes me and that we look cute together. And this all started because he had told someone. All I was told it's someone from management and I knew it's him. It became so obvious because he only offered extra help to me, the way he acted and talked to me pointed to signs of liking me. And did flirt back and forth many times. 

Being young and having a first job and no experience with having an actual boyfriend, I got scared. I got scared thinking what if he makes a move? And what if some how we both lose our jobs. And although many people are couples at the job and have family members working as well, I got scared and nervous. 

This is where I fucked up. I started to distance myself and eventually we stopped talking. You know when you have something real good with someone and then it's gone in a heart beat? That's what it felt like and still does. 

He caught on and one day when it was just us he told me I hurt him by doing so. To which I couldn't even respond to. I just stood there quiet and ended up saying that he was treating me the same (obviously it was my fault so of course he wouldn't talk to me either). I wish I said sorry that day, I really did. It's been so many months and sure we act normal and all but we have many many awkward moments. Sometimes I can't even say hi. I just feel bad for treating him like that when it wasn't really his fault either.

I am quitting in a few weeks and this does have to do with all this and another manager hating on me because of him liking me which made me really uncomfortable. I haven't told anyone about this except two of my close work friends. My anxiety started to get worse every time I would go in for my shift and I decided this was the best to do. He found out I'm leaving after I told my manager and came to talk (apparently he never goes around to say bye to people who quit, so of course I got asked by coworkers what he said and why he came). In that moment I felt so bad. I wanted to talk privately and say how I'm sorry for treating him the way I did since he is one of the nicest people there. 


So here is my question to the people of reddit.

Should I ask to talk to him privately one of these days before I leave? I don't wanna have any regrets. I'm already so emotional and sad about leaving because I really liked working with everyone there. Maybe it shouldn't matter so much after all these months but I'm an overthinker and I just wanna leave on good terms. 

At the same time I'm confused because I posted a few days ago and some told me that I was sexually harassed. 

Please help me.

Problem is, I kind of messed up my GPA first year (3.33, which isn’t terrible but certainly not good enough for medical school). Anyway, I did join some clubs my first year and was sort of active on campus, but then obviously coronavirus hit and my university shut down, and I lost almost all motivation for the things I liked to do before. I also felt screwed over because a lot of other students had already gotten into year long programs/internships/jobs while I never got around to submitting applications.

I guess second year rolled around faster than I expected and I feel stuck and lost, and constantly comparing myself to other classmates/friends that already have somewhat professional experience in college while all I really have is that I worked a store job on campus my first two quarters. I feel unconfident to apply for research/internships because of my low GPA and lack of experience, but I feel like the more time that passes by, I feel like I become less worthy of an applicant.

At the beginning she cheated on me, I broke up with her but a day later got back with her, she said she wasn't gonna do it again so I was like okay. I gave her shit for it every now and then, but she moved in a mother later, like 2 times I kicked her out one because i wasn't over her cheating, another time cause she was talking to some guy.

A year goes by it was good not too bad, we both enjoyed it and loved each other, my family moves in with me, and she still lives with me, my family gave me a bit of stress but I manged, half a year goes by she gets pregnant, we're having a kid, tbh I gave her shit through her pregnancy for cheating at the beginning and other stuff, I know it wasn't right and I do regret it, I was arrogant to my ways and apologized to her.

We have a kid, and 3 months after we move in with her mom, we started arguing more, but still we're at it together, I talked to some chicks over the internet and phone but never had sex with anyone (she finds out later). We all move to a new house we argue even more and more to the point we fight alot, we start getting distant but still live together with her mom. She finds out about the talking on the phone. 

Our kid is 1 years old now, we argue but never in front of our kid we just take turns watching him, we talk to each other but more likely than not it'll be an arguement or some bickering. Few fights here and there, but about a month ago she starts talking to some guy on Facebook, 2 weeks ago she goes to a hotel and fucks him then came home at 4am and fucked me, I didn't know she fucked him. 

 Then a week ago she Goes out with some friends and comes back 2am with the guy, she seems a bit incoherent (we found out later she was drugged by the guy) , she wakes our son up and tries to put him back to sleep, she told me if I was gonna sleep in the living room so they can sleep in our room, I kick the guy out and she passes out on the bed, the whole time I'm confused, I go through her phone and see all her messages and find out what's been going on. I leave to a friend's house.

Next morning she calls and texts saying she's sorry that she wants to make it work, I go back home, say I'm gonna leave, she begs me not to, I don't. 

It's been a week since then, we argue still alot, but since then I have been calling her a bitch and hoe, she stop seeming sorry for it, she said she did it because I wasn't treating her like dirt under my feet and he gave her attention, I think this it. we're barely on a thread, she says I need to change I said she's been a bitch and hoe, I know I shouldn't but I've been filled with hate in me

We're both miserable and I think this is it, I can't move out till like 3 or 4 months, we're trying to play nice for the kid, but we still talk but it's half arguments have bickering, we both say we want to work on the family but both blame each other for things we did, so it's almost a full circle .

Mentally I kind of just want to move on but being here physically I can't, so it's hard. How do I mentally move on, we both want what's best for our kid but we've grown toxic to each other.

We both love each other but we're just not where we used to be, it's misery for both of us, she said when she cheated on me that she was done with me, that hit hard for me. It put hate in me. I wish at least she could've kicked me out

Now here's my problem...I'm the idiot. I talked with them and had emails discussing that I dokt agree to their asking price for backrent but I made the mistake of not seeing the lease agreement they put in with the purchase agreement. I didnt think too much of it because they mentioned over and over they dojt want to stay long or even a week past closing so I said okay to back rent and not read the full purchase agreement besides the purchase part...not realizing there's a lease agreement until Oct 29th or sooner on there. The price they listed on there..now that I went back and looked at all the fine prints...stated 100 a week. Now its been over one month after closing. And they have given us a check for 400 dollars. I stated in the email eitj them that I didnt agree ( this was before the house close) and will take the 100 a week only if she stays just one week over closing, and if it goes to 2 weeks then I will charge 500, and additional 250 for 3 weeks or if its 4 weeks then I will charge a full month rent of fair market rent value. They said we will have to sign a new lease agreement then. And I never asked about it again. I clearly see it's a mistake on my part and I was being naive thinking ah its fine...they're older...just give em time to move out so they don't have to rush. Now realizing being nice sucks. Not just nice but obviously I'm an idiot for trusting people and not read the fine prints. Sigh...they are now being rude and said they will talk to their attorney and all this crap whrn I bring back the email where I stated I didn't agree with the 100 a month and them telling me they will have to do a new lease agreement and my stupid ass didn't think to create a new one for them to sign because I just thought the email would be enougj to show hey wr talked about this...

I mentioned this to several friends because I feel like white Americans knows the system, rules, and laws better than us...my fam don't speak English very well and we have always operate around people whom wr trust ...although more than a couple handful of times now that we've encountered similar situation with white Americans we've been taken advantage of and they caused us to either lose money or they are aggressive with us. When we respond...they get even more aggressive and bring in laws and all the things we are afraid of as an immigrant. Even though wr are all American citizens...we still feel the laws don't stay by our side...so many bad experiences with white Americans thwt we feel intimidated and scared of how they react to us...even in situations where we should have the advantage... we've had experiences in the past where we got police involved even and they told us they couldn't understand us even tho wr speak English clearly and told us they couldn't do anything about people harassing us...time after time wr feel afraid of the law...the system...the people. I know grouping the situation to the color of people's skin is wrong. I know not all are thst way..but I feel ...I still feel intimidated to come into a confrontation with white Americans...I guess I'm a racist towards white..that's what I've been told by all my white friends when I told them about this and the situation...sigh",25Oct2020,1
312,"Ok so i (F18) started crushing on her all really the first week of uni, and I was pretty sad about it because not only was I confident she was straight, I also thought she would get bored of me as a friend quite quickly because I thought she was a lot more interesting than me.
I didn’t want to care too much about her.

However this is close to three months ago, and were still friends, and I’m hopelessly simping over her.

The reason it has gotten so bad is the fact that she won’t confirm whether she is straight or not (she knows I’m a lesbian btw). She keeps saying she’s never been in love, and therefore she can’t know for sure. However she’s dating a boy. But the thing is that she doesn’t seem into him on an emotional level, but this is hard for me to know for sure since she won’t talk to much about him with me. They stopped seeing each other for a little bit, because she didn’t want to anymore, however they started meeting again even tho she has told me she doesn’t want to be his girlfriend. When she goes to meet him, she tries to hide it from me. And when she talks about him she always apologizes afterwards. 

The second thing is that our friendship is quite *intense*, at least more than I am used to. It started with smaller things like us two being weirdly comfortable with sitting alone in totalt silence while looking at nature and stuff. It may not sound that weird, but it started the first week of us knowing each other, we would just sit in each other’s presence in silence, and sometimes she would ready me poetry.

Then a little time went by and when we would get drunk together we would feed each other food, like cereal and stuff, which is kinda weird.

She also always uses my name, and says it to me a lot, which is an indicator of flirting here in Norway.

Then our communication started getting a bit strange, whenever we are together we really enjoy each other’s company (she will just sometimes say “you make me so happy”), but at the same time it seems like there always is something she won’t tell me, like she’s thinking of something. I asked her about it and she said “whenever I’m with you I think of so many complicated things, and I have to watch what im saying”

Over text she seems quite distant, and I often have trouble understanding what she really means and is thinking (she is incredibly care if you know that term). However when we meet we have so much fun that I forget the issue. And she has told me many times that she sucks at online communication.

Another issue is that she promises to meet up to study together, but is often a no-show. She (and often I as well) dismisses these instances with the fact that she has a disinterest in school, not me. However, if her studying goes badly, and she has to drop out and move, well probably lose contact (considering she sucks at online communication), and therefore the two aspects are sort of intersectional. Which makes me feel more offended when she doesn’t prioritize studying.

HOWEVER HER IS THE THING THAT IS MAKING ME SO DAMN CONFUSED sorry to keep you waiting 

Because of COVID constrictions we rarely touch. It was a running joke that we had slept in the same bed (this actually happened once when we were drunk, and she put her head on my shoulder🥺) but still had not hugged.

However about two weeks ago we were going to a concert, we were going to different pre-games. She showed up to the concert absolutely shit faced (I was also quite wasted tho), and when we met at the venue we had our first hug. She hugged me extremely hard and long and would not let me go, and I literally had to tell her to let go. Then she grabbed my hand and went on about how she had missed me (I had seen her two days before, she could have met me the day before tho but she ditched me) and that I just was soooo cooool. Then we got into the venue, and we both had to pee, she insisted on us sharing the same cubicle. She legit pulled me into hers.

When we got to out table we were still holding hands, and our faces were really close to each other and I would put her side bangs behind her ear and she would giggle and according to our other friends we were quite intense.

it was all nice I guess until she suddenly stopped talking, and then she threw up hehe. I had to take/carry her home, shower her and put her to bed because she was totally out of it. 

After that we have sort of not talked about us being so touchy that night, and i don’t wanna bring it up just for her to blame it on the drinking.

Communication has been worse since then as well, she’s doing even less studying, and lying to me about what she is doing instead when I ask. (This town is a small place so my friends have seen her around). 
However when we actually meet things seem somewhat normal.

This Wednesday we found a dehydrated butterfly and fed it sugar water, while we were watching in we sat with our faces really near each other. We just sat there in silence for at least half an hour. Is this normal???

Then yet again yesterday she ditched me after promising to study with me, and went shopping with her roommate (one of my friends saw them) 

I haven’t confronted her about lying to me, but when I told her I was sad to no see her she legit just responded with “mew” to the text. And when I asked her what the hell that meant she said “it means I’m both happy and sad ❤️” ... like what the hell does that even mean.

And then she proposed that we should go explore a building site nearby, which I think she did to change the subject, because when I asked her about where and when she just said “idk”

So yeah, idk what is happening with this girl,, I am really attracted to her tho (but I try to hide it as much as I can cause I don’t want to make her uncomfortable) do any of you think there is a chance she is attracted to me as well, or what do you think is up??? Because I’m honestly extremely confused. 

I don’t know enough about her other friendships with girls to know if she is always like this. Also I have only known her for three months so I feel like I know quite little in general...

Please give some advice.

Thanks for reading 🥺",25Oct2020,1

I (M17) have wasted 2 years of my life not studying or paying attention in school at all.

There's a huge amount of competition and some students have even prepared for this exam since 8th grade. To anyone not from my country, this may not seem like a big deal but in my country, this is basically what decides your life for the most part. I was a fairly hard-working student up till 10th grade but in 11th and 12th grade, I've neglected my studies a lot. I have aorund 3 months left to study for the exam and I barely know anything. I honestly don't know what to do right now. I've been trying to start studying since April but I can't put my mind to it. Each time I start studying, my mind wanders and sooner or later I give up. I procrastinate a lot as well. I feel like I don't  really have a passion for anything right now. I've just been going with the flow and ended up in this situation where if I don't get my life on track, I don't know what'll happen. I'm at a loss about what to do right now.

For the past 2 years shes turned into this edgy, reckless type with a bad attitude towards me, my family and pretty much everyone/everything else.

The best thing to for me to do is to not say anything, but it kills me because they don’t deserve to be spoken to like that. Even if I dont intervene and my parents tell her not to raise her voice she still screams at them (my dad has Tinnitus and this sets it off which is why I get so mad). She says the reason she gets upset and rages is because my dad shouts at her and only her, when the reason for that is nobody else is disrespectful like her and she doesn’t see that, even if we told her that she would storm off and not listen.

She has opened up to us and said that she feels really angry all the time and we’ve tried to get her to go to counselling but she wont do it.

When we got back Sara and Brian were still awake and so we had a beer watched a movie. Movie ends we all go to bed and Jack goes to share a bed with Sara I'm already sceptical Jack is a bit of a horndog and made no shortage of passes at Sara in the past still texts her inappropriate things and what not. Then a hour or so go and I hear them, well what I don't think is sleeping. With any other situation I wouldn't care the problem is Jack got engaged to not Sara two weeks ago. Also Sara is friends with the girl. We are all in a pretty tight nit group of friends like middle school/high school friends (we are all 26-28 now) A drunken hook up Sara had with another friend in the group almose ended alot the friendships and it was rocky between all of us for a while. So I'm completely freaking out about what to do.. Do I tell Jack's fiance? Or do I keep It a secret? Jacks literally saved my life from a very dark depressed time in my life he's my one of my 3 closest friend and I'm not afraid to admit that I love him like a brother and Im not sure if I can lose him as a friend for my own mental health. I don't have many friends especially close ones and I am genuinely terrified to the point of shaking and crying that this very well could be the end of a close friendship. Sara and I are also very close we've lived together for 2.5 years now and we bicker and yell at each other like brothers and sisters do. The issue is that I have a massive moral compass and I literally don't know if I can keep this a secret it strongly bothers me to the core of my being. I don't know if I'll be able to look and them because of this. Cheating is to me at least the most worst thing you can do to another person who your supposed to love. It goes against everything I built myself to be. The fiance is s such a sweet honest girl who doesn't deserve this. No one does. 

Should I confront them? I'm not 100% sure they did but I'm like 95% sure. 

Should I just tell the fiance?

 Do I give Jack and Sara an ultimatum to do the right thing?

Do I keep it a secret?

I’ve helped a lot of my “friends” through very serious struggles (paying their rent when faced with the possibility of eviction, buying hundreds of dollars worth of food, paying for most activities) but whenever I ask for anything in return or just to have a friend to be there they’re nowhere to be found and they don’t even respond to me.

I would consider myself as someone with some mental illness. I did have serious depression during my time at high school and severe suicidal ideation but over time it transitioned to anger and anger management issues. Over time I got better at controlling it but due to stresses, some lashing out has occurred here and there.

I think some of the issue is expecting anything from anyone after I’ve done anything and that I really shouldn’t expect anything because really no one owes me anything but at the very least I’d like friendship.

331,"Last year I (29f) left a polyamorous relationship because my primary partner (30m) and my relationship was toxic. 

Our relationship started out like many do, strong but wavering over time. About half way through our monogamous relationship, he mentions he has a kink about sharing me (which is fine, I am a kinky lady) and we begin to explore hotwifing. Through this we expanded into polyamory. We set boundaries and rules that I followed but he did not. 

1. Nobody from work 
2. Full transparency and communication 
3. If it effect our relationship, it ends. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and he tells me there is a girl at work (rule #1 broken) he wants to get to know. She (25f) and her partner (23m) are already in a relationship and they are also interested in expanding their knowledge of polyamorous relationships. I expressed my dislike for the rule breaking but agree to meet them anyway.

We meet up with them and end up hitting it off. We have a year of getting to know each other and we have integrated pretty well into each other's life, still not much of a sexual nature to the relationship based on potential jealousy issues. I think things are going well, and tell my partner that I'm happy we made the decision to date this couple. 

Around my birthday we had a party where my partner (30m) slept with the girl he met from work. They hid it from me for over a month (rule #2 broken)  and when I found out I stupidly forgave them. 

I became close with her and I stayed in the relationship for another year while my partner and I resented each other and it became incredibly unhealthy to stay together. 

We were still dating this couple as we broke up. She (25f) would constantly tell me that there is no way she would continue to date my primary if I left and about how she wanted to make things work with me instead. 

I ended up moving out of state to get away from my ex and try to work on myself. I would reach out to my girlfriend to try and keep an open line of communication, only for her to constantly ignore me and attack me for leaving her to deal with my ex. But only a couple of months later find that my ex and her are now fully in a relationship. I feel mislead and lied to. 

I went to visit earlier this year and was met with a stonewall. I was told ""you don't get to just come back and have everything go back to the way it was"" which I fully understand, but the whole thing feels twisted now. 

I understand I left and that was my decision but it feels like now that I'm out of the way, they finally have what they wanted all along. 

I have told them both how I feel about it and they tell me I am overreacting and need to deal with my jealousy issues and ""get over myself""

I am so angry  and I don't know if I can forgive them. More importantly, how do I forgive myself and truly walk away? Is it worth trying? I haven't slept in days, food has lost all taste, and there is a knot in my stomach that won't let up.",25Oct2020,1

333,"Alright, so, I’m in a situation that is possibly beyond saving. I have to make every single right move if I even stand any chance at fixing something so complicated. This is probably going to require someone with counseling experience to be honest. 

I have dated a woman for 9 years. We recently bought a home together, and there were many issues with our relationship but we were on track to a future together. We went through so much good and bad. To list all the complications on here would take forever...but long story short...I kept desiring attention from other girls because she would constantly tell me about how I need a better job, more money, muscles, a different vehicle, a 401k, life insurance...that is just naming a few of the demands she frequently made. Another big issue was that I’d take her places, and she’d complain the next day that I don’t take her out enough. I began to feel as though she was belittling me, or changing me into something I’m not. I have since understood that some of the changes she wanted were legitimate and important for a future. Regardless, I would talk online with other girls I knew, sometimes sexually. Eventually I got caught, so she wrote down every single message in a notebook and used them against me for years. 

She went out and physically had sex with another man in retaliation. It got real bad for a while...but we made it through. The process kept repeating for years. I’d feel hurt by her words, then find other girls to talk to. It was so bad that I’d neglect going out with her...I’d sit on my phone or video games and just escape reality most of the time. Then one week she went on a camping trip by herself. A month or so later, she confessed to cheating on me again, and though it killed me inside...I just pushed away all that hurt and let it go. We stopped sleeping together in the same bed...that was another thing that made me feel lonesome and unappreciated...her reasoning was a mix of me “cheating” and apparently I sweat too much in my sleep. 

Though a lot of things I’ve described were terrible, we had hundreds of amazing experiences together as well...and literally spent all of our 20’s together. We became so used to each other that it was very routine. Though I had talked with girls online before...I never was physical in person with any of them...until this past year. Unfortunately we had just purchased a home together...but this strange overwhelming feeling of revenge and curiosity came over me. “What was it like when she was with someone else”, I had thought to myself hundreds of times over the years.

One night I went through the drive-thru, and a girl gave me her number. One thing led to another...we ended up having extremely deep connection with our conversations...and eventually I began cheating physically on my girlfriend. The sex was great...and I was absolutely infatuated with the new woman in my life. I began to be distant and even asked my girlfriend if we could try an open relationship. She refused. She was devastated...and eventually we broke up after she started threatening the girl I was cheating with. About a month or two went by, I was blinded by desire with this other girl. My ex began seeking out other men, and after one night of sleeping next to my new love interest in my own bed...I had severe second thoughts. I was just shook by the horrible decisions I had made. I felt nauseated and had a moment of clarity for the first time in many years of my previous relationship. 

I began to understand very quickly that I didn’t want my ex with another man. I didn’t really want another woman. I had taken things for granted and gone much too far. The worst part was, I thought that if my ex really loved me, she’d understand our relationship was more important and find it in her heart to forgive me. After all, she had also had sex with someone else before...and I forgave her.

My ex vowed “you’re going to sit in this house and watch me fall in love with someone else”...”you’ve opened Pandora’s box”. “You think I can just forgive you in an instant”...just to name a few things she said to me. I begged and begged for forgiveness, I cut all ties with the girl I cheated with, and can swear on my own grave that after things finally got physical with someone else and went this far...I never wanna cheat again...ever. 

For weeks now, I come home from work, my ex is out at another guys house until about 6 am. I have no drive to do anything...nothing can get my mind off of her. I screwed up...but I want her back...and it feels impossible because she’s “seemingly” replaced me with a man who is 8 years older and much more stable than I am. 

She never wants to answer my calls, yet the minute I stop calling her for a day, she calls me wondering why I haven’t called. We’ve had sex a few times recently...but then she makes excuses that she was drunk. She ignores me...but then occasionally gives me bits of hope here and there. She might say “I need time to heal”...I’d say “how long do you think that will be”...then she’d reply “1-2 years”. After I tell her “I would find someone else by that point”, she tells me “well you’d wait if you love me”. It’s almost like this is still a game to her. She’s cold and harsher than I ever was to her...yet just sweet enough to keep me holding on when she needs me to be. 

So, after that giant story of unfaithfulness and growing together, and maddening emotions, I leave you with an extremely difficult question. What on earth will it take to get her back and treat her better? I want to come back into our relationship like her knight in shining armor. I don’t wanna be a cheater ever again...we were nearly married and I’m ready to settle down and treat her like my wife. I want to show her that I’m able to be a great husband if we can make things actually work again since I’ve let the past go and learned the hardest lesson of my life. Coach me...give advice...is it even worth trying...could this be another rough patch...or the end of all things with my 9 year journey?",25Oct2020,1

336,"So basically, when I was in secondary school my top row of teeth were naturally perfect, whilst my bottom row has a little left to be desired, but they didn’t bother me at all.
Then, I played a football match when I was about 15 or 16 I’d say and a guy came and sucker punched me from my blind side, knocking one of my front two teeth, essentially behind the other. 

The nerve in the tooth was killed, so that tooth has been basically black since then, and whilst the tooth was pulled by forward by the dentist, it now lies slightly behind my other front tooth. 

And now, I’m 26 and can’t afford braces because they’re so damn expensive. 
My teeth, for the last 9 or 10 years have had such an impact on my confidence and mental health, I was always conscious of my teeth in social settings, trying not to “teeth smile” unless I was with close friends, not showing my teeth in any photo’s. Basically always thinking about them and how damn ugly they are. It’s gotten to the point where they’ve shattered my confidence and I get genuinely depressed thinking about them, and I know this also sounds dumb but, i know it plays a large factor in my dating life too, nowadays the first impression I.e online dating is everything, people see no photos with a teeth smile, not good, or they see ones that I built up the courage to smile in, and see the out of place black tooth and immediately think God no. I’m tired of my teeth being the first thing anyone notices about me when I have a conversation with them and I’m tired of being eternally self conscious and self hating about them too.

My question is, is there anything I can do for affordable braces in the UK? The pricing is a disgrace in my opinion and the NHS does nothing in this matter.

338,"Please be kind, this is very personal to me. I'm sorry it got a bit long – I don't voice my thoughts often so it usually comes out in a jumbled mess. There's a TL,DR at the end.

I mostly have a very low self-esteem, due to factors that I have suspicions of but will not delve into here. I don't think self-esteem is the most fitting word though – it's more like I go about my day as usual, go to school, listen to music etc. and feel fine, but deep down I think stuff like *the clothes I picked today are nowhere as good as my friends'*.

The thing is, though, this extends past me and that's where I'm worried. For example, I could see a car the exact same model and colour as my mum's and I'd still think stuff like *we have more scratches on ours* and therefore it's lesser quality or something stupid like that. Another example is music – I'm fine listening to the music I like by myself but when I want to share it with someone else I always feel like deep down it's a bad song, which is honestly not fair to the artists, and music is a form of art so it's an arbitrary judgment anyway. But I still can't help but to think it. It's the same with my family, my lunches, and even followers of a social media account I run, etc.

While it's not that big of a problem right now as these are just fleeting thoughts and I'm still young (17), I'm worried these feelings will exacerbate and lead to me acting upon them and seriously hurting my relationships with others. Like if I get a significant other I'm afraid it might extend to them (e.g. feeling that my boyfriend's not as ""good"" as that person's, which leads to me inadvertently using demeaning language on him, which would not be good for his own wellbeing).

In truth, I think it's already affected my relationships slightly – e.g. in the clothes example from earlier, that feeling leads me to becoming more withdrawn and not having as much fun in a gathering which my friends can detect. Like recently I've noticed one of my friends regarding me more lowly, I don't think she realises it but it's stuff like me complaining about my phone being out of storage for no reason and she's like yeah that's what happens when your phone is old. The comment made me feel defensive, but I think my lack of self-worth (comments from myself about how slow my phone is) fuelled into her saying that.

The most frustrating thing is that I know stuff like clothes don't matter and that you can't rank people into this person is better than another, but I can't help having these negative feelings anyway.

On the other hand, the reason I said I *mostly* have a low self-esteem is because sometimes my ego is very inflated. Overall, I think I'm average? Most of the time? But I mess up a lot so less maybe? god i don't know

I remember watching this TED-ED video a while ago that was something like ""why do average people think they're great"" or something and I really think that applies to me. Like I get one (1) thing done nicely and I'm like !! wow I'm so good at this. The same outfit I felt great in one time can make me feel terrible in the next and then great again the third time I wear it.

So I guess my real question is how do I find my own self-worth not based on how well I do something (e.g. I place value on my listening skills, then I don't listen to my friend very well, then I think I am a bad listener and therefore have no value)? I don't know if I'm making sense at this point, sorry.

**TL,DR: How do I find my own self-worth not based on things I do?**

339,"Hey everyone !

I will spare you the backstory of little me always gushing over pianos when I went to my friend’s house in the past, or how I always enjoyed classical music from a young age (especially after watching Barbie and the Nutcracker and become a fan of Tchaikovsky), and how I always basically dreamt of getting a piano to finally start learning and hopefully discover my ""vocation"".

Well, I will may be have the opportunity to have one for Christmas, but there is a ""catch"". I am supposed to prove my motivation and start learning music theory in the span of two months to show to my parents that I am serious about it. I totally agree with this method since I usually tend to abandon things once they get tricky, so starting with the ""hard"" part would be the easiest way for me (and them) to see if getting a piano is actually a good idea.

Now my issue is.. where to start and how to do it without an instrument ? I don’t have the money to get the help of a professional, or to take a course, so the resources must be free. It can be either books or videos.. anything as soon as it’s for beginners and easy to understand.

346,"I have various types of OCD. Will only mention those which are bothering me right now. 

I have constantly created and deleted various social media accounts all these years. Everytime I create an account, I feel this will be permanent and I won't delete it. But something or other happens. I regret creating it for reasons like adding/communicating with people and I feel the only way to ghost them is to delete. Or I feel all the content I absorb such as news, or the pages I follow are too much for me to handle. Or I just get bored and think I'll never join again. 

I have this weird desire where I'll be a troll on Facebook and relentlessly shitpost and create an image for myself as a very very edgy and woke person. I feel like not expressing my weirdness on the internet is like wasting my potential. 

I tried going nosurf by deleting all my accounts. I tried sticking to just Reddit. I read posts about people being happy after deleting social media and how productive and refreshed they feel. I deleted Reddit but I just can't keep away from my phone (I am a phone addict). After deleting all social media accounts  still I couldn't be happy. I suspect it is because it is just a way of coping and to get away from madness at my home. I keep on deleting my Reddit everytime because I never stay satisfied with my username. Or even if I liked it when I made this account I'll feel it's not good enough.

I created this account and thought I'll keep it blank but my urges to make posts here got the better of me. And even though that was not my intention, when I grab lot of karma I feel like going for more. 

Also the fact that if I have nothing else to do on Reddit I'll just search random words on Reddit and see if anything interesting enough posts come up to waste my time.

349,"To cut a long story short, and to sweeten the irony of saying that, I studied humanities in college (history, English literature, and sociology) and chose to do sociology and history in University.

I LOVED English literature but wasn't fully aware of it at the time. I didn't choose to take it in Uni because the age-old 'good luck getting a decent job afterwards' thing, and for other reasons pertaining to how I felt. 

I chose Biology because... I chose Biology because I took a gardening course in my first Uni and was really interested in it. I found it satisfying identifying plants and growing things. Hidden a little under the surface was also the thought that I would meet a girl doing Biology (turns out I'm gay \~), which now grates on me.

This is actually the first time I post something on Reddit rather than just lurking. I needed something off my chest and wasn't sure who to talk about it.

Anyway, I (m20) have been good friends with this girl (f19) for a few months now. We would hang out together or with other friends and basically got along very well.

About 2 weeks ago the 2 of us, together with an other friend, were watching a movie and having quite a few beers. As soon as the other guy left things got heated real fast. We're kissing for a long time and just having fun together.

Day after she texted me that she isn't sure what/how it happened and she doesn't really want to loose the friendship we have. She isn't always in control of these kind of things and hopes she didn't hurt me.

I just replied she shouldn't blame herself on this and she surely wouldn't loose me as a friend. Actually I wasn't sure at the time if I actually wanted more out the friendship or not. Might have been the beers.

2 days ago we were watching some Netflix together and didn't drink anything at all. After a few hours things started slowly. We're just holding hands which let to cuddling. Fast forward an other hour and we're on top of each other making out and undressing. Had an awesome night and though this might actually be more than just a friendship. 

Well, next day comes and I got the text that she doesn't want to make anything out of this. She rather just has me as a good friend, but nothing more. She's struggling with some things and feels ling she isn't ready at all for a relationship.

364,"Since middle school, I've been obsessed with writing systems and the typography of those writing systems. And since a few years ago, a particular writing system sparked my interest: the Germanic runes (futhark). I love making art for the communities that are involved with germanic runes (specifically r/runes and r/Norse) and am probably one of the few people actually making modern artwork for them, instead of traditional pagan themes. It gives me a lot of energy and it stays a passion, no matter what I do.

Unfortunately runes are surrouned by misinformation due to pop culture, ill-informed pagans (there are many pagans that are aware of how they use runes, not shitting on them), nazi's, and white supremasists. It's getting tiring to see that happen on subreddits and everywhere in general. Whenever I say I'm into this niche of runes I'm sometimes met with weird looks and misconseptions and it's becoming a negative energy in my life.

Using alt acc, because people mentioned here know my main account 

About 7 years ago, I got into relationship, which still is my longest relationship, and it lasted about 2 years. In first year, we lived about 200kms (~120 miles) away from each other, since I was studying in university and she was in high school, but we met every / every other weekend. Next year she went to same city as well, and we started to live together in dorms (since it was my 2nd year, I was able to get us room together). Year goes on and on February she said that she will go to USA that summer to sell educational books for whole 3 summer months (maybe you've heard of SouthWestern advantage). I was really skeptical, since she was shy and it would be hard for her to sell anything, but since she was my gf, I supported her. My birthday is at the very end of May, and that's the day she left to USA. I was standing in bus station (she took a bus to another country to fly to US) devastated and alone in my birthday. And it all goes downhill from here.

I was working at gas station at the time and had great colleagues. One girl I had special contact with and we both were already taken and trusting to our SOs. Until after one shift we both got pretty drunk and I snuck her into my dorm (I had to use help from other people to help me to distract dorm-keeper (?) to get that girl in dorms, since guests had to sleep in other rooms and had to pay for staying, so it was better to break some rules). And of course we had sex that night.
Next day I felt really bad and Skype-called (Skype was still banger then) my gf in US, and told her everything, because I couldn't live with thought that I've cheated on her. She listened to me, said that she needs a break for a while, which is what I gave her. Before her arrival, she said that she wants me to get all her stuff ready and her aunt came and got her stuff without her. After about 2 weeks we met, had a chat, she said that last month she's been living with some Dominican guy, and so on, but I didn't care, she was my everything. She stayed with me that night, but nothing happened between us. After that night we lost contact for about 4 years.

After about a year and a half later, I finally could start dating someone again, because I was thinking about that girl for a very long time, and I just couldn't be with other, just in case she wants to be with me again and what if I'm taken. We started renting an apartment about 2 months in our relationship. At first it was fine, but then I started comparing relationships, comparing different things and slowly I just couldn't even normally look at my gf at the time, since I felt even disgust (and it hurts, because I was her first guy, and it was not her fault that I don't feel anything against her). Then, about 1 year in our relationship, we had ""the talk"" and next day her stuff was out of apartment. I'm still living in this apartment. I was happy that I was alone, and sad because I was alone.

And again I had a relationship pause for about 2 years, because I didn't want to hurt someone again. I wasn't even dating or having ONS or anything.
Then on Tinder met a girl, we went out few times, had a beginning to a relationship, she had great sense of humor, great way of thinking, but I did not find her my visual type. She was shorter than me, but still tall, and I looked like smaller brother to her. So, 2 months into dating, I told her that I couldn't be with her anymore... Without normal reason... I just can't.

Another year and a half has passed, I've been out of relationship this whole time, not even dating, just Tinder-swiping left, feeling empty, being afraid that I'd hurt next girl I'm getting relationship with. I still don't have drivers license and have dumb payments that I need to deal with every month which sets me back about 200€ a month which I could use for... Anything else. There is lyrics in one song - ""you got to be happy alone to be happy together.""

How to be happy alone and restore trust to myself, so I can assure that I'm trustworthy. 

TL;DR - in every relationship I've hurt someone in one way or another. Can't be in new relationship, scared of hurting someone else.",25Oct2020,1

-He also once said that there are a lot of sexy bunnies around him but he isn't attracted to them referring to some women
- Blocked me a lot times in the past after arguments. After thess arguments he unblocked me apologising or i was trying to reach out for him
- defended his ex he isnt friends with when I called her slut
- was not available all day once and then i understood he was drunk on birthday party with other women also drunk (i saw video)

370,"I run a tiny gaming server on discord (about 200 people), we get 1/10 of that playing at the same time so it's really small. I wrote the rules out clearly, but as you suspect I doubt many people have read them, one of the rules is that there is to be no homo- or transphobia.

I have been enjoying playing with the same people, and overall it's been ok, but I'm not great at setting boundaries and I want to avoid bottling this up until it gets to the point where I don't handle it professionally. I also want to have people to play games with and I'm worried that if I don't handle this correctly I'll lose my teams.

Well I'm NB, and some members of my server have started using words I find hurtful. Not expressing homophobic sentiments but saying things like ""pink is a bent colour"" and one called another (of course jokingly) a faggot. Well I was there and it spooked me and I didn't react and a friend (cis-het friend) is saying I'm overreacting and I'm gonna kill the server with my expectation of everyone being perfect.

I don't really want those people to be perfect, and of course it's all ""jokes"" but Ive studied hate speech and I know jokes betray people's worldview and what they deem appropriate. I know that if I'm to speak to them I shouldn't do it on the voice call, but that's all.

373,"I am a 26 year old female programmer with 3 years experience. I work in a company in Eastern Europe that pays me pretty good but I am very depressed here. In the past two months, a series of bad events that happened to me made me feel like I am now unable to concentrare and I am stupid.
I had corona, I had pneumonia, yet I worked every day because due to a chaotic medical system I couldn’t take sick days. A friend died unexpectedly in a car crash, then a week later my grandpa gets corona and passes away.  All of this while I was isolated for a month. 
I started to make mistakes at work, (we dont have enough programmers for our project, some of them quit and we can’t change delivery time estimations now) I did ot almost every weekend or after work to try to finish things on time, yet we failed sprints. 
I was found ‘guilty’ of these errors and I am constantly reminded that. My manager kind of understands me, but the fact that my colleagues complained behind my back gives me this feeling that maybe I don’t belong here. On top of that, every time I asked a superior questions, he either starts to yell or swear at me because I don’t know things or he just ignores me and then tries to humiliate me in meetings with everyone saying that I’m lazy or not capable of work.
At this point, my self-esteem is awful, I feel extremly insecure and stupid, like I could never get a job and I am so worried about money.
I have savings to live ok for 3-4 months and I was thinking to spend all December getting my shit together, repeat all technologies, start a course, maybe get a certification, something that can boost up my confidence. I also want to try to move to Netherlands with my bf but in this case money might not be enough. 
I am just so stressed, every day I get up with the worst feeling that I have to work again to this job that I should never make mistakes,  cause team is ‘watching’ me but at the same time what if it’s my only option?

M took the baby in immediately. He told me that he was going to adopt the baby and if wasn't comfortable with it for any reason I was welcome to leave. He giving me an out basically. I told him I had no problem with it and I'd be happy to see the baby girl in a loving home like his. They hadn't named the baby before they died so I suggested M to name the baby after his sister, D, and he agreed. Now D is an absolutely beautiful little girl and I am in love with her.

We got a kitten some weeks ago. From childhood I love cats so I fell in love with him as soon as I laid my eyes on him. My mom also was very happy, she stopped crying every night. She always compare our new cat's behavior to our late cat's one.

As time goes by, our kitten get closer to me. He spend the day laying next to me while I do my things, he seek me to ask me food and water and sometimes even refuse to eat until I crouch next to him and watch him or let him, when my mom puts him in her lap he gets up and lay in mine instead. At first she tried to revert the situation, like giving him tasty food and don't letting me do it even if he asks. But it didn't work. And now she gets mad at me because the kitten likes me more for exemple speaking as if I took the cat out if her lap myself and put it on mine when he actually came by himself.

It's understandable. She just lost her loved cat and out of our 3 other cats 2 show a favouritism to me. But I don't know how to proceed.

380,"Starting off I want to say that I hate the thought of leaving him because he’s so amazing and kind and I don’t think I will ever find anyone else who is more suited to me than he is with everything apart from sex. I love him so much and the thought of us breaking up kills me but for about a year and half now sex has been a huge problem. For me sex and being intimate is so important in a relationship. When we aren’t intimate I feel so down and like I’m not attractive or good enough and I’m so tired of going to bed every night wondering if he’s going to touch me or not and then I hear him snoring so I know another night I have to go to sleep feeling those same feelings. 

I have calmly spoken to him so many times about my feelings and then we usually have sex once or maybe a few times in a week but then it goes back to normal again. He tells me that he does want me but then he never shows me. At one point all my advances were getting turned down for reasons like he was too tired or he had toothache and things like that which I understand but when it started to be every single night and he was always fine up until we got into bed. I stopped making advances and told him whenever he’s in the mood to let me know to prevent me from being turned down. Even to masturbate together was something..

I’ve tried to make myself look good and wear sexy clothes but he doesn’t even notice. I’ve tried suggesting new things or asking if there’s anything he wants to try, I’ve tried to ignore it and just masturbate on my own to try and stop me from thinking about it but it’s just boring on my own when I really want him. I’ve tried to compromise by asking if he would be happy to have sex once or twice a week when really I would do it twice a day if I could, I’ve tried to be spontaneous and make advances randomly but I usually get turned down or end up just giving him a blow job and I’m left frustrated and unwanted again. 

My ex was very abusive to me and he used sex and lack of intimacy to punish me for years and I feel that doesn’t help with my feelings towards the situation. 
 
I want to spend my life with him but I know there’s going to be no change in our sex life and it’s really knocked my self esteem so much. I just don’t know what to do it’s really messing with my sanity and affecting how I feel about myself. I would never cheat on him because I have too much respect for him and he really has been such an amazing boyfriend. Couples therapy isn’t an option right now otherwise I would give it a try.",25Oct2020,1

Every time I mention a problem they just tell me ""well I can't do anything about it"" and just ignore me. And tbh even if they do listen to me the problem I wanna talk about is really just embarrassing to me and I can't bring myself to talk about it with someone irl that knows me personally. So here I go: I know people might call me a creep or a perv but I don't even know why this happens to me, every time a girl talks to me, hugs me or mentions me in a good way, well...I kinda start having sexual thoughts. Maybe that's because I've never talked to a girl or dated one but this bothers me, I'll just be chilling, a girl talks to me and boom I'm turned on and I have a boner. The only thing I wanna ask is is it normal? Or am I actually a bad person/a creep?

I’ve loved meeting the people I have and certain experiences but I don’t feel security within the field. 

My intention is to go into childcare as within 12 months I can have a secure income. 

This links to my living situation. I desperately need to move out. My mother is a raging alcoholic and my father may as well be absent. I’m unemployed but actively seeking full time employment but i do have 5K savings. 

I just need some advice and/or a push, i suppose. 

I have 2 friends (who ive known for years and occasionally take trips together) who have moved out recently and they have a spare room (sometimes their bro crashes there tho) and part of me wants to reach out and see if theyd accept me in until i find my feet. 
Im happy to pay rent of course but im anxious to ask cause i dont wanna be a burden. Plus if i do enrol to study, i may be eligible for gov study allowance which would help me pay for living expenses. 

should i ask my friends or just suffer and wait to move out when i get a secure income?? If you were the friends, would you feel burdened/like you had to help? Cause i dont want to force my issues on their freedom basically.

I assume they're Pakistani. First, because some of their profile pictures contain people that seem like Indians. Second, because many of them send me ""aswrb"" or something of note, which I assume means al salam 3alaykum which is the common muslim greeting. Third, two of the profile pictures contain girls with hijabs.


I receive a message from a random number about once a week. So far it's 10 people. And one time I was even included to a group that contained about 20. I tried talking with them sometimes but they always leave me on read. One time I found a person who answered and they only had enough english to tell me they dont understand english.


Also all their phone numbers contain country codes from Oman, Yemen, and UAE. I'm guessing they're expats. Also they probably speak Urdu or Sanskrit but with latin letters so I cant use google translate. I tried using google translate once to speak with them but it didn't seem to work.


Ngl, I'm kinda curious as to what is happening. Usually what I do block and report them if they dont answer my message. But this time a number sent a voice note that I really wanna hear but I hesitate to download because it might contain a virus.

393,"I am 13, my brother is 17.

since from what i can remember, he was the favorite one, be broke something, be blamed it on me, bc he was older, my mom believed him and i was punished.

Later on, he started beating me up, my mom only punished me, bc he was older and ""he could be more trusted"", and she kept saying that i was lying about him beating me up.

When I was big enough to defend myself from him, he started to disconnect internet from me, my mom didnt believe me that he was disconnecting me, and i got a bunch of bad grades in school bc i had homework online, after i showed evidence to my mom and step-dad, they finally believed my and told him nicely to turn on the wifi for me, 11days of no wifi and i was in trouble for getting bad grades.

My step-dad also favors him more than me, my step-dad yells at me, bc i dont like eating mushrooms and beans, but my brothers diet is coffee, and junk food with pasta, he doesnt give him shit for that, his diet is coffee and trash for 5years, how is he still alive is a mystery. 

And the chores are divided with me and my brother, but he kept complaining about him doing more chores than me, so we made a list of the chores, on the trash list, he kept putting random dates when he didn't threw out the trash, it was pretty blatant, bc he wrote that the threw out the trash on the 21, when it was the 17.

Other chores like cleaning, he also wasn't fair with those, the same situation like with the trash one.

I told my mom and step-dad about how unfair it was, he wrote down random dates, and i had to make up the differents by cleaning the kitchen 5times in a row, while he sat on his ass playing league and complaining like a old babushka, but they only said that we should deal with this ourselves ""like adults"".

I want to know, what to do in this situation, my brother has done a lot more, like constantly stealing from me, and when i tell my mom about it, she jest jokes around about it, i got angry once, bc he stole 10EUR from me, i told my mom, she did nothing, and my step-dad started to yell at me and call me spoiled.

I am jest thinking what the fuck to do here, to tell the things my brother has done to me, and how my mom and step-dad favores my brother more.

I’m on mobile so please bare with me if there are any errors.

I got kicked out of my parents house. They got drunk one night and told me (demanded me) to give them some of my pain medicine, and when they started throwing up on themselves and I wanted to call the police, I was the bad guy. Then the next day when I told them all about it, they told me I was lying and that if I was going to be that way I could just leave. Living there also included countless nights of making sure they were in bed and sleeping on their sides because they were too drunk to do it themselves. They took my medication. They took my money. Then they would spend it on alcohol and drugs. We wouldn’t even have bread in the house. They enabled me from working, telling me it wasn’t worth it and they were the ones with the car so there wasn’t much I could do about it.
So I left and moved in with 3 other people. My friend and an engaged couple. I sleep in the living room with some curtains around my bed for some sort of privacy. I share a bathroom with my friend. Things were going okay, but now! It’s all really awful. The couple don’t clean up after themselves. They get on my ass about all the same stuff they do. They cry when I try to tell them I don’t like how they do that. They cry when I ask them to do their dishes. Then, they get extremely passive aggressive. They mumble comments to themselves and make sure I can hear them. It didn’t really bother me until they started telling me who I can and cannot have over. I pay rent and bills just as much as they do, but I feel like since I was taken in and I sleep in the living room, they feel like they have some jurisdiction over me. They eat my food. They don’t respect what little privacy I have by trying to talk to me when my curtains are closed (which I’ve told them before how when my curtains are closed I’d like it to be like my bedroom door is closed). But the worst is my friend. She and I have to work together because I don’t have a car, so she drives me to work sometimes. She’s made it very clear now how much of a burden I am on to her. If I miss when she goes to the grocery store, I have to wait until she goes again in a week or two. If she doesn’t get her way, she gets so mad she slams doors and even pauses the WiFi so no one can do anything. She’s called me trailer trash and an inconvenience (but says so in a joking manor. Still hurts). If she makes a mistake she will find ways to turn it around on me. Even if the first way doesn’t work she keeps looking for ways. It gets to the point where I just apologize so it tames the waters quicker. If you piss her off, she is a mastermind at getting in your head and finding little things to drive you crazy. And she has done so with everyone in this apartment! 
I’m at my breaking point. I’m actually past that. I’m broken. If I move back into my parents place I’m just moving backwards. But I have no where else to go. I have no car. Hardly any money. I really have literally no where else to go. I’ve considered hospitalizing myself just to get out of this place. I’ve considered being homeless and I’ve extensively thought of all the places I could sleep if I where. They’ve entirely broken me. I have no motivation to try to reason with them anymore. They have completely kicked me until I couldn’t get up.

403,"So note that I won't get into my past here fully or in detail but vaguely so you guys can get the idea because my past is way to long and to many things can get me in serious trouble (note those serious bad parts are only a part of what makes me not forgive myself the other part was how I treated others in the past and what I've done to feel that way).

So when I was a kid I was abused by my older brother mentally/physically/and emotionally (note were way better now but at times this still effects me more on that further on) for the period of 5 - 16 (to be honest it might be 6-16 or even 4-16 it's fuzzy back then since it's so long ago) he was my role model growing up as well of course my older brother so I looked up to him as well to me he was my father figure since our dad left (not in that way but for reasons that I will not say but note he does come back more further on), the abuse was horrible he never made me bleed or hit me hard enough to leave me bruised in exposed areas only hidden areas and it happened on the regular. He'd belittle me and abuse me (now knowing at this time out of anger) make me look up to him and depend on him I had no where to go but to him and if I stepped out of line of what he wanted me to do or he just felt like it or I did something he didn't like he'd beat me in front of my little brother or grandma it didn't matter he knew he scared them and they couldn't do anything.

But I had some sense still left I didn't let anyone else get involved I always took it full on at fear he'd hurt my grandma or my little brother I was scared during that first year of abuse I began having suicidal thoughts, during school when all this was happening I was a troubled kid I lashed out hurt myself hurt others no matter the sized of the kid I always started fights I ran from school I stole I stabbed a kid once ( not with a blade but with a pencil it didn't puncture thank god it was at the neck ) I was horrible and I wasn't good at home at my mom I'd lash out at her never listened (I never hit her tho) no matter what help she tried to get me It never worked (medications were a no go since she got me some and I just lied when they didn't work that they did) during all this at the voices began at first it was to cope with things but then they became awful and grew at first it was 1 by my fifth grade I had 6 they didn't talk at the same time they came and went sometimes at the same time multiple will talk but they changed every so often these voices have kept me up during those nights talking to me yelling at me.

Fats forward into middle school I began self harming myself in many ways to this day I still have scars I hid them well no one knew I did hard drugs and other stuff for money stuff I'm not happy about i skipped school had horrible grades just wasn't even trying I was a shit kid still I hurt people anyone who crossed me got hurt even for the stupidest reasons I was all over I still steal stuff at a much higher amount people avoided me calling me a dream I showed I didn't care by wearing a panda hat I didn't care but I grew tired of it I hanged out with the wrong crowd after school my attempts at committing suicide were 37 attempts none successful but I wasn't really putting my all into them I wanted to die but their was a piece of me left that still held on and the amount of voices in my head grew to 15 all were awful and my lack of sleep worsened especially when I began seeing things, all of this made me feel hopeless everyone hated me my family hated me the people in school hated me I was alone and I felt lonely I began in 8th grade to regret everything I did.

Fast forward again getting near the present I dropped the drugs it was hard but I was determined with my new resolution I made I wanted to be different I wanted to be me that was hiding since it started I couldn't apologize to anyone I did wrong they were gone and I had no way to contact them and my family didn't want to discuss it I was still being abused but for those years of highschool I was me I didn't get detention except once (stupid lack of sleep) the voices their were more now 27 talking and yelling at me every second I couldn't stop seeing them around me trying to get a reaction from me it was somewhat manageable at day, I had friends real friends they didn't know me from my past schools so it was a fresh new air and some other friends I made knew I went to the same middle school but never interacted with me I didn't get to a bad group my grades were splendid As and Bs and the occasional C's at mistakes everything seemed well but everything was still broken I still thought their was no future for me I only held so long because of my family but I was broken I still cut myself and more than at the past I got bit sloppy at hiding them but I still knew how to lie well.

The nights were awful with the voices keeping me up recounting everything I did seeing people I hurt in front of me screaming and I hated sleeping either way because every time I slept i had horrible night terrors just making me wake up anyway and I made myself a date in 10th grade I decided to finally commit to my suicide i made a suicide date multiple methods for that day in case I got cold feet for one of them and made sure if I went for it their was no going back I was set I was going to make my amends and leave but everything changed when I met my girlfriend.

Long story short we had horrible horrible pasts and we're going to commit suicide on the same day we knew something was up with each other when we first met so we went together to a dance before we could go to the dance we texted the week prior and had some stupid silly duck banter (don't ask because duck you) we got together and then 2 years of a fucking rollercoaster and our lives becoming so much better because of our support and helping each other thru the hell that tested our relationship were still together and everything is great but the voices the things I see the night terrors are still here my hate towards myself won't leave I don't want to die but I can't sleep they still scream at me and I still see them yell in pain I thought I left my past behind but I haven't and I don't know what to do the only time they leave is when I'm with my girlfriend or pull thru the night thinking about her and the good stuff that has happened it's difficult but if I try and try hard I might get a good night sleep unless if I'm with my girlfriend then we both sleep like rocks ( she also gets night terrors because of her past and has PTSD ) but I can't have here here always she lives with her family and I with mine so full contact isn't always their and I'm losing it again.

416,"I rarely reach out for advice, but I feel like my life's been coming to a significant crossroads and the amount of stress and anxiety I've been managing has been a lot to handle..so welcoming any feedback you might have..

To make a long story short, I'm 30 and have always struggled with anxiety/depression. I've learned to manage, and one of my most significant coping mechanisms (if you want to call it that) is basically working myself to an early grave. I've been employed full time since I was 16, and over the past ~4 years I've run a photography business (alongside my long term partner + now wife) with a reasonable level of success. I've maintained my current day job for ~6 years at a Fortune 500 corporation.

My aspiration for the past few years at least has been to take my photography business full time (side note: my wife is full time in it after a 7 year career as a graphic designer since May 2019). This year, thanks to coronavirus, our business took a hit but rebounded reasonably well enough. We currently have a good amount of revenue already expected next year, but there is still uncertainty as regulations can easily change thanks to growing case numbers. 

The hardest part for me this year is I had anticipated leaving my day job to pursue our business full time in March. With everything going on, I decided to stick it out (working remotely). I do this less for myself, and more to ensure my wife is kept safe and so on. Leaving the corporate job is hard due to the ""Golden Handcuffs"" of a cushy salary, health benefits, etc.

I've evaluated our finances like 1,000 times it feels, and we're unbelievably stable (and I am thankful for this). While we're not ""rich"" by any means, balancing my day job + our photo business has allowed us to save a significant amount over the years (current standings equates to about ~4 years worth of personal and business expenses for both my wife &amp; I if we didn't make more money). The money paired with our fairly simple lifestyle and most debts paid down (we paid off my car, and all of our students loans, carry no credit card debt - just have a mortgage and 1 car lease). 

When I write it out, or talk it over with my wife (or close family), I feel like I should be confident in leaving my day job to pursue this career I've worked hard to have for myself. It's hard for me as I'm very risk adverse (it's why I've accrued this much money in savings in the first place - rarely spending money for myself over at least 3 years or so), and again, it's less ""me"" and more knowing I have a family (my wife) to care for. I take that as one of my largest responsibilities and generally would often suffer to ensure at least financial stability for her. 

**The end goal I want:** be full time employed with my wife working for our own photography business. I care less about the money, and more about the time freedom this would offer me to set my own schedule during the week. I also feel this would allow me to dedicate more time to a healthier lifestyle (working out and eating better), something I hardly have time for due to working so much (almost every day is 12-16 hour work days for the past few years). 

**The challenges:** we operate our business primarily in the wedding sector. We've managed to charge a premium for these services, and they definitely comprise the largest revenue stream. With coronavirus regulations, it's largely impacted our wedding schedules, led to deferred income to next year, and has translated into actual financial losses. Still, we've managed this year and will be walking away from the year with a reasonable amount of profit - so all things considered (full shut down March-April), we've managed in an industry that is difficult right now. We've also maxed out our schedule for next year already (with price increases), so I already anticipate a lot of work (assuming our clients go through with their events).

i don't like to be honest with people but i'm gonna be honest with you, my own parents don't know me, not 1 person on this earth really knows me and how i feel, words just can't explain it. I started to go downhill when i was like 8 and since that point in my life i have progressively been struggling and slowly going downhill, i was always different to other people and knowing that i was different hurt, i can't open up to people, i feel trapped in a body and i don't even know myself, i feel like i was born with a disease bro and it has caused me nothing but pain in my life, even at a young age i was constantly trying to understand it and i never could, i've grown up as a quiet person that has never been able to explain myself to people, it has caused me so much sadness and honestly i'd kill myself if i had a loaded gun. i feel trapped and my feelings control me, i've never had an output to my emotions and thoughts, as i can't speak to people very well, so as i've grown up they've became somewhat loud in my head as u could imagine. feel traumatised since a young age, but it my problems were'nt others it was me, i've hated myself since i was extremely young and at the age of 20 still haven't accepeted my issues, i just can't. it's painful and that's why i will probably never stop taking drugs, unlike alot of other people who are depressed for a few years... i have always been this way and don't know what anything else is like apart from hating yourself and wishing u were different. my problems are deep routed and will never go away as they aren't problems that can, i will never probably walk away from drugs as i have nothing to cope, i've tried alot of things to help the way i feel and nothign has ever worked as there to strong in my head here people are wishing they were rich or famous or something special, and I'm just wishing i was a normal person, but even that i have never experinced, i know nothing but sadness and it's all i will probs ever know, i constantly distract myself and i feel that's my natural response to it, i try to do stuff to take my mind of things never being able to open up to another human being is the most painful thing i have ever experienced in my life and i pray to god i hope nobody else ever feels the way i do, and that's why i use drugs, they make me myself, i can be the version of myself that i wish i was, i can't actually be happy for once. i don't want to quit and honestly i don't care if drugs kill me and end my life, i will never walk away from them as i love them with everything in my heart bro, i'm nothing without them They are more precious than anything in this world to me, with them i can be myself, anyone who thinks i can just walk away really dosen't understand me they take the pain away",25Oct2020,1
418,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old teen trying to figure out what to do with a 4 year old boy acting so annoying (calling me names, refusing to comply with requests, etc). I've never had any interactions with this kid whatsoever up until now but he's already acting like a child spawned from hell itself. 

For more context, he's my nephew of sorts who just arrived with my grandmother at home and ruined our perfectly peaceful environment. He already acts like he owns the house and it's grinding on my gears.

I have anger issues and little to no patience for people acting so entitled regardless of age. I'm afraid that someday I'm gonna do something I'll regret doing to this kid that could possibly traumatize him and make the situation even worse once I actually snap. I don't want that to happen. I can't seem to separate him from myself either because he keeps on invading my personal space. Me and my sister tried locking him out of our room but he kept on banging on the door before starting to call us names and my blood honestly just started to boil so much that I almost went out and taught him a lesson.

Not only that but he'd take everything away from my niece and other nephew and even hit one of them when they tried to take their stuff back a while ago (we live close by to some relatives). Is there a way to deal with him that won't harm anybody or is my quarantine going to be a lot worse?",25Oct2020,1

420,"Yesterday I rented an Escooter (I live in the UK) as they have just been introduced as a trial in a town nearby me. 

I spotted them after coming out from lunch and as it was pouring of rain, I decided to give it a go to get to my car which was on the other side of town so I could get there quicker as I had no jacket. 

Quick sign up process, enter you name, take a photo of your driving licence and add a card and you're good to go. Scanned the QR code and I was off. 

After completing my ride I parked it and went home in my car. Simple...

I was interested to see where else they would be introducing them as I thought it was a good idea so a quick Google later and I found that it is illegal to ride on the pavements with them. 

I had no idea about this as it was not made clear AT ALL during the rental procedure and I had been through a pedestrian area that wasn't marked on the map as a 'no go' zone and I only rode on the pavements thinking this was how they were intended to be used. 

They are only slow and it seems dangerous to ride it on the road. 

Does anyone know if I will get in trouble for this? Like if I was being tracked by the rental companies GPS on the scooter or if a security camera picked me up? 

I genuinely didn't mean to do any wrong and I made sure to stay out of all of the 'no go' zones on the map. 

Just anxious now that I may get a fine or even points on my licence when it wasn't made clear to me that this was illegal to do. If you Google it, the rules are all over the place online saying different things for different areas and different rules for rented and private hire ones. I don't know if I'm going to get in trouble for something that was only an accident 😪",25Oct2020,1

423,"I moved into an apartment complex on August 1st, 2020. It has been a horrible experience. 

I was relocating to a new city for a job, and the first unit I was to move into smelled like cat piss. I could tell they tried to cover it up, but I told them I was not moving into that unit.

They find me another unit and I move in. The upstairs neighbors (2 adults, 1 toddler) were so heavy footed that they drove me crazy. They stomped around night and day. I put in multiple complaints over three weeks. I had to start living with a coworker and pay double rent because I couldn’t stand it anymore. The upstairs neighbors moved out after 5 weeks of living with my coworker.

I asked my property manager if I could take the upstairs unit to prevent the exact situation from happening again. They allow me to move upstairs.

I didn’t smell anything when I looked at the unit, but after I moved in I started to notice an indian food smell. It got worse and worse until the whole unit stank. I spent 10-15 hours cleaning and it didn’t fix it. The complex said they would do a 24 hour ozone treatment. The treatment is done and I’ve let the unit air out for 24 hours. My apartment still smells like ozone and some of my stuff (clothes, new mattress) have a leftover chemical smell that occurs when ozone is overdone. And the kicker - the curry smell is still in the cabinets and countertops. 

It’s been 3 months, I’ve tried 3 units. Would anybody else still try to make this unit work? Or should I write a letter by certified mail stating the reasons why I’m leaving and go. If they sue me or send me to collections, I feel I could defend myself in small claims court.

430,"Hi guys, I'm going through a rather rough time. My parents both have covid which means I most likely have it as well. But that's not the point of this post, o already made one for that stuff.

Let's start off with my parents. They have a favorite child. And they've told me right to my face. They have said multiple time that ""Your not the favorite child, Hailey is. That's why we give her more than you stupid.""

My dad is a very annoying person as well. He is constantly yelling af me for not understanding how to put a bed together, how to code on computers, among other things. He is probably the worst because he has this crazy dream that I will become rich off of a technology business. I hate technology, and I am more interested in law. What sucks worse is that my brother, is in to technology, which means I must magically be into that stuff as well.

My siblings are straight shit. 

I'm 13, my oldest sister is 25, so I understand that there will be conflict but she is toxic as well. She uses her age to make an excuse to never talk to me, and when she does, I'm not allowed to respond because its ""grown up things"" yes, because wanting to buy animal crossing is very grown up.

The favorite child is constantly using me as well. We will call her Sarah. Sarah is constantly asking for 100s of dollars from my parents, but when I want 5 dollars for ice cream, that is the most horrific thing I could ask my parents. Sarah also uses her favorite child status against me as well. I always tell her to please stop yelling at me after I pet the dog, and she just says ""this is why your not the favorite, your such a bitch and mom and dad hate you and wanna kill you."" After she says that I usually go to my bed and cry, but I'm a 13 year old MAN, so I cant cry in front of my parents. Sarah also yells at me to toughen up buttercup, and yells at me for crying. She then goes and follows all those feminist Instagram pages that say men can cry, just not as much as girls. Toxic femininity exists.

I know yall are probably going to get mad at me for being such a brat, and I'm guessing these things are normal, but it is literally non stop toxicity. Any advice on how to deal with this? I would ask for the school therapist but they always no matter what send a report home to the parents once a week, and if my parents figure out, they will yell at me for not being a man. Please help.

431,"English isn't my first language so I apologise for any mistake.
So I'm 18. For a little background my parents are lazy af and they only want to live a luxury life without doing anything. Since I was a like maybe 14 years old they've pressured me to work to provide them with money. Now my dad and I don't talk bc he used to abuse my mom when I was a child and we even caught him cheating. We had to be homeless due to his affair. It has scarred me for life while my mother has forgiven him. Still he always wants me to work for them and will physically harm me if I do something which he doesn't approves of.
 Now they don't have a stable job and we live on rent. The reason why my dad can't stick to one job is his ego and he wants everything nice and can't stand if someone says anything against him and my mom is just lazy.   
They do not even care about me tbh she never cooks food on time for us. I never had a lunchbox since my childhood and my education fees are a burden to them whilst my sister will thorw a fit and she'll get nearly everything ( even if they have to borrow money from someone). All my life they have been mentally abusing me. My little sister (10y/o) too calls me names and talks shit on my face.
They literally tortured me to give them money since they couldn't pay bills due to covid when I had only sufficient to pay for my uni. My uncle and grandmother who were on their side literally asked me not to set foot in their house until i helped them out and my parents they asked me to pack my things and get out of their house.  they literally packed my shit and threw it out of the house on something so petty I can't remember 2 years ago. 
I want to move out but I can't bc I don't have a job and I want to complete my uni which will take 2 years since now. 
So the thing is yesterday my dad brought me a job offer to help them out. my mom later told me on which I refused and she asked me to get out of the house if I can't help them. Now I'm stuck and can't decide on what to do. My parents and my uncle and grandmother will abuse the hell Outta me if I don't do as they desire and honestly it's damaging my mental health. I don't want to give them a single penny on how they treated me my whole life. They've literally birthed me so I can earn for them. My mom is waiting for the day where she will just lay around the house making shitty tiktoks while I'll earn good and hire a maid for house work. I would appreciate an advice on how I could get out of this situation.

If i vompare my football skills from a couple of years back to now. It would be from a 100 to 10. Also, i smoke. That doesn't help my lungs either. I just got into college on a scholarship even though my high school grades were very crap(70%). In college i was given my student portal late, so i couldnt pick my first semester courses. Which resulted in me starting my first semester 4 weeks late and with subjects that i hated. All my scores in my subjects are 50 to 60 and i needed to drop one of my subject. Turns out i cant even do that cause im an international student and have to get rid of my holds first. There is a meeting about these holds on the 28th of oct and the final date to drop subjects is on 30th of oct. So im basically fucked. Oh and also due to the college not giving me my portal early, i couldnt even select my major course this semster. I usually play ps4 and most of the games i play, im not good at. Screw videogames, take any indoor game like say chess. Recently i got back into chess and became really interested in it. To the point where my whole youtube recommended is filled with chess videos. I decided to play my dad who is reallllly bad at chess. Guess what happened? I lost. Not the first time, the 5th time. He plays all the bad moves but i still lose. I also produce music. I have a youtube channel and im self taught. But guess what? I barely get views and the only video that got over 1k views was probably because of the youtube algorithm and the number of tags i put in my video. I dont even look good and lack self confidence.

436,"I got drunk recently, or recently enough, and ended up going back to another guy's house. No, not in that way. He was an old friend of mine, who I had slept with before but then continued a friendship with for a few months. We drifted for various reasons, different lifestyles, didn't make my boyfriend very comfortable, etc. (please no shaming directed towards the boyfriend for being ""controlling""). 

Recently he showed up, unexpectedly, at an event I was at. Throughout the night I got drunker and drunker and before I knew it it was late, all my other friends had gone, and I had no phone. I tried looking for a charger but no luck, and I don't have anyones phone numbers memorised. He was the only one left. I asked him to share an uber, but he was training home and I didn't want to be left alone in the middle of the city (a 'dodgy' part of the city at that). So, I crashed at his house. I slept on a yoga mat on the floor with a pillow and a blanket and absolutely nothing happened that night. I told my boyfriend about it, which he wasn't happy about and he's unsure about wether or not I cheated. A lot of his friends though, and some of mine, hold the opinion that I cheated as well. There's no way for anyone to know for certain what happened. 

Is what happened just as bad as if I had cheated? Is it just as morally wrong? I want to say no, bc surely cheating is worse than not. But if I did cheat, I feel the outcome would be the same. My boyfriend would be hurt in the same way so, was it just as bad? 

TL;DR slept at another guy's house, with totally unromantic non sexual intensions, didn't cheat (at all) but everyone still thinks I did and there's no way to prove otherwise. Is it just as bad as if I had actually cheated?",25Oct2020,1
437,"I literally can't find a job. I just graduated from college in May during the COVID pandemic with a BS in Biology and a minor in Math and I've been struggling to find a job in my field.

I graduated with about a 3.3 GPA and a 3.2 Science GPA. I definitely could have done better than that so I'm kinda kicking myself now but it's whatever I guess. I haven't been able to find jobs due to a combination of being self conscious about my GPA, being depressed from getting stuck in quarantine, and the fact that there really aren't that many jobs available where I live. I live in Rhode Island, which in my opinion has a terrible job market, even before the pandemic.

Plus, I never got my driver's license when I was in high school and I was planning on getting it after college. I've practiced over the summer, failed the test in August (they changed the entire test due to COVID and everyone has to parallel park in an enclosed space, which I couldn't accomplish) and then the DMV didn't have any new appointments until November, and I still need to buy a car afterwards. Transportation is really bugging me because even if I get a job, I won't be able to GO anywhere. Carpooling is technically an option but I'm trying to move out of the house because I can't stand living here.  I live with my parents; dad works the night shift and mom works a day job. Also, mom has to take my brother to school and she has a major bad habit of being late - there were plenty of times in high school when she would be hours late to pick me up. She's just not a reliable source of transportation. Even if she was, it'd have to be very close to where she worked because she would not have the wherewithal to drive me to work if it was a half hour from where she worked; it'd basically require us to get up at 4:30 or 5 in the morning if it were a morning job. Plus I just really don't want to drive with them.

I just don't have the patience and energy to search for jobs that hardly exist! I tried to sit down this morning and intended to grind all day looking and applying for anything I can, but I could only get through about an hour or two's worth of work before I got too frustrated and got a bad migraine and had to lay down because of all the stress. I'm not really the kind of person who can't handle stress from work, but jeez this really stresses me out. Even when I looked for jobs in the summer (with what little effort I could), it was pretty clear I just wasn't going to be able to find the job I want in this state.

The only jobs that are available in my field say something along the lines of ""1-2 years experience minimum,"" which really rules out almost everything. I feel like there's just nothing here if you don't have a master's at the bear minimum. Even with that you still need to have experience in the field. I've hardly found anything that takes entry level candidates. If there's anything that fits my description, it's either much too far away (as in over an hour's drive away) or it isn't relevant to my major (like a McDonalds worker, for instance). Now, I guess I could just suck it up and get a job that's not related to my field at all, but I want something that's going to advance my career, like a lab technician or a scribe. I want to go back to school eventually and get a PhD.

What's taunting me is the fact that there are many more jobs that sound interesting that fits my description in other states, but I can't get a job in Maryland or California. If I had the funds to move there, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'm living with my parents even though I don't want to and I'm collecting unemployment from the state, which isn't much ($160 per week) and I didn't realize I was eligible until September. My friend is telling me to call the the unemployment office and ask for back payment from the summer months, which I've been hesitating to do because who knows.

440,"My birthday is on November 15th. I look forward to it every year, who wouldn't after 2020? I go to this farm2table chain 5-star restaurant, order an aged merlot, open gifts, get to be the centre of attention.  Then, around holiday/birthday season where all 7 members of my family have birthdays between August and January, and there's Thanksgiving and Christmas, I remember why I rarely participate in the family and decide I don't want one, then get suckered into one anyway. I've spent the last five years in a big city by myself, and now for some reason 5 of my 7 immediate family members have moved here. So, if a birthday happens it will be massive.

In my family I'm the black sheep, read my post from 4-7 months ago to hear more about that if you want; Essentially, I'm the black sheep. My siblings, though they try to socialize with me for my mom's sake, put up subconsious walls that no amount of good will can break through. One sibling spends the entire time I'm calling screaming ""BULLSHIT!"" even after I produce reputable sources and tells me I'm a liar----yesterday, they called an emmy-award winning journalist who's worked for most of the major papers ""some internet rando"" to call BS on me. 

My other sibling isn't as bad, she's clearly trying, and always asks if I want to tag along but, those walls are still there, she's still cold around me. It's only with my family that I'm the autistic (which I really am) inept social-lepur. Any random person I meet I can just naturally chat and laugh with for hours, and get called charming, right-on or a great listener. I was a degenerate waster, hanging out with crack-heads and deviants as a teen, could you blame me? As an adult, I'm an accomplished civil engineering student, 3.6 GPA and I'm just chill, down for whatever, never complain, never say anything derogatory.

My mom is going to be devistated if she can't throw me any party, she's the reason I rejoined this side of family for major holidays. We had the rockiest of starts, as a kid, back when mental health was really looked down on, my mom had unmedicated bipolar, a condition she passed to me; we'd get into violent screaming matches until we'd shouted into the early morning hours so much our throats were too bloody to shout anymore. Then, when I was a preteen, she had a series of loser boyfriends, one used to tell her to take me out to fancy lunches and then blackmail me into doing housework that I would have done for free if they'd asked. She was also pretty bad at this point, so bad I cut her out of my life until age 21. We've since made up and both centred ourselves. She and her new husband are the ones I'm closest to and it'll break her heart for me to demand no birthday, no cake, no dinner, no presents. But I seriously don't want them.

There were times where my family felt I didn't deserve a Christmas or Birthdays as a kid, and I was really, truly happy, then they'd f\*\*k it all up by surprising me with gifts anyway and demanding I join them for Christmas gift opening.",25Oct2020,1

When I was a lot younger a few not so nice things happened to myself (I wont go into detail) and they have impacted on my life and caused me to distrust everyone, especially men. 

I never though I would find anyone. That was until I met my now ex. 
I had an instant connection with him when we met, I didnt feel scared. I'd got it right this time

After a few dates he told me some things about him, he trusted me enough to tell me. I was falling for him from that second. I told him everything about me and I expected him to run
Not long after he told me he loved me. He felt the same way as I did. We agreed that nothing would come between us and if either of us done something wrong we would sort it
From then on I was always with him and I'd stay at his
In the beginning he wouldnt let me pay for anything or help with housework. I'd offer but he would always say no. Eventually he let me help with dishes etc. He would offer food but I'd say no, he would say 'if you dont eat then I'm not going to' so I would agree to eat. 
Hed turn down my tobacco because he didnt like it and insist I use his

Almost a week ago it all changed. There was an atmosphere between us, I thought he was having a bad day. I was too scared to ask. I couldnt sleep and spent the whole night on the sofa trying to work out what I'd done wrong. I'd convinced myself I had done something bad. I was hoping when he woke up he would have told me, I came home that day 
I let him know when I was home, said I'd see him tomorrow and I love him. The reply was pretty much the same, saying he loved me too
The following day when I was in work I text him to ask if we was ok as I was feeling like I'd done something wrong. He said dont worry and he would like a night on his own, I was fine with that, for the next few hours it was like it was back to normal

Until later in the evening. He text and said he thought I was only with him because he makes me food, use his tobacco and I dont do housework for him
Which isnt true
I was going to transfer him money last month without him knowing, he wouldn't accept it and would have talked me out of it. Unfortunately I was down on money by a few hundred and I couldnt afford to. It was costing me about £40 a week just going to his and home. I was going to transfer some this month and tell him after
I tried to explaining what I was intending on doing and why I didn't tell him, and that I didnt realise that's how it looked to him, if he had said something I'd have told him earlier. We are now over because of it. 
I feel like it's my fault because I should have realised what he was thinking.",25Oct2020,1
442,"I feel like an ungrateful b-word for writing this. I will have been with the guy I met the first day of college, TWO YEARS next week. He is sweet, always wants to see me, calls me everyday we can't meet up, we have so many inside jokes/codewords and little routines. My doubts only started a few months ago and I feel sick with guilt over them at times. I was almost certain I wanted to be with him *forever* within a few months of dating. Now I'm not sure? 

I have a tendancy to focus on all his flaws. For example, he used to only brush his teeth half the time in the morning until I started reminding him *everyday* the third month we were dating. I sounded like my mom. He also hasn't flossed in years (idk how his teeth manage to look so white?). His diet is really terrible, he eats one big meal at like 4-6pm, its almost always chicken nuggets and pasta or pizza. He'll just snack on biscuits or chips or order fast food at like 10pm if he's still hungry. He has gained quite a lot of weight in the last year. He still has that beautiful face but I miss his fit body. He is naturally a hairy dude and that's perfectly fine, but for the last year, he let's his stubble grow for a week or 2 sometimes and it scratches the crap out of me. He is a really attractive guy but it's like he is letting himself go.

 He also has untreated mental health issues that make my life really hard at times and he insists he'll get better in his own time. He can be fine mentally for 4 or 5 months but it always comes back. The guys loves and adores me so I feel terrible for being such a b-word. What's worse is I've always been very monogamous. Like even as a single teen, if I had a crush on someone who didn't even return my feelings, I never noticed anyone else. So me having dreams of flirting with or cuddling guys I've never met or guys I know is extremely out of character. I see TV shows and films where characters met and suddenly I think ""I'll never feel the rush of excitement ever again and I'm only 21"".

445,"Hello everybody, I need some advice. My wife and I have been together for 10 years, she needs to sleep in a cold bedroom at night, mostly due to hot flashes. When I say cold, I mean cold. Last night it was -1 degree in our bedroom. My tolerance to cold is low. I am sleeping in a t-shirt, track pants, and a hoodie. There is a sheet, a blanket, a comforter, and another fleece blanket on top of me. I am still cold. I wake up with my lungs hurting, full of cold air all night. I get nosebleeds from the dry air. Last night, I put my foot down oh, and told her I can no longer do this. For 10 years I have been freezing cold at night. She suggested that we buy heated blanket for me. Although that sounds like a possibility, that will not stop the cold air from hitting my face, or from breathing the cold air into my lungs. I literally wake up with a sore chest every morning. She is not willing to compromise, she wants the window open and that is it. I told her that I will go set up a spare bedroom and sleep there during the cold months. That is not what I want to do, but at this point, I can't figure out another Direction. Now she is angry at me and calling me her roommate. I have been very tolerant, patient, and understanding about her need for cold air for 10 years. Finally when I put my foot down and tell her I can't take it any longer, I am being unreasonable, and damaging the marriage. So, I need some advice from people outside my marriage. Am I being unreasonable, is there any advice anybody else can give me that I haven't already thought of. Should I just try an electric blanket and shut up? Thanks for any feedback.",25Oct2020,1
446,"I'd rather not share all the details.

Let it be enough that I know perfectly well when I'm to blame - I am aware of the fact that I have anger issues.

However, I also managed to get immensely better at this issue and now I'm realising when I'm not acting outrageously. I am not getting pissed off as much (waaay less tbh) and I let a lot of crap slide. 

Still, whenever shit hits the fan, I'm the bad guy. If I have a problem I'm suddenly ""too old to have mental health issues"" or I ""have to work on my anger more"" - even when I wasn't even angry, just raised a counterpoint. 

At the end of the day, mainly my mother always concludes that she's never wrong and I'm always. She never messed anything up but I must work on myself. All the while she shits on working on herself. Also, me not trusting her is also my fault for some reason - doesn't matter she gave enough reasons not to trust her.

I'd like some advice on how to endure such a person. I'm leaving as soon as I can so I don't want to mend relationships. I'm over that point. I just want to ignore this crap until I leave because right now I'm starting to think I'm paranoid despite my own brother and even his GF (who doesn't really like me) told me that our mom always seem to try to have a go at me more than anyone else here.

So the party is at C's House and he invited me and everything was fine, until J texted S that he and everyone of his friends(which are the majority and including S and P) wont come to the party if A comes. S told this C and C first said that its his party and that he is deciding who will come and who wont come, but when S said that nobody will come then if A comes, he decided that he wont allow A to come.
A talked with J in Discord and J told A that he is allowed and everything is fine but later he texted S to tell C that he doesnt want A to go to the party.
Some time later and like a week before the party, C told me that im also not allowed to come and he didnt even give me a reason. So i didnt go there.

454,"Some back story: I started my career in banking 3 years ago. It was easy and I worked my way up to a teller supervisor within 2 years. I worked hard for that position at a branch I really wanted to be at. The pay was okay and the PTO was only 2 weeks but I had a 45 minute commute. A small credit union down the street from my house had a teller supervisor position open up and I applied and got the job. It had significantly more perks as well as a 2 minute commute which was the main reason I left. The first bank I worked for offered me most of the same perks to stay with them but again I denied because of the commute. 

Fast forward to now and I’ve been let go. I won’t get into the details. I enjoy banking but there aren’t a lot of open positions in my area. There is an open position with the company and branch that I left and I want to go back but I’m so embarrassed. I thought the grass was greener on the other side and it just wasn’t.

About my sister - uh, she does not work, all what she does is just watching netflix and browsing twitter or snapchat outside of eating and sleeping. So she's basically a leech here.

460,"I’m taking a university course in which I have been working on a research paper that we have been assigned since day 1. I have up until this point aced all my other papers and rough drafts.

I passed in the final paper a couple weeks ago and I was surprised when I received no grade but rather a block of comments. My professor said the paper was “a stretch” when it came to the main point, which confused me as he had been complimenting my papers all along the way. He then tears me a new one for lack of a bibliography for my cited works. The problem: my bibliography is very clearly at the end of the paper.

To his credit, he gave me a second chance to add a bibliography with no penalty to the paper within 24 hours. Since the bibliography is already there, I can’t add it again but I’d like to temper the idea to fit what he thinks is less of a stretch. However such a short window doesn’t allow me much time for communication with him as he’s unlikely to answer on a weekend.

If I point out my bibliography was there the whole time, I feel he might penalize me as I pointed out his mistake. If I don’t point it out, he might miss it again and my grade will be penalized. If I alter the idea, he may penalize me for taking advantage of the opportunity he gave me for changing something else. If I don’t alter the idea, my grade will certainly be lower.

I've been facing this sort of problem since she was 3, and I find it more and more difficult to tolerate her. She tends to be really hyperactive pretty much the entire day and tends to mess around with me and my stuff (aka ""being a kid""). 

I find this to be increasingly frustrating, as the more I ask her to stop, the more she does things (ex. grabbing stuff off my desk and running away, sitting on my chair while I'm working so I can't sit down, etc.) I have tried multiple strategies to get her to leave me alone, like asking her nicely, scolding her, getting my parents to ask her, etc. Usually that last option works, but it only happens once my parents get mad at me for ""running my mouth"" out of frustration.

Multiple people have already told me: All I really need to do is spend time with her and give her the attention she's looking for. However, I find that difficult to do. Ever since I was young, I am someone that doesn't like children. I don't like playing pretend with them, I don't like doing chores surrounding them, I don't like having them around in general. I tend to enjoy the company of people older than me, or being alone more than being with younger people. On top of that, whenever she asks for attention, she tends to never want me going back to whatever I was doing before hand. She usually wants me to stay by her side the entire day, playing with her and whatnot. I've also been told that she does this because she looks up to me, but no matter how fuzzy it makes me feel, it doesn't seem to overpower me not wanting to spend time with her.

I do in fact love my sister however. Should there come a need, I am willing to give my life for her. I am willing to work and pay for things she likes, like tuition, toys, food, whatever. I used to buy her sweets everyday when I was able to go out, but due to COVID, I am stuck here at home all day. However, I just cannot seem to like having her around.

I've been called many things because of this: Asshole, selfish, childish, etc. And I agree to an extent. I put extra care into my time, and it frustrates me that her asking for my attention disrupts my day.

I am unsure of what I need to do. I feel like this is an extremely niche problem since 1. Siblings with large age gaps are uncommon, and 2. The older siblings in these kinds of relationships tend to fawn over the younger one. I apologize for the wall of text, but I really need some advice on it.",25Oct2020,1
465," 

So,   i'll begin this conversation by saying i'm currently under theraphy to   solve some problems, and mostly, to see if I am an autist or not - I   have my reasons for that suspicion. Lack of hand coordination, problems   to interact with people, 'awkwardness', restricted interests, etc. This   matters, but not that much.

The   main issue is: I have set my objective for my career to be employed in a   big company in the next five years. Multinational companies. I've been   failing hard on these rational tests - because they have these weird   figures with patterns you have to figure out. I have been sucessful - to   the point of passing the tests and doing a pre-recorded interview with   myself answering questions - in two trainee program processes.

Last   year i've been sucessful enough in three big company internship   programs - more than 10,000 people tried to join - I went to the final   part. Didn't get hired, but it was a feat that all of the recruiters in   the companies told us we could be proud of. And I know I am. that  proves  i've got real value. But i'm full of uncertainity. How can I, a  'weird'  kid, can compete with normal people that can express themselves   properly? How can I, an engineer, fail to do basic 'engineer' things   like soldering wires and other physical tasks?

I'm   in Brazil, but if I wanted to join the armed forces in the US -  another  option for someone with a degree like me - i'd need a medical  waiver  because I am very sure i'd be disqualified for my autistic  symptoms. If I  can't join a company because I fail the tests/can't pass  through the  behavioral elements of the interviews, and I can't join  the public  service because of these behavioral problems of mine, what  will I do,  then? Become a Uber driver for the rest of my life? I look  forward to  hear from you all your two cents. Thanks.",25Oct2020,1

Their family has a strong culture of traditional family hierarchy, and being the oldest man in the house, his brother holds ‘power’ over my partner. It’s very psychological. His brother has done some seriously fucked up things in the past, including beating and raping women and men though it’s never been taken up with the police - he is especially violent when he’s drunk and tonight he’s very drunk. I hardly ever talk to him because I’m pretty anxious around him and he’s just generally an asshole. 

My partner started violently vomiting and shaking a few hours ago, and because of some ongoing illness I called the ambulance. His brother heard the ruckus and came into the room. knowing my partner didn’t want him in there, I asked him to leave. Instantly he started threatening me, because it’s unacceptable to talk to him like that. He refused to leave and I got triggered, told him to get the fuck out, he didn’t, just kept toying with and making subtle threats at me with this psycho drunk smile, not at all concerned about what was going on. Literally in the nick of time the ambulance people arrived, I thought he was going to ring my neck.

We are currently in the hospital, my partner is probably going to be ok, we mostly only came here with the ambulance because my partner doesn’t know if he would be able to protect me if his brother tried anything.

Adam smith, I think, was the one that proposed that someone will always have a comparative advantage in something and thus should specialize in that thing and then trade for all other goods that it needs(with some shifting in the future). I'm kind of thinking that this is something that would be best even on a small scale, but its often hard to imagine what kind of ""goods"" can be traded in small work places like a texas roadhouse or something. Like bussing tables? idk. But it made me think of this. I was wondering what kind of examples you all might have for trade, or if you have specialized in some given thing and used it as your trading tool. Theoretically, everyone should have something they can trade if the comparative advantage always exists between two parties. I guess it's just hard to find.",25Oct2020,1

Their problem was my father kept drinking whenever they went to their friends, and whenever he got home,he would be always wary and paranoid avout everything my mom would do.

I pushed my dad when it looked like he was dpojg something to my mom, and he looked suprised.

I just can't do this anymore. Whenever they fight, I always get anxious and think about what will my dad hurt my mom, and I always try to find strength to fight back if he ever does but I'm weak.

478,"Hi! Sorry in advance if I make any mistakes, as this is my first Reddit post. 

I (18F) faint pretty frequently, like once or twice every week (or more). The thing is, I've never been worried about it. Sure, it is annoying to have to figure out the best places to sit/lie down every time I enter a room, and it certainly is embarrassing when it suddenly happens in the middle of a store or a public place. However, I only collapse for around 3 seconds each time, and the affects (nausea, sweating, ear ringing) generally last for a minute or two. Afterwards, I bounce back and continue whatever I was doing as if nothing had happened at all. Even though I started fainting over a year ago, I decided to ask about it now because I recently moved across the country for college, and my parents are nervous that something may go wrong while they are not around to help me. Although I am grateful to have parents that support me, I have been able to manage myself perfectly fine for the past year, and nothing about my condition has changed. Not only that, but this would not be the first time I have asked a doctor for help. The previous two times I have been to the doctor for advice and explained the problem, I got the same ""you're a teenager, it's just your hormones"" answer both times. I do not think paying just to hear that again is worth it. If it really is just puberty or something, it will go away on its own, right? Or should I be more concerned?",25Oct2020,1

482,"So I live on my own, pay my own bills, etc and my parents live nearby so we frequently talk and I ask them over. But my dad has this particular quirk that I find to be very disrespectful although he'll tell me I'm being disrespectful. I see it as power moves on his part but perhaps he doesn't.

- If we're in my car and I'm somewhere he absolutely cannot talk if I have the radio on even at a low volume. I always listen to podcasts etc while driving so I find his demands somewhat annoying but whatever....

- The biggest issue I have is that whenever he talks to me he needs me absolute attention, I can't be doing anything else at the moments. If I'm doing something I have to stop what I'm doing, face him, look him in the eyes, and absorb whatever it is he's trying to tell me. 

- I find this disrespectful on multiple fronts, I invite him into my phone, give him a free lunch, give him coffee and talk in a polite voice. Then he has the nerve to say I'm being ""disrespectful"" if I refuse to drop everything I'm doing in the moment to give him all my attention. Playing with the cat while he's talking about something... nope have to stop doing that. In the kitchen tending to something... again drop everything and look at him. It's fucking infuriating to me because I see it as a power move of trying to excerpt his will on me in MY HOME... and also because it's like he's telling me I can't do 2 things at once as if I'm so absent minded that I cannot play with a cat while he's talking to me.

Does anyone have a parent like this? How do you deal with it? I do not cave to him and I've told him I find it disrespectful he tries to force me to do it  (even if its a small thing) and he'll get all bent out of shape and immediately tell my mother ""Ok we're going"" and will rush out and sit in his car waiting to leave... seriously?

483,"Hi,

So I'm a 23M about to graduate from university in engineering. I'm on track to get my dream job -- a pilot in the Navy. I've overcome some tremendous odds, along with being obese most of my life. Now, I'm chiseled, lean and good muscle definition. I'm confident in my looks and my career.

However, I've never had a relationship and have very limited experience with women. I can't help but compare myself to my friends who either hook up every weekend, or have lasting relationships. I feel there's something wrong with me and I'm at a severe disadvantage. 

While at the same time, my buddies tell me it doesn't matter and that I should hold my head up high because of my achievements and future. Logically that makes sense, but I just can't naturally sustain that mindset for too long before my relationship insecurity gets the best of me.

484,"I feel like an ungrateful b-word for writing this. I will have been with the guy I met the first day of college, TWO YEARS next week. He is sweet, always wants to see me, calls me everyday we can't meet up, we have so many inside jokes/codewords and little routines. My doubts only started a few months ago and I feel sick with guilt over them at times. I was almost certain I wanted to be with him *forever* within a few months of dating. Now I'm not sure? 

I have a tendancy to focus on all his flaws as of late. For example, he used to only brush his teeth half the time in the morning until I started reminding him *everyday* the third month we were dating. I sounded like my mom. He also hasn't flossed in years or seen dentist (idk how his teeth manage to look so white?). His diet is really terrible, he eats one big meal at like 4-6pm, it's almost always chicken nuggets/a burger and pasta or pizza. He'll just snack on biscuits or chips or order fast food at like 10pm if he's still hungry. He has gained quite a lot of weight in the last year. He still has that beautiful face but I miss his fit body. For the last year, he let's his stubble grow for a week or 2 sometimes and it scratches the crap out of me and makes him look sketchy (?). He is a really attractive guy but it's like he is letting himself go. I hardly ever want sex anymore. Yet when I look at pictures of him from when we first met I'm like ""damn he would get it wow"". 

 He also has untreated mental health issues that make my life really hard at times and he insists he'll get better in his own time. He can be fine mentally for 4 or 5 months but it always comes back. The guys loves and adores me so I feel terrible for being such a b-word. What's worse is I've always been very monogamous. Like even as a single teen, if I had a crush on someone who didn't even return my feelings, I never noticed anyone else. So me having dreams of flirting with or cuddling guys I've never met or guys I know for the last few weeks, is extremely out of character. I see TV shows and films where characters met and suddenly I think ""I'll never feel the rush of excitement ever again and I'm only 21"".

I am a 25 year old guy from Turkey who graduated from NABA university with bachelors degree on industrial design . I came to Turkey right after graduation back in 2017 and my plan was to study masters degree in car design but since my country is an utter and complete shit hole the economical crisis went nuts and euro became 10 times more expensive than lira . I chased after masters degree programs in italy such as IED Torino and SPD Milano , came 1st in a car design competition , got a %50 scholarship but yet again i couldnt pursue it because of the economical crisis . As a result , i developed severe depression and i feel like my life is a complete fucking shit hole . I worked in my dad’s fair&amp;events company as a graphic designer and still tried to find a way to make my car design dream come true . Right now , i am sending my CV to certain companies which are in search of a graphics designer / designer in general but to no awail . My dad’s friend who is currently the sales CEO of Fiat Turkey contacted Ferrari HQ in Istanbul and promised me a sales position there ( i know its not my profession but since Ferrari is the core reason why i wanted to become a car designer i was willing to accept a position as a sales person ) but i havent heard back neither from Ferrari nor my dad’s friend . It’s been 3 years since im running aimlessly on a treadmill with no jobs , no will to do anything about what i usually like to do such as guitar , basketball , design , drawing etc and my mental state is decaying each and every day . The Rona virus was the cherry on top of my depression cake and now i honestly have no hope for my future . I know i have to try harder and apply for at least 25 fucking job positions every single but im also completely down on energy and motivation . I know there are much worse cases and i know most people cant even afford food on the table but for now i dont want to compare my problems with others . 

As an addition to all this crap i have been feeling and going through , military service is mandatory in turkey and you either pay 30+k and serve for a month or you dont and serve for 6-18 months which is something i and almost every single person my age refuse to do . Our president is literally taking a massive shit on his gold plated toilet seat while people out there deal with poverty . There are thousands of extremely talented people out there with no job , severe depression or suicidal thoughts . A guy my age committed suicide because of these exact reasons the past month and i cant blame him . I need help . Something that will be a reminder for me to maintain hope . I feel absolutely useless and it hurts cause i know i have lots of potential and certain skillsets to make a living . I just need the depression gone . It’s at a level where my body literally aches every time i get up in the morning and it’s killing me . Any advice ?

Are some things truly worth falling out over or do I need to be more forgiving?I’ll give some examples

• Over a year ago I removed a friend from all of my socials because she stole money from my bedroom desk while I showered

• Earlier on this year I recently cut off a friend as he started to say some nasty racist shit and I simply did not want a person like this in my life. he repeatedly said the n word on a voicenote and make jokes about lynching black people (Im not black myself, but these jokes made me super uncomfortable.) as well as that people noticed that he would deliberately target ME as a joking point.

• A few days ago I blocked someone on Snapchat because I told him how I found it cute when a guy spends time with you on a night out because it shows he cares about you. He then responded with “this mentality is exactly why you end up in controlling relationships, you think it’s cute at first but then the guy ends up being controlling as hell.” I thought this statement was very malicious and completely uncalled for, considering the fact I was in a controlling relationship three years ago so felt very invalidating to the years I have spent understanding what makes a relationship controlling or not. As well as this, I found this statement completely hypocritical as his own relationships are a bigger shitstorm than mine, but you don’t see me putting in unsolicited input because I’m not a dick. or should I start being so?

Was it wrong for me to cut these people off? Should I just give them another chance, since humans really do be just making mistakes.

When I (24F) was a kid, my dad refused to let me have friends over when he was the only parents home because ""if one of those girls tells someone I touched her, my life would be over"". I wasn't allowed to sleep over at friend's houses because my dad thought all their dads were rapists. One time when I was 13, I was talking on the phone to my ""boyfriend"" at the time, and I was outside by myself, far away from my house. When I went back inside, my dad said ""why don't you talk to me like that?""

I always thought it was weird, and my friends always said they were uncomfortable at my house so nobody came over. But now my parents are fostering my teenage cousin and the same issues are coming up. He refuses to be alone with her because he thinks she'll accuse him of raping her. My brother and his wife are having their first baby soon and I get nauseous thinking that anything could ever happen to the baby if my suspicion was at all accurate.

Is this a normal thing for men to feel?? I understand that being aware of your actions is important, but this weird hyper-fixation that he has has existed way longer than #MeToo.

I don't explicitly remember anything happening to me at his hand but I don't remember 90% of my childhood.

505,"Hi, just hoping there’s someone out there who’s maybe gone through something similar and can help me out with advice. So a little about me.. I’m 21 from UK and due to covid I’ve lost my job. I live with strict parents and my sister who’s 25, completed uni and she’s working from home now and has been in a relationship for 4yrs. I was a uni dropout from the US due to a loss of scholarship and I’ve been a competitive athlete all my life so when I finally stopped training, I wanted to see what I was missing out on all those yrs when I had no social life due to strict training schedules and couldn’t go to the parties etc.

So now I’m back living at home, not working and pretty much went AWOL. I would leave the house for days and be on drugs and hanging with ppl that were a bad influence on me but I would always have so much fun and never wanted to return to this boring reality we called 2020

Now I find myself with an unplanned pregnancy...I’m ashamed. I’m not in a relationship but the father is a drug dealer and we were just friends with benefits and begs he wants me to keep it (his religious beliefs) and states he will change (job+ his addiction) 

I haven’t told my parents or my sister yet because I already know that’s not going to go down well one bit! Also I’m not on birth control because I hated the side effects but that would usually force myself to always use protection but in this case we were both on drugs and barely remember it happening otherwise I would have probably took plan B.

Tomorrow i will be 4 weeks so yes I found out very early but I noticed straight away my hormonal changes. 

I’m thinking if I keep the baby this will keep me away from drugs which I haven’t been taking now that I’ve found out and actually can’t stand the smell of smoke etc anymore but then I can barely look after myself financially never mind raising a child! I’m worried to tell anyone due to not being in a proper relationship and I feel like I will lose my good reputation from being an athlete and trying to pursue my coaching career/ and I worry about being a single parent. I feel like if I was to go through an abortion I will become very depressed and probably end up going AWOL again and back to the drugs to cope. I don’t have many friends and my family aren’t close like that so I feel I have nobody to talk to and I’m going through a lot right now so if anybody has any advice, any single parents out there? Any jobless and pregnant? Corona baby? Thanks in advance.",25Oct2020,1
508,"I know this might be a little weird but i'd be glad if you help.
Why do i always feel depressed for a couple of days after i go out with my friend or relatives? I always feel like this after something exciting happens in my life and then it finishes. I know everyone feels fresh and happy when they give themselves a break though.
So yesterday i went outside for a walk with my friend and now i feel sad and lonely. I just wanna cry all day long :(",25Oct2020,1
509,"Starting off, I’m a 19 year old female dating a 30 year old male. What I’ve by far endured by now is just breaking me to the point where I just can’t even deal with this anymore. He is in a professional career, comes from a very very wealthy family and has been dating me for 4 months now. No I’m not with him for money-the only thing he has ever bought me was McDonald’s food and a ring.He was in a relationship for two years with his ex who was manipulative, controlling and apparently would check his phone every waking moment of his day. He was going to get married to her when she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend while they were on a break. I met him through a dating app and we seemingly hit it off. He was honest with me at the start about everything then later by the second time we met he started pressuring me to do sexual things with him in order to “learn”. I was 18 at that time. He knew I was a virgin-had no experience whatsoever but he started to push my boundaries which he himself admitted to because “it will feel better now then later with age”. My naivety got the best of me and he coaxed me into losing my virginity to him. Keep in mind I wanted to wait till marriage. He took that from me as well. And to him it wasn’t a big deal as it was for me. I felt disgusted and repulsed and although I didn’t want to have sex with him I still did to please him. I just wanted a innocent relationship with him where he’d take me out to dates and we would hangout as normal couples usually do. He would always complain about how busy he was so I started to bring my guard down and gave into whatever he wanted. He may think I’m “easy” but the stuff he’s done to me is just too much. Flash forward two days ago when I met up with him, he told me how if his ex found out she would “trick” him into having him add her on snap because they had raised a puppy together which he later gave to her when they broke up. And that she would try to “lure him” back in by sending nudes-keep in mind she’s a 29 year old teacher who would basically do anything to pull him back. And she would harass me if she knew that I was his girlfriend.And he would “probably not respond to her nudes” according to his own words. When he told me all this I stayed quiet and nodded that I understood the situation but in reality it makes me wonder if all this happened already during the time we’ve been together. I haven’t met his parents which he insists he keeps his life private from them because they would nag him to get married and that they think I would leave him-which I wouldn’t because I love him so much. But I don’t think he will introduce me until we’ve been together for a year. He also told me before that he only used snap to talk to me but his snap score went up by 12 today and I haven’t used snap to talk to him in over 5 days as we use iMessage. He’s trying to tell me to wait to tell my own parents until there is ‘stability” in our relationship. He also says that he doesn’t have any social media other then snap because his ex made him delete it all back when they were together. Which is also suspicious as he claims to not have any social media. I haven’t ever checked his phone because I trust him while his ex always did but with what I’m seeing now I can’t help but have a gut feeling that he’s still talking to her. I don’t want to check his phone because I feel like it’s wrong but I don’t have any choice at this point either. I can’t be in love with someone who is still in love with their ex. Keep in mind they broke up a year before he started dating me. Also initially in our relationship he lied to me about his name and career-because he thought I wouldn’t want him because the career I’m planning to go into (medschool) he isn’t in-(he initially told me he’s a doctor but he’s not rather a vet) but I still forgave him and took him back. Does he truly love me? What should I do?

510,"i am confused on this guy who keeps flaking

I met this guy on a dating app a while ago and we've been snapping back and forth for a while now, but we never got to meet up because 1. corona and 2. we live about 1.5 hours apart. We also exchanged numbers. He always told me how he wanted to see me and wants to FaceTime but never does. We planned on meeting once and I got ready and everything when I'm about to leave to meet him he tells me he can't make it anymore because of work. I was kinda mad, but I really liked him and wanted to give him another chance. A couple weeks go by and he asks me what im doing that night. I said im out of town but im free after 4pm the next day. The next day comes and I don't hear from him until around 8pm, asking if I want hang. I told him it was getting late (it was a Sunday night) and I pretty much told him no. I felt bad about that and the next week on Friday I asked him what he was doing this weekend and to that he replied ""nothing I can literally come see you now."" Then I said great I'm free at 8pm tonight. 8pm comes and nothing, I don't hear from him until around 10:30pm and he sends me a snap saying ""damn it"" and I don't respond. He responds to my story the next morning and I responded to his and he didn't open it for 8 hours, but he would post to his story and look at mine... so I was like ok im over this dude now, so I unadd him. He then texts me sad that I unaided him. I explained to him that we've been talking for a while now and I don't see this going anywhere cause we haven't met up yet. Now he's making plans again to see me...

What I'm confused with is this guy keeps flaking on me but he seems like he actually likes me. I know actions speak louder than words and all of that but I need someone else's opinion on this cause idk what to do at this point lol... thanks in advance for reading this long ass post and for your responses!",25Oct2020,1

513,"So me and this guy have been talking for weeks now.

But he doesn’t like texting, he wants to talk on the phone or meet up.

I completely get it. But with my big family and a house of 13 people. It hard to get a time to talk on the phone with me.

Since my uni is online, and they give us work every week, and it’s due within that week. I haven’t meet up with anyone.

And also with the virus, and my mom being a high risk. I don’t go out and socially.

So he blocked me few days ago, he doesn’t ever reach out, so I’m the one reaching out. 

But I found out he blocked me.

I messaged him on, he said he blocked me because I didn’t show interested.

I understood where he was coming.

Bu I told him how can I show interest in you don’t like texting and want to meet up and talk on the phone the whole day.

He said Fiat point.

We exchanged Instagram. 

We sent five messages to each other. Until he saw my message when we were arranged a time to speak on the phone. 

He saw it and didn’t reply. I woke up this morning, and he post two stories.

I messaged him, instead of talking to me like a human being. He blocks me.

Again.

So I message him on his number and he says it because “I don’t block people often to be honest but you’re playing games”

I asked him what he meant.

I asked him did he want me to be okay with getting ignored or something.

He says “I told you last night we can arrange a phone call for today sometime and I haven’t forgotten about it but you have message me saying like you’ve got a feeling I’m talking to other people and I’m distracted and you wish me best of luck so I guess you’re impatient”

I live in a house with so many people. I texted him this morning because I wanted to talk on the phone because I was free.
 But it seemed like he wanted to talk on the phone when he was free.

He replied saying “I told you I was going to call you today but u guess the day isn’t over is it”

He added on “and I haven’t forgotten”

He then added “And by the way I’ve unblocked you from Instagram out of goodwill”

Out of good will? I was shocked.

Since he’s got it in his head I’m playing games, I asked him why he thought that.

He said “Well I felt a little bit played for example when you said are you talking to other people so maybe should keep moving and then you show interest and then  not”

He added let’s not play games with each other.

I explained to him if I didn’t like him, I wouldn’t care if he blocked me twice now. But should that tell him I am interested?

I felt desperate and ashamed that even tho he blocked me twice I reached out and asked him to explain.

517,"Throwaway account because of privacy reasons. 

So some background: I made a PayPal account over 6 months ago for purposes that I don't remember. After I made the account, I changed all the details like email and such to random stuff (although its weird I received this email on my actual email account). I should also mention that I don't have the access to the account due to ""can't verify identity"" and haven't linked credit card/bank account to it.

A few days ago, friday to be exact, I received an email from service@paypal.de (german) which states that a german person had sent me money for a book.

I checked my account from my phone, didnt see anything, so I thought ""weird, maybe a refresh could fix it?"" so I logged out. Thats when the can't verify identity -thing started.

So stupid me decides to click on the link that was on the email. Idiotic me, I say. What I can remember about it is:

- Said PayPal.com
- Had the lock -symbol next to the URL, meaning it's secure website
- Didn't see any errors

After I couldn't log in, I decided to instantly change most of my online account's password.

I also asked my mom for advice she said: ""Well since you didn't attach anything to it, I would say just let it go, you'll be fine"" 

Am I wrong for being paranoid about this, even though I'm very sure that I didn't link any credit card/bank account to the old PayPal account? Maybe no one can access my account due to the verify -thing? Any advice or am I just going crazy?",25Oct2020,1
518,"throwaway bc I'm embarrassed lol, essentially I have really bad insomnia and anxiety and sometimes this causes me to have all sorts of sleep problems, like sleepwalking, shouting, sleep hallucinations etc. When I moved in about a month ago I jokingly mentioned it to my uni flatmates but didn't think it would actually be an issue involving any of them. Then last night, or this morning, I really embarrassed myself by barging into my flatmate's room in an irrational, half-unconscious state at about 3am, after sleep hallucinating/dreaming/idk really that my room was trashed and I needed to find out who did it. I snapped out of it pretty much immediately when I saw them doing private things, then realised what I'd done and quickly apologised and left. I feel like I should properly apologise and explain what happened, but it's such an awkward situation  especially since I have social anxiety and hate confrontation, but I also feel like I need to clear up any confusion and make sure they know I wasn't being weird on purpose?

522,"Good morning, I apolgize if the formating of this post is weird as I'm on mobile. 

So where do I start, I had a rough child hood growing up and do to this I never belived in marriage. I was raised roman catholic and could tell you almost every story in the Bible. However do to childhood trauma I turned away from God for about eight years. I currently have a weird relationship with him but let me break this down and I again apologize my thoughts are everywhere right now and I'm at work so I don't really have time to think.

So about four or five days ago now I felt like something was missing in my life. I don't have very many friends because I have a hard time getting close to people and opening up writing this is hard enough but I need help, for years I had asked God for anything to tell me my father was okay, but I never got it. (Mainly why I questioned my faith) So I prayed to God for a friend. Exactly what I said was, ""Please help me, I feel like I'm alone. I need someone I can love, and I know will love me back unconditionally. I can't be the only person so please God I know I am not worthy of help but I need yours."" (The Conversation was a lot longer just shortened it as most the rest is unimportant to the topic.

Now again I've never belive in marriage my first serious relationship ended with the girl I loved unconditionally taking everything I own and cheating on me with my best friend on my nineteenth birthday, it took a few years of hard work to rebuild because I mean she took literally everything. Then I met another girl, after the first time I was cautious but I saw something with this girl. ( I thought she could be the one) It ended when one day she wanted to leave out of the blue and by leave I mean move half way across the country. She took my Dog, my money and about three fourths of everything I owned ( I kept my car this time).
 Now my ideal woman has always been someone like me who thinks a little differently than me.

Okay now back to the topic yesterday, my first ever girlfriend (I mean seventh grade, yes I know that's not really a girlfriend) hit me up out of nowhere for no reason other than she had a feeling she needed too in her own words. We talked for six hours on the phone although we haven't seen each other in ten years it was like we were back in seventh grade. I felt like I wasn't being judged for anything I said, she laughed at all of my jokes. She saw me cry (only 2 other people have in my life, besides my parents) and when I asked what I wanted for dinner she said a medium cheese pizza from a certain place (My favorite place). And when I say I asked this is kinda how the conversation went,
""What do I want to eat?""
""Pizza""
""From where"" 
""My favorite place""
""Now for the real qu...."" didn't even finish typing
""Medium, cheese, with a side of ranch bread sticks and a Mt Dew"" literally my favorite meal from anywhere. 
""Okay, Why"" 
""It's my favorite"" (mine too and you knew what I was thinkin)
Now again we haven't talked in about ten or more years but from reconnecting we figured out we like all the same movies, books, food, YouTube creators, you name it we share it. The real kicker is we lived almost identical lives in the time we weren't talkin, I knew exactly what she was going to say as she did too me. 
Now why I need advice is I've never belived in marriage or really true love I think. I mean my ex left because I wouldn't spontaneously move half way across the country for her. But last night something in my mind was clicked like I realized my prayer was answered I have not only a really great friend now but someone that one day I want to be my wife, (there's a lot of history with this girl, all good, and I'm in no rush to be in a relationship) But this girl now lives five states away. I'm willing to leave everything behind because something is calling me to do it she is worth it too me. She was my best friend in middle school. She's my ideal woman. (She invited me to go live out there with her)

What do I do? Do I follow a gut feeling knowing it could be nothing? Everything is saying do it. (I've never been impulsive) but I don't think I want to miss this opportunity.

Again I apolgize about the formatting, the wording, the flow, any miss and any confusion I'm happy to answer any Questions in my free time. Like I said I've had a weird relationship with God and even questioned him once apon a time but literally four days later this happens. I feel like it means something.

i don’t really know if this fits the sub, but i’ll remove if it doesn’t. throwaway acc for obvious reasons ;-;

(20f) so this is something that happened many years ago, but i’ve only recently remembered it, and now i can’t stop thinking about it. i was around 13, and waiting for the bus after school. 

it was only me and two other boys waiting, and i was standing by myself minding my own business. right as the bus arrived, one of the boys walked up to me and touched me. down there. like on my crotch (it makes me embarrassed to even type it) and i just got really shocked and didn’t know how to respond so i didn’t, i kinda just froze up. 

the boy who did it started to laugh. i quickly got on to the bus and i remember i just blasted music really loud on my headphones and i felt so gross and disgusting. and i somehow feel like it’s my fault. i feel terrible about it but it also doesn’t seem like such a big deal, i feel like i should just get over it. am i overreacting, was i actually sexually assaulted, or am i just making too big of a deal about it?",25Oct2020,1

527,"I don’t know why I think about this, as I’ll be turning 22(M) in a couple of days, never dated, never had a girlfriend, and starting to doubt I ever will since it’s usually a bit of a turn-off at my age. But if there’s one thing I want more than anything in life, it’s not a high-paying job, a big house, luxury, or numerous trips to exotic places… 

It’s to have at least one daughter when I have kids. That’s all. And I know I’ll never have one. Why?  


Well first, thanks to my family’s genetics, the odds are pretty much against me: both of my parents have a brother and no sister, and my dad’s grandparents had a whopping grand total of 10 boys before having a girl. No way this is pure coincidence. And second, I have this awful gut feeling that just because I wish for a daughter, life’s not gonna give me one along the way, no matter what I do. Always been bad at lottery.

I’ve always seen myself with 2 children, be it boy+girl, girl+boy, or girl+girl (order doesn’t matter to me). But if it’s boy+boy (probably what would happen), then I would talk with my girlfriend about having a 3rd, and a way to ensure it’s gonna be a girl. Now I know technology has advanced &amp; there are more and more clinics in the US that offer gender selection for family balancing purposes using IVF (expensive and a bit controversial, I know), but I personally don’t think it’s that much of a bad practice when it’s not for a first-time pregnancy. It’s way more ethical in my book than gender-based abortions like they do in China and India (would never consider that) or even having 5+ children just in hope the next one will be the ‘’right’’ gender. Plus, you can donate the remaining embryos to infertile couples instead of destroying them. But then again… what are the chances of finding a girlfriend who’d be willing to go through IVF treatments only to conceive a girl… pretty much none. Anyways, if I ever get a girlfriend, I’m sure it’ll be too late to have 2-3 kids thanks to the fertility window starting to close in the mid-thirties, and we’ll probably have time for only one, which I know will be a boy.

I know infant adoption is an option too (I’m not talking about foster care), but on top of being crazy expensive and complicated, you’re left waiting for years due to insane demand, and could very well end up with a kid who will be dealing with lifelong trauma or serious special needs/disabilities, on top of the bio mom still having the right for a few weeks to take him back after the adoption is finalized. So I’m afraid it’s not in the cards for me, unless as a last resort. Besides, adopting a girl if we already have 2+ older bio boys might not be the wisest idea… soon or later, one of the kids would realise why we did end up adopting. 

Now, before anyone jump to conclusions and says I want a daughter only to do stereotypical ‘’girly-girl’’ things like dressing her up, painting her nails, having tea parties or anything like that… sure would be fun, but it’s far from being the main reason. I want one firstly because I would be more than proud to break all those stereotypes and take her hiking, to sports games, etc. I would also love being there for her wedding and maybe walk her down the aisle, who knows? Secondly (and probably the most important), I’m an overly affectionate person. And girls tend to be more emotionally and physically affectionate with their dad than boys in the long term…they typically pull away for a shorter period of time (this is the case in many families I know around me where there are both boys and girls…the difference is obvious). Thirdly… just to have a little daddy’s girl, even if it’s only for a few years, would mean more than the world to me, as I always find it so beautiful seeing little girls attached to their father before the teen phase hits (and even after in some cases). And even if I can’t put every reason in concrete words, I just want to experience a father-daughter bond once in my life, that’s all! Like I said, it would mean way more to me than living the traveller’s life, or having a ton of cash and luxury all around me. I’d die happy like you could not imagine. 

It saddens me to no end knowing there’s a 99% chance I’ll never get to experience that. To be entirely honest, me clinging to the 1% chance it happens one day is one of the few reasons I still have a desire to live. Then yesterday, when I mustered up the courage to tell my mom about all of this (the only person I’ve told), I couldn’t help it and just burst into tears in front of her…

It doesn’t help that I feel like the only guy my age around me who wants a daughter that much, as it’s often the other way around: you usually hear how guys want at least one son so they could ‘’have him carry the family name, take him hunting, shooting, teach him how to be a real man, etc.’’…phew.

Like I wrote earlier, I really wouldn’t mind having a son as well &amp; would love him equally, but if one day I realize this tiny chance of having a daughter slips to a definite 0% for any reason (old age, girlfriend can’t / doesn’t want to have more children, or worse, never having found a girlfriend…), I’d be beyond devastated for the rest of my life. 

I don’t know what to think anymore. How do I live with the fact I’ll probably die without having had a daughter? Or do you honestly think that there’s a legitimate chance I’ll end up with one someday, even though time is running out fast? That there are girls around who would want one as much as I do? Maybe consider the IVF route, or a less invasive (so less successful) method like sperm sorting if the ‘’only boys’’ scenario happens? (I guess the technology will be even more reliable in 10-20 years) Or, in those days of gender equality protests, would I just be called a disgusting sexist? I’m just tired of reading the usual ‘’you should just be grateful it’s healthy’’, ‘’when the babies are there, you won’t care one bit about missing out’’ , or ‘’take your time to grieve, it will pass’’.",25Oct2020,1

1. My country is on lockdown so you can go out of the house but every business is closed. There are not bars, restaurants, movie theaters, escape rooms, etc.
2. I thought about inviting her over to cook but she's a shy girl so i feel like she's not ready yet for a date at my place.
3. We have no cars / bikes 

For now we set up a date to go on a stroll at different park.
Of course in the end the point is just being together but I'm a romantic and i feel like we can do something more interesting and fun.
(a few ideas i have is going around with googly eyes making things look funny along the way, or walking around with crayons and painting stuff on the sidewalks)

Will appreciate any other suggestions!

Tldr; looking for original second date ideas while no businesses are open, no car.",25Oct2020,1
531,"Let's keep this short as I can manage: 

We all know that sometimes sharing your abilities and creativity can be great to bond with others and show what you can offer the world. It's just something we do.

To those with toxic people in your lives- maybe even toxic family-- this can suck because sharing with these folks just never works out- right? 

The solution is simple- keep your dreams to yourself. Stop sharing your dreams with those toxic people. It seems obvious, but it's tougher for some more than others because we naturally gravitate and connect these ways. Keep all those beautiful talents to yourself for a while and pep yourself up about them if everyone you're forced to be around is really *that* feral. 👍

533,"Okay so basically I am a Youtuber. I am not a viral star but I do have an okay amount of subscribers and a fair amount of views(about 210,000 views total). I do videos on a certain topic that relates to things like domestic violence, sexual abuse etc. Well I told a lady(we will call Jane) on Twitter a while ago that if she wants to ever share her story on my channel(many of the Youtuber's in my circle do the same) she could. 

Well I realized after the fact that I am not exactly experienced with dealing with that type of stuff and it made me nervous. Long story short I have a fellow Youtube friend who is more experienced with that stuff and she will probably be right by my side helping me with the lady who wants to share her domestic violence story on my channel. 

BUT the issue is that Jane goes ""here is my # call me I have a lot to talk about."" The issue is that I feel super awkward if I called her on the phone. I would rather do a Skype session or have her email me. I don't feel comfortable giving out my phone number to anyone, even though she seems like a nice lady. I told her I would be in touch(which is true) so until then I thought I'd reach out and ask what I should do. 

I am creating a big video project/documentary and I don't need her statements/story until then. So I am thinking it would be wise for me to tell her to just do her best to send me her thoughts via email and then when I am ready to do the project we will have a Skype session with my other Youtube friend. 

I probably figured this all out myself after typing this, but I just want to triple check. Thank you everyone!",25Oct2020,1

535,"I (25F) have an extremely hard time adjusting to being an adult. I feel like I’m still a kid inside because I need my parents. I went to see a therapist about it and she suggested I move out if I wanted to grow up fast. I tried to move out two times already and failed both times. I moved back the second time before covid happen so I’m living with my parents right now. I had really bad anxiety when I was living alone and constantly FaceTime my parents to make small talk, but they can only talk so much before we end our phone call. I would cry almost every night and I ended up moving back home because I was so scared to be alone/by myself. My parents doesn’t mind as long as I’m paying rent (I don’t mind). 

I don’t know why I have such a hard time adjusting to being an adult. It’s so hard being separated from my parents. Part of me doesn’t want to grow up, but I know I need to change now.

538,"So there's this guy,he's older than me(girl) by a few years. I kinda knew he liked me for a while and I didn't do much about it. I am not gonna lie but at times I would look at him to see if he WAS into me but that's it. We wouldn't talk. Then one day, he came up to me and confessed his feelings. At this point I was unsure about what I felt for him,and that is what I did tell him. He seemed to be okay with that and we spoke for after,for a few days. 

Soon I realised that I took him more as a friend than a person I would want to be in a relationship with. I told him about these feelings and he accepted. 

However I knew by the way he behaved and spoke around me that he CLEARLY wanted to be more than just friends. I tried multiple times to convince him to behave as a friend around me. But he never really would. Along with that my parents aren't supportive of relationships in general as they want me to focus on my studies and I had other problems to worry about as well. I knew it would only lead to him feeling worse and us talking wud not amount to what HE wanted. So I told him I couldn't talk to him anymore . I had a lot on my plate and didn't want to play or further someone's feelings for me when I clearly had no intention of reciprocating them. He seemed to understand at first. 

But recently he came up to me and said that he couldn't live without me. He said he doesn't feel like eating or staying alive and only thinks of me. He says only talking to me makes him feel happy. However I'm not as comfortable with talking to him(I know he has major feelings for me) and I'm happy if we don't talk and tbh it REALLY is for the both of our benefits. I told him this and that I don't hate him nor would I be happy if he decided to take such extreme steps. He said he understands but I feel bad. I feel terrible that he cries and thinks of ending his life becoz of me. Am I an asshole for still deciding not to talk to him?",25Oct2020,1

541,"In terms of personality, she's all I've ever looked for: kind heart, funny, smart, deep connection, well educated... I'm also very attracted to her physically. 

We had some differences, particularly in terms of life style: I'm an early riser, don't do alcohol/weed, don't really go out partying... she's pretty much the opposite: wakes up late, likes to drink regularly and maybe go crazy once or twice a month, does weed occasionally, loves night life... 

In my head these incompatibilities would be constant issues during the relationship, and that's why I decided to break up before things got worse. There are other issues that bothered me a bit, but nothing that we couldn't overcome (she's going back to her home country in couple weeks, and has shown some insecure behaviour during the relationship: at the beginning she'd accuse me of not liking her, and later he'd do things like phoning me when I didn't answer her messages in work). I have  several issues myself, don't read as this me being the perfect guy.

I'm second guessing the break-up a lot, because she's an excellent human being and I feel like it will be extremly hard for me to find someone whom I can connect like I did with her, the same for her. I'm now wondering whether I broke up over stupid reasons, and whether or not I should contact her asap, let her know I'm sorry and what was going through my mind, and ask if she's still interested to make this work.

544,"So at the end of August, my best friend tried to overdose. This came a day after I was complaining bc she had ruined some of my art supplies (expensive ones). I visited her every day when she was in the Adult Psychiatry Unit of the hospital. She has DID, which doesnt really matter to me. She has been my best friend for about 10 years now. We got into arguements but never to this extent. My girlfriend said it was really just to manipulate me because I was starting to get upset at her for other reasons.

So this woman causes many problems and plays games to try and get me to fix it. For example I could do something like not talk to her for a day bc I'm busy with family and she will get upset at me and block me on social media. When I try to ask her what's wrong she will tell me something along the lines of ""you know what's wrong"" and continue to not talk to me. She doesnt tell me if I do something wrong and will instead make me try to figure out what is wrong and then make me fix our friendship. 

Recently shes been posting a lot of aggressive comments in our discord channel, all of which is directed to me. I guess about a year ago she posted something along the lines of ""when you try to kill yourself at school and your 'best friend' calls the school to have them look for you"".

i suppose the details dont really matter. if you're interested i posted a longer version of relationships aspects in another post that you can see by going to my page.

the thing is, we lived together and we also worked in the same place. i love working there and want to continue working there. she (as a result of breaking up with me) is moving out of the apartment and her parents house is over an hour and a half a way. however, she also loves working there to the point where I think she would actually attempt to commute.

i dont want to work there if she continues working there, and i know that she is going to at least try to continue. 

i already cant afford the apartment on my own so i too have to move back to my parents house which is only 25 minutes away. but if she keeps working there i will be jobless, moved back in with my parents, and have no girlfriend.

550,"my (ex)girlfriend and i had been dating since october of last year. we had a lot in common and loved pretty much all the same things and soon became inseparable. in college we started living together when my roommate moved out of my double, and when the pandemic started she moved to my parents house with me.

things started to get weird after she moved into my parents house. in april she abruptly took all the stuff she had brought to my parents house and left for a day. i thought she had broken up with me, but the next day she came back and apologized. this was the first of many times a similar thing would happen, where she would experience a sudden mood shift, totally hate me, and leave without so much as a word, like i wasn't worth the breath it took to explain

some back story: she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so as these things continued to happen, things would always return to normal. it kept happening so much that she told me if she ever breaks up with me when she is one of those moods to ""not let her break up with me"" whatever that means.

we moved into an apartment together depsite all of this on september 1, and after having been unemployed since the pandemic began we both got jobs (at the same place)

we had a serious break up thing happen on october 4, where she appeared to be seriously done (again out of no where and for no reason that she would tell me) but she went home and then she again abruptly changed her mind and said that she loved me more than anything and anyone and wanted to marry me and all this beautiful nice stuff that i loved to hear.

and things were fine and almost like back to the old days when we never fought at all, for about 3 weeks, until yesterday. it started normal enough, but she was being extra nice to me at work, and even wrote me a love poem, which she hasnt done since christmas, but, when we both got home from work she suddenly out of no where said that she couldn't do this anymore and that she was done and that it was over.

our lives are so interconnected now though, what with the apartment, job, bills, etc that i have literally no idea what im supposed to do with myself. her breaking up with me is like going back to square one. everything i own is connected to her in some way, clothing, books, etc, and just the connection makes me want to cry. we have a job at the same place (a place i love and want to continue working at and has good pay), we live in an apartment together, etc. now that we are breaking up i feel like i have to quit the job, move out of the apartment, and move back to my parents house. literally jobless, homeless, and girlfriendless.

i feel so lost and horrible and i just want to throw up and i want my girlfriend back and i want to hug her and i want her to tell me everythings gonna be ok, but it really seems like the end this time. i really hate this. things were going so well for the last few weeks i wish it could've stayed. i wish she didn't lead me on for so long i feel so silly. i havent loved anyone like i loved her for a long time and it felt so good to be accepted and loved for who i am or maybe who i was.

552,"So I'm using a throwaway to be on the safe side.

&amp;#x200B;

So TLDR:

Was talking to a girl online, I am from the Netherlands, She is from The US, we spoke for around 5 months every day and we really did love each other (Not in a cringy way) and spoke every day. But Since august has ""dipped"". We never had any major fights, only some disagreements. Everything was okay and fine. The issue is her mother is very strict on social media and who she talks to.

What can I do to find information about her, I have asked her adres in the past but she refused as it was too early (Was a month in, she was right it was early) but forgot to ask more. I know her full name, the state, her school and I've got a clue to where she lives, but this is only due to knowing where she goes to school.

\-Long story below

I have told you about the important part of the story, so I'll try getting into more detail. We have spoken since around February/march and everything was going really well, but her Father had recently died of cancer and her mother was very controlling of her, we always had to call in ""secret"" and she could almost never verbally speak. Now I have been duped in the past but I've learned my mistakes and I can now recognise if someone is truly playing with my feelings and wasting both our times, and when she is genuinely interested and this is definitely the case with her.  The amount of time we spend ""together"", planning stuff for the future, made sure our goals are compatible and what not is just too much for someone who would intentionally dip on me... Due to time zones I could only really speak to her after 5/6pm cause of school. So we still spoke on the same day she ""left"", but I told her if we could talk later due to me having lessons and she had no issue, after that nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what can I do? I have tried informing the local police which was Warren Michigan where I thought she was from, my phone can find some location from where the receiving end is at, as I had her number and we once called and that is where it brought me. I misspelt her last name and got nothing, I tried again but no response. I tried the general police department from Michigan but no responds. I send numerous emails to her high school but no responds. 

I do not blame em, some random person from outside the USA who does not have a lot to prove asks for all this info sounds fishy, but I have and always am willing to call with a voip and share whatever info I had ( is what I wrote)..

&amp;#x200B;

I tried looking her up on internet but to no avail, background checking fails to give me anything. I think it has to do with her age.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what can I do? I really do think her mother has done something as I have called her numerous times and it tells me the same code (I forgot the one) but I looked it up and it says it either blocked me or the phone is off, I tried my original number which she obviously knows and may have blocked, but also a voip USA number which she does not know and another number, both same result so she has not blocked me, which means the phone is off..

&amp;#x200B;

I know the easy answer is to just forget about her and move on but the thing we had is just not that simple for me to just move on, I'm not here being sad for myself 24/7, but to just move on idk.

And It's not like I can go to Michigan to just look for her myself, that comes off as creepy first, secondly no can do due to corona, and thirdly is so inefficient it will take me ages.

I show up after my shift, cook us up some great dinner she’s being very clear about her intentions. So we’re eating and drinking and getting a bit too hot and bothered for the kitchen so I suggest we go back to her room.

Whenever they happen I usually freeze up a bit and because of that it’s ruined a lot of my “potential” relationships and a lot of hookups.

Anyways I was with Z and she was on top I’m munching away and things were going really well and she’s like perfect I swear to god. And out of the blue I had a flashback and I just froze I stopped munching my chest tightened up and I was breathing really fast and I just closed my eyes.

They start comparing me to a family friend my age (as parents do), but they don’t realize he’s only like that because he’s trying to lose weight, which I have already done a significant amount of without the activity (I tried to explain this to them but they ignored it, as they do sometimes). They tell me I should find some sort of sport or something and say stuff like “what kind of stories would you tell your kids if you’re in your room all day?”. I tried to explain to them that I merely don’t like those any outdoor activities (I genuinely don’t) and that I’m just not an outdoors person, but they stuck to their guns and held their ground.

559,"I already posted this in another place here on Reddit, but I'd be grateful if more people could help me.

Here's my story:

 

I (F/27) have an Instagram account to share photos of games I play and print screens. I have around 1K followers and most of them are similar accounts and mutuals. That's where I met B (M/34). He has a similar account a lot of mutuals too.

We started talking through DM's about the weather. We are from very different places with very distinctive weathers. He mentioned that once he visited a country very close to mine and send me some pictures of him and his friends while in said country, very tourist like photos.

He had his Twitter account linked in his profile so I decided to check it out. It was a personal account but not private, so I was able to see some photos. Most of them were of his dogs and of him hiking. I couldn't see his face but the body type matched the ones in the photos he sent me.

Later that week I made an Twitter account as well and shared it as an IG story. He started following me there but had changed a few stuff on his own account. He deleted the photos of him hiking but kept the dogs ones. He transformed his personal account into a more game focused one.

We started talking again around 2, 3 days ago, and he shared more personal stuff, like his job and more photos of him and his family. He did look like the same person from the first photos (but I can't be a 100% sure), so I didn't put much thought into that.

That's when things start to get a little bit weird.

We were talking about movies and I mentioned one I liked because my favorite illustrator of all time worked as a concept artist for that movie. I also said I had some art books from him and B said he also had a couple and that he'd show me. He then sent a couple of photos and one of them was clearly taken from Google because it had a typed annotation to the foot of the image, almost like an art website that shows art books. I didn't mention anything because to be fair, even I can take photos of a book from Google to show to a friend, if said book it's not with me at the moment. And he never said he was going to show his personal copies or that the images were from him, but I felt a little bit confused, not gonna lie.

Later, B talked about how he met this really famous band in a convention and how they gave him a signed copy of one of their albums. He then proceeded to show me a photo of the signed copy. I decided to save the photo and did a Google search using it and found the exactly same image on several websites that sell rare signed itens from famous people. (the angles, light, background, every detail was the same). Now, I think this is different from the whole book thing, since it's a signed copy, I believe people want to share the ones they have with them, not a random photo from Google just to illustrate it. So he was either lying about how he got the album or about the whole thing (I think that's probably the case).

After we talked, I decided to investigate the other photos (the ones of B and his family) the same way I did with the signed album, and didn't find anything, but that doesn't mean they are real...

Now, I'm not concerned about sharing any personal/intimate info because I'd never do that online to a person I have never seen in real life, but I'm worried about the ""lies"" and that he might be using photos from a random person on the internet that might not be aware of that.

* What should I say if someone just ""isn't interested"" in politics?  
* What's the best way of engaging in this discussion without totally alienating the other person? I tend to go a little hard when I talk to people about politics, and I don't think it's always the best approach...",25Oct2020,1

564,"I have 2 younger brothers and I’m the oldest. Our parents didn’t raise us to be “responsible” and because of this, this has caused me and my siblings to have some really bad habits. All I ever did in my whole life was pretty much playing video games all day. I’ve never gone outside, I’ve never done my own laundry, I’ve never washed the dishes, I used to never take a bath, and lastly I never brushed my teeth. Sadly, my 2nd oldest brother is way worse than me. All he ever does is stay in his room and play games all day. He never brushes his teeth, takes a bath, never does his school assignments, never does his own laundry, and he never cleans his room. His room smells so bad that even I refuse to sleep with him because his room smells bad. The worst part is that my mom is the one who has to clean the room. My brother basically relies on my mom to do his laundry, clean his room, and has to tell him to wake up for school. My mom does get mad but all she ever does is make empty threats. She says she’ll take away his phone if he doesn’t change but that really never happens so my brother continues doing what he’s doing. I’m honestly worried about him because I fear that by the time he’s an adult, he’s probably gonna be living on the streets. He says he wants to go to England and yet he really isn’t doing anything at all. I used to be sorta like him but I’m choosing to change my habits because soon I will go to college and I’ll need to learn how to my own laundry, learn how to cook, take a bath more often, brush my teeth, etc. Right now I’ve slowly changed, I’m not the same person I used to be in the past. I’m still trying my very best to change before it’s too late but I’m very worried about my brother. He doesn’t listen to my parents and I doubt he’ll listen to me. The only thing I can tell him is that,” If you continue with your bad habits, sooner or later you will struggle in life as an adult. Do not expect mom and dad to do all the things for you. You need to get your butt up and start thinking about your future and start changing your habits. If you want to be a dental receptionist then you need to start working because staying in the house isn’t going to do anything. Dreams don’t come true without work, you need to work to earn it.” 
I really can’t blame my brother for being this way, my parents aren’t even doing anything at all. All they’re doing is making empty threats. My mom isn’t doing anything because she says,” If he wants to be lazy bum, then that’s his choice. Let him be a lazy bum.” Should I just focus on myself and try changing my own bad habits, or should I try to encourage my brother to change his habits with me?",25Oct2020,1
565,"First time posting on here or anywhere since I'm kinda the quiet type of redditor. Anyway. This is extremely complicated so be aware of that.

My family is extremely against anything online. We're talking that when I was 10, I could barely talk in an online game without getting criticized. But when I was 11, I entered the world of online writing, friends and so forth and... Yeah.


It started off fine. I had just installed discord, and was friends with a bunch of people who, while they were older than me, were extremely kind. Keep in mind I did not share any information about myself, apart from my name, and even then not my last name. Smooth sailing for maybe a year before it all went to shit. 

Something happened which I don't want to go into detail about when I was about to turn 12, and my father found out about discord and reprimanded me, telling me that I shouldn't be on and it was a threat to my safety. I'm unsure whether my mom found out, or even now knows anything about this, since their relationship is a bit strained. 

I was heartbroken, since they were closer to me than my irl friends, and about 2 months later I pushed down my fear and redownloaded it in secret, but the damage was done and I was never as close to the first group of people again.

However, this is where I found the second group of people, who I will call KKT. KKT had others around my age (12 and a half at the time where I found them) and I had been talking with them prior to this for a while as well. I joined their discord server and though I was scared of my father finding out, it was too fun for me to care, at least for a while.

A year later, I met up with one of them, which was stupid yes but we lived quite near each other, and a lot of the others had also met each other and I had confirmed countless times that they were who they said they were. My dad found out but I fabricated a huge lie about how, we'll call her L, had been my penpal for a while and we recently exchanged phone numbers but I didn't tell him because I was scared of how he'd react. He bought it (I hope).

Cut to a month later, I started getting more and more scared of my dad finding out to the point where I was having panic attacks over it. I'm pretty sure at some point here I might have developed Anxiety or come close to it but I'm not sure, and I don't want to self diagnose because that's a shitty thing to do. 

It got worse over the course of another 3 or 4 months. Over these months I exchanged phone numbers (excluding L, I already had hers) with the people I had known for over 2 years, coming up on three. I told them about this and they encouraged me to delete discord, because if it was making me that worried it was better and I could still talk with them through WhatsApp.

I'm older now and it's been another year. Not all of the time frames are completely accurate, so sorry about that, but they are decently sized and should mostly be almost the same. Everytime I think about my dad finding out, I get absolutely terrified, and when I try redownload discord I just can't without feeling this huge sense of terror and dread.

But, I don't know what to do because it might be better if I just told them the truth, and it would be a thing off my mind, even though it scares me so much.

What should I do? I'm sorry for such a long post! And,  on the slim chance, anyone who knows who I am sees this, please don't do anything nor say anything. I maybe should have used a throwaway but it is too late now. Thank you!",25Oct2020,1
566,"Hi everyone,

I'm grateful for all advices I get, and thank you for reading.
Tldr at the end.

So, my grandmother passed almost a month ago. It hit me hard, and it was a lot worse for my dad. We feel like we share a connection, between us and my grandmother. We have no one to talk to about this, so now I'm here.

A little backstory: my grandmother was an extremely strong woman. Not only did she get 2 degrees in the 50s, which is unheard-of, in my country women were supposed to be stay at homes who serve their husbands. She married when she was 33, had my dad when she was 36, became the head of a microbiology and chemical forensics team for a whole county.
She broke her hip when she was 70, gave 0 fucks, underwent replacement surgery, danced out of the hospital. The first real crisis came when she was 86 in the form of a brain aneurysm. Doctors told us to say our farewells... And a week later she was back to normal and went home, just lost a few memories along the way. After that she was hospitalized because of multiple organ failure a few times, we used to joke that she pulls wild pranks. Then she broke her other hip, still went home from the hospital on her own two legs (she was 90 at that time). Then the final blow came, another brain aneurysm, but this time about 50% of her brain was destroyed.

Now this is where me and my dad come to the story. We are both convinced we felt when she stopped fighting and decided to die. The exact same moment. We thought that she's in a better place, or hoped so.
For the past week or so we have had dreams about her though. I've had dreams of her just standing in the door, when I woke up I had  an intense feeling of being watched. Today dad told me he had had dreams about her too. She was asking him to go look for her.

We don't know what the fuck is going on. We think she needs some help but don't know what she wants us to do. It's extremely bizzare she even asked for help, because she was the most badass woman I ever knew.
I've been looking for an explanation for a few hours but didn't find any.

Please please please, if there's anyone out here who believes in this sort of things or fucks with them one way or another, please tell us what to do.

Tldr: My grandmother was a badass, she died a month ago and since then me and my dad have become convinced she needs our help, but we don't know what we're supposed to do.

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",25Oct2020,1
567,"I have a really good job, good friends, and I am the planner—Whenever there is a large event like a house party or a hike, I plan it. 

Well ever since covid, I've been hanging with 4 friends only and haven't met any of the other ones. And my last relationship ended a month or so ago.

I have not met ANY girls during covid. After work (9 to 5), I head home, do my workout and hit the bed at 11. I feel weird about approaching a girl too, because hey it's covid. 


Can someone offer words of advice for this 23M?",25Oct2020,1
568,"Hi, so I live on a cul-de-sac with about 5 other neighbors. It's overall been an enjoyable living experience here except for the loud family I live next to. It's been mostly normal stuff they're entitled to do (enjoy their porch and deck as a family when it's warm out). And I've never had my sleep interrupted by them so no complaints there. 

But recently they put a new muffler/exhaust on one of their old cars and the sound of it is driving me crazy. Imagine the nice idling sound of a Toyota and then mixing it with the sound of a revving V8 Mustang,  and then mix a wheezing sound in. The startup of it can be felt through the walls of my house sometimes. 

If there's anything I can do to soundproof my home better can y'all let me know? Thanks.",25Oct2020,1
570,"Sorry if this is all over the place because I'm on my fourth cup of lemon balm (so I'm sedated/ not thinking straight) just as background I'm 15. Thanks for letting me rant for a little bit.

Since the start of covid we have had our grandmother living with us. Which would typically be fine for most people but I have resorted to eating/drinking out of plastic/paper plates because my grandmother does not understand how the dishwasher works even after several months. Its impossible to teach her to do or to stop doing things. For example giving my dog food which we have had to bring him to the vet twice at this point (hes fine now). And with that it brings a lot of stress into my family which is understandable but I feel like cannot be good for my mental/emotional health. This has resulted lowkey verbal abuse towards my grandmother which I hear maybe 3 times a week.

My brother in my opinion who has been basically the only person who was able to balance out our family has no gone to college. I feel greedy saying this but I truly miss him and I feel like I have feel almost into a depressive state without him. This along with the stress of my family/school has contributed to my anxiety, and possibly sadism (wanting to feel in control of something/ have power) which is terrible and thats a whole another story. Has lead to self medication currently.

My parents can both be extremly toxic at times. My Dad always tells me about his problems and more importantly how their relationship with each other is which is not good (getting a divorce). Which I fucking hate and have tried to tell him not to tell me but he basically has nobody else to talk to. But besides that i feel like my dad is really good (of course we get into arguments/fights but thats expected) also its impossible to have a normal conversation with him because you cant have any compromises with him if that makes sense. My mom I cant stand though. She's nice at times but so fake towards basically everyone. For example she was yelling at my grandmother for eating ice cream with her fingers (which is common) and idk how I feel about that because its very unsanitary. But something she did to me today was that she had the audacity to yell at me because I told her I would move my clothes later and also I said she should wait to throw out socks that dont have another pair for another day incase we find some which she went off on me for. Also she keeps pressuring me into having people over and Ive told her several times that I will do it later but she trys to be so envolved in my socail life its terrible she is the reason I've become antisocial. Hell with all of this shit I defiantly dont want kids or to be married which is a terrible outlook on life.

Something I hate about myself is that its extremely hard to process my emotions which has lead to the use of psychedelics to try and help me figure out what the hells going on in my life (which has failed) I dont know why but I'm rarely emotional and when I found out my parents were getting/considering a divorce I wasn't even crying hell I just sad. Keeping all of these emotions along with my anxiety, partial sadism, and developing depression will not be good in the coming years for my mental health but I'm at a loss for what I can do because I told my mom that I had bad anxiety twice the first time she said that she didn't believe me the second she told me just to ""read a book"". And if I tell my parents about depression or sadism they probaly will say the same thing and honestly I dont feel comfortable opening up with them about this. I wish I could figure out some way to solve just one of these things smh.

Anyways thanks for listening to my life story lol. Any advice is appreciated with what I can do thanks",25Oct2020,1
571,"Me and my friend Harriet have been friends for about 4 years. She’s a really good friend to me and I can talk to her about most things. We rarely get to see each other though because she works shift so when I do see her I treasure our time together.  

Last year I met a new friend called Stacey. She’s really lovely but we have very little in common. I opened up to her recently about my mental health and she kind of didn’t respond. I wouldn’t say we are that close. I introduced her to Harriet last year because I felt like that they would get on. They have loads in common and have hung out without me. Which is fine because they go running together. I don’t even run for a bus 😂. 

I want to meet up with Harriet next week because it’s been forever but I feel really guilty not inviting Stacey. I feel obligated  to do so though but I know that they will spend all night talking about their interests and I can’t join in. That hang out nearly every week and I don’t get to see Harriet that often. Is it cruel not to invite Stacey?",25Oct2020,1

573,"So I am a recent college grad 22 years old that live in a community of two houses. The house i stay in there are 3 people and the other house 4 people. Due to Covid, we do not allow any visitors and people have to quarantine full 14 days even if their test result is negative. I agreed to all these rules. Due to the restrictions both me and my boyfriend have, it leaves only an airbnb for a few days after Thanksgiving as an option to see one another as winter fast approaches. I had the understanding that as long as I followed the protocol I would be free to see or visit whoever I want, especially if they are social distancing. I have not seen my family for instance because they are not. My bf has asthma and social distances as well as I do.

 But instead, my housemates were like it may not be safe for me after the election traveling with him. And I was told by house leader if they can get back to me with a ""decision."" It rubbed me the wrong way but I wanted to give the  benefit of doubt that they would respect me as an adult and also go by their own rules. But now I've been sent news about how the covid rate is increasing and the house leader told me he had a friend who got covid from his girlfriend who got it from an asymptomatic person. Based on all this, I think they will say no we don't want you to go. But I of course want to go and plan to; i know if I don't I will have resentment but its also like not their choice to make for me. So im thinking about moving out, but not only for this reason. Its an accumulation of wanting/needing space, evenings to myself, saving money on rent and this has only compounded my desire to live alone or at least elsewhere.

Any thoughts?",25Oct2020,1
574,"So for context, i am 18 years old male and she is (I believe) 13-15 years old. I haven't seen her since my other cousins wedding about 3 or 4 years ago. Even then I didn't talk to her at all, we never really talked since I wasn't close with her like she was to my other twin cousins who are 10 now. I am the oldest of this generation of kids, and I feel so bad because I just saw her today, and it was awkward between us both. We didn't really talk or anything other than a few words to each other or walking by each other. I remember me holding her with utter joy when she was born and I vowed to protect her and be there for her, but I failed her. I wasn't apart of her life after I got into high school. I don't know what she does anymore, I don't know her age, her birthday, her interests, anything about her yet I love her so much. If anything were to happen to her, a boy breaks her heart or anything, I would deal with it, I want to be apart of her life and become close with her. I feel as though I have already lost my chance with that though.

I don't know what to do, I am not close with her anymore, she plays soccer, i sit and play video games. I don't know any of her social media, nor her phone #, it sucks that I feel so defeated as a cousin and a horrible human being. I want to cry and leaving the house today and driving home, I felt like I wanted to cry and I felt utterly distraught. I feel like I have lost my connection with her, with all of my cousins and that I will not be apart of any of there lives. I have never even met her younger brothers because I don't go to our families ranch which is where she is mainly at. They don't know I even exist except her. Just seeing the photo of me, a 5 year old holding her, my little cousin with the biggest smile on my face, and thinking from that time, and now, I am utterly destroyed.

575,"Hi everyone! This is a throwaway acc for privacy and I have copied this post onto several threads in order to get as much advice as possible. Now for context I am currently in a very loving and CLOSETED relationship (for safety reasons) which has been going on a year and a half now. While I do not label my sexuality, I am a young woman dating another woman and don't have much interest in men at all. 
Recently, I started friendly chatting with this guy (we'll call him D) and I've been in constant communication with my girlfriend about it (whom we'll call M). I send screenshots of our conversations sometimes, I'm open about when we talk and what about, etc. Now my girlfriend is very shy and she does not open up about her feelings very often - more a suffer in silence kind of girl. This is important.
Now as for D, he is wonderful. Growing up I was best friends with exclusively guys, so I cherish all the guy friends I have because there are never any feelings involved for me. D and I are super friendly, always on the same wavelength, and we talk about everything under the sun. I love conversing with him and he's very funny and generally a sweet guy.
On occasion he does flirt veryy slightly. I am always blunt, play stupid, or just ignore it and discuss a different topic. I constantly reiterate the ""friend"" part of our relationship as often as possible. He's always super respectful though, and seems to be on the same page.
My girlfriend is super supportive of our friendship. She's voiced that she's grateful for me keeping her posted and updated, and she says she has no problem with mine and D's friendship seeing as I'm not attracted to men. However, she is prone to lying about her feelings so as not to let on that she's upset. I worry that deep down she is concerned, but won't let on in fear of possibly ""sabotaging"" my new friendship or happiness.
Now, here's where I ask for help or maybe some insight as to what I may be able to do. I love being friends with D. I often imagine we'd hang out together once the pandemic seems to calm down. However, by continuing this friendship, would I be secretly hurting my girlfriend M ? Would I be hurting D by potentially leading him on, seeing as I cannot out myself to him as a means of explanation ? What can I do to keep my girlfriend feeling secure in our relationship while also being sure to not accidentally lead on a good friend without outing myself as gay ?",25Oct2020,1

577,"I have a niece, well more like a step niece because family complications but either way we've been friends since we were little. We are 6 years apart. I'm now an adult while she's a preteen. I have recently learned about self love for almost 2 years now and as supportive as my niece is in giving advice I realized something I've overlooked over the years during this family/friendly dynamic between us. My niece is quite blunt with no filter. Things she says tends to be really harsh and hurts my feelings but I never correct her for it. 

I know I should as her ""aunt"" that she favors but I guess being partly her friend I never could see myself hurting her feelings. I do know I deserve some if any respect from her. I know we've been friends for years but she acts like she knows me better than myself most of the time but in reality my niece sees the old me who hasn't changed. Same old pushover who gets bullied and is sensitive about everything. I'm fragile I know and have really strong feelings about whatever I'm passionate about but still I'm not the same person as before. At least to a certain degree and I don't need to prove that to her.

Idk. I just hate how she writes my character that way, that I'm always weak and all up in my emotions. Overly dramatic or sensitive. Even petty when most of the time I have a good reason to acting that way. She sees my problems as small matters that shouldn't affect me and that if it were her it wouldn't faze her one bit. Recently I was crying over a fight with my ex-best friend and my niece was like ""you shouldn't be hung over cause she was garbage anyway."" She was right but she was scolding me more than anyone about how I was reacting and that I'm dumb most of the time.

579,"TLDR: My parents enter my room at random moments and won't listen to me when I ask them not to do that because I have concentration issues, are they justified in doing that or not?

So recently the lock to my room broke and as a result my parents will randomly come in when I'm trying to do work. When they catch me on a break instead of doing homework like what they wanted me to do they'll start lecturing me about self-control and how my priorities are bad and how I'm supposed to be focusing on work. I've had concentration issues for a long time (I'm in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD but this got interrupted because of quarantine, though they're only agreeing to this because my therapist suggested it and think I just have an addiction to technology and need to focus on homework more) so I can understand where they're trying to come from, but it's still really annoying when they do.

I've asked them to knock, but this usually results in them knocking before immediately entering, and sometimes I can't hear them because I'm listening to something on headphones. I then tried to compromise with them by asking them to wait five seconds before entering but they refuse and keep claiming I'm only trying to make that compromise so I can hide evidence of me not doing work. They also won't let me fix the lock to my room (though I'm planning on fixing it when they're not around). I've been resorting to using a chair to barricade my door but they still manage to open it enough that they could see what I'm doing and also get angry at the idea of me trying to keep my room locked.

Am I crazy for being upset about this or are they justified? They're really close-minded so I highly doubt anything anyone would suggest will convince them to wait for me to let them enter.",25Oct2020,1
580,"So basically this girl she's very important to my life. She was the first girl I started talking to after my ex she's seen me at my best and at my worst and at one point she was the reason I didn't commit suicide. I thought she liked me tbh she fixed are relationship when I ruined it (it was 100% my fault. At the time I thought it was hers cuz she was hurting me but she didn't know cuz it was my fault for not telling her about certain things) but she popped out the blue one day and texted me and fixed are relationship. Overall she's a very kind and sweet girl she encouraged me a lot too hell she wanted me to make a youtube channel and said she'd edit for me since she does her stuff and she encouraged me to make my own and I helped her get over 100 subs too cuz I wanted to help her accomplish her dreams but back to the subject she also helped make me a better man too like when I accidently snapped at her (once again my fault not hers) over something small and dumb and she showed me that overwhelming kindness once again. Eventually I asked her out and confessed my feelings to her that I was in love with her and poured my heart out to her made some embarrassing jokes and quoted some song lyrics to her but all she said to me was was ""sorry I just dunno what to say"" and she proceeded to ignore me on everything, messages, instagram, discord, steam everything. I was very confused when it happened and didn't know what to do she didn't say yes or no just ignored me. I was expecting her to block me and unfollow me on everything but she didn't and still followed me and during the months she ignored me I'd catch her occasionally checking my insta stories and for some reason was still in my discord server even tho I was blowing her up with constant messages. Eventually she finally messaged me after about 2 months just saying ""so what u want"" and I told her I wanted to know why she ignored me for song long and I called her a mother fucker cuz it seem kinda obvious what I wanted to know lol and all she said was ""idk"" so I kept asking her over and over again why but she wouldn't answer and then she says ""fyi im taken now"" and ofc hearing this news just crushed me into a million pieces (my female friend said that she's 100% certain she's lying about that based on sum we saw tho) so I asked her once is that why she ignored me and she said no to my surprise but I wanted my answer so I kept asking why but she was acting strange she was cursing at me and putting me down and when me and her first started getting close one of the first things she asked me to do was to not curse around her cuz she hated cursing so to see her cursing confused me and broke my heart and for the girl who's built me up so much and saved me from suicide to put me down and curse just broke my heart so much. So I told her to stop cuz she's being rude and hurting my heart and this isn't like her and she said to fuck off and that I don't know the real her and she has masks and shit so I asked her to please tell me what's wrong but obviously she didn't. After a few days of arguing she finally said that I was the problem and out of everything I was expecting to hear that wasn't it but I told her that if I'm truly the problem to let me make it up to her then but she said no that if im the problem that I can't do anything about it but I told her she's wrong that I can do it that if im the problem I'll try my best to take a look at myself and fix all the ugliest sides to myself and do my best to better myself if it means to fix things with her but she just left me on seen after I said that. I messaged her a few more times about making up but all she would say is no and fuck off so I finally gave up and said fine if me fucking off would make you happy then fine I sent her my goodbye and said sorry for my flaws and ofc she left me on seen but then three days later she randomly sent me a meme for no reason and I got really upset with her and said like ""why are you doing this you told me to fuck off and I did your acting like im the worst person ever saying we can't ever make up and then you send me a meme trying to act all buddy buddy with me fuck off with that bullshit keep that same energy"" is pretty much what I said and as usual she left me on seen. I felt kinda bad so I said sorry for being harsh and sent her a cute lil video which she liked but she didn't say anything. After that I said a few more things but ofc she just said her favorite word fuck off and now she's back to ignoring me. 

Some other important details I forgot to mention earlier is she sent me a playful video of her pushing her stuffed animal to the floor telling me to go to simp jail very jokingly before she went back to being rude. She also refuses to block me too and her reasoning for not blocking me is because she only blocks ""pathetic degenerate fat fucks"" and I am not one of those. Also she isn't liking my usual jokes or when I'd make memes for her. She also unfollowed me and left my discord server that I had her added in after I called her a bitch and jokingly started simping for this other girl cuz I felt hurt that she ignored me for so long just to tell me she's taken and she said to me ""and friends don't call each other bitches"" and I replied to her ""and friends don't ignore each other for months."" And that if she didn't like me so much and that im so horrible she should of said so from the beginning instead of ignoring me. My thoughts on all of this was at first I saw her as the bad guy for ignoring me for being rude to me and purposely pushing my buttons to make me snap at her so she can call me the bad guy but the more I think about it I feel like she's doing everything in her power to make me hate her cuz comparing the way she's acting now to before are like two separate people. Im concerned something might be wrong with her mentally cuz some of her actions remind me of when I was hurt. I told her I loved her and I meant what I said and in all honesty idk what to do. Walking away would be the easy option but I don't wanna do that to someone I love. She's very confusing not upfront and loves to ignore me and idk what to do anymore. I don't see what she's gaining from all this all I see are negatives she's breaking my heart and making me hate her and being sad and concerned while she's getting 1000's of messages from me cuz I wanna just talk it out like normal people so I wanna get her attention and talk but she's so hard headed it must be annoying lol but she's holding up somehow. Someone help me or just tell me what to do im so lost and I don't wanna walk away just yet what do I do?

I was not informed on the proper care for a scar and it went from being a thread-like line to being up to 1cm in width in places, it's very pink, very bold, and it still itches. I didn't know you're not supposed to let a scar see sunlight or it'll be bright. It didn't use to bother me but I keep getting paranoia about it stretching further. How can I make it less pronounced and prevent further spread (if it's even spreading, maybe it's my imagination)?",25Oct2020,1
583,"Right so a bit of back story. 

I moved to England 3 years ago from Denmark (Scandinavian) I got a job straight away in a Caffe and have been there for 3 years now. 
My job is stable considering Covid, I am not in danger of losing it. 
I currently live in Tunbridge Wells which is a town South East of England. 

There is a Scandinavian shop/Caffe in London where I have been multiple times and it's a place where I feel like home and so comfortable in. I truly love it there as it reminds me of home and have all the food I miss from Denmark. 

I was shopping on their website and saw that they were hiring so I decided to apply for an interview. I went for the interview, they liked me and wanted to go for a second interview with the higher boss. 
At that moment my own Caffe had people leaving so I felt like I couldn't leave and told them that. 

A few weeks later they messaged me again from the Scandinavian Caffe and said they have another job that they think would fit me. 

My shop has gotten some more help with staff so I would be able to leave my job now. 
So now I just need advice if I should take it or not. I would absolutely love it I just worry about the traffic price which is £5000 a year or me and my fiance have spoken about the possibility to move closer to London. 


Pros: 
Feeling like home 
Scandinavian like me 
Amazing opportunity 
More money

Cons: 
The travel is expensive from where I live to London (£5000 a year) 
Will spend a lot of my day on public transport 


TL;DR:  I am Scandinavian, have a job offer from a Scandinavian Caffe, work in a Caffe now pros and cons just over this. 
Traffic cost will be expensive but I would earn more money. Or I could move closer to London.",25Oct2020,1
584,"My Boyfriends Nan recently passed, and today he said he was gonna spend some time with his younger sister, now his sister has a tendency to be a bit of a JNSIL, but that doesn't mean she doesn't deserve to have her big brother around when thier both grieving.
So for most of the day i only texted occasionally to make sure he was doing ok. 
Now all my other friends have been really busy today and i didn't really have anyone to talk to, i get that people have lives and it's fine.
However, i do suffer from depression and i ended up feeling really lonely today and eventually broke and texted my boyfriend. I just wanted to have a simple conversation with him.
How waa his day
What did he and his sister do ect..
He responded to 1 or 2 medsages and then just said He's chilling with Sister
And i know that basically means the conversation was over.
Now it might be because im just really emotional today but this really upset me
As 1. I just wanted ti talk to him, i wasn't trying to pull him away from being with his sister
2. Earlier in the day when i checked in to see if they where ok he said he was with his sister and couldn't talk, and then said his sister said to say that
3. Like i mentioned, his sister can be a JN, in the past she said to other people how she hates that I've stolen her brother and how we spend time together.

So part of me feels really bad for feeling up set and even a little jealous as thier grieving
But another part of me feels like his sister is using this to keep us from seeing each other or even talking to each other.
His sister is 27 and he's 29

So is ok for me to feel this way or AITA??",25Oct2020,1
585,"I was picking up my daughter from daycare, and where the sign out sheet was, there was a wallet.  There was a woman that walked out before me so I figured it was probably hers.

The teacher is bringing my daughter to me with all her stuffed animals and lunch stuff so it would have been a full armload plus holding her hand across the parking lot.

This is where i screwed up, i picked up the wallet and put it in my back pocket, and grabbed all my daughter's stuff and headed outside to talk to the woman.  

She's already heading back in and asks me if I saw a phone.  I say no, (I was going to say but I found a wallet) but she sees it and she cuts me off and starts blowing up about me trying to take it.  I hand it back and I keep trying to talk but she just keeps saying ""wow! Wow! Really?!"" Almost screaming, so I just panic and get in my car and leave. I'm not comfortable with  confrontation and this was getting really loud in front of my daughter.

Replaying the scenario in my head, it really does look like I stole it.  Theres a security camera that would have watched me pick it up and pocket it.  Now I'm terrified of running into this woman again or, even worse, if the daycare office thinks I legitimately tried to steal it.

I dont know what to do.  I know I should have stayed and tried to talk to her. I know I shouldn't have left since it made me look guilty, but it was just a really scary moment that was getting too aggressive.

What do I say to the office? The woman?  Should I even acknowledge it? Should I call and try to clear it up now or wait until someone confronts me?  I've been extremely anxious all day and I cant stop thinking about it.",25Oct2020,1
586,"So I've been friends with this person for about 3 years, and we've gotten along pretty well and have done a lot of things together. There was no situation where I felt like I was putting more work into maintaining the friendship or whether he was doing that effort too, but a few days ago I noticed my messages were not going through to him and my calls were going straight to voicemail.

It happened after the last presidential debate on Thursday, we are from opposite ends of the political spectrum and often discussed politics and debated different policy, all in a respectful manner and without demeaning each other. However, on Thursday after the debate when we were discussing some of the issues that were covered, I made a remark to him asking ""how would it work if you're such an expert?"" 

After I made that remark, I noticed he read it and my messages or calls haven't gone through since. I did some reading and called him using a \*67 bypass, and I have no doubt he blocked me. Out of respect for him, I've avoided sending \*67 calls over and over again and I've avoided using other numbers or my friends as an in-between to get in touch with him.

TL;DR at the bottom.

Yesterday I (f15) went to my friends (f15) house to hangout/talk because we hadn't seen each other in a while. We were having a conversation about her boyfriend and that she wants to break up with him. I was on instagram scrolling through his account, I don't even remember why, and I clicked on a picture when she said something along the lines of 'he's a fucking n-word'. She's white, I'm white and he is white too. I was shocked when she said this, so I said: why are you using the n-word? All she said was 'sorry' . But I don't think it was a sincere and genuine apology. Her other friends, that she knows from field hockey, are the kind of people that use this word/ these kinds of words and I know she will continue saying this and using other words too (the f slur, the r slur, etc.) maybe just not around me anymore. Also, this isn't the first time she said it (around me). The first time I just wasn't sure I heard it correctly but what happened yesterday confirmed it. 

I absolutely HATE it when non-black people say the n-word and don't understand how it can be hard to *not* use the word, now of course I am not black and have never experienced racism but I know it's important to call people out and recognise racism. I support BLM and try to explain to others why it's an important movement. She knows all of this but has said things along the lines of 'why are you so political' . 

This made me reconsider our friendship and I realised that over the years we have grown apart (we have known each other since we were 11 years old). We aren't interested in the same things and at school we have 0 lessons together. The weird thing is that I don't miss sitting next to her in class and all that. I think I might have been ignoring some red flags, but I'm not too sure whether they are red flags or not.   
Examples: she often uses her phone in the middle of our conversation, which really annoys me and I've said so multiple times but without succes;  
whenever we're talking she doesn't actually listen, she'll just respond with 'hm' 'yeah' 'cool' or **she** is talking;  
Like I said she uses the n-word and other terms which I dislike (and she knows I do so);  
she isn't 100% supportive of the lgbtq+ community (I think) because I recall her saying 'suddenly there are all these lgbtq+ people in shows/series/movies, and they are unnecessary. They're shoving it down our throats' and 'I support it but suddenly it's everywhere and it's annoying'. Meanwhile I'm questioning whether I'm bi or not so that doesn't sit right with me (she doesn't know this);  
she has this kind of negative energy surrounding her and hanging out with her soaks up A LOT of my energy which is very tiring for me. 

I am seriously considering cutting her off, but I don't know how to do that. I'm very bad at confronting people, asking why she said the n-word already made my stress level go up like 📈📈📈📈. I want to work on this but I don't know how, which is why I'm asking for advice.   
What should I do with my friend? How do I confront her? Are the examples red flags or not?

TL;DR : my /good/ friend said the n-word and uses other disrespectful terms which made me reconsider our friendship and if it's worth keeping it. I also realised we are growing apart. There are some other possible red flags that I ignored till now. I'm wondering if/how I should confront her and if I should cut her off or not.

595,"Im a fixer and want to help.  I’m not sure what to do or where to start. Apologizing in advance if it sounds like a rant... 

My younger sister (junior in college) lives with my parents. She has always had a bit of a temper and hard headed. It’s sometimes difficult to have a conversation with her, unless you agree with her, because she will shutdown, be dramatic, raises her voice and eventually starts crying. My parents (mid 60s to 70) help her with what they Can and more than any of us siblings have received before ... school, weekly allowance and any time she complains about her nails or hair- it’s like the world is falling apart if they say no. They are older and They just don’t have it in them to fight but I know she takes advantage of them. My dad continues to work and he wants to retire once she graduates college, yet she is taking her time as she’s a junior but in her fourth year or so. Granted, she transferred which she lost credits and she does do well in school. His job is not an easy one and it pains me to see him still working a dangerous job at his age with her acting so clueless or treating them in this manner. 

A month ago she left with friends and my mom went into her room and found marijuana. My mom called me crying. When she came home and they confronted her she just started yelling at them and instead started attacking them. They let her know that if she wanted to stay in their home she would need to be drug tested as long as she lives there. But i know this just causes them added stress. Her word recently is calling them ignorant or racist- which they are neither.... we are also Hispanic, not that it matters or need to reinforce that they are neither of those things she calls them. But being called that hurts my mom and she just cries and I know my dad is in pain although he may not show it. Apart from that she yells at them any chance she gets. They try to stay in different areas of the house because she makes them feel uncomfortable. My mom called me the other day and said that she didn’t want to tell me and she’s been acting like that for a while but now it’s causing my mom to go into depression. My heart breaks to hear my mom say this to me. She also shared that she’s been saying how she had a terrible childhood and that they ruined everything because she was not allowed to spend the night at friends houses and that she just gets in their face and yells at them . I do not know where this is coming from and that doesn’t seem to me enough to say that ruined a childhood. Maybe I’m wrong? 

Out of anger and distress. I texted my little sister that day and said that that she needed to stop. That she’s causing them pain and would hope that One day she’d recognize everything they have done for us. She instead has blocked me... it’s been two weeks and I’m still blocked as I tried to send her a link to get counseling. 

Because of covid I have not been able to fly home to see them. All I want to do is give them a hug and tell them I love them in person. But I just don’t know what to do to help them and my sister.",25Oct2020,1

I love the people and the culture, the people are lovely and amazing and so nice. But i'm not a big fan of the rules. Everytime they just tell me that ""everything is just a test of Allah"" and that ""after i die the real thing comes"". I don't wanna live my life following rules that make me unhappy. I don't want to think about the consequenses that come with every move i make. I want to live freely, i want to live like i want. I don't want to wear a hijab, i don't want to pray 5 times a day.. i want to be able to eat non-halal things i want to be able to actually wear clothing that *i* like.. i want to do things before marriage.  I want to be able to have a sleep over with my boy friends. Not only my girl friends.

 I don't even have any girl friends, i only have 3 boy friends that are my best friends. But i can't, since i am a woman. And since i am a woman, i can't do that because it goes against the rules of the religion. It's too much, i'm very unhappy and i don't like it. I became depressed because i couldn't do what i really want. Almost all the rules make me uncomfortable and make me feel like i'm only living as something pointless. I feel like i'm not allowed to do anything. I feel like everything i do is haram.

But... i only have one rule that i like: No eating pork. I actually became used to not eating pork. I never was interested in eating pork, so it isn't a big deal for me.

 Now, my parents have noticed that i'm VERY and VERY unhappy to be living like this. And i'm not sure if they got the hint of me not wanting to live like they do. I'm planning to tell my therapist about it, and ask for more advice. But since it's gonna be a long time til she actually comes by again to give me therapy, i decided to ask advice on here. 

I decided this for myself, because i was depressed. Not because of the religion itself but because i got bullied when i was younger, i'm being used since i can't say no and i'm lonley and i cut myself etc. Now my friend gave me advice to make myself feel better and live better. And i realised, that i need to make decisions to make me feel alive. That make me feel like i'm able do everything.. that make me feel like i'm free and happy.

They both reacted very mad and negative but i didn't care i wanted them to know what's going on and what i feel like. And now i'm taking my second step: Asking for advice on how to tell them.

Basically I was arguing with a previous employer for a few months over miscommunication regarding the corona virus &amp; that resulted in my job not coming back.

They have finally came around it seems and they have told me that they don't want me to fix it for free &amp; they will pay the market rate for me to correct the mistake.

In return they said they would ""draw the line under all this""

607,"I work in a big medical lab. I had some odd symptoms I thought were just a weird cold that would come and go, but went to urgent care Friday after work. They suggested a covid test because I had a mild fever. I’m still waiting on results. I can’t find any policies about what to do, but at my last company if you had any symptom but didn’t say anything and ended up positive, you’d be fired. I have only been here 2 months, and couldn’t find anything about the first 90 days probationary period, and haven’t heard anything of it. I’m just not sure what to email my manager. 


Hello,

I went to the doctor Friday who suggested a covid test. I have not knowingly been in contact with anyone, but had unattributable symptoms, and am still waiting on results from Friday’s test. I could not find any company  policies about this, and wanted to defer to you in case there is something that wouldn’t allow me to work tomorrow if results are not in.

608,"Hey everyone,

I'm 16 (in high school, grade 11) and I live with my mom, step-dad, two step-siblings, and an older brother in a very small town of about 3000 people. I've never really enjoyed it here. Going to school with the same group for 12 years, working for a small business, being part of small-town gossip, having difficulties being myself, and getting very little opportunities are all reasons why it's never really been an enjoyable experience for me. I don't have a ton of friends here either. Sure, I know pretty much everyone since only about 65 kids go to my high school, but I don't have many close friends here as I do out of town. COVID made it worse since I wasn't able to travel to see other friends as much as I used to be able to.

My aunt, uncle, and grandparents live in a bit of a bigger town close to a major city (where I would like to study for post-secondary) that's only 6 hours away from here. In my free time, I really like spending time there to visit them, explore the city more, get a break of my small town, and see my friends who are studying/living there. Since last year, I've had the idea at the back of my mind to move in with my grandparents to finish high school there. It wasn't really a logical idea at the time because of the pandemic and other factors, but now that I'm in grade 11 and still having a hard time, I decided to think a little bit more about it. I made a pros and cons list (pros include: new friends, adapt to the city before I go to university, possibly better grades in a bigger school, a fresh start, overall better mental health, etc.) (cons include: having to quit my job, restart my social life in grade 12, not at home with my immediate family, etc.) After doing that and talking to a few friends about it, I came to the conclusion that it is a logical idea that would be super beneficial for me.

I know having the conversation with my grandparents about moving in with them would be relatively easy since they've always offered me to move in if I ever go to a university near there, so I doubt a year earlier would be much of a big deal. However, I'm worried about having the conversation with my mom. It's something we've briefly talked about last year, but she says she would hate letting me move out before she absolutely has to. She also mentioned that I have two years left of high school and when I graduate, I'm free to go wherever I want. But, I just want to have one year of high school when I'm still young and not stressing about getting older to just have fun and be in a better environment. Sometimes she makes it seem like I want to leave her too, but that's not the case. I tried mentioning it a few weeks ago, but she brushed it off saying we would talk about it when the pandemic is over (which could be in years for that matter)

Moving out to do my grade 12 elsewhere is a decision I want to make fairly soon since there's a lot of little things I need to figure out and deal with before going ahead doing it (like resigning from my student job, transferring credits to my new school, etc.) So, how would I go about having a real conversation with her about it? How would I convince my mom to let me make that decision? How do I tell her it's not about her?",25Oct2020,1
609,"I think this is going to be long.

Okay,it's 2019 and i'm a 17 y/o boy just entering into the adulthood by exploring into \*politics\* and this was the time when there were protests being held by the students against the CAA law in India.

So i go research a bit,find that the argument by the left is pretty much convincing and more humane.the people ruling here wanted the power to determine who lives here and who doesnt.I had it pretty clear in my mind that this is [wrong.so](https://wrong.so),during the news time me and my father had a debate about this thing and he's a huge right wing guy he sounded how the people in naz! germany would sound against the jews.

Here,India-pakistan is same as [US-mexico.you](https://US-mexico.you) dont want any more people or hate them who are already [here.Me](https://here.Me),instead of supporting my father went against him and from that time we dont talk too much.

My mom usually says this when i quarrel with her,""what your dad does to you is correct"".I think he is avoiding me for being me,make sense?

Anyways,from that point he's more inclined to him that he ever was..why? I think he does this so that one day i understand how much i crave his attention.hah! that worked.

I talk more to my security guard than to him.sometimes its frustrates me that why am i even here.i kind of give way to the fact that i have a younger brother and he needs more care but this is not how it was when he was her then!

Recently,an actor and many famous people committed suicide here in India and that always becomes an ending point of my mom's arguement with me.""So many people killed themselves,why dont you jump of the building too?""...the end.its so often that i dont even cry anymore.

Also,I'm going to start college and they dont want me to live in a hostel even if they can afford [it.it](https://it.it) just makes me sick cuz i dont want to just walk out my house one day.i have no choice

He's a total drunkard,always into news and doesnt give time to family turns my 7 y/o brother against me and calls me a \*zero\* cuz i dont talk to his kins.

610,"Greetings to everyone reading this !

I honestly have no idea how to start describing this, but let's start from beginning. 

My brother (25) was for life without girl, happy to pay for ""special services"" and similar. He is bellow average IQ and not always the sharpest tool in a shed. In July this year, he found his new ""soulmate"". 

In just 2 weeks, he moved out to live with her (40) who happens to be mother of 7 children, known to abusing those kids, happily providing other mans while being in relationships and has a jail knocking on her doors due to that abuse. 

Just month and half after he left, he happily announces that he is now in fact engaged. So we started digging a bit around. She in fact is mother of 7 ""kids"", 3 of which are now adults (18-23) while 4 are still minors (4-10) .

As she worked in retirement home i have found out that she got fired for neglecting patient needs, bringing other men to her shift for fun time and for sleeping at work. Also she worked extra hours to pay back the loan she took from owner of that retirement home. 

Here comes the problematic part. Just a week ago we found out that my brother is gonna become dad. He seemed a way to happy about that as he believes everything she says to him. Him being a father is one thing, but what about those other minors that she have ? They are adopted by social services to other families for as long as she can't prove that she is capable of taking care of them. 

Is this new kid that's on a way his or not, we can't know until he asks for DNA test which i doubt he will ever request. My mom even tried to talk him out of that woman since we all but him can see right through her. 

Then today happened. We invited them all on lunch to bring all the facts together and to see if she is capable of anything with new kid while others are still not back at her place. Dinner went terribly wrong. Brother came alone, as we suspect, she found out about our intentions. So from one hand mom just lays everything out as she broke. He rushed out yelling that we should never contact them again. 

Some other facts:   
\- my brother lives on minimum wage and he is sure as hell not able to raise that kid on his own without terrible case of poverty  
\- from Facebook i found that she is in debts over her head  
\- also  from Facebook i found out that she did exactly the same thing to at least 4 other guys she was with  
\- he was planning to get house by getting money from loan-sharks as he doesn't trust banks and can't get high enough credit  
\- one of our neighbors got killed by other loan-sharks 3 years ago and was found out rotten in his own house after a whole month so we are scared for him  
\- brother doesn't believe a word to anyone or anything that is against his soulmate and is not capable of listening of any of the facts or evidences.

620,"*Sensitive content* (throwaway account) I’ll try to be discreet but direct... (31F)

Backstory: A couple of years ago, my husband (32M) went through a phase where he would grab my phone during intimate times and take a vid (I didn’t love the notion, but technically I consented). Nothing that really showed our face, and mostly short clips; there were about 3-4 vids total. I really didn’t like or want to keep the vids, so temporarily placed them in a hidden folder on my phone.

A couple months had passed, and frankly I forgot the vids existed. One day, my son began to ask some strange questions and tell me about the “silly” vids he found on my phone (5-almost-6 at the time). I immediately knew what he was referencing; he had somehow wandered into my hidden photos, and saw [some of] the vids. My heart sank, and there was a pit in my stomach. I felt like the worst parent ever...I had failed my child, and probably ruined him forever. Hubby and I did research on the matter, and just kept a keen eye/ear to any odd behavior from him, and were open to and ready for further questions or thoughts from him on the subject. Seemingly, he forgot about it, and has never brought it up since. I, of course, deleted the vids (and the recently-deleted pics too). I now have a passcode/Face ID on my phone, and never ever take any type of “risqué” photos/vids. 

Fast forward to YESTERDAY. My daughter (6yo) had been bugging me about “where babies come from”, so I read her a book called “it’s not the stork” about how babies are made and grow (book made for 4 years+, so wording is very safe and designed for young children, but does provide a factual delivery). Then she says, “oh yeah, I saw a video where you and daddy did that. Back when I was probably 4.” ......um. MORTIFIED, yet again. I thought she was spared, but it turns out they both watched the video(s) TOGETHER at the time that it happened. I acknowledged the video, said that I was “a bit embarrassed and sorry she saw that” (obv a severe understatement), and told her I am glad she told me (and that she could come to me when she has questions or encounters something like that). I probably seemed super chill on the outside, but I felt like throwing up I was so upset. 

The only articles I find on the internet regarding this type of thing are 1. when children encounter porn and the mental harm that can come with any mistreatment of women, etc (which was not an issue in these vids), or 2. walking in on parents and how to handle it. This somehow feels different—a hybrid of sorts. 

I’m sure someone on here will agree I’m the worst and should have been more careful; I would agree with them. This mistake is eating me up. I feel I have failed BOTH of my children in this department. They seem completely un-phased by it. I’d love to think I didn’t ruin my kids’ brains, but also/MOSTLY want to know the truth on how this may affect them, and how I should handle this now; or whether (though embarrassing) I’m totally overreacting.

644,"Last weekend my boyfriend and I were exposed to coronavirus, and since then we've been quarantining together, figuring we'd already been in such close contact, kissing, etc. that if one of us had become infected we must both have it. He's been showing some symptoms, while I pretty much only have fatigue. His results came back positive, and today mine came back negative. 
I'm wondering if it is worth it to get re-tested at this point and if us having different results actually makes sense. Although I feel mostly fine, I find it hard to believe that I don't have it since we've been in very close contact with eachother this past week while quarantining together.",25Oct2020,1
645,"For the past 2 or so years, ive been a social recluse, i was taken out of school because being there made me so uneasy, it felt like everybody was staring at me and were secretly laughing at me, I basically had mental breakdowns every morning because of it. After this, I would stay in my house for months at a time, never interacting with anyone in real life other than my family (who I live with because im a minor). This past week, I went out into public for the first time in a long time, but I couldn't be out for more than a few minutes before I started to get the same feelings I had at school. I don't know whats wrong with me, and thinking about it is something i've put off for a long time, but now I realize that I really need to fix myself. I was thinking of attending school again, but even going on the website made me really nervous, the thought of being in a classroom with other people makes me feel sick, my entire body will shake.

646,"I (21 M) have depression, with my medication I am taking I feel normal, every so often I still feel way down and unmotivated to do things. This weekend is one of those weekends.

I literally did not leave my bed yesterday at all and the night before I had a panic/anxiety attack (I don’t know the difference) which was bad enough I had to take the special medication my doctor said to only use when I’m having an attack.

It’s days like today that remind me i don’t have very many friends that are available at my college campus to hang with and that I am extremely lonely and haven’t been in a relationship since I was a freshman in high school (I’m now a senior in college).

And now to make it worse, my cousin passed away in a car accident in August and now that gets added on and I feel sadder.

647,"I have no idea why I constantly hear this but everyone says if you don't kiss a girl the first time, then you permanently set the scene for how she thinks of you. I think this is wrong, my opinion is, if at that current given time if you are liking a girl who is very rare to find and you hang out and don't kiss that is a good thing. If she hangs out a second time with you than it is because she is curious and wants to see if she truly wants to go farther, at that point than go for it.

648,"So, after years of consideration we decided to.adopt a rescue dog- we love dogs and decided we wanted to add to our family. 

We got a 1 year old dog a few weeks ago, and he was adopted from an overseas shelter. We spent a while researching him, and looking at how we would accommodate him and potential problems 
Now he is a lovely natured dog, but he has real issues with seperation anxiety. We have been trying to address it, with training and doing the usual stuff the experts tell us (we have employed a behaviour expert) and its just not working. 
The problem i have is that this is starting to affect my mental health, the lack of sleep is really making me anxious, and really struggling a bit wife life. I have suffered from anxiety my whole life, and on the whole its manageable but now its becoming a daily issue.
I think its best for my own health, if we rehome the dog - if this continues i really worry were I will be in few months with both physical and mental health.
I feel rotten for making this decision,but I feel its the best for myself and the dog in the long run. 
Only issue is my wife is really attached, and I don't know how to persuade her without breaking her heart as she's so attached.",25Oct2020,1
649,"So I'm 19 years old suffering quite badly with acne and &gt;very&lt; oily skin

I've tried so many different products that are the ""go to's"" for acne. I've tried direct treatments, cleansers, scrubs, creams, just about everything and nothing seems to be helping

I've never had a super strict skin care routine, I find them quite hard to stick to. At the moment I'm using a witch Hazel based toner, niacinamide 10% zinc 1% twice a day and pimple patches for worse spots but the niacinamide serum seems to be making my face produce more sebum and my face is a lot more shiny and oily since starting to use it

Are there any effective products on the cheaper side that help with oil production and make your face less shiny and oily and/or help reduce breakouts and acne
My skin is not sensitive and has never reacted badly to any ingredients, very oily, prone to breakouts and acne as well as scarring 

I'm open to anything that isn't too expensive and that will help

651,"I’m sorry if this is too long, but I had to get this off my chest. 

I never got an “I love you” from my dad. I never got a, “How are you son? Everything alright?” Never. And my mom, only saw me as her middle child son, and never gave me the time of day to come to her for comfort and love. My parents never really cared about my emotional well-being. They raised me, yes, and they took care of me, but they never cared about my emotional and social development. They only cared about the value I could produce in society so they would be perceived as “good parents”. They never sat me down and talked me through any personal problems I had to deal with in my life. They never provided guidance while I was growing up. I had to take life head on and learn solely through trial and error. Now, I’m 22 and I’m a pretty tough/intelligent man now because of it. I learned to think with my head instead of with my emotions. I’ve been in situations where I probably wouldn’t have made it out in one piece if I didn’t have the grit and wits that I carry now. 

But, all that being said, their lack of empathy towards me has caused me a lot of problems. I can’t open up about my feelings to anyone. I can’t put my trust into another person’s hands when it comes to telling them how I feel, because I never had the opportunity to do it growing up. And the few times I did try, my trust was always betrayed. So, my protective shell has only gotten thicker. Also, because I never had anyone to open up to, I allow people to open up to me. Something about me makes people feel comfortable venting and talking about their problems. Since I tend to see the world through a logical and fact-based POV, many people come to me for sound and solid advice. I tell them like it really is, not just what they want to hear. I try to be as helpful as I can since I don’t want them to have to carry the heartache of not having anyone to turn to for guidance. I don’t want anyone to feel the way I felt growing up. But, now I carry the weight of breaking down everyone’s problems and offering constant guidance, but I can’t release the weight of the problems I carry within myself. 

The point in trying to make here is, don’t be afraid or ashamed to speak up when you have a problem. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. If there is no help from the ones who should be helping you from the start (Dad,Mom,family,friends,etc) you need to seek it out elsewhere, or put your foot down and make them listen. I sure wish I did when I was younger. Don’t be like me, don’t hold everything inside for so long that you almost become numb, and don’t allow yourself to be the shoulder to cry on or the emotional crutch everyone comes to only when they need guidance. It will make you tough, and you will be resilient, but there are better ways to become that. Take time to listen to others, but make sure they take that same time to listen to you.

654,"I have a friend who is clearly an alcoholic. He drinks heavily every other day on average and it is starting to seriously affect his life. I lived with him and his GF over the summer and just moved out. Here is what I noticed. 

1. He drinks very heavily three or four times a week.
2. he comes home very late after work, sometimes three or four hours after he got off. drunk
3. he proceeds to make all sorts of noise and wake me up, sometimes barging into my room to have a drunken ramble about whatever is on his mind. 
4. he gets into constant arguments with his GF about silly shit, but almost always devolves into verbal abuse with her and making her feel worthless. 
5. he confronts people when he is drunk about all sorts of random stuff. the slightest thing her perceives as ""against him"" blow up into arguments and him becoming upset. 

A few weeks ago I decided instead of confronting him about this stuff that I would simply move out. Trying to talk to him about this shit always results in him becoming upset and somehow flipping the blame on you. I wanted to remain his friend but simply distance myself from the chaos and do so in a socially graceful way and to just move out with no hard feelings. the week leading up to me moving out was replete with him pulling me aside to ""have a talk"" where he would always ask why I was leaving and if it was anything he did. Instead of starting shit I just would always say no, and that I just wanted to give him and his GF space and that it was time for me to be moving on anyway. 

The night before I left his GF and I were talking while he was at work and she basically admitted to me that she understands why I am moving out and that she hopes he gets better when it is just the two of them. Instead of keeping up the soft lie of saying I was moving just to give them space I decided to commiserate with her for a while and to just vent a bit. We talked about how he becomes upset at the slightest things, especially when he has been drinking, and that telling him the truth, that he was being a terrible roommate and is clearly an alcoholic, would have just sent him into a rage and made things worse. She is a good girl and deserves far better than the treatment he gives her, and I thought she would appreciate the fact that at least someone sees what she is going through as well, and perhaps from our conversation gain the strength to stand up for herself a little better and not put up with his bullshit. 

Unfortunately she used it against him in some sort of he said/she said thing and now he is texting me stuff about how I am two faced and lied to him and yada yada yada. This makes me feel worse for her than anything. She is like a whipped dog that cannot help but tell him everything anyone said that was not praiseworthy of him. on a side note. Why do some women fall into this trap? they find a guy that treats them like they are lower than a snakes ass and yet stand up for them and defend them at every turn? madness. 

anyway. this is more of a vent than anything, but if you have any advice for me I would be glad to hear of it. For right now I am just ghosting him and not responding to his texts. It is uncomfortable but I just don't see anything I say making the situation better. He is after all, correct. I did lie. I moved out because he was a drunk belligerent asshole. Fun to hang out with once in awhile if he is in a good mood, but living with him is a nightmare. I just get the feeling that telling him that would have been the incorrect choice, and that moving out with social grace was the way to go.

656,"This is going to be long, just a heads-up.

I live in Romania and I'm a 20 year old male. I have come to profoundly hating this country. There's hundreds of reasons, but to sum it up, the standard of living is low, corruption is high, wages are low, even for high skilled workers and future perspectives are close to non existent. I live in a dead city, in a dead country.

I do not know what to do. I'm currently in my 2nd year of university (a 3 year course) and I'm studying psychology. While I still like psychology, I highly doubt this unviersity is for me (Romania is renowned for a very bad education system). I feel like I'm going at full speed towards a nightmare. I need a way out.

I've wanted to move for many years, but only recently have I become aware that if I don't, I'm a dead person (figuratively and literally). At this rate, I'll succumb to insanity in a few years. I need a fresh start, whatever it takes. I don't know where to start, though. I'd love to move to the US, for example, but other well developed countries are also an option. What can I do in this direction? I have no idea which way to go. I know for instance that for the US the immigration process is hard and if someone would illuminate me on what's the most efficient way to do it, I'd be eternally thankful. Also, the same applies for other developed countries, not just the US. ANY advice at all is vital to me.

As for a few random other details about myself that may be relevant, as I've said I'm currently studying psychology (sadly in a place that makes me want to drop out every single day, but at the moment I don't really have alternatives). I also speak Romanian, English and German fluently, if this is of any importance.

I don't know how many more years I could last here. If I had an opportunity to leave and have a relative confort insured (aka a job, the means to live independently more or less) I'd drop everything and leave now. I want a fresh start somewhere else, where I can actually hope for a bright future, somewhere where no one knows me and I can start all over without my past failures or my paranoia and anxiety dragging me down. 

What is the best option for me? Where  and when do I go and what do I do to succeed in my plan of starting a new life? I know this is pretty vague, but I need to hear as many options as possible because I've postponed this for far too long. I don't want to reach the point where doing this will get harder or impossible. This is a change that I owe to myself and I have to do everything in my power to do it. I am aware some options do take hard work and determination, but I'm willing to put 100% of my effort and concentration into this as it's my only chance.

Any advice is immensely appreciated. Thank you in adance.",25Oct2020,1
657,"Alright, this is gonna be a very personal one.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help, i honestly do, idk what i'm doing anymore. I get this feeling in my chest, it starts in the bottom of my throat and it creeps down, and it makes me feel like shit. Before i get into more i would like to include some backstory, I'm a 17 year old, i'm 6'2"" i weigh 160, i like to view myself as fairly attractive, i'm in a vocational school for Building Trades, i really enjoy it. That feeling i get, i've only had twice in my life, once was when my cousin killed herself, i was at school one day and i got pulled out of class and there were two cops and my parents and my sister. I was taken to the hospital where she was being kept. She had been there for me year after year and she got pregnant and felt like her life was over, and i got that feeling for the first time, i was in a dark dark place for a very long time. I remember when it went away, it was because i met a girl and she made me forget about everything but her. 

I started vaping at the age of 16 before freshman year, and i've been hooked ever since, for reference i'm in Junior year now. Me and the girl lost touch and we fell apart and i got over that pretty quickly. I got a job at a McDonalds and i met a girl who i loved, and still do and would die for and i still would die for her, but her boyfriend doesn't trust or like me, and makes it so she cant hang out with me, and basically controls her life. And me and the girl whose bf doesn't like me were best friends for 6 months straight, we would spend every day together for the 6 months before they started dating, we'd fall asleep on FT together and i was in bliss.

Well, when we were hanging out she told me that before then she felt like she was wasting her life, and she felt like when we would hang out she didn't feel like she was wasting her life anymore. But after her new bf came along she feels like she is wasting her life again because he makes it so it revolves around her.  He has made it clear that me and her will never hang out as long as they are together. He tried to make her kick me out of her life, and he threatened to leave her, when i heard her tell me that, i told her, dont risk your relationship for me. She didnt want me to step out of her life, but i wasnt going to risk her relationship so i could have her in my life. I would rather her be happy with her boyfriend and me be fucking crushed without her than have her in my life but make her crushed. Well, we said our goodbyes, i told her id always love her and always have her back and if she ever needed something to text me, and she sent a paragraph to me that had me fucking sobbing while reading it. For reference im not an emotional guy, at least i dont show it, i didnt cry before that for a year or two before it. That went on for two days, and then she told him that her life doesnt feel right without me being in it. Those two days were some of the worst ones in my life.

Not being able to hang out with her makes my life so fucking boring, every day id wake up actually have the motivation to get up and do stuff to make myself a better person, without having her there for me, ive not had the motivation to do anything, i now sit in my room, sad playing on my computer for days on end just to not have to think about what i dont have anymore. Everyday me and her both wish we could go back to the old days, when things were fun, when we wanted to be awake. But honestly idk what to do anymore because i dont have anything that i can replace that with, nothing will ever be able to replace that, i fucking loved her with all my heart and now i cant see her. I just want to have that back, idk what im doing anymore, honestly, its really fucking me up, the nicotine used to numb all my pain but it doesnt numb this, nothing numbs it its always there, playing on my computer makes it not so bad but its still there in the back of my throat making it hard to talk.

I just want to be happy again, i dont want to be sad anymore, ive been sad ever since i wasnt able to see her i just want to be able to be happy, to be able to see her, to be able to just-- I dont know, just to not be depressed anymore and idk what to do, i smoke weed and i vape, i dont drink i dont do anything harder than those.  I just want to see her, when i used to hang out with her we would hang out for 8+ hours on a boat with her family, and i wouldnt crave nicotine whatsoever, but now it feels like nicotine is all i can think about, well, nicotine and her. I need help, im in a really dark place and i dont want to talk to anyone else about this because im scared about what their reaction will be. I just need help.",25Oct2020,1
658,"I'm in my senior year of high school, and I feel like I've missed out on learning tons of real world skills that will be useful to me as an adult. My parents won't teach me how to drive, they won't allow me to get a job (even though it can help me gradually strive closer to independence and help me gain job experience and work ethic), they've barely taught me how to cook, all because they seem to try and make every aspect of my life based around education. Over the last 4 years I've received countless punishments for not having exceptional grades, and they've gone as far as threatening suicide if I didn't get accepted to a prestigious college (despite it not having any of the majors I want). They also refuse to acknowledge the student debt crisis or the fact that I will have to take out over 100k in student loans if I go to a private university, and keep saying that it's a ""future problem"" that shouldn't concern me now. I feel like my parents don't appreciate me enough, because they're caught up in some kind of fantasy that I'm destined to be a perfect student and get mad at me when I don't satisfy that fantasy. The truth is, I'm tired of school and everything in it. I'm tired of being forced to pursue something I will never be that good at. I'm tired of being refused anything and everything that even dares to not fall in line with my parents' fantasy. I'm tired of my parents not appreciating me for what I've already accomplished. I'm not some held back junkie who fails all his classes (hell I've never even done drugs), I worked hard for my grades even if they're not good enough for my parents, and I want to be able to pursue things outside of school that will also be greatly beneficial to me in life (like knowing how to drive).

661,"I don’t even know how to start with this. I’ve been unemployed since I graduated in May. Submitted tons of applications to no avail. Finally I get a response from two firms, get interviews, and get both jobs. I picked one because it was remote (or so I was told) and paid more. 

At no point during any of my communications with the team was I told this job would require in person meetings. I was explicitly told it was remote on multiple occasions (always over the phone or video though). I find out literally the day before I’m supposed to start that they expect us to meet at a certain location, and only give us an hour to get there (since there is remote work to be done beforehand). The location is a two hour commute for me- even if by someone chance I missed the fact that there were supposed to be in person meetings (which I highly doubt I would’ve missed), I certainly would not have missed the location. 

I reached out to the supervisor seeking clarification, and she was not at all kind about this- she insisted that she had mentioned this and blamed me entirely. I think I’d have to be the biggest idiot in the world to have missed the fact that I’m supposed to make a two hour commute in one hour, and I think the words “fully remote position” aren’t really up for interpretation, but I ended up just apologizing for the misunderstanding because I don’t want her to contact other companies badmouthing me or something. I also suspect they lied about the salary, because the paperwork suggests le thing entirely different from what I was told in the interview, but since I left the job I can’t confirm that.

So now, I’m pretty much lost. I was depressed earlier for being unemployed, so getting a job was a saving grace. I told other people about it, my parents (who are not at all happy about my employment situation) were thrilled, and I felt like I was finally getting my life together. Now that’s all gone. I can handle telling my friends, but the prospect of disappointing my parents again and going back to square one is killing me inside. I don’t even know what I’m looking for in terms of advice, I just needed someone to read this. Thanks. 

TLDR: I finally got a job after months of unemployment, found out the day before I was due to start that the conditions for the job were totally different than what I was told, had no choice but to quit, and am now depressed about returning back to square one (disappointing my parents, being unemployed, having no prospects...)",25Oct2020,1
662,"So I recently moved into uni dorms and these girls came up from the dorms bellow and one instantly caught my eye. We ended up sleeping together (she was my first). And just for context I have bad social anxiety so the fact I was comfortable enough to sleep with her and talk to her about stuff that I’m not able to open up to my family about played a big part in why I fell for her. 

So we slept together 2 more times and always texted each other things like I just want to be with you rn. And it feels like it’s been ages since We last saw each other. I ended up telling her I wanted us to be together and she rejected me saying I really like you and like spending time with you but I’m not looking for a relationship right now. 

I dealt with this badly since I’m insecure and kept asking her why she didn’t want to be with me. I know clinginess is unattractive but my head was a mess and I couldn’t get over her, I thought knowing why she said no would put my head at rest so I could move past it. But she never gave specific reasons and after repetitively asking her to talk with me about it, I could tell I’d put her off and we started talking less.

Because I was in so much pain and could tell I put her off, I told her I was over her and that I just wished I never told her how I felt and that it was stupid of me. She said it wasn’t stupid and we should pretend like it never happened. We do talk now but on a less regular basis, I try to give her space and haven’t spoken to her in a week. I’m really not sure how to repair this and don’t what she’s truly thinking. Maybe an outside perspectives will help me understand.

Hello everyone, something happened to me a few days ago and its been BUGGING me ever since.
At my job we have this thing where anytime a trainer trains people for the first time, they'd have a somewhat experienced trainer stand there just to help out if the new trainer is a bit lost.

I've had expereince training people in other departments at my company so for me it wasn't a huge issue. I've been told I'm quite good and someone who can be relied upon! But since it was my first time doing this department training specifically
I obviosly wont be as experienced. But heres the thing, I started off extremely well! I was confident, articulate, charismatic, and the people I was training
were engaged! I felt on top of the world!

.....now heres where things went to shit. The ""experienced"" trainer who was there to watch over me has an attitude problem. For some reason she has a rude bitchy attitude.
I'm not sure how the women at my job can stand her but many of the guys despise her. I never understood why, until now. So when I was training and about to explain something,
just to show her ""knowledge"" she'd cut me off and explain her way. At first I thought....hmm thats odd. Then she did it again.....and again.....and again.....
At one point I said, please I got this. And she didn't like it. Of course at this point my confidence grew less and I started to stutter. My trainees began to lose
interest and thought I was a fool and should only be listening to her. The bitch started to laugh/chuckle at me when my nervousness increased, and ridicule me. My words couldn't
come out right and my confidence went down. At one point my nerves got the best of me and I gave up, and just didn't want to be there anymore....a very shameful feeling.

Right after the presentation, I thought hey maybe I can pull this off now :). And I started well.....then the bitch started again! OH YOU FORGOT THIS, OH THIS THAT,
like eff off jesus Im about to explain it. Shes not being helpful at all. At one point she wanted to seperate one of the trainees from me because she felt I couldnt handle both

Then heres the funny part, the trainee I took on learned the material better from me because of my calmer teaching style. He understood everything I taught and was able to do well, especially for a new hire. And he thanked me saying I'm a good teacher.
The other guy didn't as much. Later when she left and was under my care, I tried to show him the proper way of doing things but he wouldn't listen. He was convinced I'm stupid and the rude trainer knew better.
He had poor performance rates the rest of the day and whenever I tried to help he'd cut me off and say yeah sure I got it. I then realized whatever and moved on.

The next time I train she wont be there and I'll know what to do better. I'll be more confident and will have more control. But my question is how can I deal with these types of people?
How can I deal with people who go out of their way to be deliberatly rude and just want to put others down? I feel this may happen again, because it has in the past, but I'm tired of people
taking my nice/calm attitude as a reason to put me down. Please give me some advice on how to put people in their place without feeling guilt (something I have trouble doing)

I'm aware some of you will think otherwise about what I said but hopefully this will inspire others!

667,"TW:suicidal ideation

This is going to be heavy and long; list of emotions right now. I hope this is the right sub for this.

My husband struggles immensely with cPTSD and other mental health concerns. He has near constant thoughts of suicide, and has since his break over three years ago. He is unable to work, and may qualify for disability, but isn’t on it yet. All of that I can handle, but he’s become cruel. He has extreme anger outbursts, says things to hurt me and I can’t take it. We’ve been together 11 years as of yesterday.

As much as I love him and wish we could work, I think I need to go. It’s time; past time. But, I am terrified to leave him with nothing. He has no income without mine, no health insurance, and little support outside of me. I am very afraid he will kill himself without support, but in the event he wants to live, I don’t want to erode that will by leaving him with nothing. Our lease is up in February. I want desperately to give him the base upon which to live his own life by then. I don’t make a lot; if it weren’t for his boyfriend ( we’re poly, and his boyfriend has been a godsend. Our poly dynamic isn’t the problem here) we couldn’t afford the place we have. Unfortunately, his boyfriend is also done putting up with this, and wants to break it off to let my husband fend for himself. Either after the lease is up in February, or as soon as an eviction will allow if the violent outbursts don’t stop.

I don’t know how to let go. I don’t want to let go. But if I have to, I want to give him every chance I can to be successful on his own. I live in Oregon, Portland metro area. Rent is expensive. Disability takes time. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get him resources of his own so he can move into his own place by February? I want him to have the chance to be okay, and I don’t think he has the drive to make these arrangements himself. I think if faced with this overwhelming nightmare I’m trying to tackle right now for him, he’ll just decide he’s better off dead. 

My goals; I want him to have his own income, own bank account, health insurance, and a way to keep his emotional support cats with him. It would break my heart to have to take them away from him and keep them with me because he can’t house them. I don’t think he can survive without them.",25Oct2020,1
668,"I grew up with a dad who raised and provided for me. We definitely had some issues with our relationship and he used to be kind of abusive. Even now that I’m older, we have a weird relationship. I didn’t find out my dad wasn’t my biological father until I was 16, and then it made sense why it seemed like he treated me differently than my other siblings. Recently, I searched my biological father’s Facebook and saw that he has cancer, which led me to question a few things. I’ve been told that he isn’t the kind of person I want to meet by multiple people, but do you think I should? I just don’t want to live with the regret of not knowing certain things if he dies and I never meet him.",25Oct2020,1

Well, his buddies aunt was there, who was like 45 maybe. His buddies younger brother and sister were there too (both under 16. I think the sister was 14). Well about 2 hours in I noticed that the aunt took her bag of coke (which she had on the counter) and brought it upstairs, where the kids bedrooms were. When she came back down she told the mom (an assumption) that she had given both the son and daughter coke. The mom didnt care.

I'm 23m and I have never used drugs so I cant tell if I'm like freaking out over nothing because the kids were *technically* safe. I mean I saw them before I left and they were both acting fine. Should I report it or leave it alone?",25Oct2020,1
670,"Okay so back in April, covid hit people hard. Especially those self employed. So I figured I'd ask for a commission from an artist I follow on Instagram. I asked for 4 A4 drawings of video game characters I like. Nothing super complex. I paid half then and he said I could pay the other half when they were complete. It's been 6 months and, as far as I'm aware, they've only completed one and I only know this because they sent me a picture of it months ago.

I completely understand that they have to work as much as they can to take care of themselves during this madness and I've told them they can take their time with it, but I haven't heard anything from them in like 2 or 3 months. I'd feel bad asking them if they're done yet because I don't want to rush them but, at the same time, I feel like maybe 6 months is a bit much. I'm not an artist and I've never done commissions for people, nor have I ever requested a commission before this so I have no clue if this is normal.

671,"A new co-worker started at the office and we work alone together doing pretty much nothing. So after the work was completed we sat around talking for a few hours. I feel guilty now because we talked about my older family members unconscious bias in their verbiage which might have made them sound really racist. I also worry I sounded hypocritical because we talked about how people say offensive things without knowing it and I'm pretty sure I did that while we talked at least once. I accidentally said an old unacceptable term when I meant to say something else that sounds like that but meant something different. At first I tried to move past it but ended up apologising because it kept gnawing at me. 

And I feel compelled to apologize again to them because I feel like maybe I said other less than cool things without realizing but then that's sopping with white guilt and she's probably moved on already. 

Overall we had a nice conversation but I can't help but feeling like A that was way too long to talk B those are not good work topics C I am experiencing embarrassment about what I revealed about racist family D I had a mini rant about mental health care and my struggle getting care, so now I've revealed I have some ""problem"" but not what it is, leaving that up for guessing. Our conversation ended abruptly bc another person came to the office to ask for help and we didn't really get to wrap up in any way just said nice talking and bye. I think we were talking about something less volatile by that point.

Should I say anything next time at work? Like the anxiety ball wishes I could just say, sorry if I talked your ears off, my family isn't all bad, thanks for entertaining me, I don't usually talk that much I'm just hypomanic and it's just bipolar 2 and I take pleeeenty of meds for it so don't worry! /s Or maybe just forget about it and try to be less chatty?

674,"I have ADHD, which makes my anxiety and depression worse. I've also got a LOT of allergies. I'm not sure if this info will be relevant.

I started birth control in February 2018. The first 2 months I was sick almost every morning, but it got better. Towards the end of the year the vomiting came back.

In January 2019, my birth control was changed. I took it until April, but ultimately stopped because the vomiting did not stop. I haven't taken birth control since.

Ever since then, vomiting in the morning never completely went away. Generally, I will have bouts of vomiting for a week or two, and then be fine for a while. This time, however, it's been well over a month.

This is a huge problem and is severely impacting my life. I have to complete 300 hours of an internship by the beginning of December and I am barely halfway through. My supervisor and I had to have a talk about my attendance, and my internship advisor just emailed me about needing to talk to me about my midpoint evaluation from my supervisor.

Prior to this, I've always struggled with my health and attendance at school. I've only had one job in the past, and while I did leave voluntarily, I did have to have a  discussion with my manager about my attendance.

Sometimes it's been a matter of just...not being able to get myself out of bed for the day, period. This I chalked up to anxiety/depression. But with this internship, I've been trying really hard. I need to graduate, this degree has already taken me 3 years longer than it should have, and I'm scared of losing the internship. But nearly every morning I wake up around 7, and vomit violently until at least 10. If I'm better by 10, I go to the office at 11 if it's a day I am to go in. Otherwise I will let my supervisor know what's up. She's overall been very kind about this, but is clearly becoming frustrated. I fear she doesn't believe me because the majority of the call-offs have been on mondays or fridays. I agree this might seem suspicious but I swear it's not intentional.

The last 2 weeks have been particularly rough; my supervisor has sent me home for the week twice in a row. I've been crying almost every day because I'm just so sick of being miserable all the damn time. I'm sick all day anymore and usually can't eat OR drink ANYTHING until at least 5pm. But in the evening I almost always feel fantastic.

My parents think the issue might be some combination of my allergies and anxiety playing off of each other. I've gone to the hospital twice the last two weeks (I can't get into my PCP until the middle of November, and Urgent Care centers have been full due to Covid since the hospital doesn't  provide testing). During the first visit, the doctor just berated me for not going to my PCP (again, I can't right now). The second visit was more helpful; they ran tests that all came up normal, gave me Zofran which only somewhat helps, and referred me to the local gastroenterologist. Unfortunately the gastro doesn't accept referrals from the hospital so I have to wait until November when I can see my PCP.

I'm just...extremely overwhelmed. I'm starting to fear that I won't be able to hold down a job and my degree will have been a huge waste of time and money. Beyond my health/attendance issues I'm a good student and take pride in my work. I just cant seem to do it with any consistency. My boyfriend makes enough to support us but I feel guilty putting all of it on him when I'm rarely well enough to even complete housework. Any advice at all would be appreciated.

Tl;dr:  my health has been affecting my ability to finish school and I'm terrified.",25Oct2020,1

677,"Sorry this is long, but this is actual insanity that this happened. 

So I am a college student in the last year of my degree and I’ve lived in this apartment near my campus since June 2019. Everything has been fine until these past couple of weeks. 

So a couple weeks ago I started to notice that I was getting bites on me. Everywhere.  I had them on my wrists, hands, hips, back, etc. I started waking up in the middle of the night itching. I thought I may have had bed bugs but I couldn’t find them. I went to the doctors and they told me I had scabies. I went to sleep the night after and I woke at  2am and saw a bed bug running away from me. I called my property manager the next day and told her I saw them and she called an exterminator. They came a few days later and examined and then a few days later they came and did a chemical treatment. 

During the time it took for the exterminator to come and inspect then treat I started sleeping on the couch in the living room and was unaffected. However, 2 nights before the exterminator came and did the treatment I saw my cat chasing a bug in the living room. I turned on my flashlight and saw a brown shadow run underneath the chair. This freaked me out and I cried for a few hours. The next day I went to work and was on the verge of tears all day thinking about going back to my apartment. I didn’t have anyone to stay with in my city so I called my mom and asked her if I could stay and she let me. She lives an hour and a half away. I’ve been hear ever since. 

A couple days before they did the bed bug treatment I noticed these other small bugs running around. I saw quite a few and didn’t know what they were. My roommate asked me if they were bed bugs and I said no. We sent a picture to our property manager and she said that they were just beetles and that they would die due to the bed bug treatment. 

The few times I came back to the apartment to post treatment I saw more. The exterminator came back for a follow up inspection and I showed him and they turned out to be cockroach babies. They came a week later to do a cockroach treatment. That was this past Tuesday. 

I tried to go back yesterday and I saw a cockroach baby in the sink. I had so much anxiety that I threw up and cried for an hour and asked my mom if I could come back. 

Here’s the thing. I’m not really afraid of most bugs but I am of these bugs. I refer to them as kind of “nuclear” bugs. Both are extremely hard to get rid of and I’m super afraid that the treatments were not effective. We also did not get used furniture recently, go on a plane or stay in a hotel. I only really take a bag with me to school but I only do in person school for 4 hours a week. There’s a good possibly that they came from another apartment and that they could come back. My roommate doesn’t seem to be too bothered by this and has been staying there during this.  

I don’t really know what to do. I feel unsafe. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",25Oct2020,1

681,"So, I [27F] am high functioning autistic, though you wouldn't know unless you quite a bit about autism. But, it seems like I've become a magnet for creepy guys aged 45-65 over the past 5 years or so.

There was one guy who was just sleezy and tried to get me in bed with him. I saw through it and immediately distanced myself.

And the addict that a 'friend' (I immediately cut contact with him after this) gave my number, and this addict clearly wasn't in his right mind, so he would call me up to 8 times a day, almost every day for 6 months. I never answered. He'd leave messages saying ""Baby, baby, I love you, why won't you call me back? Baby, I love you.""

There was a guy who saw me walking into a gas station and drove 40-50 feet straight for me just hitting the horn relentlessly, tried texting me several times over the next 3 months (I didn't respond) and tried adding me on Facebook, and when I asked him to leave me alone, he begged me not to tell anybody about the creepy stuff he did. I got a new to me van that he didn't know about (not because of him) September 2019. He was driving around town and saw me driving in January this year. Well, January to mid-March of this year, he would park within 60 feet of my van at church and would often just sit in his car, facing my van, doing I don't know what. The church I went to pre-pandemic has 2 very large parking lots, one on the north side, one on the south side. He use to always park in the south lot, I park in the north lot.

A guy at my job thinks it's 100% ok to completely disregard me saying that a certain guy he knows isn't my boyfriend, or that I'll never get married/have kids, or that I don't want to give him a hug, and even try to grab stuff from my pocket.

She would always say that she “wasn’t ready to try that again” or “I need more proof of your change” also during this time she was in another relationship, (I didn’t learn about this until about a month into us seeing each other again). To put it bluntly he is kinda shitty and manipulative to her and she used me to fill voids in her relationship, with me. To make a long story short she went through this cycle of breaking up with him, to get back with me, and deciding not to get with me, and blame me for the situation. Saying “I’ve made it clear I’m not ready for that” which really did a number on my self confidence.

I’ve looked at the idea of woofing, and also living in a van . Seems cool. I’ve thought about getting just a bachealors in buisness or doing a two year program for like dental hygiene/cyber security

684,"I live in Canada. I have a high school diploma and an associate’s degree/diploma in music. My resume is full of enormous gaps that I can’t provide any valid excuses for. I’ve dropped out of university 3 times and never held a job for longer than 6 months.

The truth: I have no work ethic and I’ve always had a support net in my mom, who has enough money to pay for my comfortable lifestyle. I’ve had mental health issues but nothing serious that should prevent me from working. I have low confidence, low energy, low enthusiasm, and basically a number of personality traits that are very undesirable in a professional person.

I have some interest in pursuing certain career paths. My mom would pay for me to go back to school - again - if I commit to something and ask. But I’m pretty downtrodden and reluctant to ask her to shell out more money on me. She’s probably spent a hundred grand, easily, on my false starts and I’ve failed at every endeavour to translate it into self-sufficiency.

I’m in therapy, which my mom also pays for. I don’t feel like I’m a mental illness basket case, I’m pretty miserable but I see myself as capable. That said, I historically have quit every job when it became “too stressful”.

687,"My fiancee has some worryingly bad anger issues. It’s not like she can’t control her temper because she can most of the time. It’s when she gets upset at small things that I get nervous. And when she does get upset, it’s not my safety I worry about, it’s her’s.

Things that have happened that concern me:

\- She got upset because the water spout on the fridge wasn’t working so she through her glass on the ground, breaking it, and while she was cleaning it up, she held onto a piece of the glass so hard she needed stitches for the cut.

\- She broke a stool because she got upset she couldn’t push it in all the way because it was getting caught on the legs on the stools beside it. I went over to help her so she didn’t lose her temper and instead, she just threw the stool causing the back to break off.

\- When she comes home upset after a day at work, she’ll work herself up to the point where she’s crying and hyperventilating, and will not calm down. She’ll hit herself too. She’ll smack her head pretty hard— hard enough to leave bruises and bumps— and will hit her head against the wall at times. She broke three of her fingers two months ago because she slammed her hand in a drawer on purpose. I know it was on purpose because I watched her do it.

\- I won’t ride in a car with her driving anymore because she gets such bad road rage. If a car cuts her off or tries to pull out in front of her, she’ll speed up instead of breaking. Funny enough, she has never been in an accident.

\- She controls it much better in public, but what I have noticed she’ll do is dig her fingernails into the skin on her wrist just under her FitBit until she bleeds. She also bites her lips— often until it bleeds— and will pick at her fingernails… until they bleed.

Overall, a lot of these instances are few and far between, but this isn’t all she has done. Usually something happens every few months, but it seems to be getting more frequent. I know her father had similar issues and took them out on her mother which does concern me. She was arrested for assault when we were in college, but I think it was in self defense or something so the charges were dropped.

Aside from these issues, I love our relationship. We have been together since college where we met through our greek houses. She is a very kind and respectful person who really wants to help those around her. She has never been violent in anyway towards me and when we argue she holds her temper well and almost never shouts. It always seems like it’s the little things like some off-handed comment someone makes or a minor inconvenience.

We have a date for our wedding in a little under a year, but I brought it up to her that I don’t want to get married until she worked on these issues as they are progressively getting worse. She got upset with me originally, but has seemed pretty withdrawn since. I feel like an asshole, but I don't know what else to do.

690,So this year I've been feeling really empty and emotionally numb. Like i havent really felt something for a long time and whenever i 'feel' something it's not intense at all. My dad died last December and it hasn't impacted me at all. I barely cried but i used to be really sensitive and cried very easily.I also catch myself dissociating a lot and idk i dont want to talk to anyone if im being honest. Some friends text me but i am being kind of dry so they stop talking because i really am not in a mood to talk  and i feel really toxic.Most people annoy me and i have no idea why. A friend has been flirting with me back and forth and i just cringe for some reason? Isn't that weird? And i kind of distance myself now but i know how bad this is. They haven't confessed or something so it would be weird if i said im not interested but i know how much it sucks when someone is distances themselves. I am trying to understand why i am generally acting like this lately and I can't figure it out. I dont hate myself or something. I don't have access to a psychologist so I am trying to understand on my own.

699,"Hello there.

Long story short, I'm having all my wisdom teeth removed and 2 of them needs to get surgically removed.

Problem is, I work as a desk agent and I usually speak a lot during my shift since I have to - that's my job after all. Thing is, the first time, I'll have 2 days off and I switched 1 so I can relax. The second time, I don't have this luxury and I'll have to go to work the day after surgery. I'm not afraid of the surgery and the like but I'm kinda worried about pushing myself too far afterwards.

As of now I can't switch that day or the next and I'll have day shift which means a lot of talking. 

Ultimate questions are: how do I prepare for the aftermath food and painkillers wise? What to avoid doing (besides speaking a lot)?",25Oct2020,1

But now I want to improve my money making. For 4 payments of $400, I can get a moped and nearly triple my earnings to $1,000/month if I work 5 hours a night for 5 days a week. 

My parents think it's a really stupid move. That I'll start being tired at school from working nights or worse, that I'll get into an accident and be seriously hurt or killed. Then there's the problem of theft since we don't have a private parking spot so where will the moped be parked. I said in a little alley near our house. I don't think anybody would notice it and just walk in. 

I feel like my life would change for the better if I made more money. I could upgrade my PC, replace my cracked phone, finally be able to go on vacations to the US and other countries, buy whatever I want, have more confidence because I'd have more money in my bank account. I may even be able to move out and have my independence since a studio costs only $400 a month to rent.

People at uni were asking what people’s parents do for work and when I said my father had retired the girls told everyone that I am a snob. One encounter with a girl at freshers entailed in her bragging about her chalet in the Alps to a group of people and then she later told everyone that I was spoilt and showing off my money for carrying a bag that my mother had gifted me. I later found out she is being mean about me because she likes my boyfriend and she wanted to be the ‘rich figure’ but I hate knowing she is spreading rumours about me when I have only spoken to her a few times in a group situation and have only been nice.

708,"Some background: I am a very happy introvert, and honestly could spend the rest of my life alone and be happy. I don’t really go to social events, and in general I don’t talk to people unless I need to. I am fully capable of holding a conversation, but it doesn’t interest me much and I usually feel like I could spend my time better elsewhere.

The problem: With the extended lockdown in my area, I think I’ve gotten *too* used to being alone. Now, when I do talk to others, I start getting extremely tired (as in, I need to lay down and take a nap) after 30 minutes. I find even talking with my family on the phone, which I do fairly frequently, and I get literally physically exhausted after 30 minutes. The only “solution” I find so far is drinking alcohol, which prolongs my ability to tolerate it, at least for a little longer...

My first thought is social anxiety, but... I am not really nervous or anxious about talking to people. It’s more that I’d rather just go back to being by myself. But obviously, in the real world this isn’t feasible, and in a post lockdown world I might be screwed in terms of work and such.

It doesn’t have to be anything profound, but does anyone have any tips to help improve this issue? Thanks.",25Oct2020,1

He's still sleeping with L and another ex, A and L doesn't know about him sleeping with A. All he's been doing is brag about sleeping with two women. Then, even though his goal is L and he is no longer dating A, a friend of mine who's a trans guy, K likes A. After my friend found this out he got wayyy competitive even though he's not dating A. I started getting pissed off when he flexed on the call saying that A would like him more just because hes stronger and shit which is stupid because K is a girl who literally just started transitioning to guy. He's gotten so full of toxic masculinity and all it does is ruin my already low self esteem.

Now I'm really mad because now he's randomly flirting with other female friends of mine (even though he said that I'd have a better chance of getting with them if anything, how ironic) and bragging about when they flirt back. Last night he was on the phone with another different ex while texting A and A's best friend, sent a dick pic to A's friend claiming that ""it was by accident"" even though more likely than not it wasn't. Even though A's friend has a boyfriend she flirted back and he just used that to brag more to which I responded by calling the girl an unfaithful slut out of rage.

But now they're planning on taking the aunt. The aunt won't wear a mask. Three times at our wedding she was told to put her mask on.

I've expressed my dissatisfaction with this. It just takes this lady a few seconds to be outside without her mask, get it, my wife gets it and then I get it and this affects my job and both our lives.

Since Covid has started my wife and I have taken every precaution to be safe including spending 99% of our time at home and not doing anything out doors (outside going to the store and quick things like this).

714,"Hi guys,

I just woke up and got to eavesdrop on my roommates talking bad about me. It kind of caused me to re-evaluate my lifestyle.

Basically they said I’m a very boring person who is a simp and has a lame lifestyle.

My major is a lot more demanding than theirs, so I am in my room a lot doing work. Then if I’m not doing work, I like to relax and play video games with old friends, or go hang out with the two friends I’ve made so far who aren’t my roommates.

If I’m not doing that, then I am at my job.

Looking back on it, I don’t really like my roommates. They have a lot more free time than me and generally have a a bigger group of friends than I do. But they are pretty immature and I don’t like their friends much.

I am happy with my two new friends and getting to stay in touch with two of my close old friends through video games. I also like to stay busy with work and school. 

Recently I’ve been trying to get into a relationship which is apparently looked down upon because it takes away from the college experience, but I want a girlfriend and so far I like going to do things with a girl I met on the weekends.

But I could definitely see how this could be seen as lame, not gonna lie when I heard them talking about me they quasi-convinced me that I am lame and need to put myself out there more.

I really don’t make much time for my roommates at all and frequently I am relaxing at 10pm-1am while they are out doing things, and I usually don’t have the energy to join them. When I do, it’s always like I’d rather just be alone. Plus with COVID there’s not much to do at night and I’d rather not be going out in big groups.

Today they knew I was planning on going somewhere with this girl and then I was probably gonna go to the beach by myself (which I like to do), so I think that is why they were talking bad about me. I dunno. I like how it is but maybe I should be more outgoing? But at the same time I’m just not the most outgoing person.

I’m looking for advice, not because I really care about what they think of me, but because I want to know if I should be living a more exciting college life.

Thanks!",25Oct2020,1

So I have been at uni, in the Uk, I have started first year of university 6 times, each time changing course, and sometimes university. 
I have dropped out in the past due to issues such as personal, health and financial. 
Last year I have finally finished a year 1, of a part time, six year degree, and I am proud of myself because it took a lot of hard work. However, with the current issue, and the increasing difficulty of my current course (it’s a language and this year we are being taught in that language only) I am having a hard time seeing it through. 
This is because I am not able to make it my number one priority, and I am having long term therapy for mental health issues and transitioning, tired of struggling and am starting to think higher education isn’t for me as I am 29 this year and have been trying to do this since I was 20. 

I have always considered completing a degree something of high importance, but I am feeling like I am wasting a lot of my time for something that I am not doing for a career goal.

I can only watch kids/toddler shows like sesame street because every thing else reminds me of how ugly i am. This is twisted but sometimes i have to think/behave like a child/toddler because that way i feel less guilty about the way i look since kids are accepted regardless of the way they look so that way i can somehow accept myself a bit and be less upset. But this is really unhealthy i think. I have trained my brain to not be attracted to anyone to protect myself.

720,"So, I (27M) moved to a new city a week ago. My new flatmate (27F) is really nice and flirtatious with me. Last Sunday after I finished unpacking she wanted to have a couple of drinks. I went along but didn’t wanted to be wasted on my first night at the new place so I stopped after three drinks. She had a couple more and started to be really friendly with me pretty much laughing constantly and kept finding ways to touch me.

Long story short we ended up in her bed all cuddled up watching a movie. I didn’t make a move nor did she.

The same thing happened yesterday evening. She had a few friends from work over at our place for drinks. I was out in the city and once I got back to the flat around 9pm her friends already left and she was pretty drunk. She offered me some drinks and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said yes and long story short we ended up in the bed again.

After a while she started touching and squeezing my arms and chest and I’ve had my hand on her leg. We were doing this for about an hour when I decided to make a move and leaned in for a kiss. However, she backed away and said “We can’t because we are flatmates.”. I told her I thought she was okay with this as she was flirting and kept touching me on my very first night and now again. Her reply was “I’m sorry, I wish we could do this.” I just said to her that I think we should go to sleep in our own rooms so I got up and left.

Now I’m not sure how to handle this. Should I bring this up to clear the air? Should I pretend it never happened? How should I handle this? Thank Reddit!",25Oct2020,1
721,"(This is kind of a long read but it's all just to give context as to how strongly I feel about this person) 

So this girl and I met thru Xbox about a week ago. She made a post looking for ppl to play with saying ""im weird...bla bla bla, just want some genuine fun... Bla bla bla"" so I decided to respond to her post in a friendly way saying ""I bet I'm weirder than you"". She instantly invited me and said how she liked my response saying I was different from the other guys who kept responding to her post with "" invite me"" or ""hi"" or other simple responses. Anyways we instantly had a connection and talked like we were friends for a long time already. We both said how we instantly felt that connection and how we vibed with each other. Fast forward from 8pm (when i first met her) to like 11 pm when we decided we just wanted to chill and talk about random shit. The conversation went super smooth and we had no problem shifting from topic to topic and I had way more fun talking with her than playing the actual game lol. Anyways we literally spent hours talking, and I mean hours.... As in we kept talking until 6 am :3

We exchanged literally every social media we both had including numbers. Like I said we talked and talked and we would flirt with each other from time to time. So yeah all this is to give context and to help sell the idea that we connected very well and we both enjoyed our time chatting with each other. 

The next day after that (or later that day as it was already 6 am when we finished talking) we agreed to talk some more at night but this time thru a phone call. So we did and again, everything went super great and it really did feel like we were really great friends since forever ago. We didn't end up talking as late as before since it was a sunday and we both had to get up early in the morning. Anyway we agreed to chat again the next day but this time thru video call. 

Monday arrives and it's around 6 or 7 pm and I messaged her saying that I'm ready to call whenever she's ready. But I didn't get a response. I found it a little weird because our past texts she would literally respond instantly but this time she just left me on read. But I didn't think much of it as we already did talk so much before and it's nice to give ppl their space and all so I didn't wanna push anything. 
So the whole week up until today I basically sent her about 4 snaps and she would see them and leave them on read. After that I stopped since I didn't want to seem pushy or anything . 

But I will say that after vibing with a person THAT much and speaking to them for literal HOURS even if only for 2 days straight, and then not hearing from them again, does cause me to feel a bit sad. ESPECIALLY when I get super attached to ppl after a bit of us connecting. I also do have to say that I don't see all this as ""oh no I ruined my chances with this girl and I'll never be able to get in her pants"" as I genuinely do see her as a friend now more than anything. So yeah..... I just don't know what to do anymore and this might sound really weird seeing as we kind of don't really know each other. But like I said, I get really attached to ppl and I've never connected with someone as much as we did in that moment. I've been thinking about it all week and it really does feel like I've lost a very good friend.

One of the things that makes me very nervous is the idea that I send out false red flags of ""creepy"" behavior. Staring at people for too long, or not looking at them at all, or accidentally looking in the wrong places. Accidentally crossing boundaries. Talking to myself when I'm distracted (I tend to verbalize my thoughts absentmindedly). Coming across as flirtatious in bad contexts when I'm trying to be friendly or just spacing out.

723,"So I've been dating a guy for a little over 3 months, and from the start the agreement was casual but exclusive and if it turns into something than that's okay. I had a lot of fun with him over the summer but once classes started I got really busy. I told him I was to busy to see him anymore and he responded with ""I would really like to see you any time you are free. I know it's not much and I don't want to stress you out or be a burden. I just would like to see you"". And of course I'm all for supporting the the nice, sweet guys out there. So I've been able to see him once, maybe twice a month when I have long weekends. But come to the current time and I've really just lost all interest in the relationship/whatever you wanna call it. He's a super nice guy, he's very attractive, he's funny and considerate, there is literally nothing wrong with him and I know I should have more feelings for him at this point but I don't. I don't know how to tell him that I have no feelings or investment anymore without coming off as cruel. I also don't want to do it over text, but the next day I have free time is 4 weeks away during Thanksgiving and even then I might be flying home.

I wish I could have more feelings for him, but at this point I've completely lost interest and I can't control it.

But strangely I was kinda okay with it. But later on she started ignoring me and this hurt me a lot. Simultaneously I was also going through my bad days so I didn't know what to do.

Fast forward to college, we took admissions in the same college coincidentally. But she found new friends and totally forgot about me. Not only that she used to dominate me as well. As a result I became a simp. 

Also the personality of the girl is such that she is kinda party going. She does stuff which I am not allowed to do like partying up late, drinking blatantlyat home. She is socially powerful and has contacts. Also she makes other people and friends pay her bills.

Even today she tries to dominate me. But I am sick of it and I try to resist. Also she taunts me a lot about me being single and my inability to talk confidently with girls (Yes I am working on it). But everytime when I try to resist,  she tries to ruin my social life as she's socially very powerful and has contacts. Basically it's like she having a camera over my social lifeI have already told my friends about this but there's nothing they can do. I jave even considered the option of walking away but she still continues to be there everywhere I go and haunt me.

In other words, how do I deal with a girl who seriously has dominated my life without getting my social life ruined.",25Oct2020,1
729,"Hello people of reddit, this is my first ever time using reddit, so I apologize if this is screwed up in formatting or anything like that. I am also very poor with spelling and grammer, so please bare with me. 

For context of this situation, I am currently 13 years old (F). This happened when I just turned 12. This person who I am going to call (F) 'Sally', is a close (IRL) friend of mine. Sally had introduced me to Amino, (worst mistake of my life, but this is important for later) we joined an anime communitie. There was loads of RP of said communitie we were in. But also, there was loads of sexual RP or just sexual things that we were exposed to. Having been exposed to this so regulary, I thought those behaviours were GOOD and OK. I eventually decided to go on Amino less though, as I found it boring.  Sally would check up on it regurelly and tell me all that would happen. She made some friends there, with some of them being (not good) adults.

Now, heres where I make a mistake that will forever haunt me. I made a new account and went on there. I introduced him as 'Chase, my online friend.'(Who I said was 14.) Chase and Sally became close per say in a matter of a couple hours. (shocking.) Sally (or me, I deleted these accounts so I cant see what started it) wanted to do NSFW RP. Which I/her agreed on. (I actually remember sending these messages, hiding in my bathroom feeling sick to my stomach. Almost felt like I was going to through up.) The day passes, I see Sally at school and she talks about how great Chase is. (unknowing IM chase.) SKip forward, its night, you finished some NSFW RP with Sally. And then she says she started to masturbate, (which she admitted to chase that she has since she join amino.) And I encouraged it.... I encouraged this behavour, I dont even know what my motive was. Ive had a good life, great family and friends, and yet I enouraged this disgusting behavour from my 12 year OLD IRL close friend. This led on for almost a week, when I came to my senses how wrong and disgusting this is. I made Chase get into a fight with Sally, in the end I made it stop and eventually ghosted and deleted the account. Same goes with the email I used. 

I have never told anyone this before, because im a fucking coward. I havent even came out and told her. Anytime she has texted me, I get sick to my stomach and my whole day becomes sour. Because I know that if I tell her, or if she finds out, shes going to hurt so much. Im so disgusted in myself and I feel like my whole life will just go to waste. As society these days will hold your past against you till the day you die. (Im talking about, 'omg \_\_\_\_ said a slur, cancel them. I not talking about murduer, or p\*dos, or r\*pe. Those PEOPLE need to have their actions hold against them, and no apologies can attone for their actions.) Since this happened, I have completly changed. I am more I strive for being a better person, and trying to be kind, I know what I did was so wrong, and I will never do it again.

Im not sure if this even made any sense, but I thank you for anyone who reads this. I dont know what to even do anymore with my life, because in the end, I did something. And that action I made (if people find out) will forever be held against me. What do I do now?",25Oct2020,1

Our parents aren’t the best either, so it seems pretty enticing to go live with them. Regardless, I want to have the best relationship with her I can.

733,"I need advice on marriage in relationships. I am a female, 28 years old and I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 8 years, and he’s 28 as well. He’s very back and forth about the marriage thing. Sometimes he tells me he wants to buy me a ring and propose and other times he blatantly says he never wants to get married. He said he doesn’t believe in marriage and it’s all a show. He said it’s more meaningful if someone can be with him without having to get married and go through all that “bullshit.” 

He also doesn’t want to buy me a ring because he doesn’t want to spend the money. He said he’s rather use that money to put a down payment on a house. He said he doesn’t want to have a wedding either cuz he doesn’t want to spend the money. 

I am conflicted because I believe marriage is a symbol to commitment, and I believe it means a lot if someone wants to do that for you. It also reassures of making it official. I’m not too sure if I’ll ever get married if we break up because I probably won’t trust anyone for awhile. Plus I have a mental illness, bipolar disorder, and it makes me feel like it would be even more difficult to find someone else that would be accepting of my illness. I am stable though, and I haven’t experienced any symptoms in awhile. The symptoms come and go but the most it lasts is about a month, then I stay dormant for a year. However, I have been hospitalized a couple times and each time was when we broke up because I was going through a hard time, the stress made things worse. But obviously we got back together and things have been really good. 

We even started seeing a couples therapist and it really helps in our relationship, but now marriage gets brought up and I’m starting to realize he doesn’t want the same thing. I’m not sure if I should sacrifice being married to someone to be with him. Sometimes I think I can’t live without him, but it’s stuff like this makes me feel so unloved. I feel like he doesn’t love me enough to marry me. Anyways, if you could share your thoughts on this, I’d appreciate it. Thank you.",25Oct2020,1
734,"Hey fellow Reddit users, first time post!

First a little about me. I am about to graduate from mechanical engineering but ran out of money so came back home, Alberta, to find a job and save money. Well covid happened so there are really no jobs.

Anyways, I decided that since I love tutoring and have been doing for the past 7+ years I could utilize my skills and create a online course and attract a larger audience that way.

I've been working on calculus 1 topics and have narrowed down to three subtopics-limits, derivatives, integration. Basically I want to make strep by step process of solving equations and also a better understanding of the concepts. 

Here's where I'm sort of hitting a roadblock and not sure what to do. Is it wise to create just three topics and then work on them or would it be wise to actually create all relevant topics found in calculus 1? Another road block then would be price. If I have say 6 modules and 19 -12 videos with pdf files that show typical questions with step by step solutions, would asking $100-150 usd be too high of a price?
Finally, should I wait until everything is complete or should I release at least enough (2 modules with few videos and pdfs) and then release more as I finish them? I'm thinking of releasing them on either thinkific, Coursera, or any other online course website. 

So tldr; releasing online course for calculus 1 focusing on limits, derivatives, integration. Is it smart or release more then 3 topics, price for such a course, and should I release everything once it's done or can I release as soon as I am done my very first module and keep releasing possibly every week?

Anyone has experience with making courses will be able to give a clear insight since I'm sure you have dealt with everything I'm listing above. However, even if you haven't feel free to comment. Not looking to make 7million per year here, I just don't want to waste my time so some money would be nice in the process since I am giving up my time to do this 😜

740,"Hi reddit. It's in the title. 

I've had this issue with no true outlet and I'd like to figure out a solution for myself. I'll start by saying, yes, this is a high school situation, but the ""drama"" is more in my head and nothing has really conspired from my feelings. 

I (17F) have two friends (18M,18F) that are a couple. The three of us have been friends for almost two years now and they will have been dating each other for a year come November. They've never made me feel like a third wheel and the three of us actively hang out on a regular basis (I'm surprised actually how much they have me tag along.) I'm good friends with both of them individually as well, though I'm a little closer with the girl, Alice.

My feelings/romanticizing issue started earlier this year. The three of us — or more really me and them — had drifted a bit last year and started really reconnecting over quarantine. Since then we've been around each other all the time and the relationship between us three became more ""best friends"" than just ""I see you at school."" Alice and I had a more solid friendship already, but her boyfriend Everett and I didn't really get too close until this year. Things between us three have been awesome since; Alice has no issue with Everett and I being close and Everett has no issue with Alice and I being close (I am bisexual- neither of them make assumptions.)

But I find I am very, very attached to them. This is easy to brush off as, ""They're your friends, of course you are,"" but I've had a lot of invasive thoughts of being with both/one of them too consistently. I'm attracted to both of them equally and if they asked me to make two into three there would be no hesitation on my part. That's extremely unrealistic, however, and I don't want to feel that way about them. 

Two events have made this more difficult for me to push down. 

Alice and I kissed in front of Everett as a joke (it was a peck). I'm not the only person Alice has done this with, and she does consider herself straight. It stirred me up but I laughed it off.  Second, the three of us entertained the idea of a threesome... Everett and I were very headstrong and into it- Alice seemed to be at first but then decided she was uncomfortable with the idea, so we shut it down and only bring it up as a joke anymore. Alice still gets a little weird with the jokes but simultaneously laughs at them. This whole ordeal has been driving me insane. 

When it was first brought up, I felt like I was on fire- my anxiety was awful. I was convinced I was doing something horrible by entertaining the idea with them because it was a way of admitting my attraction. This feeling retained as the discussion progressed (which, by the way, took almost a week's while to happen.) We had a more NSFW conversation about things one night and I was riding high for a while and it was all I could think about; in class, at home, at night, at dinner, all the time... Then Alice expressed her feelings and we shut it down as quickly as it had begun. I was more embarrassed than disappointed, because again, to me, I had essentially put myself out there and bared a part of myself I had been hiding from them. It still burns me a bit, but I've felt better since we've been able to joke about it. 

But I still can't stop thinking about it like it's going to happen, or like Alice will change her mind. This situation was a month ago, and I'm STILL forcing thoughts away like it was the days when I was on cloud nine. It's almost worse than the constant pining feeling in my gut. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to separate myself from them or take a break because I have no idea how I'd explain myself and I would miss them like hell- they're the best parts of my day. I hate that I can't just think of them as my friends and be normal. If I had the balls I would confess if even just for the purpose of help but our entire dynamic would be fucked up. They're amazing people and they would still talk to me and hang out with me, but things would undoubtedly get strange and uncomfortable. I don't want that to happen. 

If there's any advice at all that anyone can give me on ""getting over"" them or something, please give it. I hate locking my feelings down, especially with them, but I care a great deal for both of them and don't want to push them away.",25Oct2020,1
741,"My wife and are at odds with a situation regarding our neighbors son. He is about 17 years old and autistic. He’s overall friendly, but there are two main issues. The first is that he lights fires in their backyard every weekend (day and night) and just lets them burn (never puts them out when finished). This occasionally happens throughout the week as well. This is highly annoying as we can’t ever have our windows open and today he’s burning leaves (located in the Midwest) and you can smell it in the house along with see the huge clouds of smoke in the backyard. The second issue is he’s always outside walking around and while he’s doing that he’ll look into our house at us. We know this because he waives.

His oldest brother is early 20s and still lives at home, so being he’s autistic and his brother hasn’t moved out we’re not counting on him going to college or moving out soon.

Maybe one needs to know the reason for it too. I think it might be important to the storie as it's for sure not like this because I'm a creep or something. At least I don't hope so.

Thing is, before I met my ""current"" girlfriendy I just never had any kind of intrest in anything sexual when it comes to relationships and so and, while there were some interactions it was always just me beeing preassured into doing these things I didn't really even want and yeah. I always kind of just shut down and that's that. So ... I'm really not into hookups and stuff like that ... never was, never will I guess.

So I never really looked at sex as something nice or beautiful. Basically because of that I very much lost all intrest in sex and ... yeah.

That would only change when I met my current girlfriend of 3 years by now. She's the firs person I actually ever felt something for and I really really love her from all my heart. She kind of woke my intrest in these things again but ... she's weird. When I touch touche her or try to start something she just like freezes and doesn't move, speak or whatsoever anymore ... I always get scared of doing something wrong or her not wanting that right now that I'd rather put my own cravings out of action than put harm on her even though she doesn't say no ... or anything else in that matter ... 

Actually even when I talked to her about it she always just says it's normal and that I should just go on n so but ... I don't know ... something just always feels weird and uncomfortable about it and I stop.

It's just so weird to me doing things and not getting any kind of reaction whatsoever. Not even in the slightest. Not even a kiss or something back n then. Is that normal? I mean, if that's what sex is I really think I got something wrong there... 

As I mentioned this has been going on for 3 years by now and over the last months were constantly just fighting and she mentioned multiple times she's thinking about breaking up and so. It's not cause of what I just mentioned but some other problems she has n so as mentioned in earlyer posts too.

Now within my head that I might lose her soon which is already a kick in the face for me as I really really love her additionaly I started thinking about how me beeing very much inexperienced as shit when it comes to everything connected to sex might be a big red flag to others in the future too...

Before I start I think I should mention that I am a 29 year old who has been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, and anxiety and depression and recently been prescribed adderall for about 3 weeks so far.

Ever since I a kid (maybe like 13-14) I was always very fascinated in criminal psychology. I would always want to know the who, what, when, how, and why’s of why criminals commit the acts they do. And I would constantly research and read until I felt like I had a reasonable explanation.

For about 5 years now I have been researching the Columbine tragedy that took place in 1999. I would spend hours a day reading about the killers,victims, and everyone that had a story to share.

I feel like I’m getting to the point to where it’s becoming an obsession and I am genuinely concerned about this. I find myself not being able to focus from my work to personal life. It’s always just I need to know more and more. 

I find myself trying to relate to the killers, trying to find a reason that could come up with some better answers then what I have been seeing all over. I have went down a rabbit hole that I feel is endless. 

I’m very sad to say but I am not sure if I should pull the plug on this. I’m not sure if I’m at the point of a healthy fascination still or if it has gone into an obsession. I’m also starting to question my whole major. I’m not sure if this is right for me. 

To the people reading this, I’m sorry if this is offensive to you, I can only imagine the thoughts everyone must think reading this. I’m not a bad person, or dangerous in anyway. I am not glorifying this incident either. I’m just really concerned if this is healthy or not. Because I’m not sure.

Important to mention I’m recovering from anorexia right now, and it’s not like I’m gonna starve (lol) cause we have other stuff in the house, it’s just both kind of really triggering and sucky to not have any foods I even remotely want to have in the house.

751,"I’ve always been a person to avoid conflict in order to try to fill my life with positive energy. Because of this I feel that the people in my life are not genuine, acknowledge my success, or genuinely care for me. 

The biggest person that makes me a victim to this is my mom. My dad died when I was very young, and my mom started dating someone else. She began going out more, and giving me less attention, which was crucial during my teenage years. Eventually, her and this man got married. After him living in the house for a while, I was sexually assaulted by him twice. The first time my mom did nothing, the second time, he left the house. I do not know if they are divorced. In response to this, my mom told me “not to tell [my family] about this, [shes] trying to protect [me] not him” 

Now, I barely hear from her. I got a message from her today, after months of not speaking; asking me “what I wanted for Christmas and how my internship was going” .. 

I moved towns and support myself completely. I know asking for random peoples advice isn’t helpful, but I just want some advice on the kind of people I should put my energy into, or if it’s worth it to give attention to my mother at this point in time.",25Oct2020,1

753,"My whole middle school life, I never knew how to actually be a friend or make friends, and I did not want to be lame so I just became comedic relief. I always annoyed people, said dumb, insensitive things, and the only way I ever communicated was by making jokes because I was that awkward. I went to a small school that was for vanguard students, so everyone was a bright student and knew each other. Now in high school, most people from that school still talk and hang out with each other because they all made lasting friendships and I can never be a part of their seriousness. They were very good people and I still want to be a part of their lives, but everyone remembers me for this dumb idiot. Whenever I talk to them now, we get to have good conversations but we never get that close. I want to hang around the people who do well in school and actually have a life so I have people to look up to, but these people see me as a dumba\*\* as well. I want to make new friends but I find it really hard to not be fake and even I don't know who I am.

For context, I am quite a vulgar and blunt sense of humour, often making jokes about sex and fucking my friends etc and also cannot handle my drink,and ended up VERY drunk every time we went out. I (supposedly, as i cannot remember) made a few of these suggestive jokes and comments to this guy while out drinking with the group. However I never made a move or advanced on him outside of being flirty while very drunk. I also have a history of sexual assault/rape which he knew about. 


Fast forward a few weeks and we go out again and I am so drunk i cannot walk straight. This time he decides to grab at me and grope me several times throughout the night. 
I did not tell him to stop as we were with other friends and I did not want to make a scene.
I did not ever ask him or tell him to do those things.
I did tell him I wanted to leave as all my friends were leaving too and I didnt want to be alone with him after he'd grabbed me throughout the night.

My friends have reported this to work and he has been suspended, but he has made it out like I was asking for it through my suggestive jokes and being flirty over the time we were working together.

Their views do not have to do with anything political and believe they just think it will be fine because nothing has happened. In a few weeks there will be a gather of people at my in-laws home with people to enact a tradition for my wife’s sister that is getting married (not a wedding ceremony). I have severe objections to this especially given that my in-laws have underlying conditions that put them at high risk. 

If you are asking why my wife doesn’t voice this to her sister well lets just say my wife’s sister has an anger problem and can be insulting when things dont go her way. 

I live in a republican state so I can’t report this to authorities as they will likely do nothing. 

I dont know how to handle this and have this conversation without missing an event that is important to my in-laws and important to my wife to be there. My wife is also in agreement that her family ignores protocols as outlined by the CDC.

759,"Recently, I've been thinking a lot. I think, being at home for so long has given me the time to assess myself. I think that I'm a horrible person and I don't think I deserve friends or anything of the sort. I'm very, very selfish, and even more lazy. I will not to anything that requires any sort of substantial amount of energy.

I almost always choose what I consider to be the path of least resistance.

I've noticed that, the reason I do a lot of things, is simply because I don't want it to come back and require massive efforts down the line. For example, I will reject nearly all acts of kindness that would place me in debt to someone. I don't like receiving presents with others because in many cases, it means I have to get them something eventually. It's terrible.

The other issue, and quite possibly the biggest one, is that I need people for entertainment. I see others as a form of entertainment or pleasure. Of course, I have my moments where I think there's mutual fun happening, but I would rather sit there and watch a group of people talk and observe their interactions and reactions than actually talk to them. I do find talking to people fun, and I think it's nice to have people to talk to, but I feel like it's only when it's convenient to me.

Virtually everything I do is for myself. It doesn't matter how selfless the action seems. It's almost always beneficial to me. Nearly all of my actions are meant to preserve some sort of righteous image. They're meant to make me seem good and dependable and funny and happy, but I'm not. I'm especially not happy. I hate virtually everything, ranging from the world to my very existence.

What I'm trying to say, is that I think in my little bubble of desires, everyone is replaceable. All of my friends and family, are replaceable or unnecessary. The only reason the relationships still exist is because they're either carrying them, or I still have some sort of use for them; I still find them entertaining. However, if they ever said, ""hey, I don't think I want to talk anymore"" the only honest response I could give them would be ""okay."" I wouldn't blame them for leaving and I wouldn't exactly care. In fact, this happened to me recently, and that's how I know for a fact that I would react that way. The only reason that relationship is intact today, is because some of my other friends stepped in and told me to be more kind and to actually try to maintain the relationship. I was ready to drop a friend I've known for 6 years now in a heartbeat.

I could go on and on about how terrible of a person I am, but that would be a waste of your time.

I've tried telling some of my friends that this is how I actually am, but they don't seem to care or understand. I don't want to make them upset, because that would be a hassle for me.

But I also think, maintaining these relationships with them is cruel. It's almost like a researcher that's suddenly realized how cruel it is to constantly test use mice and is trying to figure out whether or not to let them go. I think, the easiest solution would be to stay in all of these relationships and continuing to hide who I am. I just don't think I'm going to be able to keep everyone happy.

The way I see it, either I leave everyone right now and find a way to be happy alone without people to use for my own desires and hurt them in the process, or I stay with them and make them live happily whilst sacrificing my own happiness and tricking them into thinking everything is peachy and I am who I say I am.",25Oct2020,1

So I really need some advice I am still a kid but I have been thinking a lot about this. I’m American and I got into Anime when I was 5 things like Pokémon. Then when I got to the age of 10 I started loving Asian culture a lot not just anime. I think it is beautiful everything from the traditional clothing to the festival’s. I’ve always wanted to live in Japan and my aunt says she will take me to visit one day and I’m super excited but lately there has been something holding me back. I express myself a lot and how much I love the culture but I am afraid that I will offend a person from the culture if I wear anything from it. Of course things like Lolita fashion is something I would feel comfortable wearing but things like a Kimono or a Cheongsam if I ever went to China or Japan would get me weird looks or maybe people would get angry at me. I also have been looking at a Liuqin (Chinese instrument) and I’ve been wanting to learn to play one but I’m afraid to play one because I’m not Asian or I might offend someone if I don’t play it right. Btw I really don’t want to become Asian I know there are strange people out there that want to change their own culture to become someone else but that is not what I want to do.

766,"Hi! I hope you’re all having a good day! I would really like to preface this by saying that I’m an atheist, and I don’t really believe in anything supernatural.
I’m 16 now, and my parents and I moved into this apartment complex when I was 9. This is going to sound so cheesy, but ever since we moved in, the three of us have noticed that my room is so much colder than anywhere else in the house. But the real weird shit didn’t start until I was 13. 
At night, I started hearing someone breathing in my ear or around my room. I would hold my breath to make sure I wasn’t hearing my own breathing, and sure enough, it sounded like there was someone else in my room. I always assumed it was because it was late at night and because I sleep with my fan on, so I must’ve been freaking myself out. But one day, the breathing started in the middle of the day with no other noise. I flipped out, started hysterically crying, and had my mom check my entire room. Of course no one was there, but I refused to go back in my room for the rest of the day. It started happening that every time I was in my room alone, there was breathing. I couldn’t be in my room without headphones on. After maybe 4 months, I decided I would stop being scared. I was probably hallucinating, so i just thought I’d ignore it. The second I made this decision, I felt someone run their fingers through my hair. I ran to turn on my light, but of course, no one was there. From that night on, I would feel someone crawl into bed with me or touch my hair/face almost every night, in addition to the breathing. After a few months of that, I started ignoring it again. But it didn’t stop there. Doors slamming shut and opening by themselves, our drawers and cabinets opening and shutting by themselves, really weird shit. My parents blame it on wind drafts. My dad keeps having a recurring nightmare about someone crawling up and sitting on his chest, claiming it feels so real it always wakes him up. Every single knife in the house and a bottle of wine went missing one night, and I got blamed and grounded for it. My parents searched my entire room, and we still can’t find our knifes or their wine. 

I’ve been dealing with this for three years and I have no idea what’s happening or what to do. I’ve never believed in the supernatural before, but at this point, it’s hard for me to come up with another explanation. Please help?",25Oct2020,1

They think it’s all jokes and that I find it funny but over time the jokes have grown old and I’m so sick of it. I’m just a big joke in this family. Every time I try to have an actual conversation with my mom or my dad they find some way to ridicule me and crush my self esteem, always reminding me I’m barely even seventeen, I can’t possibly know anything about anything. Every time I try to actually do something, even the most simple thing, they think I’m doing everything wrong. Their way is better. I’ve tried to tell them that I may not do everything their way and that my way may not be perfect but that I have to sometimes make my own mistakes to learn from them. Lately I’ve been thinking about moving away, renting my own place in the neighboring city. Today I brought it up to my mom and she instantly ridiculed me. Finding every single small hole in my plan and ripping it open. Then she proceeded to tell about it to my father, who at the dinner table began asking me, why I’m so depressed and what is it about my life that is so terrible, I’ve had it so easy!! I’m so tired.

Im jobless and i dont have any talents. 

My parents love him much more as he is the Prodigy son. My mom even said i was a mistake. Also there was one event when i was a child the 'common wealth games' was held in our country and dad had 2 tickets. My brother said he didn't want to go. I cried and asked dad to take me with him, but he took him anyway. 

Everything I do, my parents compare me with him and say why can't u be like him, why cant u do this like him. 

I tried to copy my brother and tried to do whatever he did and failed miserably.

Our gap grew bigger and bigger and i haven't talked to him like 5yrs. 2-3 days back i talked to him and i hated him so so much. Dont know why but he was so different and my parents made me hate him so much due to the comparisons they make. 


Now im in the middle of the ocean and have started to realise that i wasted my whole life trying to be someone that my parents wanted me to be.

Its not like i hate them and i dont think they hate me either. But i think they dont know a thing about being a parent or even how to be a good human. They think if they provide food, i should be happy as hell. They didn't even ask what i want to be or want i want to do in life.

Now im exhausted and i dont want to do anything. The need to struggle to get anything or the need to be successful in the eyes of society is sickening me.

I am thinking of suicide but recently a famous actor suicided and was a big news in my country. And so you know what my parents called him? A 'coward' . And i had a talk with them and the conclusion that come out of the conversation was all suiciders are dumb , losers and coward. So me suiciding would add to their point of view of me as a loser son.

So what should i do. Suicide would not  be good for anyone , not me or my parents. It would only prove that i am a loser.

782,"**TL/DR at the end**

Ok so I'm 16 and there hasn't been a year in my life I didn't go trick or treating. I don't have many friends and my best friend (the one I hang out with the most) told me they work all night on Halloween so we cant go together. They proposed we could have a sleepover instead on Friday night and buy a lot of candy and have a horror movie marathon. I said yes, but I decided to also go collecting candies Saturday night.

However, I just realized how lonely that would be. Can you imagine? Giving a handful of candy to 5-year-olds and then this 5'8 guy comes up alone dressed as a plague doctor and asks for candy. It's ridiculous. But I'm not ready to let go of Halloween yet.

So I thought I could ask some of my other friends. I met this guy two months ago at my summer job and we instantly became friends. He presented me to his other friends and I really liked them all, and when the night was over, we all went home. The next morning, they'd added me to their group chat and I haven't talked to them since that. I really want to talk to them, but I never know what to say and that's a subject for another day.

I remember that the guy I met at my summer job once said he already had his Halloween costume ready, and he was going to go with his friends and they had this cool thematic. I heard him and I thought ""Wow that's so cool, I wish I could do that!"". I really want to ask him if I can pass Halloween with them, but that was in August, before the second wave of covid-19 so I don't know if they're still going. And if they are going, they might not even want me there and I wouldn't blame them cause they don't really know me and my costume doesn't match theirs and maybe they're going to another city cause some of them have cars. I know I'm overthinking this but I really don't want to spend Halloween alone and they're kind of my last shot but I don't want them to turn me down so I'm just not taking any risks. Should I text them??????

783,"Hi! I’m 21F and I had gotten pregnant with my now ex 18M. A lot has happened between us and I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of over the past few months but I’m really trying to do what is best for myself and my baby. I do still care and love my babies father but he’s went down a path that I can’t comprehend. 2 months ago he went to go live with his mother 6 hours away after a big argument that happened. Ever since then I’ve just went down a real toxic path because I haven’t had any real emotional support nor good family support. I’ve done some very inconsiderate things out of just pure anger towards him for becoming very careless and just heartless. Which is very hard for me to become but I became that person for awhile. I still do feel some anger towards him for giving up so easily and just basically acting like our relationship meant nothing to him. 

I’m trying really hard to understand the choices he is making in life right now knowing there is a baby on the way. His motto right now in life is “debauchery, nothing less.” Which basically means he’s living a very careless partying lifestyle. Me being the person that has never really lived that lifestyle or never really intended to am having a really hard time understanding where he’s coming from. He’s been through a lot of traumatic past events and has never really had a family or a stable home life. At 14 years old he tried to end his life. I deeply cared for this person and wanted to understand all of his pain but not ever experiencing it first hand it was hard for me to fully understand his pain. I feel that he is just living this lifestyle because he’s just given up on a lot of things in life. I always wanted to be that person for him that stuck through all the bullshit because that’s how much I craved to understand him but he pushed me away..and I just became someone I’m not. 

It’s been two weeks since I’ve contacted him. It hasn’t been easy at all. Last message I sent him was me basically saying I’ll see him in court. On Friday I figured out the gender of our baby and it’s a boy. I want to tell him the gender but deep down inside I just wish he cared enough to at least check up on us. I told myself I wouldn’t contact him.

787,"I am 17 and i live with my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend (they are in their 20's) 

We live in a 3 bedroom house that has had a ton of problems since my mother and i first moved in. Our driveway is on an incline and one of the sump pumps was broken for months so every time it rained it would flood and sometimes you would have to stand outside in the rain and sweep dirt off of the drain, we had to have the sink in the downstairs bathroom removed because the water from the kitchen sink would bubble out of it, (leaving us with 1 bathroom for 4 people) and our ac does not properly reach upstairs making the bedrooms unbelievably hot. (To name a few of the problems we've encountered)

The newest problem is that my brother and his gf recently had their baby, hes four months old and our lease is up at the beginning of November. This means that if we don't move, they will be sharing a room with their 1 1/2 year old baby by the time we can move out again. Before they moved in I had two rooms and let them take one so now my room is super cramped. 

Recently when applying for houses we found out that they are labelled as ""undesirable renters"" from their previous apartment. (Long story, but i can explain if asked) This means that most rental companies will not accept us. They don't even really pay the rent, they pay rent to my mom but my mom can fully pay the rent without relying on them if need be. We have been looking for about 2 months and every place either wont take us or is too expensive/doesn't have what we need.

I am getting desperate at this point because I do not think this house is going to work for us for another year, but my mom has basically lost hope and we have to sign a new lease soon. (I forgot to mention that they are going to raise our rent this year even though it isn't deserved) 

Does anyone have any advice on what I/we can do?",25Oct2020,1

Now it was put under mortgage because my father wasnt paying for his retirment fund. Just to be clear he never even recived any pension so basicaly they punished him for not paying sonething he never planned to have. But they haven't dobe anything yet and its been a few years since. I was still a minor at the time. My and my dad arent getting along and I was hoping to sell my part of the apartment and I wanted to hire a lawyer. But the thing is that he assures me that in a year he will start recieving his pension (on a different base) and that they will use that money to pay the debt off and the mortgage will be lifted. I am afraid that if I take any action that the bank will take the apartment and then we will both end on the streets.

I do have a cell phone addiction that I think is related. I will spend all day on my phone even though I find it boring. I don’t know why I do this but I do and I cannot seem to control it. I’ve tried setting limits but I always turn them off, I’ve tried to just force myself to stay off but I relapse so easily and it’s very boring and I spend time staring at walls in place of the phone.

791,"Hi -- made this anonymous post because I don't want it to be linked with my main.

A girl (15F) that I (15M) dated on and off for a while (but off now) got extremely upset at me recently because about a year ago, when we had just started dating, I had said some sexually charged things about her. It was really in the heat of the moment, just joking with some friends. I really regret saying those things and apologized. She struggles with an eating disorder and she told me that what I had said negatively impacted her progress. We spoke almost every night over the summer and I felt like she was the only person at my school that truly understood how I felt. We both developed feelings for each other over the summer and stopped speaking to lose them about two months ago. Last week was when I messaged her and she told me how upset she was over what I had said in the past. She says she feels like she can no longer be my friend.

Since then, she's started dating one of my other friends. I thought he was my friend, but we had a falling out about a year ago and I don't think he considers me his friend anymore. I tried to hangout with him and he told me he doesn't want to.

She is at the epicenter of our friend group and is setting up stuff without me. So it really feels like I've been abandoned by my whole friend group. My school is still online, so I don't know any way to really make friends.

This has all happened in less than a week. I really don't know what to do. Feeling more hopeless than I ever have. Every day feels like a constant struggle to stay alive and wanting to live.

Do you all have any advice as to what I should do?",25Oct2020,1
792,"Okay, so this is a weird story. Basically I met this girl online over a video game, and we sorta just clicked from the beginning. We were able to trust each other with incredibly personal things, and I guess one thing led to another and I fell for her.

She's my everything, her presence brings me comfort, relaxes me. When she is hurting I'm hurting, when she's happy I'm happy. She's the only other person in my life that I could genuinely trust with everything on my mind, the atmosphere and vulnerability and comfort I feel around her is irreplaceable to me. I love her a lot, but I was afraid of messing up our friendship so I kept my mouth shut.

A couple days ago she told me she was dating someone, not just anyone, but on of my best friends. It.. upset me, because I guess I really wanted to be that sort of person to her, but I can't be.

I've been depressed about it for a while now, and she keeps asking me what's wrong, since in our relationship, we've been open about everything that's bothered us from the beginning, but honestly, I can't say the truth. To confess now would be to destroy their relationship, or her relationship with me. I'm not selfish enough to pull that sort of shit, but I don't know what to tell her.

Advice? I can't ghost her or disappear because she won't leave me alone.. I can't tell her the truth because it would mess things up, and I can't convince her nothing is wrong because I've been acting depressed for too long now..

TW SUICIDE, SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SELF HARM

My (19f) sister (16f) has a lot of struggles with mental health including depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. Over the last few years the self harm has gotten worse and worse and she overdosed yesterday. 

No one in my family can understand why she keeps doing it. She was sexually assaulted by a previous boyfriend which I understand is horrible and no one should go through it but it seems like the littlest things trigger her.

Things like someone cancelling plans or someone poking fun at her send her spiralling. The worst part is when she gets into the episode of self harm, she posts it all over social media, sends it to her friends, and almost brags about it after the fact. The next day she acts like everything is fine.

She also acts very manipulative towards her friends and family getting people to buy her stuff and drive her hours away. She has a sugar daddy that I’m pretty sure is illegal as well.

Just this past weekend she used my kitchen knives from Christmas to self harm, had a party then kicked everyone out and threatened to off herself because her ex wouldn’t kiss her, then overdosed and had to go to the hospital yesterday. 

She’s home now but everyone in my family wished she went to the psych ward so we could stop worrying about her for a few days. It’s reaching a point where everyone in my family doesn’t want her around anymore. It seems like no matter how much therapy, support, and meds we give her she just doesn’t want to get better.

My dad is already threatening to leave because of this and the rest of us are just exhausted having to deal with this multiple times weekly.

I want to clarify that I don't want to be one of those boyfriends who says that she can't have any guy friends and shit like that, because I don't mind that. What bothers me is that she told me that he did indeed have feelings for her back before they stopped talking.

Getting a therapist to whine about it being too much so i can get some time off of school comes with even more negatives then positives regarding my burnout and i don’t know what to do. 

Everyday when i come home after roughly ten hours of school a day i will have the whole day filled with homework and even double gym hours whee they force you to run a few kilometers and they get mad as hell if you dare to walk before you reached that, i also have extreme amenia, so i often as i walk a long way home have to stop as i’m almost blacking out, gym doesn’t help. They don’t listen. 

Our country has extreme amounts of corona cases but refuse to close school even with the knowledge that all of the cases are coming from there. In hospitals there are NO rooms free at all because of corona. Having to keep pushing and knowing youve only just passed the beginning of a year when youre already at the end of your energy hurts so much. How do i stay strong when i don’t even have time for ‘i’?

I cannot get out of this year, does someone know how to skip a few months? I wish online school was back.

I don’t know what to do.",25Oct2020,1
828,"My dad constantly gets on my nerves, and he is embarrassing and rude. He smells bad, and he has really long armpit hair, a thick ugly unibrow, and a ton of wrinkles on his body. He walks around the house wearing nothing but a pair of gross boxer shorts. He snores really loud at night, and his thighs are extremely thick. His eyes always bulge out, and his hands always form fists for no reason, and it looks like he's going to punch someone's lungs out. He stares at people, and it's really scary, because his eyes look creepy, and his face is disgusting and chubby. He smacks his lips when he eats, and he has terrible breath. His teeth are all yellow or brown, and his hair is really bulgy. He farts and burps around other people, and it smells terrible. He rips out a massive fart all the time, even though he thinks it's okay. 

He has bad table manners as well. He drinks about 70 bottles of beer at every meal, and he eats with his bare hands. He often slouches in front of the TV when he eats, and he spills the sauce everywhere. It gets on his body, on his clothes, on the sofa, and on the floor. My mom has asked him to stop eating in front of the TV, but he never listens. He burps when he eats, and he hogs all the food for himself. There's never enough food for everyone else because of him.

He has terrible shower habits as well. He spends about 40 times in the shower, and he leaves his dirty underwear in the shower, and sometimes he even hangs it on the faucet knob. He tosses his dirty clothes and towels on the bathroom floor, and he fart and burps non-stop when he showers. He brings beer bottles, snacks, video games, and the TV into the bathroom when he showers, and he makes a mess in there. There's literally Cheeto dust everywhere in the bathroom, and there's snack wrappers in the toilet and on the floor, and I even see soda bottles and beer bottles in the toilet. He plays video games when he showers, and he leaves the game controller in the shower, and he blares the TV super loud. He does the same when he uses the bathroom, plus he uses like 50 rolls of toilet paper every time he uses the bathroom, and he never flushes when he's done.

He has anger issues as well. He sleeps without wearing any clothes, and often at 2 in the morning he would storm out of bed, burp and fart super loud, and run around the house, barging into people's rooms while completely naked, he screams in our faces and spits on everyone, and he drags us downstairs, punches an enormous hole in the wall, and makes us fix it in 10 minutes, or else he will fly into a rage and punch more holes in the walls, tear apart furniture, smash the windows, and set fire to our books and flush everything down the toilet. If anyone tries to negotiate with him, then he punches his chest, jumps up and down, and wiggles his head. He drinks several bottles of wine when staring at us. Often we are clueless, so we just don't know what to do. That only makes him angrier, and he gets even more aggressive.

And my dad is super creepy as well. He hogs the bathroom, and there's only one bathroom in the house. If I ask him if I can use the bathroom, he kicks open the door and screams no 300 times. He eats all the snacks, and when I ask him for a bite, he farts 50 times and twists my arm. Also, he jumps on people's beds and deforms them. He weighs 700 pounds, and he's only 4 feet tall.",25Oct2020,1
829,"Hey all,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I have a friend who is thinking about partying this coming weekend in a different city. I tried talking to them about how that's dumb and will put us all at risk (they have roommates and we have mandatory in-person classes). I'm gonna try to talk to them again, but if they don't listen, should I say something to school admin? We're a small class and I know that this friend will know it was me or one of their roommates or something if they get approached by an administrator, but also I feel like it's really risky and puts a lot of other people at risk, and if I know what this person did, I feel like I'm partially responsible for any harm that does or doesn't come of it. Is there anything else I can or should do?",25Oct2020,1
830,"I've been having nightmares about very specific things for a while now. They've been mostly about a humanoid black silhouette and me getting kidnapped and stuff. There have been some extreme ones too, like the one where my dad abandons me and I get snatched by a 4 or 5 meter tall thing with 3 meter long arms and legs while it opens up it's mouth and eyes. I woke up screaming at that one. These past nights I've been having absolutely horrifying dreams. Two nights ago I dreamt about me being in some sort of research facility in the basement of my house. It was some sort of artificial sea but not very big. There was a small island however. I was having fun swimming in the dark and playing on the island when I realized I felt watched and frantically went up to some sort of control panel to try and turn off the lights. While I was doing this I saw a sort of picture of the thing that was coming to kill me. It was some sort of cross between the boy from ju-on the grudge and the thing from the russian sleep experiment. It looked like the boy but more teen-y and its face was in the same position as that from the thing from the russian sleep experiment. It had very rounded teeth and it peered straight into my soul. I started looking for the light switch more and more frantically when a sort of airlock like door opened with a pshh. There was nothing in the doorframe so in a panic I barrelled towards it to bear up whatever was there in some sort of fight or flight reaction, knowing I had nowhere to go. It turned out I was beating up my mom and I woke up sweating.
Last night, however, involved my dad. We were out on some sort of sea or giant lake. We were on a fairly modern boat. The sun was in a constant state of setting, so the sky was beautiful. Now I have to say that I had a similar feeling dream about two years ago. In that dream I was out on the open ocean with my parents and I was in the freezing and very rough water. I was attached to the boat by a sort of cross between a lifeline on a sailboat that you attach to your life vest and a guide line used in cave diving. I was tasked with bringing up some kind of giant fish. I remember the fish being a greenland shark. I had to go down about 300 meters into a very green deep sea. I was completely alone and no one could help me. I was absolutely freezing and scared to death. Eventually I brought the shark up to the surface but I was stuck with the shark in the water for hours upon hours. In the dream I had last night, my dad and I had to cross this sea or lake. Eventually he took me into the cabin and showed me a sort of hole in the boat that I was supposed to use to spearfish in a very tight underwater cave. I also had to keep up with the boat to avoid getting left behind. When I entered the cave system I immediately saw a giant school of barracuda chasing me. I wanted to get out but I had to leave the cave system on the other side. I eventually made it to safety but the seas were getting rougher and we were stuck on a non moving 60 meter or so wave that had two stories. Eventually it moved and we almost capsized. We arrived at a harbor and the harbourmaster was checking everyone's cargo shouting that it was 1902 but spelled 19002 which was weird and that nobody cares what we had on board. I've had worse dreams, some of which I don't remember because I only remember waking up sweating and crying. Last night I woke up sweating again.
I'm afraid that the nightmares will get worse and I might suffer from sleep deprivation and paranoia. Is there any kind of therapy I need for this or is this something that can be fixed another way?

You are good and right and capable, you really are enough, exactly as everybody else is; playing the victim means considering yourself inferior to what makes you feel bad, but you are not! You are not inferior, you are not worse nor wrong, you are totally enough for anything and anyone.

Yes, life is hard. Yes, it is hard to go on when you have nothing and nobody and just a long list of disappointments behind you. But what I’ve learned is to step back and watch me and say: I am not ashamed of that.

837,"i am 17 years old and lately i’ve been struggling badly with my moods and i can see how it is affecting myself and how it can ruin my relationships. i’ve always been quite suicidal but now that i have a boyfriend that isn’t something that crosses my mind anymore, although i always think if he were to cheat on me or leave me i would probably do something stupid and harmful, it’s concerning that i could easily just switch and it can be dangerous and i usually do talk about suicide to my boyfriend and how even if i’m happy it’s always an option if something were to happen. i have really bad attachment issues and i’ve always been this way, i’m very clingy and will do anything to keep my boyfriend in my life, i sometimes end up making things up in my head if something seems off and then keep thinking about it until i believe something is going on, which makes him quite annoyed and stressed because i have to reassure myself by looking at who he is talking to and i just need that constant reassurance to make myself feel ok. i have been diagnosed with anxiety and am on anxiety medication which has helped with my anxiety attacks and constant anxiety throughout the day but hasn’t helped some situations which is why i’m concerned something else could be going on. i also gain a lot of jealously and anger out of no where, for example i was hanging out w my bestfriend and boyfriend and he wasn’t giving me as much attnetion as i preferred so i ended up shutting down completely, being very blunt with both of them and feeling so hurt on the inside everything was upsetting me and causing me anger i felt extremely depressed, when my bestfriend left i ended up crying for hours to my boyfriend and my bestfriend tells my other mates that my boyfriend probs wants to break up w me but is too scared to, exept my boyfriend knows me and sees i’m struggling, he has been by my side through so much for a year now, but i’m hurt because people think i’m a horrible person when i’m not. my mood swings are very intense too i feel like i feel a lot more than i should, for example i said to my boyfriend i love you and he sent hearts back then i ended up crying my eyes out, my boyfriend said he couldn’t stay for dinner i ended up shutting down cos my anger was intense then i started crying for an hour making him stay, another example is when my boyfriend said he couldn’t come see me because he was busy so i got so angry that it psychically hurt and i deleted my social media then switched to feeling like i didn’t need anyone but myself, then i downloaded it back to talk to him and was crying for a while, then my anger was the first thing i felt in the morning. i get like explosive anger for the smallest things and it’s really strange and frustrating cos i cant physically control it otherwise it hurts and makes me go insane, although i try my best not to offend anyone whej i explode. and another thing that happens is the way i feel about people switches up so much even my own friends, one day i will just feel anger/jealously toward them and then assume we’re on bad terms and then i feel happy with them again. i also get random anger toward my parents for no reason and just feel some hatred toward them but 10 mins before i felt happy with them. i don’t know it’s just so weird and hard so deal with, what could be wrong ?! it’s ruining everything, i know i am a good person but these emotions are out of my control it’s only gonna end up breaking me. i need advice",25Oct2020,1

840,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, please tell me where is the best place to post. 


Lately I have been trying to better myself, and a lot of it is processing my childhood. I have a hard time recalling a lot of it and so sometimes negative memories will resurface and I will talk to a counselor or my boyfriend about it. Here are some of the memories that have been bugging me as of late. 

When I was 10-11 years old, my mom became obsessed with French bulldogs. We were a really poor family, mostly due to my mom and stepfathers inability to responsibly budget/handle money, but also due to the fact that my stepfather couldn’t hold a job. Regardless, when a scarce paycheck came in and a “great deal” on a French bulldog puppy surfaced, they brought one home. 

Great for awhile, but she needed special food because she was allergic to most foods (I’m not sure if it is all
French bulldogs or just her, but it was something about grains I think) and pretty much as soon as the puppy grew up she became resented by my parents. They kept her in the back of the house, in a mildewy cold room where we did our laundry. She had to stay on the cold tiles and she absolutely did not get the special grain free sensitive food she needed. 

When I was going to middle school, it became my job to wake up earlier than everyone else, quietly go downstairs, and clean up the poor dogs bloody pee, diarrhea, and occasional vomit. If I made too much noise in the morning I would get yelled at for waking my parents up, and my stepfathers reasoning for making it my job to clean up after the dog was that I should have been getting up early enough to let her out before she could make a mess of the laundry room. I was only allowed to use a couple paper towels at a time and constantly got in trouble for using too much bleach or towels to try to clean up the whole floor of a mess. If I didn’t clean it up before it was time to leave for school I would get in trouble, and I would have to clean it up before getting a ride to school. I also was the only person doing the entire families dishes for awhile. Including everyone’s cooking messes and everything. For a family of 6. Not sure if I have validation in being upset about that or if I should just stop being dramatic because that’s a normal chore, but anyways. 

We didn’t have dog food consistently in our house, because my stepfather said she needed to eat the expensive sensitive dog food, but they couldn’t afford it “right now” (never) So sometimes she would eat leftover human food, sometimes she would have crappy dog food, and once in awhile they would care enough to get the dog food she needed. All the while she made sick messes in the back of the room and was neglected. As she wasn’t allowed into the rest of the house with the family (where my mom’s other tiny toy chihuahua dog was for some reason???) she had to sleep on a towel or on the freezing tile floor, sometimes in her own mess. It makes me so terribly sad to think about it. 

When she had fleas, my parents waited until the house was infested (I mean thousands of fleas all over the place, giving my little brothers bites everywhere) to deal with the problem professionally. At one point she had some sort of skin issue and rubbed the fur off of her back because of itchy ness (probably the flees but it was a long time ago).

I don’t think she’s ever gotten the proper vet care she’s needed in the past, and I just want to know if this is animal abuse or not. They never kick or physically attack the dog, or like literally “abuse”, in a sense of you know what comes to mind when one might think of the word “abuse.” It’s just what I’ve explained. I visited my little brothers and they still have the same poor dog leashed up outside. There’s an old couch out there and when she manages to jump up on it she is yelled at to get down and has to stay on the concrete. It broke my heart because she was so excited to see me but she was so dirty and smelly and in desperate need of a bath I did not want to touch her (I did but not a lot because it was really bad and it makes me feel awful but I am kinda a clean freak possibly?? OCD) I want to call a shelter or something but I’m scared she will just get put down because she has health issues and she is the sweetest dog. I also don’t actually know the address of where they live to tell anyone because I just visited my little brothers by following another family members car all the way out to their new house. Any advice or thoughts are welcome. Validation please. I feel like I’m just being dramatic and I need someone to tell me it’s not normal.",25Oct2020,1

859,"I (14f) usually do well in school, so my parents expect a lot, and yell at me if I do not achieve their ever increasing expectations. They are also strict, and have very short fuses. An innocent comment can be manipulated into an insult, or they make it about them instead of what I’m trying to talk about. My mum does not think she pressures me, and gets mad and insulted when I tell her I feel like she does. She says she feels that she doesn’t and therefore I’m discounting her feelings and telling her how to feel. My dad accepts that he pressures me and asks if I want to “know what real pressure is” then sets the standard higher and if I fail to meet that I’m given the silent treatment.

I’m cautious to bring it up, as my mum is struggling a bit (she said she feels like she’ll never be happy again) and I don’t want to make her upset. She is not mentally ill, she just feels like she’s on her own and the bills and house expenses are piling up (my parents split when I was 2). My dad just gets mad and starts saying I’m not capable of anything/personal attacks, ect. Last night he told me he’d make a list of how he’s a bad parent because he’s “self aware” and I should make a list about how I’m a terrible child.

They don’t seem to get how it’s been a bit hard for me as well lately. 2 of my friends tried to kill themselves, one cuts and binge drinks, and one of the friends who attempted has been getting worse, she looks like a ghost and I’m the only person she feels comfortable being honest with (yay s/)

860,"A few days ago, I became sick. I’m pretty sure it’s just a cold because I’m lacking a lot of covid symptoms but regardless, I’m sick. I have no idea why but this sickness has thrusted me into depression like I’ve never felt it before. 

On and off throughout the years I’ve struggled with it, but there was always a chore that needed to be done or a task at work that made me get up. And while I still had terrible intrusive thoughts I was able to distract myself a little. But now that I have nothing to do but wallow in misery that’s all I can find myself doing. I can’t even convince myself to eat because of the self image issues I’m having. 

I think another major thing that’s triggering it is that my husband and I are not intimate. Maybe every few months but that’s it. Today I’m sure he was “helping himself” in the bathroom and it made me even more miserable. I can’t get out of bed. 

My mind keeps racing to how I’ve gone from 110 at the start of our relationship to 123 now. How obviously I’m not his flavor anymore because /something else/ is. Every time I try to get up or even turn on my switch I think what is the point. I’m hideous, no one would care if I was gone, and everything hurts. 

Now I feel like if I was just able to talk with him about this it would make things better. But I have no idea how to start that conversation. He denies masterbation and tells me he thinks I’m attractive when I do try to talk about it. So it’s like it goes no where and leaves me feeling like it’s got to just be me. 

So really. I’m here asking for advice on how to level with my husband and tell him what’s going on without making it seem like I’m trying vying for his attention. I mean I am, but I feel like this is so much more serious than he understands.

862,"Hi,

I (f19) started college in September. A couple of weeks into starting I had a horrible experience in one of my classes that’s completely ruined my college experience so far, and I’m thinking of quitting and going home.

I struggle to make friends anyway, I am a mixture of being extremely shy and being considered beautiful (I do not feel this way about myself) that means people often assume I’m rude or stuck up.

A guy in one of my classes took a liking to me. I was always friendly, but I am not interested in dating at the minute. After class one day, he got talking to me outside and propositioned me for a date. I turned him down, as politely as I could, by saying I’m not looking to date at the minute. He pushed me for an elaboration and I said he seems lovely but he’s not my type. He seemed annoyed by this 

The next day when I was waiting for class my professor asked for a word. She took me aside and said another student had made an accusation of racism against me. The student had told her that I said I ‘don’t hang around with black people.’ I was absolutely mortified. I told her it wasn’t true, and I could tell she didn’t believe me at all, and I think she probably found it quite hurtful thinking I said this, being black herself. She said that she can’t do anything without proof and reluctantly let me stay in the class

However, no one in the class would speak to me, and I spent the whole class dealing with dirty looks people whispering about me. I felt so shaken up by the experience that I didn’t go back to the class again, and switched.

A few weeks after, I noticed a girl from the class lived in my dorm. I started getting dirty looks from people in my dorm and everyone seemed to avoid me. I feel too anxious to talk to anyone about the situation in case they don’t believe me, and I barely leave my room. I don’t know what to do.

**I want to add that I know false accusations of racism are extremely rare. Racism against black people is a huge problem, and organisations such as Black Lives Matter are extremely important. This was an isolated incident, and we should believe people when they tell us about experiences of racism**",25Oct2020,1
863,"So the other day I was reversing out of a tight parking space in a supermarket car park and gently bumped the car next to me, I drove forward and checked the car, couldn’t see a mark and just drove off - however I didn’t get out of my car to check thoroughly 1. Because I was running really late for an appointment and 2. Because I was panicking about what to do. Obviously with hindsight I should have got out, properly checked and then waited for the owner of the car, but I really thought with it being such a gentle bump and no obvious mark it would all be fine. Today I got in and noticed on my car and small but visible dent and a couple of scratches and now I’m very concerned I did more damage to the other car than I first thought. So here’s the question 
1. Is there a likely way for me to track down that car - I have no information about it 
2. Is it possible if the car is damaged that they can track me down
3. The car park was pretty full and there’s every chance people saw me hit the car and not wait, is there anything a bystander can do to get me in trouble if they recorded my number plate?


I fully accept I’m 100% the arsehole here, I have no excuse except I panicked, I just want advice on whether there’s anything I can do to make amends, and if there isn’t, if this is likely to come back and haunt me",25Oct2020,1

868,"My (25F) boyfriend (25M) and his brother had a rough childhood. My boyfriend was able to defeat the odds, get out the hood to go to college and now lives a pretty decent life. His however, brother still somewhat leads that same rough life. They had to stay at many shelters when they were younger and his brother to this day still bounces from staying with different people from house to house. The person he was staying with recently died of an overdose so he has a week to move out. 

He hasn’t asked anybody else if he can stay with them yet, but he has two options in mind. My boyfriend told him that he can stay with us if anything. I know that it’s only an possibility and that it is his brother, but just knowing that it can happen is really stressing me out. First, he hasn’t asked me how I felt on this. He probably didn’t ask because his mindset is “family is a given” and puts his brother above a lot of people since they went through the hardest things together. Secondly, his brother is a street guy. He has no drive to get a job besides doing street stuff and would just lay on our brand new sectional causing a dent in it. Thirdly, this is my first time living on my own and living with my boyfriend and I would hate to lose my space and privacy. We live in a “decent” sized one bedroom apartment and we barely even have room for storage. 

How do I go about this? 

He just told me a few minutes ago: “I just told my brother he can come stay with us if needed” and I’ve been distraught since then. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want his brother to be homeless but I also don’t want my space to be invaded. It’s really upsetting me.

869,"
So, I’m a 16m, and I’ve idk kinda been dating a girl. We’ve never officially stated we had been dating, I’ve asked her many times, and she says “I don’t know. I don’t want to hurt you, and I can’t lose you.” and we’ve gone on like that, doing basically everything up to sex. 

I used to fall hard for her, like what I think was love, and I know she had that at one point too. 

We’ve been on and off again since March, and right now we’re on. I like her a lot nowadays, and I think she likes me, but I dunno.

When we were off and I basically told her I was done,  but we could be fwb, my friend caught her saying she was catching feelings for some other kid. I told her we were completely done after confronting her abt it, and she instantly apologized and desperately tried to keep me,  and I think I might’ve fell for it because I don’t know if she was honest. 

Right now, she’s acting sometimes really sweet, and when we’re at my house yk it’s like we are dating.

I don’t want to lose her, or get rid of her, but I don’t know what to do. She’s not the most loyal from what I can tell, and I do put in 400x what she does, but I still get happiness out of the relationship. 

Do I seriously just have to call it quits and dump her for good? Or is there something I might be able to do to salvage it and actually have a committed relationship?

Tldr: this girl I still like, who’s been on and off again with me but currently on, doesn’t seem to be able to commit but still wants me as her “boyfriend” without the commitment. Is there anything I can do to salvage this? Or should I cut my losses of more then a year with her?",25Oct2020,1
870,"I have been having some trouble with my parents lately and it’s really having an effect on me. My mother is the main problem, she gets really upset with me over very small things. For example I told her that I wasn’t a fan of the soup we were having for dinner (it was just canned so she didn’t make it or anything) And I even began with saying I feel bad for not liking it. Then she proceeded to get very angry and ask things like “what do you mean you don’t like it” and “well why don’t you want to eat it”. Along with all the passive aggressive whatever’s and I guess so’s. This kind of thing happens a lot and I pretty much get scolded first thing as soon as I get home from school  every day.

871,"So here is a little back story:

I moved to the current city almost 10 years ago to go to school. As life unfolded, I dropped out of school and have been working two jobs for the last few years saving money. 

I saved up and bought brand new furniture to furnish a living room, dining room, bedroom, and washer and dryer coming from 3 boxes of random stuff and a beat up dresser. 

Anyway, after working two jobs, I always felt lost and felt stuck for a very long time. I didn’t finish what I started and had to work to make a living and couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do with my life. 

I finally snapped pretty recently and after years of not investing in myself, I paid for a career counselor who helped me to unearth what I was passionate about. It really woke me up inside and I put in my two weeks notice at the job I hated the most. 

A few days later, we soon found out that our city would be soon in direct path of Hurricane Laura. I live in southwest Louisiana with a very active hurricane season in 2020. 

So back to the present, the hurricane ravaged my city and in less than six weeks later, we had to experience a category 2 hurricane Delta. 

After 3 direct attacks to the local economy, I am realizing, the first being Covid shut down, the second being hurricane Laura shutting it down a second time for about a month and a half, and the third being hurricane delta, I am scared that the economy just couldn’t handle that many strikes. 

Businesses are gone, gutted, and now even two months since hurricane Laura, I would say about 20% of businesses has returned. There is still debris sitting by the roads waiting to be picked up. There is still a tarp on my house, in addition to about 80% of residents in the whole city as they battle insurance claims not covering anything because people have to pay out the ass before insurance matches the rest. And even then, there is a year wait for repairs. 

Long story short, I want to leave and go somewhere where I have a better chance of finding a job. I’ve been applying for jobs in Houston and Denver and haven’t received any call backs. 

I will never understand how some people can just pick their lives up and move and be completely fine. I’m much more cautious to something like that. I’d like to have a job and house lined up before doing something like that and I’m nervous it would take too long if I made a rash decision and just be up shit creek. 

A lot of people that pick up and leave are around my age or younger. I don’t presume they would have money saved up unless they live with parents. Or had family where they were moving. I wish I could do that and maybe I should do the same and just jump and figure out the rest. 

Any thoughts? Advice?",25Oct2020,1

875,"I’m going to throw a content warning for self harm on here, as I feel that might be necessary. ⚠️ 

I’ve been self harming since I was 12, I’m diagnosed with depression, and my parents handle it in such a strange way. They’ve always taken it as more of a punishment rather than a “how can we help?” I work 5-6 days a week, as well as online school 5 days a week. Apparently, this has become a problem, as to them my depressive episodes “have to stop.” My stepmother is diagnosed with depression, but she doesn’t understand that my experiences are nowhere near the same as hers. I started self harming again last year, after two years clean, and as a punishment my parents had disallowed me from going to group therapy, where my only friends were. Of course, this led to me falling out of touch with all of them. Since then, self harm for me has been on and off, and it’s not necessarily bad I feel, it’s just a way I feel I can relieve my issues.

I was out with my stepmother the other day, and I guess she saw my arm, so she yanked my sleeve down, which kinda sucked. I came home to my dad in my room, where they forced me to strip so they could see where I hurt myself, even after I started sobbing and refused. They searched my room and took everything, which is whatever, and then it gets a bit iffy.

I had a therapy appointment last Monday, my first one in months after
my dad had said it was my fault that I didn’t call. Still, whatever. I talked to him, and he specifically told my parents not to make rash decisions about all this, and then they called MY job, told them I was taking a leave of absence due to a family emergency, and now I can’t work. They took my computer, I’m only allowed to have my phone and school laptop every night until 12, and they told me that the last step to getting my license, which is behind the wheel here in Virginia, was not something they were going to take me to until I was “mentally well.” I have completed everything, I have my own car, just need them to do this one thing for me. 

Furthermore, they complained I don’t tell them things, but they know jack shit about me. Firstly, they blame my depression on the abandonment of my mother, as well as my “transgenderism.” I had asked to get tested for ASD, or autism, at one point, and they belittled me for 3 hours about how I just wanted to be special and I needed to stop my incessant bullshit. Then, just yesterday, my stepmom lashed out at me for “doing that stupid flappy hand shaky shit” and said she’d kick me out of the car and force me to walk home. I keep oversleeping for work and class, and I told them it was due to a lack of reasoning to get up in the morning as sometimes I just don’t see the point of living some days, and they said “That’s not a lack of motivation, that’s called fucking being dead to the world.” Fun. On top of this, I hear voices and see things, I always have, but with everything, I feel as though I simply cannot trust them to tell them this.

I want my license, I want to work. My 17th birthday is on the 6th, and they’re making it hard to work with. I’m my own person, and to them I’m just another cog in the high school student boat. They’re never proud of me, they never tell me that they think I’m doing a good job, it’s just bad stuff. I don’t know what to do or where to go.

Let me explain. We both primarily communicate through Playstation, we play games together often. We're both in the USA, about six states away. We met online. We do have some funny moments, but negativity always outweights those moments.

He's pretty annoying and a (VERY) gaslighter. He is 'always' correct and even if I provide a good explanation, he's right. It gets frustrating when we're arguing about stupid shit for the fifth time in an hour.

We have two friends we play with. I stutter quite a bit, which really interferes when we're talking. Anytime I stutter in a conversation they all go *""D D D DD D D D D""* to sound like stuttering, and it feels bad knowing I can't say anything back or else I'll stutter more. I also have an irregular name, so anytime I'm right they'll just say ""Imagine being named ***name***"". It's frustrating sometimes, especially if I have had a bad day.

 If I were to block them, they would have no way of contacting me unless they flew to my town and came to my house (which they won't). The only catch is, they're my only friends. I'm not very social, so making new friends would be hard. I have a couple IRL friends, but we don't play on the same console. 

To sum up, I could keep playing with them, or ditch them and play games by myself, although I'm not sure if I'll be happier. If i'm not happier, I'm not sure if I could forgive myself. This is a tough choice for me, I've known them for about four years. Thank you",25Oct2020,1

881,"I’m currently 17. I’ve had my Permit since I was 15 and got my License back in July because of COVID-19. I didn’t have to take any tests, not even a sign test. My parents opted for this because they have no faith in me,

I took a private driving school that was honestly terrible. They told me when to do everything, yes, even break and stop at stop signs. They only showed us car crash videos to scare us, and the women were rude to my mother (maybe rightfully so?)

Anyways, I failed the first time I tried to get my Permit because I missed a question that I had no idea. I studied hard and was disheartened. But nine days later, I got my Permit and could finally drive legally with a parent.

Now my mother is frantic. She stressed the first time I drove with the Driving School, and they told her that her stress was going to make me stressed and that she needed to cut it out. My mom felt offended. After I got my Permit, my mom refused to drive with me because she felt like she would faint (we were going 10mph in our neighborhood.) Before I got my Permit and was still learning, I accidentally hit a mailbox with the mirror. It didn’t damage anything, and it was because I was trying to avoid a big truck coming. Ever since then, she’s been uncomfortable, but now she refuses to take me driving.

My father works a lot. So we could only drive on weekends and in the afternoon. He’s definitely on edge and tends to grab the wheel, especially when I turn. I never resist, of course. He is calm and collected, though. 

Now, funny enough, I’ve taken 24-hour lessons with a driving instructor, in weeks per 12-hour package. He was confident and noted that I was very defensive in the city we live in, which has TONS of fender benders, and there’s always accidents. It’s hard to drive here, but he’s used to the area and helped with my anxiety a lot.

So nowadays, I don’t drive much. We just moved but didn’t change location, only house. Yesterday I was excited to drive home for about 2 hours. It was mostly highway, which I’m more comfortable doing. Except many people go past 80 on a 60, so because I don’t speed, I was getting people zooming around me. I could care less. I didn’t make any mistakes. But when I was turning, my dad, of course, grabbed the steering wheel. And he told my mom that I was rusty because we hadn’t driven in so long.

Every time we drive, he comments, and it convinces my parents that I’m not ready. (This has been happening since I was 15). I have my car; it’s friendly, safe, and only a year old in the model. I have my license, but I need my parent's blessing. I’m scared when I turn 18 that I’m going to get in a wreck because they diminished my confidence. I can’t rely on Uber because it’s unsafe and sex trafficking and kidnapping aren’t unheard of around here. I’m stuck. How do I even go about this?",25Oct2020,1
882,"This is long. I'm sorry. But for the past 2 years now, my sister's anxiety has come back and is worse than it was before. She's turning 16 soon. She got therapy for social anxiety when she was like 13-14 and then stopped cause it got better. However, since I came back home from college I guess it got worse idk. But she completely changed and I was angry, rightfully so, at the way she treated me regardless of whether she was anxious. She would completely ignore me even during the most neutral or friendly interactions and was SO rude and hurtful towards me, saying things like ""I just don't want to talk to you"" or ""I don't like talking to you"" with no reasons provided. Now that I've moved out, when I come home to visit she says things like ""you don't live here anymore why don't you just go home?"" She was pretty rude to my parents as well but they put up with it, I didn't. Long story short after about 6 months of her bullshit getting worse, I stopped talking to her. It's now been a little over a year that i haven't spoken to her. 

As for my parents, whenever she would say or do these things I would tell them because I wanted them to talk to her cause in my opinion, she shouldn't be allowed to say those things. I know I certainly wouldn't have been. They were so much stricter towards me than they are to her because of her anxiety but they just give in to her and let her treat me like shit. She also does this to our grandmother as well, she just doesn't visit or talk to her no matter how much my grandmother asks about her. For the past two years I've been having countless fights with my parents because they say they get tired of me telling them how to parent. I do this because I don't see ANY action from them. I would suggest things like maybe she should go back to therapy or you should talk to her and tell her what she did/said was wrong. But I only ever heard them blaming me and saying how I handled the situation wrong. Then, after a few days or weeks or whatever, they turn around and say ""you were right, we spoke to her and told her she was wrong"" but I'm always still mad because they only do this after I cut them off cause they want me to talk to them again. 

I don't know why they can't discuss it with me and hear me out in the moment when I'm trying to come to solutions. They always get mad for telling them what my sister has done and say they don't want to hear me rant about her anymore or they don't have time for this. And then they turn around and end up doing what I suggest. I know it kills my mom that me and my sister don't get along, and I've heard my parents say multiple times that she doesn't know what to do about my sister, but I don't think that's reason to shove the problem under the rug whenever I try to bring it up and get mad at me for trying to talk about it. I only go on about it because if I don't, I don't see ANY action from them. 

Now my family is doing what I suggested 2 years ago and sending her back to therapy. But I'm still not happy because they shut me down and dismissed me saying they didn't want to hear it when I suggested it 2 years ago. My mom told me it's cause she wanted to give it time and see if it would go away by itself, but since it's only gotten worse she decided to do therapy now. I told her I think that's unfair to me. Because my sister treated me worse than she treated my parents at first and they didn't seem to care. It's not until she completely shut THEM out and was unacceptably rude to THEM that they decided to finally do SOMETHING about it. But why did I have to put up with her bullshit and defend and fight for myself for all this time? It's drove a permanent wedge between my relationship not only with my sister (which I don't know if that will ever be fixed), but with my parents as well. 

My parents recently showed me their texts with her because they wanted to show me why they decided to send her to therapy, and I do feel bad for them. Her anxiety has obviously been getting progressively worse and I can see in those texts that they are trying so hard to get through to are and are justifiably extremely worried about her. I can't bring myself to feel bad for her because of how she's treated me. I just can't. But I know it hurts my parents to talk about it and it must hurt to hear me partially blame their inaction for the state she is in. And I don't want to make them feel worse and obviously my sister is the priority for them right now, but I still feel like I got the short end of the stick for all these years. I feel like they've dismissed any pain this has caused me and I don't want to start a fight but I want them to know all of this. I want them to know how I feel and just listen and admit they've unfairly dismissed and blamed me and made too many excuses for my sister. No matter how anxious she is or how upset this situation makes them, I don't think I deserved any of this. And to be honest, they're partially right, at a certain point I just wanted consequences for her and justice for myself because I've given up on trying to help or fix the situation since I was repeatedly shut down and dismissed by both my sister and my parents even when I was trying to suggest solutions. 

I don't know what to do. My mom keeps telling me how much me visiting cheers her up but I am still mad at them for this and for not wanting to listen to me. I don't want to make them feel worse especially when my sister is getting worse and they're getting worried, but I can't just pretend I don't feel this way or that I'm not mad. I want to resolve it but I don't know how.",25Oct2020,1
883,"   I just woke up from what I believe was a dream but I'm not sure. It felt way too real for it. I haven't seen the people before. The woman that I met or somehow already knew was a beautiful woman who I was apparently married to. The dream lasted 5 days from how I counted. I ran my company like i planned on doing while I also had 3 kids crawling around my desk. The dream also showed me the math for the stuff I've been struggling with for my business. I don't understand all this, I dont see how the dream can teach me to understand things like that when I haven't seen the people or if i havent seen the equations. I even saw myself as a older version of me at least 5-8 years still in my late twenties but still its noticeable. Now I just long to go back or make it happen for real. I've never felt that much from a dream. What does it mean I'm honestly glad with anything people can tell me im still in shock. Thank you in advance!",25Oct2020,1
884,"Before I(19F) start this, I have been severely screwed over when it came to my last two boyfriends. My first Bf literally picked video games over me all the time and the other one shattered my heart and then a few months later started dating my best friend. This could be one of the reasons I’m so picky right now.

Anyway, lately I have recover from my last heart break which was 8 months ago. I have wanted to get back into the dating scene. I live in a small college town, so the pickings here are kinda slim. I find that anyone I’m Interested in is either taken or doesn’t like me. On the other hand the guys who do approach me aren’t really the best either. I find they are supper nice but not really going anywhere in life, or just want me for sex.

All I want is a nice guy who is going somewhere that is semi attractive. I’m a full time college student that works a full time job, so I want someone who has the same work ethic I do. I find that the work ethic part is hard to find. 

I don’t think that what I want is entirely too picky but yet it seems like it is. Sometimes I feel that I should settle but when I think about that I feel disgusted with my self. I feel that I should be able to be single until I find what I want. A boyfriend isn’t a necessity and I should be happy single then upset because I settled for something I didn’t want. 

I honestly don’t know at this point but, Every single one of my friends are in a relationship right now so I’ve been thinking about it a lot.

Any advice is much appreciated!",25Oct2020,1

886,"This isn't necessarily something that I want to talk to my friends about because I really care about this person, so here I am. I recently started seeing my ex again after about six months of being broken up. We ended things amicably, just needed space to figure ourselves out, and have decided to rekindle the relationship. However, my roommate and I have been having issues ever since this started happening. In the beginning, they were the one who encouraged me to see him again. But now, it’s completely changed. They want me to “do what I want to do”, which is obviously to see this guy who I feel like I could really have a long-lasting relationship with. Yet, every time I go and hang out with him for just a few hours (which recently has been about once every two weeks) they get really quiet, won’t talk to me and are just generally mopey around our place. I always ask what’s wrong and try to be supportive and it seems that they are upset that they don't have any other friends/relationships other than me. The issue is not that they think my ex is a bad guy or anything. I understand that it is hard for them, but I don’t know what to do.

Before you ask, we do spend lots of time together! I do not mention the guy I am seeing around them nor do I share details about the relationship - I keep the topics to things relating to myself and our friendship. I stay off of my phone from texting him when we are hanging out/spending quality time together. I don’t see him very often because clearly, it upsets them, so I am trying to make our hangouts less frequent so that they're not as upset. I feel like I’m doing everything I can to support them and to be respectful of the fact that it is hard for them while also making sure my needs/wants are met, but it doesn’t seem like I am doing enough. I’m trying not to be mad over this, but it is frustrating that every time I have a good time with this guy I come home to them being passive-aggressive and sad. I don’t know if this is even something that I should be mad about, but it does bother me! I’m trying not to be unfair about the situation and I don’t want to be ridiculous, but the behavior is really starting to get to me. I’m not going to stop seeing this guy because it is what I want to do.  Any advice on how to not let this get to me? Or if it’s normal that it’s getting to me? Is it unfair to say that I am not going to stop seeing him?

Flash forward to now, I had trouble holding hands during the date and it really pissed me off. Like I felt hesitant. In my last relationship holding hands was basically a reward.

895,"First of all, let me say that I (F46) believe wholeheartedly in boundaries between friends and family.  I grew up in a boundary-less family in a strict religion and I pretty much had to break away from them in order to have my own life.  In the sect, if someone, for example, saw you at a restaurant that served alcohol or at a rock concert, you could be ""told on"" and everything is everyone's business.  Sometimes, in order to get someone in trouble, people could even spread rumors that are not true.    


I have been friends with Maria (F40) for about 12 years.  I had not had that many worldly friends before. She was really open about things, like sexuality, etc. that I was not accustomed  I didn't realize that I was being overly inquisitive, or rude, and a few times she got really angry with me, yelling at me that I crossed the line.  I felt stupid and terrible and also angry with myself, and also very angry with her for blowing up at me over something I didn't realize was harmful.  

I have been in therapy now for the past 10  years.  I've been working with my therapist about setting boundaries for myself, and also, for respecting other peoples' boundaries.  I have talked to my therapist about my boundary violations; only the first blow up she had at me did my therapist say was crossing a line for most people.    


I am not getting feedback from others about crossing anyone's boundaries.  I asked my therapist, and she says I certainly have not crossed any in our therapeutic relationship. i.e. as long as I have been seeing her, I don't ask her personal questions or pry about her life at all, which she says shows good restraint for a curious person.  

I have good relationships with my husband and our kids (we both have kids from a past marriage).  My kids love him and his kids love me.  My husband and my bio son are both very private.  Their boundaries are like a moat with crocodiles, but it has been many years since either one has been upset with me over boundary crossing.    


Maria keeps getting angry with me about crossing her boundaries, but they always seem to change.  She used to get input about me about her creative projects, and used some of my ideas. I'm not in a creative field, so I was tickled that I had something of value she could use.  I helped her with a master's thesis but serving as a major informant, and in fact, spent two weekends writing a short autobiography she could use as a source.  Yet when I offered her an unsolicited creative idea, she jumped on me and said that I was crossing her boundaries.    


Recently, she was angry with me because when I happened to talk to a colleague of mine who shares a similar academic study, I identified her as being from the suburb she lived in from 3rd to 12th grade, rather than the urban city where she prefers to be considered from.  I had no idea that was that important to her, but she told me that being from the city is an important part of her identity.    


Another time she opened a thread on Facebook about an ongoing political debate, and then went to bed, and didn't answer a question on the thread that people were discussing without her.  I said, she went to bed, she probably won't be back until tomorrow.""  She got upset with me for speaking for her. She keeps referencing other people who have stepped over her identity boundaries over a (white) minority group and that my boundary violations remind her of this, even though I have always referred to her as Basque rather than Spanish.    


About 10 years ago she moved to Europe and so I only see her when she is here visiting her parents but we have talked several times a week on Messenger, mostly.   


Recently her blowups are happening more and more often.  My husband (50) has been sick for the last 2 years, in and out of the hospital and in addition to working (due to covid19) I am caring for him.  He has maybe 5-7 years left and at some point, he will have to go into a care center.  I'm tired with caregiving, and she has sent me many long emails about the times I have violated her boundaries in the past, and how that she is like a pressure cooker and that she can only take it so long until she explodes.    


I feel like right now, I have so much on my plate I cannot actually process my failings in helping her maintain her boundaries.  I really feel awful, but I feel like right now, all I can do is care for myself and my husband and I might not be in any place for growth right now.  I care about her, and it is so upsetting to me when she calls me out that it puts me in a bad place for days.    


I feel like even though she has meant that world to me, I need to just let her go for now.  I have an unanswered email from  her right now explaining why she feels she cannot help but blow up at me, and it has been 3 weeks but I can't even think about answering it.  Frankly, her boundaries remind me of my dad, who could be laughing at us kids' antics one day, and another day, he'd be so ticked he'd be smacking someone over the same thing.

Maybe I think I'll get labeled as a weird or bad person because I act strange, I'm way smarter than I should be at this age, and I'm also very matured for my age. I also have suffered truama from being bullied and I am always willing to fight if I have to, acting like it and not hiding it.

Another thing is I am strangely desensitized to most disturbing things (again because I was bullied)  and I have joked saying ""that if you could see inside my head, you would either puke or run away."".

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, what should I do? who should I talk to? or should I even mention it right now or should I try and wait?

I didn’t have a problem with it before and thought it was normal until I found out all my friends who work in fast food, retail or anywhere else gets paid more than me. It’s a great job, but I realized that I’m in college now and can’t be working minimum wage anymore. Then I found out my friend’s work is hiring, and I would get accepted if I just applied and quit my job. It’s a little far, but the pay is great. I’m just too afraid to switch jobs.

900,"I live in a factory town. I work a very stressful job. This particular company is notorious in my area for being a horrible place to work. It pays well, and you're definitely taking care of once you're higher up, but it's mundane and the lower level employees aren't treated too well and deal with a lot of stress. People calling in because they're pissed off or just need the day to recoup. I've been working there for about 2 and a half years. It's an office furniture factory, and I'm so damn bored of it and I'm so damn stressed out all the time and so is everyone else. Just about anyone there who just isn't straight up stuck because of needing to care for family or because of a financial burden (made a huge mistake getting a car loan that I shouldn't have) wants to leave. Almost everyone that I know there either talks about getting a new job, is looking, are planning, or have tried but end up stuck because of the pay. It's $16 an hour, btw. At least as a level 2 (a lot of workers are even level 1 and could probably leave much more easily).

I want out, and I want out bad. I've called in before just to look for a new job and have looked somewhat before. But I usually say fuck it and tell myself it'll be fine. However with Covid in full effect it's gotten much worse. We currently have about 16 people out for quarantine and it pushes the burden on everyone else. I could write a long essay on how bad it is there, but I will spare the details for a simple question: Would going anywhere else really change anything? Has anyone else been in this situation and left only wishing they should've stayed?

It just feels as if it takes such a tole on my mental health. The original stressor was when I couldn't perform in my specific job well but I know in and out now. A lot of new shit gets added and I occasionally have to deal with that but other than that it's clock in, clock out. 5am - 3pm most days. There are occasions where we finish early when we meet our production goals, but it's been rare with how many absent workers we have.

903,"So I know no one will be able to fully diagnose me, but I’m just wondering if this generally sounds like an eating disorder, and even if it doesn’t how should I go about fixing this before it develops into something worse?

So for context I’m a 17 year old guy, I have pretty bad anxiety, I’m 5’10 130 lbs, I’ve never really had trouble with food before this past year. 

Now for whats been happening. So ever since last year I noticed I can barely eat a full lunch at my school, in fact I only ever finished a full lunch less than 30 times in the year. And it’s not like I would feel full in my stomach, but in my THROAT. I would have this feeling of if i ate anymore but throat would feel full and I would throw up if I tried to eat more so I didn’t force anything.

So that happened all last school year and I didn’t think anything of it, quarantine happens, fast forward to now. 

I usually only get hungry two times a day, once in the morning, and once pretty late at night. At this I’m really concerned because I don’t want to be become deficient in my vitamins and lose any potential growth I have left. But I just CAN’T eat as the full throat feeling is there. I remember what it was like to be full in my stomach and I know that even if you were still full you could keep eating without feeling like you’re gonna throw up. With the full throat its literally if I try and eat before morning or late at night, after a few bites, my throat will get full and I just can’t eat another bit of food.

I’m not sure why this is happening, I don’t know what to do and I just want to be able to eat normally again. How should I go about fixing this whether its an eating disorder or not?",25Oct2020,1

Basically October 2019, last year, I went into the back of another car on my way to work - entirely my fault, a spider lowered from car roof in front of my eyes and landed on my lap and well I freaked out looked down to wipe it away and hit the car infront. 

However, it happened in slow moving traffic at rush hour in the morning where there was lights and a junction. I was only just pulling away when it happened, barely even off the bite... no more than 10mph if that. So we pulled over checked over the cars i had a small crack in my plastic front grill and she had the faintest long mark across the back of her car - it would most definitely T Cut out in less than 5 mins. Her car was battered from all sides. She explained her car is a company vehicle so she had to report it, I too have a company van (which I was driving to collect at the time of the incident) and I personally would never have reported this due to the little amount if damage. That said she did, so I took photos of her vehicle all round to ensure I had some evidence of not only the rear but all in all the state the car was in (showing little care). 

She then obviously claimed on insurance and claimed whiplash - it was a given. Im not a doctor or an expert so I can not say for certain however the incident was at leas than 10mph, my bag on my front seat didn't even budge so there's no way of whiplash in my opinion.

I sent my insurer the photos I had taken, I explained what happened and then back in March/April this year a man came out from my insurer to view my vehicle and its damage. I hadn't had any work done to my car so the crack in the grill remained. 

Following this I have never heard anything since. My renewal came up and my insurer folded so I was unable to renew with tham and went else where, they were a sister company to a large one which still remains and its them who was dealing with the claim. It was hard to fill in the detail on my new insurance as I dont know what the outcome of the claim was and It asks for details and there was no option for 'in progress'. 

Basically, I need help.. has anyone been in this situation before and know how long this should take? Should I contact the insurer regarding the incident and find out what's happening or am I best just leaving it to run its course?? It kind of makes me anxious thinking about what may happen. I just dont know what to do.

She calls again and threatens my apparent beneficiary status for her 401k. So offensive to try and basically bully me with her money. How should I handle this? She lives several states away so I probably will never actually see her again in person.

913,"So as the title says I need some help here. The past two weekends have got me in a slump. The first I was hanging out with a girl i was crushing on and we got to second base then ghosted me after words this past week. Then on Thursday I again got to second base with a hottie ive known for a little while, got to second base. And again now its looking like I am losing ground and might get ghosted. Thought its a slightly different situation. I am 28 and consider myself good looking. But right now I feel like there is something wrong with me",25Oct2020,1
914,"Hi -- made this anonymous post because I don't want it to be linked with my main.

A girl (15F) that I (15M) dated on and off for a while (but off now) got extremely upset at me recently because about a year ago, when we had just started dating, I had said some sexually charged things about her. It was really in the heat of the moment, just joking with some friends. I really regret saying those things and apologized. She struggles with an eating disorder and she told me that what I had said negatively impacted her progress. We spoke almost every night over the summer and I felt like she was the only person at my school that truly understood how I felt. We both developed feelings for each other over the summer and stopped speaking to lose them about two months ago. Last week was when I messaged her and she told me how upset she was over what I had said in the past. She says she feels like she can no longer be my friend.

Since then, she's started dating one of my other friends. I thought he was my friend, but we had a falling out about a year ago and I don't think he considers me his friend anymore. I tried to hangout with him and he told me he doesn't want to.

She is at the epicenter of our friend group and is setting up stuff without me. So it really feels like I've been abandoned by my whole friend group. My school is still online, so I don't know any way to really make friends.

This has all happened in less than a week. I really don't know what to do. Feeling more hopeless than I ever have. Every day feels like a constant struggle to stay alive and wanting to live.

Do you all have any advice as to what I should do?",25Oct2020,1
915,"I just turned 38 last week and I feel like i'm getting nowhere in life and life keeps giving me curve balls. So, for starters, I am a type 2 diabetic and have prolific diabetic retinopathy. Right eye is useless, left eye is ok for now. The eye disease has recently kept me from night driving, so I'm relying on coworkers to get me to and from work. This also means working longer than usual hours every shift. My eyes aren't bad enough to qualify for disability, yet.  


My job sucks. I work second shift at a print shop as a digital press operator/tech/other duties. Don't even make 30K a year unless I work an abundance of overtime. Kind of a bad job to have with failing eyes, I know. My boss is a limp-dick push over who bows to all the women and anyone who he marks as a favorite. Plus, he wants all his employees to be pitchers for the same team, meaning, there is no hierarchy. Someone who walks in off the street is basically at the same level as someone who's been there for 30 years and it's stupid. If there are any personnel issues, he finds the easiest solution then moves on. He refuses to put me on first shift despite the fact I would be able to drive myself back and forth to work. I've been there for 7 years, hardly take any time off and I am ready to move on to something more challenging and fair. However, I don't know what do for work because of my eyes.  


I really need a better job with better healthcare benefits. Here soon, I'll have 3 different specialists to see and they all cost me $70 a visit. I live solo, so my income is the only income. Best money I made was driving a semi years ago, but that's not possible now, either. Just don't know what work I can do that would pay me more than 30K a year with failing eyes.  


Hoping I can get some good advice here. TIA!",25Oct2020,1
916,"A girl(17F) I kind of like and myself are messaging each other. I kind of know she’s probably not interested as she isn’t really asking me anything it’s just me really asking the questions. She’s probably just being nice as I did a few things for her the other week. So here are my ideas of what to do so please offer your opinion on what’s best;
Ask her to play Minecraft, she’s a gamer. 
Give up. 
Carry on carrying the conversation. 
Or try again another day. 


Also what does :d mean in a text? She has used it a few times.",25Oct2020,1
917,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old male who lately has been missing my best friends from 5 years ago. Sorry In advance if this explanation is long, but I’d really appreciate any advice :) so when I was 15, I became best friends with another guy who was the same age as me. Such good friends that when his parents kicked him out I offered for him to stay at my house the entire time. For 2 years we were best friends, did literally everything together. Then one day he just stopped responding to me. About a year later, so around 3 years ago, he messaged me again asking to hanging and so we did. He’s always been one of those people who never gets back to you, hard to get a hold of, etc. He focuses all of his attention to the girl he is dating at the time, so I know he’s dating someone cause I’ll never hear from him. Anyways that’s how our friendship has been, we hangout, have an awesome time, he tells me how I’m the funniest person he knows, then just stops responding, it’s a cycle. I messaged him on Facebook 2 months ago and never got a reply, I want to text him to hangout but also don’t want to seem eager and that I’m messaging him on every social media platform, what should I do?",25Oct2020,1

922,"i am 17 years old and lately i’ve been struggling badly with my moods and i can see how it is affecting myself and how it can ruin my relationships. i’ve always been quite suicidal but now that i have a boyfriend that isn’t something that crosses my mind anymore, although i always think if he were to cheat on me or leave me i would probably do something stupid and harmful, it’s concerning that i could easily just switch and it can be dangerous and i usually do talk about suicide to my boyfriend and how even if i’m happy it’s always an option if something were to happen. i have really bad attachment issues and i’ve always been this way, i’m very clingy and will do anything to keep my boyfriend in my life, i sometimes end up making things up in my head if something seems off and then keep thinking about it until i believe something is going on, which makes him quite annoyed and stressed because i have to reassure myself by looking at who he is talking to and i just need that constant reassurance to make myself feel ok. i have been diagnosed with anxiety and am on anxiety medication which has helped with my anxiety attacks and constant anxiety throughout the day but hasn’t helped some situations which is why i’m concerned something else could be going on. i also gain a lot of jealously and anger out of no where, for example i was hanging out w my bestfriend and boyfriend and he wasn’t giving me as much attnetion as i preferred so i ended up shutting down completely, being very blunt with both of them and feeling so hurt on the inside everything was upsetting me and causing me anger i felt extremely depressed, when my bestfriend left i ended up crying for hours to my boyfriend and my bestfriend tells my other mates that my boyfriend probs wants to break up w me but is too scared to, exept my boyfriend knows me and sees i’m struggling, he has been by my side through so much for a year now, but i’m hurt because people think i’m a horrible person when i’m not. my mood swings are very intense too i feel like i feel a lot more than i should, for example i said to my boyfriend i love you and he sent hearts back then i ended up crying my eyes out, my boyfriend said he couldn’t stay for dinner i ended up shutting down cos my anger was intense then i started crying for an hour making him stay, another example is when my boyfriend said he couldn’t come see me because he was busy so i got so angry that it psychically hurt and i deleted my social media then switched to feeling like i didn’t need anyone but myself, then i downloaded it back to talk to him and was crying for a while, then my anger was the first thing i felt in the morning. i get like explosive anger for the smallest things and it’s really strange and frustrating cos i cant physically control it otherwise it hurts and makes me go insane, although i try my best not to offend anyone whej i explode. and another thing that happens is the way i feel about people switches up so much even my own friends, one day i will just feel anger/jealously toward them and then assume we’re on bad terms and then i feel happy with them again. i also get random anger toward my parents for no reason and just feel some hatred toward them but 10 mins before i felt happy with them. i don’t know it’s just so weird and hard so deal with, what could be wrong ?! it’s ruining everything, i know i am a good person but these emotions are out of my control it’s only gonna end up breaking me. i need advice",25Oct2020,1
923,"ok i’ll get straight to the point. i think i might have this phobia, and it’s completely ruining my life. i NEVER let anyone touch me anymore, not even my own fucking boyfriend because i’m too scared of his touch. this all started when i had a pregnancy scare, and just from there it’s gone down hill. i’m scared to even be in my house after my boyfriend has been in it in fear that there is sperm, i can’t even sit on my couches anymore because he’s sat there himself and i’m scared to sit there because i think that there’s sperm. i can’t stop washing my hands, they BURN. i can’t stop washing them with bleach, water, soap, i can’t stop taking showers. anything he’s touched? immediately disinfected after he leaves. i still can’t touch it either way after it’s been cleaned because i’m TOO SCARED. my parents are getting angry at me because they think i’m scared of corona virus which is why i keep washing my hands and taking 3 hour showers but they don’t know the truth. nobody knows none of this. it’s tearing my life apart, the last day i saw my boyfriend was either thursday or friday and he wanted to do sexual stuff but i really didn’t want to bc of what i’m dealing with. my bf arrives pretty early, last time i was sitting on his lap and he pre cummed SO much just from that. we weren’t even being sexual either, we were in public and just watching the sunset. but anyway, we were in my house and he put his phone on my lap and i pick it up and it feels all gross and grimy, so i ask him why does your phone feel weird and he told me he masturbated the night before and didn’t clean his phone and i just start crying because i start freaking out because it was on my lap very close to my vagina, i didn’t have any new clean clothes to wear, and i just wanted him out of my house from then on. i managed to find a clean pair of pants and change, and so we started driving around town later that day since we got bored, we were sitting in his car and he keeps touching his phone and then touching me all over my legs, thighs, stomach, face etc. i just feel so much in disgust because he never disinfected his phone not even when i asked him to. OR washed his hands,  he knows how paranoid i can get. but, he attempts to finger me and slightly touches my private area and i get very angry and i just ask him to stop so he does, later we go back to my house and i run into my room and take my pants off and change into a clean pair of pants my sister had. but i just wanted to shower so fucking bad, i wanted to just cry. i hide the dirty pair of pants under my bed and i guess later that night my sister finds them and decides to put them on top of my clean clothes... i can’t even wear my clothes now and even if i do clean them i don’t want to fucking wear them. i can’t step on any part of my floor where my boyfriend has sat because i’m scared to change into new clean pants because what if semen is on my foot? and while i’m changing it gets inside the vagina part of my clean pants? i’m honestly in a lot of tears. i haven’t seen my boyfriend in 4/5 days because i’m too scared. it’s tearing my life apart. i can’t stop showering, i can’t stop disinfecting, i can’t eat, i cant sleep, i can’t even use the bathroom anymore. (TMI!!) i hold it in till i crap myself and i just cry. idk what to do. i know semen dies quick but i don’t know how to drill that into my head, i’m crying now because i’m super hungry but i don’t even wanna touch my dishes or the food because i’m scared to. please help.",25Oct2020,1
924,"(Sorry for any spell or grammar mistakes English is not my firts language, also I'm writting from my mobile) 

I've been a teacher for few years and always did good in the evaluations, eventually the school gave the type of contract that all teachers want to get when they start working, they call it something like ""full time position"" and they give you full salary in vacations, and other benefits.

The thing is, I am very tired of this job lately, since last year my bosses have been tossing me projects and projects (plus the regular teacher work I have to do) and it doesn't seem to stop. COVID is not helping to the work environment, and I am starting to look for other options.

Am thinking about opening my own business, but seems that is not the ""right time"" and I could use the money from my salary to save more (although I have enough to start); but in the other way I can't stand one more period of online classes and weird protocols from my admins.

My family seems to support me but I feel they are biased, so I would like to have more clarity from someone who had a same experience as me.

925,"Earlier today my ex con cousin (armed robbery) who is staying next door in the home of our recently deceased aunt and who has been zero problem until today admitted that he's selling drugs said to me ""If I didn't think you would call the police on me I would kill this dog (his dog) and throw his dead body on your porch"". I bought his poor neglected dog a doghouse and he said I care more about animals than I do people. I never fed him or his when they were hungry (I was in NY and knew nothing about his issues other than prison). This cousin vented about many things including my mother with dementia whom I moved out here in the country to care for, my sister (who is an angel), ex wife, my girlfriend from way back in 1992 and quite a few other things. He looked high. Later in the afternoon he and another man were shooting dozens of shots from what sounded like a semiautomatic into the woods behind his house. Not at his dog.
