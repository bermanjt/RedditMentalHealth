0,"I don't understand why I'm feeling like this because I'm told I have a great worth ethic.

I'm constantly worried about getting in trouble or being fired. I think about work a majoirty of the time when I'm finished. I go through the day and hope I didn't do something wrong. I would think it was a good day but ""oh, I did this one thing that may have been and I'm going to be written up about it or fired."" Is what usually goes through my head.

I get so fixated on it and I don't know how to stop.

3," My F18 mom F41 has been abusive to me physically and emotionally growing up, I also have an incredibly narcissistic younger brother M14 who I basically never seen eye to eye with.

When I was in kindergarten and first grade I suffered badly in school. I had Dyslexia and also had undiagnosed ADHD but my mom and step-dad wasn't aware of it at the time, so I was basically being punished constantly over things I necessarily had no control over and to make matters worse I was being teased by my teachers because I learned at a slower pace and would often be called “Dodo” which is just another word for stupid; I was already developing self esteem issues at 5 years old. Almost everyday I came home from school I was hit with belts and extension cords and yelled at till my ears popped because I was behind academically, these experiences have taken a toll on me psychologically to the point where I suffer from extreme social anxiety, low self worth and major depression; me and my mom still has a strained relationship, I don't trust her and honestly have no reason to. My younger brother is probably the biggest attention seeking narcissist I know, he believes that the world revolves around him and has had this attitude since toddler stage, he is extremely deceitful and a professional liar, and lacks sympathy for others, I remember getting an oculus go as a late Christmas present from my Aunt and this asswipe threw an entire fit over it despite him having a PlayStation from my mom, he wants everything he see's me with and gets angry with the spotlight isn't on him, I want to move out but don't have enough money to do so; I'm extremely depressed and feel trapped in a extremely deep hole I can never be released from.",27Jul2020,1
4,"I've been just thinking about her for 2 days straight. We met a while ago and we have a nice friendship, I honestly liked her from the start but as I got to know her the more I liked her and I don't wanna use the word love cuz it's such strong word and I'm terrified of being in love. And i don't wanna ruin our friendship and I just don't know what to do i don't wanna tell her but we also tell each other everything. 

I can't explain it my brain is really weird i feel guilty not telling her but also ill probably regret telling her, and we live really far away from each other so I think i should tell her in person. I'm sorry I'm just so confused I've never had this feeling before and she's unlike anyone I've ever met.

I don't think anyone is gonna read the whole thing but if you plz help, literally every single piece of advice helps",27Jul2020,1
5,"Between my siblings and I, the last person I expected to get bullied was my sister. She's a fun-loving extrovert and I hate to see her so solemn not only because of limited contact with friends due to quarantine but also due to her being bullied by her old (similarly aged) ""friends"" from elementary/middle school. We only found out about this a few days ago, but apparently this has been going on for at least a year, possibly more.

These little shits blew up her phone with calls and texts at all hours of the night until she changed her number. Then they started bothering her on snapchat and instagram, making new accounts when she blocks them. 

Until recently, they were calling our home phone a lot and saying not nice things to her. What they were saying to her I cannot say, because she didn't tell my parents most of what they said, but I do know that it isn't good. She told my parents she feels worthless and ugly, so I assume they are saying these things to her.

A group of them apparently used to show up in front of our house near midnight and loudly discuss her and ways to mess with her, loud enough that she can hear because she keeps her window open. She would have to come to the front door to tell them to go away. If a group of adults did this, I believe this would be considered a form of stalking and/or harrassment.

This, to my knowledge, has mostly stopped for the time being because my mom talked to the mom of who she assumed to be the ringleader, a girl my sister used to carpool with, after my sister told my parents what was going on. We have yet to talk to the other parents of these kids, mostly at my sister's request. I know that the parents have to know about what their kids are doing to my sister, and if they would listen to a 21 year old I would march over there and give them all a piece of my mind. Unfortunately, this might have to be handled parent to parent.

I want to support my sister and I want this bullying to stop, but I barely know where to start. My sister is experiencing so much distress and quarantine is hard enough. How can I help?",27Jul2020,1

I’ve (15m) been talking to her (15f) a while and she finally opened up about herself and she told me what she’s struggling with. My brother had a past experience like her, and he got through it and I told her about that, and that she needs to not give up. I told her to find things that make her happy, and I’m just trying to help.

It’s not me, so I can’t find a psychologist or something. It’s her family that’s the main problem, and she can’t really do anything about it because she’s not old enough to live on her own. 

She told me she wants to commit but she also thinks that’s the selfish thing to do. I told her that she has a lot of people that care about her, and that wouldn’t help.",27Jul2020,1
8,"I've been spared the worst of the pandemic so far bc I'm a healthcare worker.  However, I had to leave for medical reasons.  I've been completely isolated now for a week, with two more months to go.

I realize now that work has been the only thing keeping me sane.  There's very little I like doing just to do it.  I thought I liked cooking, but I only like cooking for other people.  The TV shows I liked, I only enjoyed watching together.  I miss having people to take care of.  

I don't just miss it, I feel empty and bored.  I'm open to ideas but really, I've tried to think of something exciting that I can do alone and so far haven't come up with anything.

I can only hike and exercise so many hours a day.  Once I'm done with that, I'm in this weird state of pain inside until it's bed time.  What the heck, this is weird :/",27Jul2020,1

My girlfriend is a rape survivor, and her family is the worst group of people I have ever have the displeasure of hearing about. They tell her shit like it's her fault that she got raped and that it’ll happen again if she doesn’t stop “acting like a victim,” among other things. Because of these people, she has 0 self-esteem, and it’s just so terrible to see. 

She’s been my best friend since the start of the school year. We started dating in February, and I love her. She’s kind, caring, sweet, and she truly loves me too, it’s fantastic. I want to be with her always and was for a month, but then COVID hit, and it’s been hard. We used to sleep in each other's dorms every cuddled up with each other, but then COVID hit, and now we’ve only seen each other in person one time for four days in the past five months. I’m visiting next week, and we text and FaceTime every day, but it’s been tough. 

My mom doesn’t like my girlfriend. She came to visit one time, and my mom thinks she’s ugly and doesn't like how she’s not a social butterfly and doesn’t understand why I like her, but she likes that she makes me happy. Fine, I can live with that. But then after she left, my mom told me that nobody else in my family thinks she pretty either. This kind of broke my heart a little bit, but again, I don’t care. My mom was also mad we had sex without condoms, which I get. She’s on birth control for her periods anyway, and I pull out, so I didn’t figure it was the biggest deal. We also agreed to abort any baby if anything goes wrong and have had a long talk about that. 

Room registration for next year started, and we choose dorms next to each other. We used to live a building away, but we basically lived together before anyway, so I figured it wouldn’t matter that much. My mom was adamantly against this. “She’s just a girlfriend. They’ll be others.” This is her go-to line, and it pisses me off. I’ve had one other interest before but nothing even close to this girl. This girl is so so so much better. There won’t be another one I’m sure of it. Eventually, we got the rooms, and so that’ll start in September. I figured this would also be a good test run too. If we can’t handle living next to each other for a few months, then maybe we shouldn’t be together. Simple. 

Today my mom wakes into my room and asks me if I had any plans for junior year housing. I said no. My mom responded, “you probably want to live with (girl), don’t you? Bad idea. Don’t do it. Make some friends, get an apartment with them. You’re too young to be in a serious fucking relationship, that’s not what college is about. If you want to live with her, forget it now.” 

I sat down with her and told her that I don’t understand why she doesn’t care about this girl at all or why she refuses to realize that I like her and want to be with her forever. She always says, “they’ll be more,” and I hate it. 

I asked her, angrily, if she wants me to dip into every girl in the school and her honest to god said: “yes, wear a condom though.” Like what the actual fuck does she want. Does she want me to date every girl in the fucking school? I’m not “too young,” and what does that even mean. I want to be with this girl, and I don’t understand why she hates her so much. Just because my mom married and then divorced her high school partner (my dad) doesn’t mean I’m going to regret mine too.

I know she just wants to protect me, but I think she’s irrational and doesn't care about my opinion at all.

If anybody has advice please let me hear it. Thanks.",27Jul2020,1
10,"Hello all,

I graduated from university in November 2019 and have spent the last 7 months looking for work. I am currently enrolled in the CSC and CPH (license courses for financial services). 

I managed to land a job at a Canadian bank 2 weeks ago, but due to being at a moderate risk of COVID, and the work being defined as an essential service, I had to step down as a recommendation from my doctor, as I was unable to work from home with the role. However, my supervisor told me to finish the license courses, and contact him once I'm done to see if the position is still available and if there is a therapeutic/vaccine by then. The job isn't guaranteed by any measure, but he did tell me to get in touch with him later down the line as there was mutual interest.

If I am unable to continue at the job I had (i.e. its been filled), do you have any recommendations? I feel I should have completed the course before I started and made it clear I would need to work from home at the start. My uncle told me that I am making a huge/stupid mistake, and because he deems the courses as ""easy"", I should have no problem finishing them within weeks, then going back to work. However,  I  feel long-term it's not in my best health interests. The course's are usually done while working , but I did not major in commerce and find the work somewhat challenging, as both courses have over 1000 pages of content I have never seen before.

I care about my uncle's opinion, but he seemed really blunt on it and has a ""my way or the highway"" approach. His work is not deemed essential, yet he still goes into the office.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks",27Jul2020,1
11,"So at the moment I (21m) work at a carwash In the Midwest, I've been working there for close to 5 years. We are currently going through some changes, my manager has been at the wash for 3 months longer than me, they are moving him up to full time maintenance for our multiple locations and wanting to make me an assistant to a new hire manager.at the same time this has been in the works I've been feeling underappreciated and my friend came to me with an opportunity for an apprenticeship at a local electrical company. I had the interview the other day and will be receiving a call about whether I get the job or not tomorrow but I'm going to be delaying my decision until later in the week. The electrical company would start me at my current pay and pay for my education to become a journeyman over four years. They have full benefits and the works, and at the wash they offer a retirement plan at the moment but will be implementing alot more very soon. After word got out that I had an interview and that it went well and I'm looking to leave the owner seems to realized that I've been underappreciated and is trying to convince me to stay with an increase in pay, an immediate move to assistant manager and pay raise that would be more than the electrical company. The wash claims to have plans for me to be a manager of a location within a year or two and then a possibility for a computer systems manager which with all of this could be the 70-90k range of pay. I'm looking for outside opinions as to which path I should take, I feel emotionally attached to the wash as it's been the first and almost only job I've had and they're making considerable offers but it also seems the electrical company might be a better path.

And start a brand website\amazon FBA business or shopify and invest some in a stock portfolio... BTW I already have a good enough amount of knowledge about both ecommerce n the stock market and I can say the least from what I've learned over the years from online research I would be a 100% responsible with a credit card.

13," So r/AmItheAsshole didn't want this post so I thought that this might be the second-best place to put this,

So a couple of days ago, a friend of mine decided to post on their story ""Send a heart emoji if you would stop me from killing myself"". Out of concern, I sent one and asked if they were doing alright (note: this friend has had struggles with mental health before). They then said that they were fine and explained that they were doing one of those ""challenges"" where you send them a photo of yourself to prove that you would have their back and then continue the cycle where you do the same thing.

I then tried to tell them that doing this sort of shit is risky and could add to normalize stuff like this to the point where people wouldn't take similar posts that people are using as their last chance at life seriously. (An example of the risk I was talking about could be that this sort of thing goes around in a school community and some kid posts a similar thing as their last attempt at life but it becomes overlooked because people think they're doing it to be ""trendy"" or some shit). They then got pissed and told me that they were ""sick of my bullshit"" and decided to unadd me. 

I can't tell if I'm at fault. I care about this person but they have done similar things where they have ""blown up"" over things and made themselves seem like they're the victim in situations when they were either completely or partially at fault. This person is leaving town soon and I'm wondering if I should try to fix things or if I should let them go.",27Jul2020,1

15,"I mean the title says it all, and i want to preface this whole thing with saying this isnt about pity i fully accept that its my choices that have led me here.

I have never really had friends minus a few online that i play video games with, but as a kid i had none not until i was about 13 when i was able to play World of Warcraft (online video game) and made some friends on there. Idk why i was able to make friends online but not in person. As a kid school was torture and thats when i first really started thinking about suicide, if i didnt have the friends that i did online i would have killed myself, but knowing that i could come home and play WoW with them kept me going at that point, along with the advice that ""just wait till school is over, everything changes then"". I never excelled at school, C average probably like a B was really good for me. Threw most of school besides the bullying i did everything i could to just avoid contact with anyone my age then go home and play WoW.

Then my working career started, 2 years at Walmart... yee ha, yeah that was torture, I eventually quit walmart and moved to another province(in Canada) did general labor eventually where i was living fell through so i moved home. Then i moved around a few more times, moved home a few more times. I have been out of my mom's for like 3 years now pretty sure there will no be another move home lol(pretty sure). I never had career plans of any kind idk why but i have never been interested in anything... not as far as a career is concerned, people have asked me ""you like video games why dont you do something with them?"" the truth is i have no interest in making them, i like playing them, dont want to make them couldnt tell you why. If i sound lazy well the simple awnser is a just am, i work for minimum wage still as little as possible to pay my bills and allow me to skate by. I live with a roommate I am 28 he is 43 so we dont spend much time together due to lack of similar interests, we will watch a movie together once in a while thats about it.

Since i never went to college or anything pretty much the only good thing i have going for me is i have no debt and a few grand at least in the bank, which is a pittance but at least i know i can lose my job and have a few months bills.

I think something i have just developed over my whole life and as a kid the way i hated school and felt safe and happy playing video games I just feel very uncomfortable outside of my home. I go to work and i suffer through it but i really hate it, even though i do enjoy a solo bike ride and stuff like that there is something in my room where i just feel safe and idk hot to explain it, almost as if when i am in my room my batteries are charging, as soon as i leave it they are been expended. So as a result of that i mean i still obviously have no friends or at least local friends lol, even though my online ones have been getting fewer as they all grow up and dont have the time for video games i still do lol.

So idk to wrap things up I am just disgusted with myself but i have no confidence at all that i can change anything about myself, honestly i have the opposite i have a certainty that i will fail whatever i attempt, and i know the first thing anyone will say is ""well of course thats the first thing you have to change"" but i mean 28 years idk how to do that.",27Jul2020,1
17,"Our mother used to be very attentive when we were little, almost to the extent of a tiger mom. But after my father went to prison, she had to work crazy long hours to support our family. As a result, my siblings and I became very self sufficient due to the fact that we rarely saw our parents (We live with our grandparents too so we weren’t completely alone).

Due to Covid, our Mom decided to stay with her boyfriend instead of quarantine with us. This didn’t come as much of a surprise though, since for many years our mother had not been regularly staying home with us, and instead would stay at her friend’s apartments. Her reason being that she was not on speaking terms with our grandparents. I also think she has suffered abuse from my father in the house we live in. She even threw out all of the furniture in her own room because it reminded her of him. I think this may be why she's so adamant on not living in our home.

In about a month, we will all be moving into a new house with her boyfriend. As the date approaches, things have become tense. This move has been hitting two of my siblings especially hard. One of them will be a junior in high school, which makes me concerned since I view the last two years of high school as pivotal not only academically but socially. She is a great student and the last thing I would want for her is to have to navigate an entirely new area/school system and find new friends all during a pandemic. I feel like my mother doesn't always have my sister's academic interests at heart. A couple weeks ago, my sister asked my mother if she had taken her out of her old school yet. She wanted to know about AP class registration for her new school. However, our mother had not even thought about having to register her. Instead, she started getting angry at my sister for not reminding her sooner (?).

Anyways, my siblings have been nervous, angry, and even depressed about the move. However, whenever my siblings show these ‘negative’ emotions to my mother, she plays the victim. She will cry and repeat her past trauma to make us feel bad. She says she cannot live in our house because of the way our grandparents treat her. She also says she just doing what’s best for us, since we would finally be a family living under the same roof again. She’s also said on multiple occasions that she feels hurt because she thinks we don’t need her as a mother anymore, since we’ve lived without her for so long.

My siblings aren’t asking her not to move, they just want her to understand them. They need comfort and reassurance, but all she does is make them feel like their problems aren’t as important as hers. I don't know how to get through to my mom. There's a growing tension between my siblings and her, and I don't want there to be long lasting resentment. I know moving is something pretty much everyone goes through, but things are really difficult nevertheless. Any advice?

TLDR: In the last 1.5 years, our parents divorced, she started seeing someone new, and she's now moving us to an entirely new place. It seems like things are happening fast and hitting us hard. I’ve always been very understanding of my mother. I know she’s been through so much and has sacrificed a lot to support our family. But lately, I’ve been feeling guilty because I’m starting to become angry with her for the way she’s handling things. I feel like there is a division forming between my mother and siblings. I don't want my siblings to resent my mother in the future. What should I do?",27Jul2020,1
18,"For some context, I met these friends through one of my fathers coworkers/best friend. For the sake of this story, I will refer to my dads coworker/best friend as Joe. My father and Joe go back some 25 years. Their friendship was one of those kinds where I’d always refer to Joe as Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe had 2 daughters; one was slightly older than me (like 2 years) and the other was only 1 year younger than me. As toddlers/kindergarteners, Uncle Joe would come over with his kids and we’d throw small pool parties. We had even started taking trips to places like Disney World with both of our families and it was honestly so much fun from what I remember. Well, as we got older, it became apparent that Uncle Joe wasn’t exactly the most responsible parent and neither was the mother of these 2 children. They had gone to live with Uncle Joe’s mother while Uncle Joe cleaned up his act, but he never did, so Uncle Joe’s mom basically assumes full custody of both children. My father was aware of his habits but gave Uncle Joe the benefit of the doubt because of their lengthy history together. The last I spoke with these two girls I was probably 8-9 so I never really had a way to stay in touch with them. A couple of years later, I was 13 and had been added on Facebook by one his daughters. I accept the add but never really talk to her. Fast forward to my freshman year in high school and Uncle Joe is found in the men’s bathroom of my fathers office, hunched over with a needle kit by his side. Ambulances had to come and revive him, causing way too much of a scene at his office for my father to ignore, so he had no other choice but to fire him on the spot. From there, my father decided it was best that he cut all ties with him completely. By this time, his kids had been able to see him on a somewhat regular basis from my understanding. The mother had moved to a different city many hundreds of miles away for reasons unbeknownst to me. I was still friends with Uncle Joe on Facebook though, so whenever it crossed my mind, I’d search him up and see how he was doing. Turns out he found a new wife, married, and also had a baby together. It seemed like he was doing okay for the longest time up until 2 months ago. Now I am 19 years old and both of his kids are also young adults. So now it’s May 2020 and I wake up one morning to hear the saddest news I’ve heard in a while. Uncle Joe is dead from a heroin overdose.  Even though I wasn’t close to him in the slightest when he passed, I still felt awful about the whole situation all things considered. My father took this news pretty hard as well, blaming his mother and brother for enabling him, burning every bridge we’ve ever had with that family to the ground all over Facebook messenger.
If it were me, I would’ve just settled with prayers and condolences but I could understand my fathers anger and frustration being that his very close friend had just died. Regardless, I was tasked with getting into contact with both of his daughters whom I had originally been childhood friends with because my father is actually The Godfather to Uncle Joe’s 2nd oldest daughter (the one who added me on Facebook when I was 13) . Eventually, I found out that both daughters had new Facebook pages, but I didn’t expect a timely reply considering most teenagers never use Facebook. Worth a shot though, right? So I sent both girls messages basically saying “Hey, I’m sorry to hear about your dad. I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now, please feel free to text me if you guys want to talk”.  Again, I figured texting them over Facebook was a long shot; I’d have a much easier time if I found them on Instagram or Snapchat. Well, I did end up finding them after sifting through many profiles (don’t judge, I was determined). The problem I face now is, what do I say to them? It’s been 10 years or more since I’ve even spoken to them. I don’t want to start out the conversation with something along the lines of “Hey, I don’t know if you got my Facebook message, but I’m sorry for your loss” opening up old wounds and such. I just feel like it would be super weird if just appeared in their DMs out of the blue after this much time apart. Is this friendship worth saving?",27Jul2020,1
19,"I’m an introvert who admittedly has always struggled to make friends throughout my adult life. I still have a wonderful group of friends from college who I meet up with yearly and with whom I can always rely on, but I’ve moved several times since college and never seem to be able to form lasting adult friendships since then. 

Two years ago, I moved across the country to a new state and by sheer luck, I was befriended by an extrovert who brought me and my husband into her friend group. For the first time in my adult life, we had friends. We went out regularly, we even took several couples weekends away together. The entire time I was cognizant of how lucky I felt to finally have the one missing piece in my life in place, and it all happened so naturally and so easily thanks to this extroverted friend who brought me in. 

After one such couples trip away, the friend who originally brought me into the group suddenly started distancing herself from me/changed her behavior toward me almost overnight. In my attempts to not be neurotic, I made up excuses like maybe it was due to her third pregnancy or maybe she was going through something at home, etc. However, she seemed to be fine with the rest of the friend group. Over time, this made me feel more and more insecure when our group would get together, and eventually, I noticed the rest of the group seemed to be distancing themselves from me as well. 

I’m at a loss for what I may have done, and I’m now just feeling like a fucking loser unworthy of other’s friendships. I have been fortunate not to have experienced all that much rejection in my life, and I’m surprised by how much this stings. I’m in my mid 30s and embarrassed to say I actually cried today when I saw some stupid Instagram story of my previous friend group all hanging out and with no invite. This just one amongst many examples and they’ve pretty much made it clear I’m out of the group. 

I’ve never actually been axed from a friend group like this and I just feel like a loser. It appears my husband was axed out just like I was. His reaction is more a shrug and a “yeah it’s weird but who cares”. Unfortunately, it hurts me to my core and I’m left feeling wildly insecure and unworthy.

I cant go to her house either since she lives across the country from me, What do i do?",27Jul2020,1
22,I’m currently having anxiety attacks every night. After highschool I was an extreme introvert due to having a lisp. That caused me to pick a weird career path as a painting business owner thinking I’d work alone and wouldn’t have to speak much. Started the business recently and things are going good. Also fixed my lisp. things have been good but I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I just feel like this job is unhealthy in many ways. I just want a reliable 9-5. To do this I will have to go back to school and live with my parents till I’m 26-28 (currently 22 and 6 months). And I feel like a complete looser. I could have wasted my youth having fun and creating memories. but all I did was bust my buns to start a business I don’t like...and now I will have to struggle for three more years going through school to have a average 50k a year job. I don’t mind that pay but I feel like I missed out on having that crazy lifestyle in my 20s and all I will do from now on till I die is work work work....,27Jul2020,1
23,"I am dealing with a relationship-breakup now, but I still love him and I keep having mental breakdowns. It's the fact that if I do go insane, that would probably ruin him. I don't ever want to hurt him like that and I don't want him to blame himself either so I'm trying my best to hold myself together. We're taking a break to find ourselves and for him to find his happiness. I'm not doing so well.

I promised him I would make friends, whether it's on the internet or in real life. I also promised him I would take care of myself, that is what I'm struggling with. I feel all I do is have mental breakdowns; I cry a whole lot because I miss him (best friend/ex SO). I cry because I don't have friends, and that's why I need some. I feel when I try making friends, no one cares to converse with me. That makes me feel bad, rejected, etc.

My father is short-tempered. I lifted six gallons of water yesterday, and when I had set them down, my hand slipped and I dropped them. My father got angry and screamed at me. I felt so humiliated and terrible because of this mistake.

Today, I wanted to try something new, graphic design. I spent the day, drawing on the computer and on paper. Art is not what I do and I'm not an artist, but I get proud of the things I make. I showed all the things I made to my mother, and she just made me feel I wasted my time and helpless. It's just that feeling of rejection, making me feel bad. I kept thinking, if I could show him (my best friend/ex SO) he would be encouraging about it. He might say what I could've done differently but he wouldn't make me feel bad.

Maybe I am easy to put down. These things have their moments of making me feel as if I am not good enough. Nothing appears to make me feel happy. Anytime I felt this way, when we were together, I had him to go to. He was so comforting. We would talk through it until I didn't feel that way anymore, I felt good instead. I wasn't having breakdowns like I am now. Now, it feels like I cry over everything. Nothing appears fun to me anymore. I can't listen to music, ride my skateboard, or watch tv shows without crying. I used to take pictures a lot. I always got excited to show him, and now I just don't take pictures anymore.

**TL;DR** If anything, I feel like I am losing myself day by day. Is there anything I can do? How can I not feel so easily rejected? Why do I feel like everything I do is wrong? Why can't I find anything interesting or as fun as I thought they were? How do I get out of this rut?",27Jul2020,1

26,"This isn’t half as deep as most of the posts on this sub. You could even call this trivial.  So I’m starting at a new highschool next year. Obviously I’m not 100% sure it’s going to be in person, and if it is, it’s a hippie charter school. I’m kind of a slacker and honestly last year when I towed my backpack around campus to seven classes a day I regretted bringing it at all as I hardly used anything in it. This brings us to my dilemma. 

I have an obsession with purses, beyond the normal level for any sixteen year old girl. If there’s a purse to be seen I’m focused on it like a goddamn sniper. Because of this, I’ve gotten really good and finding deeply discounted designer bags. My most recent accomplishment was purchasing a $30 micheal kors tote which was shockingly not a knockoff. I love it. I like designer things because they’re iconic. A status symbol, you know? Even though I’m not rich, just really good at bargain hunting lol. So is it super trashy to bring this thing to school? I want an honest answer. I’m not a spoiled brat, and I don’t want anyone to think I am, I just really like purses.

TLDR: I’m really into purses and scored a cheap micheal kors handbag but I’m worried people will think I’m a bitch for taking it to school instead of a backpack",27Jul2020,1
28,"So basically we had a final coming up and I asked this guy “Alex” if he wanted to study together. I had never actually spoken to him before, but on the last day of class I sat next to him. At the end of class, I asked if he’d study with me.

I thought he was cute and I thought this was a good chance to talk to him. We’d study for the final, while we’d also chat and get to know each other, as everyone does when they study. And maybe some time afterward I would ask if he wants to hang out some time.

I was with another female friend in class when I asked Alex and I think it was implied the three of us were going to study as a group.

That class was kind of late at night and a lot of people used to go to Starbucks to study. Alex said he planned on going there after class but he had to talk to the professor first and it might take a while since there was already a line of people for the prof.

So my friend and I were walking to Starbucks to study, where Alex would join us later. On the way, my friend said “how about I go home so it’s just you and him?” I had actually told her my real intentions beforehand. I liked that idea. My other friend was way prettier and way less awkward than I am and I almost felt like she would steal the show. My self-esteem has really grown since then, but that’s how I used to think of myself.

When Alex got to Starbucks, he was surprised to see that only I was sitting there waiting for him. He asked “where’s that other girl?” I said she got tired since it’s late and she went home.

We chatted while we opened our laptops and took out our notes. We talked about what kind of nurse do you want to be (this was nursing school by the way), do you want to stay in-state or out-of-state, where are you staying, and that kind of stuff. Then, he asked a really blunt question.

“Also, can I ask something. If you’re being completely honest, are you doing this for some reason other than actually wanting to study?”

I said “no” and we went on. We studied maybe an hour and then went our separate ways.

He asked me that question with a look on his face that made it feel like he wouldn’t appreciate my real intentions. It also would have felt so awkward to say “well it’s both to study and to get to know you since I think you’re pretty cute” ... the truth was too awkward so I lied.

I’m still not sure if he was uncomfortable, or if he just wanted to know. I didn’t realize anyone would feel uncomfortable about it though. The one time something remotely similar happened to me, I actually really loved it. Junior/senior years of high school, an underclassman who had a crush on me used to come to all my soccer games and he’d always tell me what a great job I did afterward. I didn’t like him back but I actually thought this was really sweet. Not everyone appreciates things like that though, I guess.

So I’ve just felt really bad about the day with Alex ever since. When he asked me that question, and when I lied, I felt like I was violating him.

Thankfully, that happened in senior year of college, so I didn’t have to see him much in clinicals. The college I went to had a big nursing program, and you don’t have to interact with everyone. I ran into him twice after that day and we didn’t really say anything to each other. He just did those weirdly awkward half smirks boys do sometimes.

I had a dream about this just a few days ago and now I feel bad again.

This Alex thing aside, the past few weeks have just been really miserable for me in the ER and I’m thinking about leaving nursing altogether. I might have to go back to school and get another job in something else. Remembering this incident with Alex just added fuel to the “I’m really sad and a lot of going on” fire.

Do you have any advice on forgetting something that happened two years ago?",27Jul2020,1
29,"Hi everyone. First off, thank you for taking the time to read this. I dont know what I should do. I’m not comfortable talking about this with people in my life so I thought I would try here.

I (26 F) struggle with intimacy is any form. I dont want to hug, cuddle, kiss or have sex unless its all on my terms....which isnt often. I often feel angry when my boyfriend (28 M) tries to be affectionate towards me. I feel terrible because hes well aware that im not interested without me even telling him. 

Sex is something that I have always had an issue with. I suffer from a chronic pain condition which makes sex painful for me. I was allegedly sexually abused when I was child but I have no memory of it. I have no sex drive. Its extremely rare that I have even the slightest urge to engage sexually with either myself or my boyfriend. 

I also have this desire to be alone most of the time. Im an introvert, but I need alone time from everyone. I cant spend too much time with my friends or family without getting irritated and just wanting to be by myself.  

I hate that i’m like this. I love my boyfriend, and he really loves me, but i’m afraid that i’m going to ruin our relationship because I dont want to be physical. 

Thank you for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",27Jul2020,1

32,"Hello everyone! So I got into an argument with my mom on Friday because she was upset of how much time I would spend playing video games. I would usually play around 2-4 hours a day but with Ghost of Tsushima's release, I've been playing up to 6-8 hours. She said that once we come back from vacation, she'll restrict how much time I play video games and maybe I won't be able to play them at all one day or maybe even the day after.

I'm pretty athletic, not too athletic, I've been playing an instrument for 8 years, I'm doing very well in school, and I recently finished a course about music production and it motivated me to begin diving more into that. If anyone has any tips on how to start with music production, that helps! But video games make me super angry for some reason. If I can't get something right, I'm angry and even when everything goes well, I'm still angry even though everything went well!

My point is, I need help on how to be a better person. Now that I'm on vacation, I realize that I'm very happy and I'm great with my family. I'm on good terms with my mom now but I need help on how to stop being addicted to video games and how to not be angry. Thank you in advance!",27Jul2020,1
33,"I've never used Reddit before so i'm really sorry if i'm doing anything wrong, and if this isn't allowed please let me know and ill delete it. Also sorry if this gets kinda long. (writing this at almost 2am cause I cant sleep please bare with me)

From what I can remember for my whole life my mum has done everything she can to make me miserable, she was physically and mentally abusive to me, for example degrading me for absolutely nothing, accusing me of stealing/or just doing something im not meant to, throwing heavy things at me when she was mad and trash talking me to everyone we knew.

It wasnt too bad until my dad attempted to get back into my life when I was around 11-ish, it ended up going really bad, my dad said some pretty bad stuff about me and my mum, ended up in a failed suicide attempt, after this it just felt like I was hated, I never had proper meals, clean clothes and the treatment mentioned above got worse. I should also mention that she was an escort, she'd have people over whilst I was home and i'd have no choice but to just listen as I didnt really have a way to distract myself, I wasnt allowed to go out or have people over incase she got a call and I'd get home while she was busy, so for quite a long time I was just kind of isolated. My family and family friends thought I was a jerk cause of things she'd told them.

In 2017, when I was around 15, everything came out, ill spare the details as its a long story, but everyone has dropped my mum and I'm now living with my grandma. I love my grandma so much, her and my aunt have tried so hard to make my life enjoyable/normal but im so tired, for the past 3 years ive been having nightmares almost every night, thinking about it at least once a day and I feel so drained. I really don't want to be ungrateful for what they've done for me but I really just cant take it anymore. I have 2 friends, one who is leaving for a University on the other side of the country and one more who is married which means I cant really see her a lot as she has a life and my boyfriend who lives in another part of the country. I feel so lonely, ever since the pandemic I wasnt even able to do college work as they just gave us our predicted grades instead, so every day for the past few months now has just been me sitting alone in my room either looking for work, having these horrible waves or just pain that I cant even describe or playing games.

I do see a counsellor and have talked to her about some issues but I just dont feel better at all, shes brought up PTSD and the possibility of me taking antidepressants but ive only heard bad things and im not sure what to do about that yet. I've also spoke to my boyfriend and he truly believes that the only way i'll ever get better is by forgiving my mum and speaking to her about why she did it and if I never do i'll regret it, but I really dont want to forgive her, my life has been torture and I dont think she deserves forgiveness, I cant even imagine her speaking to me seeing as she's never made an effort to speak to me once.

I don't really know what im looking for with this post, theres not much advice you can really give other than to speak to a professional I guess.

Maybe some advice on whether or not forgiveness and speaking to her is really the only way? Or some thoughts on Antidepressants?",27Jul2020,1
34," \---2013---

I am at my girlfriend's house watching a movie. She leaves to go to a party.

I don't hear from her until the next day.

A month later I find out from someone that she had cheated on me. The someone gave me the guy's number, and I called him. The guy confirms that they had sex, and apologizes to me, he said he didn't even know we were dating.

We break up a few years later.

\---2017---

I am talking to this girl for about a week. I go on a trip to California. It's the girl's birthday that week. The girl calls me the day after her birthday and tells me she hooked up and had done mushrooms with the same guy.

I again call the guy, he again confirms that they had sex.

I stop talking to the girl a few weeks later.

\---2019---

I start dating a new girl.

\---Jan 1st---

My girlfriend cheats on me with the same guy mentioned above but we stay together.

\---1 1/2 weeks ago---

My girlfriend and I go through a bad break up and she is now I guess casually hooking up with said guy.

I made a post detailing the entire breakup with this girlfriend on this subreddit a few days ago. I have deleted it since.

\---7/22 2020---

I end up calling my last and only real girlfriend, the one from 2013. She has moved on like I had and this is the first time we had spoken since we had broken up. I am calling her to ask her if I am a bad boyfriend, did I do something wrong to make her and girlfriend #2 cheat on me.

I show her the story I had written mentioned above that was posted here.

She asks me what I remember from that night she had left for the party. I tell her ""We were just watching TV, you got a call from the guy, you went to the party, I didn't hear from you until the next day.""

She sends me screenshots of her messaging the guy from 1/27/2020 that say:

Her - (Name) I have a weird question

Him - What's up

Her - This gonna sound really random but I remember one time we were at a party and I was super fucked up on molly and I remember we were sitting on a couch and holy grail was playing and you were singing it to me.

Her - But I'm trying to remember if the cops got called or if I just hallucinated that lol

Her - Cause I remember we all had to leave really quick

Him - I don't remember that tbh

Him - that was so long ago

Her - I know

Him - Yeah sorry :/ lol

This girlfriend had cheated on me and done drugs countless times and this is the only time she can't remember what happened that night. The only thing she remembers about that night is that after she left the party, the guy and somebody else took her to a car. The guy drove her to a house. We talk about this for the next few days.

She is afraid she was sexually assaulted.

\---7/25---

I have my ex #1 on hold on the phone. I call the guy (who, remember, is currently with my recent ex #2).

Me - Yo

Him - Yo

Me - Listen... Remember around 2013 or 2014 when you and ex #1 fucked and she didn't tell you that we were dating and, remember I called you and you just straight up told me?

Him - Yeah.

Me - Um..Yeah, one second.

I merge the call.

Me - You guys there?

Both - Yes

Ex - What happened that night?

Him - Nothing, I just remember we were at a party

Ex - Did the cops come?

Him - I don't remember

Ex - What happened after the party?

Him - We hooked up

Ex - Did we have sex?

Him - No

Me - You literally just told me you had sex.

Him - That's impossible because she was on her period. I think she gave me a blowjob and some other stuff happened.

Me - We've talked about this since that day and you have always said that you guys had sex.

Him - No, we didn't.

He starts to get mad and basically hangs up.

Me and my ex talk for a bit then I go to bed.

\---7/26---

I wake up and I remember the girl from 2017. I call her and she described an extremely similar situation and she was uncomfortable talking about it. She did remember more though. She was on mushrooms and said that she was having a bad trip, just like she told me 3 years ago. She said that the guy was ""the center"" of bad trip. She said she tried to go to her room mate's room to feel better, but the guy wouldn't let her. Then she went to the bathroom to try to call me or her other roommate, who was not there at the time, but the guy wouldn't let her. She remembers she just got into bed and the guy got into bed with her. She said she knows for sure they did not have sex, but the guy ate her out. She cannot remember if she verbally said ""no"". I thank her and ask if she would get on a call with ex # 1.

She agrees to get on a phone call with ex #1. They talk. Ex# 1 calls me back after and says that they had basically experienced the same thing.

I am now stuck. I am obviously extremely close to the situation as ex # 2 is currently talking to the guy, so I feel like if I tell anybody it will seem like it is out of spite. Ex # 1 is currently trying to track down people the guy has supposedly had sex with in the past to see if this is a reoccurring theme. 2017 girl currently wants to remain anonymous.

What the fuck do I do.",27Jul2020,1
36,"This is gonna require some back story, so bear with me. I also think I just need to type this all out and rant. 

I (21f) moved to a new state and got an apartment with my husband right before the pandemic. For reference, we’re both pretty introverted people and really value our alone time together. (Which we don’t get much of because of his job.) 
 
Around mid June I got a knock on my door, and I opened it to my neighbor (22 f), whom I had only talked to once in passing, bawling her eyes out, pretty much screaming. I immediately asked her if I needed to call the police, or if she needed help, and had her come sit on my couch. 

   She calmed down enough to tell me that her boyfriend was a drunk and had destroyed their house and that she didn’t know what to do. I cried with her and comforted her, and after about an hour of talking, asked her what she wanted to do. She decided she wanted to leave, and go stay at a friends. So I helped her pack her stuff, and even kept a few things she was worried he’d damage in my house. Then I took her to get some dinner. We spent over 12 hours together. By the end of it I was worn out, but excited to have a friend in the same town as me. 
   The next day she called and said she was moving back in with him. I was disappointed, but told her that if that made her happy then okay. (I was too exhausted from the day before to argue it.) My husband and I helped her move her stuff back, and she actually introduced us to her (barely sober) boyfriend. 
In the following days, her boyfriend got sent away for work, and I got maybe 20 texts and 5 calls. All more dramatic than the last. Usually I can put hear her scream crying above me before she even calls. She’ll ask if we can hang out. In the month I’ve known her we have hung out maybe 4 times for more than an hour, and I really can’t do it anymore. 

The first time we hung out after she moved back in was about a week after our initially meeting. I had made blackberry croissants and asked to if she wanted one. 
I have a very insecure, rescue pitbull. I work with her diligently to overcome her trauma from her bait dog days, and is perfect except for socializing with other dogs. When neighbor came to my house the first time, she met her, and knows her back ground, and when she brought up my dog meeting hers, I politely declined and explained were still training. My dog loves people, and other dogs, she just has to be in the proper atmosphere to be introduced to another dog. 
So, I had my front door open, and I was holding my dog by the leash waiting for neighbor. She rounds the corner with her small, unmannered dog bouncing and barking and my dog got very upset. Once I settled my pup I gave her a croissant and asked her to take her dog home. And that was that. 

Keep in mind, I’m a very private person

The second time, I ran into her in the parking lot around midnight, and she was pretty tipsy. She had just driven home from work. (Yeah I know), and asked me to help her up the stairs. I agreed. She then begged me to stay with her, I reluctantly obliged. She then stripped butt ass naked, and walked to her bathroom and hopped in the shower. I very uncomfortably scrolled on fb and pet her dog. She begged me to sit in the bathroom and I told her it was too hot and preferred the hallway. She then got out, and said “Let’s go to your house and watch a movie.” I asked if we could watch it at her house because my husband was asleep and had work at 4 a.m., and it was 1 at this point. She said she’d be quiet and basically dragged me down stairs. She then insisted we watch 365 Days (? I think) on Netflix. I was uncomfortable, to say the least. I tried to argue to watch something else but she was insistent and I figured that the sooner the movie was over the sooner she’d leave. Luckily she talked through most the movie, and at some points I asked her to quiet down, as I could hear my husband in the other room, awake. 
Finally she fell asleep on my couch, and I left her there till 4 a.m., (she had asked me to make sure she woke up for work at 5, because she “naps hard when she’s drunk”).   

Okay so on top of the weird interactions, the phone calls and texts are getting ridiculous. The other day at 1 am I woke up to my phone going crazy. I got 15 messages, as follows: “OMG”, “OP HELP ME”, “OMG OMG”, “come here please”, etc. I didn’t respond for about 5 minutes because I really didn’t know if I wanted to get myself into an ordeal, (I know I suck) but she then, (I think after she realized I left her on read) she said “Nevermind. it was a spider, but don’t worry about me I killed it myself. Thanks for the help”. 
 
I have found myself leaving my door closed, avoiding taking my dog in walks when she’s home, and going to bed early so I can avoid her. Every time I run into her it’s an hour long conversation that almost always ends in me denying her request to come hang out in my house. 
I’ve tried explaining that I’m a newlywed and I’m busy, but she’s persistent. If she knows my balcony door is open, she will stand on hers and call my name till I respond. Like seriously she did this for a whole episode of glee once. 

And finally, the last straw, the reason I’m writing this, last night. I was at my apartment dog park, at midnight, because ya know, my dog. And I see her car drive by. I made a mental note to go through my side door so she couldn’t see me, and continued to train my dog. About 15 minutes later I hear my name and the pitter-patter of paws. I look over and see her and her little dog coming directly towards us. I leashed my dog and tried to create distance while simultaneously trying to reinforce all the training I’m doing with pup. And she’s still coming right for me. I said “hey stay that far, pup isn’t ready for this” and she said “but look how small my dog is!” And kept coming. I explained that it’s a trauma thing and not a size of the dog thing. At this point I was out of the dog park and in the parking lot, and she was about 30 ft away. Pup then started barking and pulling, so I turned sharp and walked away. She didn’t understand that this was for my dog, not her. And was like “why won’t you just let them play.”  I was livid. She didn’t understand that in that moment she had undone weeks of positive socialization. She never goes to the dog park, so I know she was coming to see me. 

I just don’t know how to address this. I don’t even know how to cut her off. She literally lives above me. And like I said, she can hear when I’m home or have my door open. 

I’m exhausted. I’m stressed out in my own home. Do I ask her to leave me alone??",27Jul2020,1
37,"So, to make a long story short my friend picked me up from the bars last night to have a couple more drinks with her and her friends. She ended up staying up all night and drinking through the afternoon, and apparently going home to her parents who I assume were very worried about what had happened. I was not around when she continued to drink and stay up through the day. I believe her parents have her phone (we are all of legal drinking age) and have been screenshotting our private conversations. I had nothing drug related on my snapchat but it did have my home address and phone number saved. Prior messages on our phones SMS texts we had talked about cocaine and how we were going to get some. I guess my main question is, what do I do? Am I in the wrong? How do I apologize? Are there any legal ramifications of sharing drugs (not selling)? Even if it happened weeks before?

She was apparently making no sense when her friends dropped her off, and apparently her parents lied to her other friends ABOUT HER DYING. She is alive and well, but they also said they were phoning the police. Weird rant, weird night and I don’t know how I got involved or if I am in the wrong whatsoever.",27Jul2020,1
38,"As the title says, my girlfriend has a very severe fear of whispering and low voices in general, to give you an idea of how bad it is she starts shaking and tearing up when she hears even a few second of someone whispering. 

She says she hates having this phobia and from time to time it becomes a notable problem, like for example at school during tests since she is pretty smart everyone always asks her for answers and obviously they whisper at her, giving her have a bit of a panic attack.

How do i help her get over it? 
She says she thinks a therapist is a bit of an overkill and also it costs quite a bit of money so that's out of the options, also exposure therapy doesnt sound like a good idea either because it's not guaranteed to work and i would never want to expose her to her biggest fear for any substantial amount of time.

Basically, when I’m craving sweets or really fatty/carby foods, I’ll put them in my mouth, chew them so I can get the flavor, and then spit them out. I can “eat” a whole bag of candies or potato chips like that. I like being able to taste the food, but I don’t wanna consume all the calories. Is this a bad thing? I know I struggle with self-confidence and self-control, but when I think of the alternatives (either binge eat whole boxes of snacks or make myself puke after I eat food that’s bad for me) spitting it out seems like the most reasonable thing. I eat well otherwise, and it’s not like I spit out the food I need to be healthy. (I try to stick to 1,300-1,600 cals a day.) And it’s junk food that I buy with my own money, so I don’t feel like I’m “wasting” it, just using it how I enjoy it. Is this ok?",27Jul2020,1

It's not that i feel like a girl or feel I've been born the wrong gender, i just feel it would make my life better over all. It's all the stuff underneath that I mean, I'm not unhappy about it, i just feel like i would feel better if our was the other stuff. I have two younger sisters, and I'm the older brother. But it would feel weird making my dad the lone guy, if i change gender. And the same thing (kinda) happened to my grandpa who got 5 daughters. If i was to change it would make us 3 girls.

I mean, id try to keep on acting boyish, (not that I'm much of that right now, i have long hair) but at least try to not change any relationships i have with my friends. They would probably tolerate it well. I think.

It's hard to come out though, i told my younger sister that i had considered it but not really anything else. It took a lot of courage to finally say something.

44," Please read this, i am lost 

So this friday was my 16th birthday, and i threw a small party. i don’t have the nicest relationship with alcohol, as i tend to relate drinking with sadness and visa versa. so at my party i got drunk and first off, punched and broke a door, the frame, and my hand. i said horrible things to my best friends and i can’t remember this at all. but that’s not the worst thing i did. 

I train mixed martial arts and can fight very well. the girl i like came to my party, she was abused as a child and was terrified of me when i hit the door, as she was inside the room. I pulled her wrist and left bruises, and i don’t remember doing it. this girl and i haven’t known each other for long but i’ve proven to be very trust worthy and i’m pretty sure she likes me back, and i am always so nice to her and so caring she was very suprised. 

I never thought i could do this, especially to her as i truly care about her and am very open about being against any type of punishment, physical or mental of men against women. i did the one thing i swore to never to and to the girl i would give the world to. The girl told her friend “He just lost me”. 

The next morning we talked about it, she was very nice and understanding, she laid on my shoulder and was hugging me telling me it’s okay and to not feel bad. i made it very clear that i would never hurt her intentionally and she said she knew that, and she knows how i could never harm her and that’s why she understands it was a mistake. 
 
Both of my grandfathers were abusive and violent alchoholics, and men in my family have a known bad temper. i don’t have a problem with alcohol as i don’t drink often but the fact that i lost my temper so fast and hurt someone i feel that way about scares me. 

I don’t know what to do as i can never drink again, not because i hurt my hand, not because of the hundreds of dollars in damage i did or what i said to my friends, but i can never forgive myself for hurting her despite her forgiving me. 

We are fine now, and i’ve apologized to everyone, but i can’t help but think that i lost all my chances with the girl of my dreams and may someday ruin my life like my grandfathers. 

I need advice, someone please help

46,"So I just started a new job in food service for $12 an hour, 39 hours per week. I've held two jobs in food service and never had any real problems apart from shitty coworkers and filthy kitchens. At my new job, everything is clean, the people are lovely, and the pay is perfectly acceptable.

Unfortunately, I had to call in on my third day because my back felt like it was going to fall off. Iwent to a chiropractor about it and found out that my discs are quite possibly bulging or slipped, and now every time I work I have an electroshock therapy unit connected to my back, and I have to use ice and heat to feel normal again after getting home. Usually the pain subsides mere hours before I have to clock in again.

What’s bothering me is that I want to do something. I don’t think I could live with myself if I didn’t at least try to help. Atm she says she’s gonna take the test tomorrow. I want to be there for her but it seems like she just wants to be alone. I’m willing to leave her alone but I’d just feel terrible to do nothing. If it does come back positive, I’m worried she won’t want me to be with her when she gets the abortion *which is what she wants to do if it comes back positive*. Also, in our state, Massachusetts, you need parental consent to get an abortion. Should we drive to another state to get it done? If her parents or my parents found out, it’d be terrible. Anyways, I’m just lost on what I should do. I’ve tried driving over but she says she can’t handle it. What’s the right thing to do?

So, here am I, just left in the dark with my shitty family. 

My parents just got in a huge argument. My mom is an alcoholic and was angry about something, so she started throwing things and screaming at my father, who supplies her with the booze. While my selfish grandmom (who also lives with us) pretty much just told me ""to deal with it"" and blamed me for not watching my mom enough. Like it's my fucking job to babysit her. I told her this and she just said, ""finish your education and you can leave, you won't have to anymore."" 

But I'm just done with this fucking family. I wish I could leave but I have no where else to go. I feel like a trapped animal. I've considered suicide as a way to escape but have some primordial fear of death preventing me.

56,"Hi so I'm a 16F and i just found out that i struggle with what's apparently called intrusive thoughts (IT), its heavily associated with ocd but i dont want to diagnose myself or anything, i just know that I have IT. 
I've pretty much struggled w really, really bad IT for as long as i can remember. I was raised in a religious household and taught to always be good and devout or there would be threats of hellfire. So i developed a fear of everything wrong, and whenever they told me about bad stuff that happens I basically panicked, like for example, my parents could be talking about a murder suicide and as soon as they were done I would put my hands over my ears and pant and shake my head and just think ""how could anyone ever do that? What if I do that, and god punishes me for it?""  The actual IT wouldnt necessarily sound like that, they're much worse, I just dont want to write them down tbh. since ive been older ive been able to hide it a lot better, and sometimes they would go away for a while but then come back unexpectedly and not go away until I went to sleep or the next ""period"" ig you could say, was over. 
Since I found out IT were a thing ive realized that they come and go in periods bc of my struggles w religion.
For some time I questioned if I really believed in god, and one day I started calling myself an atheist and I did really have the bad IT, I would still have tendencies to do or think certain things but i was able to think clearly. Then eventually when i came to realize that i actually believe in god and they came back. This is what made me think I might have IT, bc I found that they attack morals and beliefs. Ive created false memories of religious treachery because of the fact that I never want to sin. I sometimes stop in the middle of a sentence because an IT comes. It's honestly exhausting. 
Now I'm basically trying to find out how exactly to get rid of them, and I came across the r/OCD, and found a dozen people that were asking the same questions I came there to ask (i sort by New). There were lots of ""Is there any hope?"" And ""I think I'm going crazy"", i wanted to cry it was so sad. 
Now im mot sure if there is a way to stop them. I dont know what to do. I dont know how i can go on like this honestly. How can someone live the way i do for so long ?

68,"College is in about a month. I haven’t gotten my schedule yet, and will be pissed if all my classes are online but I’ve already signed a dorm contract. My school baited everyone by saying we’re doing “hybrid learning” aka a mix of in person and online classes. Then when kids sign up for their classes, they get about 2/3 in person classes. The kids then sign leases or housing contracts because they need to attend in person classes on campus. A few days later they check their portal and the classes are all switched to online. I don’t want to pay $12k to do all online classes from my dorm, when I can do it from home. 

Also the social aspect of college like rushing and parties and game days most likely won’t be there. So why the hell should I even go? 

Other than those scams, overall I’m extremely anxious and nervous. I’m so worried about making friends. My roommate and I already don’t seem to be interested in the same stuff, so I can’t rely on her to help start my social life.

If I don’t get in, I’d have to be a fifth year senior. Clearly nobody would want that, especially me when it’s another $55k for a year. The cost of my school is starting to extremely stress me out. 

I feel trapped and nervous and scared for so many reasons. I’m afraid of not making friends or getting into a sorority, worried about getting into the nursing school that’s over a year and a half away, and already freaking out about money.

My therapist recently got covid and wasnt feeling well enough for calls, but we're hoping to call this week, since they seem to be feeling better. What I've been feeling has been going on for the past 5 weeks. I do smoke weed(have a med card) but havent in a week to see if that's whats affecting me, and I do take xanax for anxiety but havent in 2 weeks because it only amplifies some of the things I'm feeling

I get upset and irritated over the smallest things, and I feel incredibly guilty for those emotions whether I snapped at someone or not while feeling that way. I get dizzy when I feel like this and I have to sit down. It feels like vertigo, which I was dealing with when I had Bell's Palsy in August 2019 but havent had any severe vertigo symptoms since February. I've always been a fairly patient person, and I know how to control any emotions from blowing up. So I dont know why I'm blowing up now.

I have to try so hard to be funny, witty, etc. I'm a very literal person and it's been getting harder for me to pick up on sarcasm, and I often get defensuve when lighthearted jokes are thrown my way.

And it feels so scary to not have a self to ground with when I can barely comprehend what's happening on a TV or something I'm holding. I've been heavily attaching myself to movie or show characters in order to feel like I have a personality and a sense of self.

I'm so scared I'll get irrationally irritated and end up snapping at someone, I've been distancing myself from everyone on social media. I got upset with my partner for no reason and they decided they should go home for the night(they usually stay with me bc their house isnt the best place to be) and I was so scared that this would happen again tomorrow I told them to wait until I had another therapy session or at least had a sense of what was going on with me. 

I'm done feeling like I'm on the constant brink of a melt down. I'm done feeling like I can't talk or understand or listen to words. I'm done feeling like I'm holding nothing when i try to cook. I've been cleaning like nuts and I feel so exhausted but I'm afraid if I stop I'll just explode. I feel so wound up in myself for no reason.

A few months ago in December/January, my mom got into a bad situation and owed money to some people.

I don't know the details of the transaction, just that she was behind on some money and they were pissed. At the time, I did not live with my mom.

So I called the shelter, informed them of the situation, and they said they already knew because two guys (one of which I knew because he used to live at the shelter as well) came around looking for me that afternoon. Eventually I got a hold of my mom at one point and made her tell me what was going on and she revealed that they were threatening to rape me over the money. 

So I stayed at my boyfriend's that night and after that I returned to the shelter and was just very cautious; My mom told me to only leave if I was going to school (I had to take the bus to go to college) but at some point she said she paid them back and things were fine now. She insisted even from then that they wouldn't have done anything and were just trying to ""scare"" her, but actually looking for someone doesn't sound like a bluff to me.

A month ago I was with her to buy her a coffee for her birthday. She wanted to stop at a friends house she'd been staying at to pick up some clothes. She lets slip that it is the house of one of the guys, the one I knew. I asked her why the fuck she was still friends with him and staying with him, to which she said he apologized to her. I told her that doesn't account for me, and she said he would apologize if he got the chance, to which I said an apology is not enough. She then started crying and saying that I have no idea how hard it is trying to survive and that she has to stay with people even if she knows they're bad and that she's the victim because it hurts her to be around someone who said things like that to her daughter. There was nothing I could do about it so I just asked to be dropped off.

This month, through a housing program for homeless youth, I got an apartment. The program pays the rent for 3 months (not including things that don't come with rent, like electricity) and then after that you're on your own. I had money saved up but certainly not enough for $800 + utilities + groceries + etc. every month. I also don't have a long-term job (I'm doing a two week online thing that will earn me about $750) because I don't have transportation and working in a public place during a pandemic worries me. I also spent a lot on my dog's vet bill recently. I do get $900 in the fall though from financial aid. However obviously, all this is not enough. That's why I let my mom stay with me, because she gets $750 from disability, and also because she was homeless but I'm gonna be real, it's mostly because of the money. 

While we were moving in, who do we see walking down the road but the guy. My mom, for some reason I cannot comprehend, yells and waves to him. So obviously, he now knows where I live. Me and my boyfriend were grabbing boxes and he stayed there staring at us for a solid minute before he kept walking, it was really weird and I nearly started crying. I've also seen him when taking my dog out, and my mom told me today when she was taking the dog out that she saw him (and I assume talked to him).

Tonight she told me she was going to hang out with someone, I wasn't really paying attention because she says a hundred things a minute and 90% of it is irrelevant stuff I don't care to hear about her personal life, so I was like whatever. She came home stoned, as expected (I told her she wasn't allowed to do any drugs on the premises and the most I would allow is her being high from weed while here, as long as she *got* high somewhere else). While talking about her night she slipped up and mentioned she was with, you guessed it, the guy. 

I truly don't know what to do. On one hand, I don't trust this guy or my mom to make smart decisions regarding him and I don't want to be put in danger. On the other, without her I'll be homeless in 3 months, 4-5 if I'm lucky. I know if I tell her not to be friends with him anymore she'll just do it behind my back. My options are really limited and I could use some advice on how to handle this.

TL;DR: Mom is still friends with someone who threatened to sexually assault me, now I'm faced with the option of kicking her out of my apartment or not",27Jul2020,1

77,"One thing I've realized during this quarantine is the fact so many of my peers are codependent. We have no sense of individualism. Happiness comes from inside one. Happiness is a feeling that you really can't describe because it's different for everyone. Happiness shouldn't be dependent on having someone else around and being in a relationship. You need things that you enjoy yourself. You need things that make you feel carefree. You need things that are ultimately your pride and joy. Being your own bestfriend seems easier than it is, it will always be a learning experience and will always be something you struggle with. But in the long run, its worth it. Codependency is something that describes Gen-Z so deeply that most of us don't even realize it's a trait of ours.

79,"I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want this to be attached to my other stuff for obvious reasons. 

I dont like talking about my past, but I will explain a little because I know people will be confused: I never had any childhood friends, maybe because I have untreated aspergers or just because I was unlucky and the bullying I experienced from the age of 5+ caused my shyness and social awkwardness which kept the cycle going. Friendless and depressed me would spend every waking moment on the internet, and when I was 12 I started using 4chan regularly, becoming familiar with edgy humour and the like. When I was 13 I got deeper into it and browsed edgier and edgier forums, I became ""unironically racist"" along with a bit of homophobia mixed in too.  I would make jokes about race, thinking I was funny and try to explain my view points, thinking I was smart, to anyone who would dare to listen. I felt confident for the first time in my life because my community asserted that I was right. I am unsure how serious people actually believed I was, if I was just being edgy or if they knew the truth.

When I turned 16, i moved away and my life changed a lot. I got other hobbies and spent less times on the alt right side of the internet. Though I was still edgy, I was much less serious about it and I eventually got talking to people of different cultures in my school who were not aware of how I was. Overtime I became much more politically correct and the disgust for how I was grew.

I am 18 now, the majority of my friends are not white. I do not believe any of what I used to believe anymore. I feel absolutely disgusted by the way I was and I am reminded of it everytime I try to reminisce of being younger. I feel like I have indirectly hurt many of my friends by how I was and I feel like no matter what I do I will never be able to forgive myself, if that is even the right thing to do. I'm scared that somehow how i was will come back to haunt me, if someone who knew me back then would try to find me and expose me. I dont even know if I am being paranoid at this point.

Why i created this post im not too sure, considering I cannot change the past. However, I guess any way that could make getting over this easier so that I do not have to feel like shit because of this for too long. I am also wondering if it is bad for me, a recovered racist, to hang around with poc friends who are unaware of my past. Any thoughts will be useful here.

So for the past 4 months I have been speaking to this girl (21), and I am 20 M. She is so beautiful and so smart. I am very much interested in her and it seemed that she was very interested in me. She even told me that she is very honest with me and enjoys our conversations. We would have long conversations for hours and very deep. I honestly think she is the one. Because of our heritage (Egyptian), we don’t have dating instead we get engaged for couple of years to get to know each other before marriage. So she was talking to me about her opinion on engagement and what she looks for in a guy. We discussed meeting but I am currently out of the country and won’t return for another 2 weeks.

81,"So, I've been friends with my boy for about 3 years now and we're very close. We play online games together, we often invite each-other for sleep-overs and do all that stuff. About 8 months ago, when he was playing call of duty, he met this girl that quickly became histoire girlfriend. There's been on and off relationships where she dumped him in most cases, but now they're closer than ever. She lives in the same country, but she lives very far away, a 10 hour drive from where we live. A couple of weeks ago, i noticed her attitude started becoming a little toxic towards me. she started making fun of me when I made a mistake, she would yell at me when SHE made a mistake and I couldn't resurrect her and she just started becoming an umpleasant person around me. The other day, I was playing with my mate and she joined us. We were just messing around and like most friends do, we made fun of each other, nothing unusual but at one point when he mocked me about losing and I replied ""you lost two games before me so😂"" And she just went full Karen mode. She snapped and went SHUT UP, MY BOYFRIEND'S WAY BETTER AT THIS GAME THAN YOU! I was getting pissed at her cause she was about to cross the line, and my friend didn't say anything but he told me by text ""it's all good even if you were properly making fun of me I can stand up for myself"". And I ended up making her cause she would keep saying my name as if she was annoyed at everything I said. A few days later, she joined with one of her friends and she kept kicking me from the party every 10 minutes. She did it twice and the third time I just turned off the game and texted my friend ""yo do something about your girl mate"". He replied by "" I asked her why she did that and she said she was jealous about me"". At first I didn't get it cause we're not attracted to men and she knows that and he said ""she said she's jealous of the fact we can invite each-other and see each-other in real life and she can't see me. I told him "" Is she stupid or doesn't she know the meaning of best friends "". He was n'y angry at me for saying that cause He understud how annoying she was toward me and He just said "" Well it's understandable for the fact that she's upset since she can't see me"".

83,"I [F19] work at a donation facility for an animal shelter. We get volunteers and people doing community service a lot. Recently my coworker's grandson [M21] began paying his community service hours at my work.

He's been hitting on me pretty bad. He asked me if I was single two separate times. One of the two times he asked if I liked it/wanted to be. I told him I enjoyed being single. He told me he was 21 and asked me if I was into  ""older guys"" or whatever. On my last break he walked up to me, told me I was ""in trouble"" and said I had to kiss him. All of this in addition to general flirty-ness that's been going on since I met him. 

He made a comment about my young female coworker that skeeved me out a bit. He told me he ""wished she wasn't 15"" and stuck out his tongue. 

I've always been kind to him but I never show any signs of interest. I'm kinda required to be nice to this guy because I'm at work. He just creeps me out a bit... Another volunteer told me I should tell my supervisor about his behavior.

This is my first time dealing with this kinda thing, I don't really wanna make a big issue about it. I'll be seeing him a couple times a week and it's making me uneasy.

84,"I need some advice. I used to be part of a great content making group. We all loved making Halo gameplay videos and machinimas. I had a few subscribers and was having a ton of fun with my content and the community. Then- I made the mistake of trying to defend someone I knew in the YouTube comments section. My comment wasn’t mean but it was dismissive. Someone else with more experience on the internet took great offense and began insulting me. I also believe I was targeted since I am a female. Being my immature self- I insulted them back. Suddenly, a barrage of horrible insults came my way. They then went and made a copy of my YouTube account, same name and picture, then went on various channels and my own channel and began leaving racist, sexist, homophobic comments on all these channels. They then botted and disliked many of my videos, what once had 200 views and 10 likes and 1 dislike now had 35 dislikes. As a new YouTuber - this was devastating. He also deleted all his comments to make it seem like he wasn’t at fault. And most of the time I do my best to be tuff and let things slide because Ive gone through so much shit being a girl on Xbox- but this was the cherry on top. Worst of all, no one stuck up for me. No one else wanted to get botted or have their acct copied. I was so hurt by that. I basically deleted most of my videos and haven’t gone back to that acct for the past four years.

86,"I don’t know if she’s depressed, if she’s just overreacting, or whatever... She won’t tell me or anyone else anything.

I’m her best friend. We’re very close. She tells me everything that happens to her life, even the boring stuff, but she doesn’t tell me the things that are making her sad.

One time I came home to her crying on her bed. Our whole family each spent alone time with her and she didn’t a single thing about it except that it was none of our faults.

The next day, she seems fine and whenever we talk to her about it, she just tells us to stop asking.

She’s always kept her feelings to herself. I think she finds it weird to share her feelings, but it hurts so much seeing her sad and not being able to do anything about it because she won’t tell me.

Another thing, we are both currently student athletes in the same sport. Our parents got us into this sport at a young age and fully support both of us in it. I love my sport, however, the same can’t be said for her. It’s not like she’s lazy... She works out on her own at home diligently. She just doesn’t like the sport.

She has almost quit a few times already but hasn’t yet. She’s not being forced or pressured to do the sport. My parents have expressed that to her. She keeps telling me that she’s not sure if she wants to go back to the sport after quarantine. I’ve told her to talk to my parents multiple times about this but she won’t.

She keeps postponing the day she’ll ask my parents, and then she forgets about it, and then she’ll feel bad about having to still do her sport. I’ve tried to help her ask my parents but she gets mad at me when I do. It’s like she trying to avoid and forget the problem instead of solving it.

I don’t know what to do. My parents also don’t know what to do. I’ve seen this kind of behavior on her multiple times already. I’m afraid one day, she won’t be able to avoid her problems and she’ll burst. Any kind of advice is appreciated, thank you very much :)",27Jul2020,1
88,"Apparently, according to the Indiana unemployment website, it doesn’t matter who’s fault it is if my claim is deemed inaccurate. And it just so happened to be deemed inaccurate the second COVID ran out, leaving me in (apparent) $12,000 debt. They said they were supposed to send me a letter explaining why, and having details on how to appeal. They never did. I never got any correspondence regarding it at all other than a notice of overpayment. I have no idea how to appeal, but am told I have a very limited amount of time to do so. If the determination is made final, I’ll have zero options. I may not even qualify for a payment plan.

If I’m $12,000 in debt, that’s fine. It’s worth having a home with the person I love, and without unemployment, I wouldn’t have had it.

89,"Please do forgive my grammar and mistakes as English is not my first language.

First, let me introduce myself—I'm the only child of the family and is regarded as the ""breadwinner"". Belonging to an Asian household, I was expected to do good in school—and those expectations were met. I'm always at the top of our class and never got a grade lower than A. I was pretty content of what I have and happy that my parents are very proud of me but those happy moments come with something one wouldn't expect. 

Let me explain why I didn't realize I was being abused. As a child, we really don't know anything. If I didn't want to study, my mom would slam my face into the piles of books laid out for me, and I thought it was normal. If I just wanted to play all day and enjoy my time with friends, my mom would go out her way and get me while holding a tree branch, hitting me while dragging me away. I thought it was normal. If I wanted to go out with friends, my mom would lock me in my room and tell my friends that I was studying and shoo them away. I thought it was normal. When I wanted to be alone, I'd lock myself in my room but it was no use as my mother had a lot of duplicates of my keys and would force her way in. I thought it was normal.

I thought everything was normal... after all, I was forcibly locked away from the outside world. The only ever chance I could go out is when I was in school and when my friends would sneak me out and make excuses for me.

Fast forward to when I could finally think back about everything, I realized that I was the only kid in my class that would get beating for not studying, that I was the only kid to get dragged away for going out and playing with my friends.

I realized that I was also being verbally and mentally abused that time. My own mother would call me a useless child if she catches me with my phone despite having done everything that she had told me to do. She would also berate me and embarrass me in front of everyone—no one here do not know what I've done as a child.

There was one time that I talked back to her because I was done. I couldn't even defend myself as she'd managed to hit me before I could get a word out. I found myself deciding to cut my hair short for it to not get grabbed again.

I honestly couldn't talk. She's so entitled and defensive of her title as a ""mother"". She would say things like, ""I was the one who brought you into this world,"" ""Of course I could hit hit you, I made you,"" ""You can't talk back to me you do not have the right to.""

And she has the audacity to say, ""I hit you because I love you."" Which honestly hurt more than being actually hit.

Anyway, we'll get to my mother later. Let's talk about my father.

I don't really know my father that well as he's been working for almost my whole lifetime and I only get to see him maybe once or thrice a year. In the eyes of many, I was called a ""daddy's girl"" as I was overly close to him. Maybe I was just longing for safety and care that I realized I was seen like that.

What I do know is my father is addicted to gambling and has a pretty bad temper when he loses. Our house almost got sold off because of his addiction.

Due to work stuff and the pandemic, he's finally home and stayed for almost a year now. And also because of it, his addiction to gambling grew and grew (curse those online gambling sites). His temper grew with it too.

About three  years ago, he got me a cat as a present. Last year, a dog as a present, and last month, a puppy and another cat as presents. My mother couldn't do anything about it as my father sees himself as the ""law"" of the household.

Why am I telling this?

Well, just earlier this morning, my father got rid of my younger cat, and slammed the older one onto the floor—which made me write this in the first place. Just last week too, he threw my puppy off of the balcony. The puppy survived but got wounds and bruises all over.

I cried to him and begged him not to take away my friends from me, but he keeps shouting at me that he is the law and he has the right to get rid of them as he was the one to bring them here in the first place. Many things were broken when I tried to get my cat off of him. Including my glasses so I really can't see well atm. 

I ran and is currently hiding under my bed. If course, I wasn't safe. My mom unlocked my door (of course) while my father was bringing my cat god-knows-where and for whatever her reason is, she kept hitting me and pinching my back. I couldn't really hear her as I was covering my ears and had my head into the corner of my room.

I suffered depression before because of people I thought I could trust, which is a story for another time, and I had just escaped from it. I think I'm falling into depression again as I have a tendency to harm myself in any possible way I could. 

I'm writing this after I got sober from hitting my head onto the wall multiple times and now my head hurts. 

Everything made me realize that ever since I was a child, I was being abused. Verbally, mentally, emotionally, and physically.

Wow, reading back, my family is a great mess.

I have to cut this short now because I'm getting a headache from all the crying.

I would like to get advice as I really do not know what to do at this point. I don't want to enter another depressive episode and that the next time I do, I might never wake up. I still have books to read and movies to watch... oh, and my remaining animals need me too.

I'll be editing this after I feel better... I'll add some stuff too.

Thank you in advance.",27Jul2020,1
90,"Disclaimer: my English may be bad so sorry.

 I was friends with several people for about 5 years. Since middle school. We were the ""popular kids"" .  I was the ""nerd"" one in the group. we fought a lot, they didn't care about my interests, would lough at me, get mad at me if I couldn't let them copy my homework or even exams (fun story:  one day we were having test and teacher kinda knew that I was letting them copy everything, so she told me to take my desk and sit right in front of her. Like, she was santemeters away from me. And every chance of letting anyone copy dissapeared. In the middle of writing I hear my ""friends"" calling my name, and I know teacher hears them, becouse she raised her head and stared at me, waiting to see what would I do. They kept calling me and she kept staring at me. I was in such stress at that moment that I couldn't keep writing. But thankfully they stopped calling and I was able to finish test. Right when class finished, they all  came up to me and started calling me ""selfish, egoist, terrible friend"" and they didn't care that I couldn't let them copy becouse teacher would see me.) And etc. Whole time I knew that situation was toxic. yes, there were good moments, we had fun sometimes but most of the time I wasn't happy. I tried to ""escape"" them several times, but somehow we always got back together. I'm not one of confident persons, it's really hard for me  to Express myself and I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. And I don't like making someone upset becouse of me, and when they would say, ""please forgive me for what I did let's be friend again, please."" and other bs, I would always forgive them, even tho last night I promised myself that I wouldn't. I was always afraid that if I left them, I would have no friends, that I would be alone. And then I thought that maybe they weren't toxic after all, maybe I'm just being whiny. 
Then quarantine happened. I got close to my old friend, she's from other school and we usually communicate by internet. And I had lots of personal time, lots of time to think and I realized that I need to leave, this was perfect timing, becouse I would just block them on social media and it would be a lot easier for me  than to tell them in person. 
So I did. I unfriended them and even  blocked some of them. I really felt weight rise up my chest. I was guilty becouse of not telling them anything but I felt happy. One of them massaged me and I politely said hi, then she asked why I unfriended them and why was I mad, which i ignored and moved on, which was really hard and I even typed apologies several times but deleted them before sending. Next few months, I felt that I was getting better. I got extremely close to my internet friend, found new friends in fandoms and realized that I didn't need my old friends to be happy. At that point I haven't left my house for 4 months, but I wasn't bored either. When quarantine ended, my teacher massaged us that we needed to take  our books back to school. That meant I had to meet my classmates, including my old  friends. I was hella scared, I knew they would I ask me why I did this so I was even getting ready speech (which was pointless, becouse my anxiety wouldn't let me say a word) . But actually what happed was one girls looked at me up and down, and I just left my books, talked to teacher and left. I could feel them looking at me, and I saw it too, but i pulled out my headphones and kept going. Ine month later  teacher included me in project (would point out without my permission), we have to go to school every day at 6 PM and watch a movie(maybe make one later too). Watching movies is pretty cool, becouse we don't have cinema in our city. So It was a plus. But when I arrived yesterday some of them were there and one of them started walking towards me saying  hi and trying to kiss me on cheek, but when I stepped back she asked ""what's wrong with you?"" And other one, which I kindly blocked becouse she was one of the most toxic person I've ever met, said ""I told you"" and first one kept asking what's wrong and I said ""nothing"". Thankfully teacher came them and said hi and how am i and etc. Every chance she would get, she would ask me what's wrong, which continued today, sometimes I would excuse  me being on phone, or having headphones on and listening to music or sometimes I would tell her to stop. Others weren't showing interest other than listening to our conversations, but yeah. It continued untill she harshly and angrily said bye to me when I was already walking out of door.  I know I should tell them something but I don't know what and how. I'm scared that I will get back to them. Help",27Jul2020,1

92,"So I’ve been extremely sick lately. Tested for covid 3 days ago now but still waiting for results. My best friends haven’t really asked how I’m doing... The first day one asked in a group chat but that was really it.. They haven’t asked if I need anything either considering i’m quarantined to my apartment and cannot really leave.

2 days ago they were texting in the group chat and J asked T to come hang out with her baby. I said something like “you really gonna hang around that baby right now?🥴” because I’d just gone to get ice cream with her the day before I got very sick and my results haven’t come back and the baby is like 3 months... I was concerned but trying to sound playful and non-judgmental. The baby’s mother, T,  said “i mean i don’t really have an option lmfao” to which I then tried to further explain that I wasn’t meaning to sound judgmental by lightheartedly saying “i mean it’s not my health i just don’t want anybody trying to put it on me if something happens to anybody.. i been warned y’all”. Nobody acknowledged my text. J disregarded it completely and texted “i’m on my way” to T in the chat.

I felt so disrespected. I wasn’t trying to control their decisions. It’s their health, not mine. But I was trying to communicate that I feel that even though their choosing to be irresponsible, I will have to bear the guilt if i test positive and that baby gets sick... I know the reality is that there are so many other sources the virus could come from but I know in the back of their minds they’d blame me. The next morning I sent a text explaining how I felt disrespected that my concerns were disregarded and T replied saying she wouldn’t blame me. J who is my BEST friend of many 10 years never replied. It’s been a couple days so i texted the chat this morning to make sure they’re still healthy since they’d been around me when i got sick. T said she was fine and asked how I was doing. J still hasn’t replied at all.

Furthermore, i’m frustrated that she has not ONCE checked on me or my health during this time. It sounds dramatic but the way I see it is.. I’m sick during the middle of a pandemic and she has not checked on me not once to see if i’m ok or if i need any help while being stuck at home. I feel hurt by that. She’s been watching my snapchat stories of me jokingly complaining that i can’t leave but NEED ice cream. and my IG stories detailing how sick I really am and has said nothing. A part of me wants to text her and demand an explanation but another part of me just never wants to speak to her again. I almost went to the hospital yesterday bc I was having such a hard time breathing and she wouldn’t have even known. Am I wrong for being this upset by this? I’m bipolar so I tend to be very black and white/ dramatic in my reactions so I question the validity of my feelings all the time so idk...

What’s a reasonable reaction?",27Jul2020,1

95,"Hi everyone!

I need help with the process of getting away from my narcissistic mother. I’m 18, and currently live with her when I’m not in college. All my life, she’s controlled every aspect of my freedom, from my finances to when I can leave the house and who I can see. Whenever I bring something like this up, she blames me for being an ungrateful child and tells me to move out if I hate it here. She also denies anything negative she’s ever done, and says that she can’t remember it, so it’s untrue. The problem is that she’s a very nice and respected person in her daily life. She uses this as an excuse for her behaviour, and always claims that she’s the only one who does anything in the house, and she’s the only one who is correct in any instance. Any contribution I make, she claims she’s the one who did it. At this point, I really would like to move out, but I don’t know how to handle a lot of things by myself. She holds every cent she’s ever spent on me above my head, so I have to pay her back eventually. I don’t want to add to the amount I already owe her (she payed for my schooling in highschool as I was in a specialized program and helped me out with my college fund for first year). She still has control over my main bank account, and even though I’ve made a separate one, I can’t access my CERB and some of the other money that I rightfully have earned since it’s in that main account. I don’t know how to start the process of moving out and slowly removing myself from her. I don’t know how to do things like remove myself from her insurance and get my own (I need therapy and medication for my mental illness, which she refuses to believe in), get my own money back from the account she controls, cancel a credit card that’s under her name, remove her bank account from my school, etc., because I can’t ask her to do those things for me (she won’t). I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, so if there’s a better subreddit, please direct me there, but I’m really at a loss here and I need to leave this house for my own sanity. I just don’t know where to start and how to get enough money to live and pay my tuition. Any help is appreciated, thanks for reading if you got this far!",27Jul2020,1

108,"So I’m 20f and my sister is 23f. My sister (I’ll call her Lynn) has had a bf (I’ll call him Peter) for 3-4 years and lives with him now. I’ve been dating my bf for almost 8 months. A few weeks ago me and my bf were having lunch with Lynn and Peter and this was their first time meeting my bf. We hung out in a common area of her apartment building for a few hours and it was really fun! 

Like halfway through, I had to go to the bathroom so Lynn took me up to her apartment and the bfs stayed where they were. When we were alone she said “Oh my gosh they look so similar!!!” And I was like “What? No they don’t” but she kept pushing and also said they look kind of like our dad (who we don’t have a good relationship with) so I was weirded out and vaguely offended so I said “But I don’t like how Peter looks.” Now for a bit of context, both bfs have beards and similar hair colors, but Peter is very overweight and my bf is average, leaning towards the heavy side but he’s definitely not in the overweight category. There’s nothing wrong with being fat, it’s honestly just not my type. 

Now let me say before I go any further (not an excuse but I still want to say) I was homeschooled. My social skills are not the best. Lynn was not homeschooled. 

Anyway, while we were walking back down she asked me “Why don’t you like how Peter looks?” And I replied with “I just think he’s kinda ugly.” I’ve always been super honest and I cannot lie at all which I don’t think is a positive trait. I know I need to work on having a better filter. So Lynn says “wow that’s kinda mean” and I say “no it’s not??” Because at the time I genuinely didn’t think it was. I thought it was just me having a different opinion. We ended the conversation with Lynn saying “I guess, it’s just preference.” But after telling this story to my bf and mom, they think I should definitely not have said that. My mom made me feel especially bad and said I probably made Lynn feel self conscious so I feel really guilty about it and I wish I hadn’t said it. At the time I felt like she was insinuating that my bf was ugly too so I was a bit defensive which looking back on it was super messed up and I really shouldn’t have said anything. My mom said I should’ve just kept saying “idk I don’t see it (the resemblance)” And I wish I would have said that. 

Does anyone else have that sibling thing where you just don’t really apologize? Like it’s weird. We usually just move on. I thought about texting her “Sorry I called Peter ugly” but it just seems so unfeeling and insincere. I don’t know how to make this right. Does anyone have any advice?

She said that she was just busy since it was summer, and later said that she was going on a three day trip and that she would call me right when she got home.

119,"I do not have anyone in particular to come to for this, so I thought this subreddit may help. I created this account solely for this rant. 

I really enjoy drawing. It has been a huge passion of mine over the past couple of years and I have been blessed to have a supportive family. My dad has given me more than enough to become a successful artist. I have every resource and more that anyone (a beginner or expert) could ever imagine to need. I draw every day and I am constantly trying to improve, but I have a tendency to overwork and overwhelm myself with crazy expectations.

I want to become a professional artist and move others the way that some animes, games, comics, mangas, other artists, etc have to me. However, as many people know, the art field is not very forgiving. Many artists barely scrape by and are basically abused in the industry. I keep telling myself to give up on this dream and pursue a more stable career, especially since I have been given opportunities to do research in the medical field.

On top of that, I have a secret that no one knows. I love to create stories. It has been a hobby of mine that I have devoted myself to for a decade. For the past six years I have worked on a story that I have not mentioned to a single person, even though I have put my soul into it. It is the reason why I taught myself to draw. My goal in life is for others to see this story (as a comic) and be moved by it just like many others have done to me.

Now that I am graduating high school soon, I have been thinking about how my future. If I want to become successful, I need to make a decision and I need to make it now. Either give up on this childish dream and put my attention towards a secure career, or to continue with this ambition that will probably get me nowhere. Regardless of which choice I make, I have to devote myself to something.

No one in my family has been very successful and I am scared to make the same mistakes my parents and older friends have made. They settled for less and realized that they couldn't catch up. In order to prevent this from happening, I am putting all my attention towards my passion at a young age and I am constantly trying to become better. However, I feel like am running out of time. I feel like I need to be at a professional level by the time I graduate high school, which has been causing me to subconsciously rush myself to become better.  

At the same time, I feel like even if I got my art to a professional level, I have no idea how I will achieve my goal and continue to make a living. I am so scared that I will never get anywhere with my art and become just like my parents. 

I have not told anyone about this. The most my friends and parents know is that art is something I can do, however they do not think it is a huge passion of mine. I do not like showing my art and ideas to others. None of my friends and family even know that I have created stories everyday for a decade.

I apologize if this seems tame or preachy compared to the other situations that others have experienced in this subreddit, but this has been on my mind for a very long time and it is becoming very overwhelming. It has even caused me to quit art for a year, which I am now paying heavily for. I am just so confused as to where to go. I have no idea how I will be able to achieve my dreams, or if it is even possible for me to do so. I want this more than anything else in life and I am so overwhelmed and confused over what I should do with myself.",27Jul2020,1

121,"Hi. I first want to start off by saying that I believe everyone should be quarantining to the best of their ability and to the best of their comfort level. If that means you become a hermit and never see anyone until 2021, that's cool. If that means you go to work and go to the grocery store but take the appropriate precautions (ie washing hands and wearing a mask at all times outside), that is also cool. 

Basically, I am upset at my (21) friend (20), who'll I'll call Alberto. The general situation is that he is trying to dictate how our mutual friends choose to quarantine in order for him to still hang out/be social in person, but it's specifically at my detriment as I am an essential worker and can't drop everything to cater to his needs. 

So, Alberto and I have a common friend, who'll I'll call Sammi (19). Sammi, Alberto, and I have all been hanging out off and on during quarantine, as I have been the only one working and I would usually do my grocery shopping with these same friends and their roommates. During quarantine, Alberto has been traveling up to his family multiple times, leaving myself and Sammi to watch his place and spend time with his animals. Alberto has also been hanging out with people he deems 'safe', as they are mutuals of myself and Sammi's. All throughout quarantine, I have noticed that everyone in our circle of friends seems to quarantine/not quarantine based on Alberto's social needs. (If Alberto is seeing family in two weeks, stay away. If Alberto is lonely, come over or he'll be sad bc he needs his friends.) I haven't had a problem with this until about two and a half weeks ago. 

Two and a half weeks ago, I was contacted by my place of work that someone tested positive for COVID. However, I never worked with this person and I also had not worked with anyone (recently) that worked with Patient X, as I'll call them. My place of work has very, very strict sanitation, temperature check, and symptom tracking policies, so I was pretty sure I was not exposed. However, at an abundance of caution, I contacted my friends and told them that I wanted to remain separate from them for a week or two, just to be safe. I also suggested that they hold off on plans to socialize with people outside of our circle, just in case one of us got ill. I wanted to make sure that I was doing my best to be responsible, and everyone agreed to not be in contact. I missed everyone, but we skyped and played minecraft and everything was fine. 

Then, when it had been almost two weeks, I asked Sammi when we could hang out. Sammi then proceeded to tell me that Alberto will not hang out with me until I stop working or until there is a vaccine for COVID or our community has 0 cases. AND THAT IS OK!! I was like, cool! That's fine! And then I realized there was a tone is Sammi's voice, and I asked what that meant for me hanging out with Sammi. If Sammi was still going to hang our with Alberto, then I didn't want to be disrespectful and selfishly spend time with Sammi when I knew Alberto didn't want to see me in person. Sammi told me that Alberto is guilting Sammi into not hanging out with me because he wants to spend time with Sammi. Sammi wants to be able to make her own decisions and not feel like she has to choose between us. (I want to clarify that I specifically said I would respect whatever decision Sammi made without judgement, but that it is wrong of Alberto to try to dictate her choices.) 

So--I'm mad. Sammi and Alberto are hanging out and skyping me WHILE THEY ARE TOGETHER, and I feel very left out. Sammi is continuously saying that she's uncomfortable with the situation, but she won't say anything to Alberto. All the while every single one of our mutual friends are hanging out and going to public places together (family homes, grocery shopping, etc) while I am stuck alone. 

To top it all off, Alberto is very, very privileged in that he doesn't even pay his own rent (and he pockets his unemployment) and basically gets everyone to do what he wants; he's spoiled and entitled at the worst of times, but the majority of the time he's a good friend. (I mean, the gall he has to say that I can't see any of our mutual friends bc I have to work and he says I shouldn't have to... ugh)

What do I do? Do I confront him? Do I ask Sammi to talk to him or ask her to hang out with me? She suggested a two week off and on schedule, but that would put her in a position where she is quarantining just to be with me. I know it's selfish to want to hang out with my friend during a pandemic, but I am always catering to whatever Alberto wants, even pre-COVID. I feel like I am being targeted, even though I don't think Alberto is malicious. I'm just...really sad and lonely.",27Jul2020,1
122,"Hi everyone, I apologize if this post becomes too long. I will leave a TLDR at the bottom.

So I am 15 and my mom has been drinking for pretty much half my life. I remember being 7 and her drinking every night. She had a very bad alcohol addiction. She never abused me in any way, she's never hit me, insult me, neglect me, or anything like that. She's an amazing mom. She would just act a little...eh, stupid? Weird? Her bad alcoholism lasted a few years, maybe 2-3. My memories are a little foggy, I just remember a few specific events.

I never understood what was going on. As far as I knew, at night mommy acted funny. Eventually, my dad came into my room after she fell asleep to tell me what was going on. 

My mom stopped drinking every night. To this day, at most she'll drink 2 nights in a row. However, over the past few months she's always had a box of wine in the fridge. She drinks a little bit during the week, but she never gets drunk. I can tell when she drinks, though. About every other weekend, she gets drunk one night. Like I said before, she never gets abusive in any way. She does get emotional and we always end up having deep talks about her rough childhood, my sexuality, issues with femininity, etc. sometimes. But then we always start goofing around again. 

I'm not mad at my mom and I'm not traumatized. This stuff doesn't personally affect me, I'm just worried about my mom. I grew up where drinking was normal, is it? Or am I just too worried over nothing? If my mom has an issue then I wanna help her. I'm worried my mom is gonna choke on her puke in her sleep, even though she never drinks to the point of barfing. I'm also not worried about her driving drunk, even when she gets drunk she talks about how uncomfortable she is with the thought of driving. She drank today and passed out about half an hour ago which is pretty early for her. I wanted to sleep in the same room with her so I could make sure she was okay but theres not enough room. Thank you to anyone who read through all this, I feel like this is a fucking mess haha.

TLDR: My mom used to drink almost nightly when I was little but after a few years she stopped. Here lately shes been drinking a little more and I'm not sure if this is a problem since she never abuses me in any way, my mom is the best mom anyone could ask for.",27Jul2020,1
123,"So a bit of a short one here 

I’m 13 and I just don’t like being touched. I don’t really have a reason like I wasn’t abused or anything but I just don’t like it. Tonight my dad was going to bed and he told me goodnight and patted my arm. I reflexively jerked my arm away and asked him not to touch me. He and my mom (who was standing next to him) started yelling at me and ranting about how I’m they’re son and they love me so they have a right to touch me. I was grounded after that and I came up to my room to type this. And honestly reddit I just want to know. Am I in the wrong here?",27Jul2020,1
124,"Years ago I meet a girl 3 grades lower than me going through some serious depression and anxiety. She cut and had a book of really negative thoughts about her. I wanted to help and just be someone positive in her life. As we talked more I understood how much she hated herself. I couldn't see a reason why. She wasn't a mean person. Just quite and normal at first glance. Anyways, we became friends and would talk in real life often. The problem started when I found her having a mental breakdown and a knife in hand. To be honest I was petrified and didn't know what to do. She started tracing the knife around her wrist, (she had already cut before) and I freaked out and said ""I'll give you my phone number if you don't cut."" I just didn't want her to hurt herself. When I said this she suddenly changed her mood and smiled. It wasn't a manipulative smile, it was more like a burst of positive emotion that she couldn't help but let out. She looked much better afterward - still a little bit rattled, but composed once again.

Now, keep in mind I'm a guy. I knew how it would look if it came out that I gave a girl my number knowing she was 3 grades lower than me. I only saw her as a friend, someone to support and trust. I hate and would kill anyone who would try some shit with someone that young given my age.  
I didn't want to look like a creep basically. I knew I only had her best interest at heart but what would others think? Would the parents cause a huge scene assuming that I'm someone I'm not? Would the cops get involved? Our friendship never extended beyond the rare hug but I was scared of what others would think and do.

A couple of weeks passed and I didn't give her my number, in fact, no contact info for that matter. I couldn't figure out what to say to her or what to do.

Suddenly, I had to move schools. As a result, I couldn't go to my old one where my friend was. I was a ""liability"" since I was no longer part of the school. From the eyes of my friend, I suddenly disappeared. I was the only person she trusted to a high degree. I completely abandoned her without so much of a goodbye. I can't imagine what that felt like for her. It must have wrecked the little trust she had in people. I'm sorry and guilty for hurting someone that I cared about.

After I left the school I was invited back for a BQQ. I was happy that I might see her again and be able to explain things. When she saw me she kicked me, lunged at me, and put her hands around my throat. She didn't squeeze at all or kick me hard. I think it was more of an emotional reaction but there wasn't any malice involved. She said to me with watery eyes that ""I ruined your life."" Later, I eventually had the chance to explain things to her, but we were in a place where someone could pass by and hear. I asked her to go the staircases with me where it's more private and I could explain everything in detail without others overhearing.

She hesitated which in hindsight I understand why (I did break her trust by suddenly disappearing.) But at the moment I was only seeing things from my point of view and took it as an offense. I ended up going the egotistical route and saying ""I don't have much time if you want me to explain I will but you got to make a decision in the next 10 seconds."" She waited past the 10 seconds and I walked away. Now that I'm typing this, it sounds so stupid what I did. I can't believe I fucked it up in the end over my stupid ego. I just wanted to explain things to her in private and set things straight... but instead I and end up leaving her hanging, and so too I left that chapter in my life open, not being able to properly apologize to her and make amends. I just wanted to explain things to her in on my own terms and that cost me my clean conscience. God damn it.

I hate myself for making that stupid decision. I had the opportunity in front of me. All I had to do was explain. To put my ego aside, her first, and just make things right. But I didn't and it kills me. I just want to find her and apologize. To say I'm sorry and explain everything I did. To give her closure and help her understand that she can trust. I never wanted to hurt her, but I did in the end. I feel like such an idiot and I can't make it right. I only know three pieces of information about her and I don't know if it's the right choice to try to find her. How do I move on?

\-What if I try my heart out to find her and I can't in the end?

\-When do I know when to stop looking for her, because there's always something more I can do.

\-How can I move on knowing that there's always something more I can do to find her and properly apologize?

\-I don't want to seem creepy or obsessed about finding her. I'm a reasonable guy and just want the healthiest route to take. The guilt is just eating me up and I want to make it right by apologizing. -

\-Right now she's 18 and I'm 21.

\-What is the healthiest option in your opinion? I feel like the only way to make things right is to find her no matter what, apologize, and explain.

I know the country of origin she's from because we both had that similarity. I know which elementary we went to because that's where we met and I know her first name. I also remember she told me which high school she wanted to go to but I don't know if she ended up going there at all.

Any questions I'll answer promptly. You can Dm me too about this. Thank you so much for your time and thoughts. Again, I appreciate it. I'm struggling and your help means a lot.",27Jul2020,1
125," 

I didn't really know where else to go or who to speak to but I've been friends with someone (let's call her Becca) for about a year now (I am a recently out gay man) and a few months into our friendship she told me she had feelings for me which is when I came out to her. Our friendship was fine after (noticed some little things but never thought about them) and we got really close but I've been dating a guy for 8 months now and I live w Becca and things have been getting even weirder and just...wrong. It got especially worse after I got into a relationship, so here are some of my observations and details:

\-She is very attached to her mother and went to a small school (class size was 13)

\-Her parents support her in every way and she lacks any independence, not even a bank account (shares her mom's amazon account and must get approval for all purchases from her)

\-She doesn't do chores fully and I feel like I'm her parent because I always have to go over her not doing the dishes right or making a mess and not caring (she mentioned a few days ago that I remind her of her dad)

\-She has ADHD and is prescribed way too much Adderall (60mg IR a day, never met anyone w this)

\-Addicted to nicotine (puff or juul in hand at all times) and cocaine (not BAD bad but she CAN'T say no when offered) and a MAJOR addiction to weed (smokes multiple times a day)

\-She lacks any social awareness. Ex. She talks to me about random things and doesn't stop even if I'm studying or doing something that clearly needs my attention so I have to tell her to shut up because she doesn't get the hint. This is arguably one of the biggest annoyances about her and I feel like I have to work on my friends liking her because a lot of them just don't.

\-More on social awareness: she talks too much, she tends to tell stories that go nowhere or are not even interesting but seem to make her really excited

\-She has no real friends, and thus I am the only person in her life that she leans on and depends on

\-She gets visibly uncomfortable when I kiss my boyfriend or hold him close when watching a movie

\-She gets visibly sad or uncomfortable when me and him go out together and she isn't invited

\-She is VERY passive-aggressive and doesn't attempt to hide it at all

\-She gets excited (and I mean EXCITED) about boys after a few minutes of talking to them on Tinder and this happens every few days because none of them ever work out (context: she's never dated anyone and has limited sexual history)

\-She's very emotional and cries about little things

\-She never gets mad at me, and I mean EVER, and I've pushed the line to see if I can crack her (I know it' shitty) but she just never stands up for herself

\-She's not good at school and is taking an extra year to graduate, however, she is VERY artistic

I should've mentioned before but she is a few months from turning 21 and we go to college together. Overall, her behavior is very, very childish and immature and it's been concerning because I can't imagine how she can live on her own. I know this sounds horrible but I'm at the point where I don't even know what to do anymore. She's starting to get into my relationship and my boyfriend doesn't wanna visit or study because he says she's annoying and distracting. I know she has ADHD and my boyfriend is diagnosed as well, but even on Adderall he acts completely different than her, almost like Adderall doesn't affect her at all. I've looked online with some of the behaviors I've noticed but the closest thing I found was Asperger's and she didn't fit all the signs.

With all the things I've listed, I hope you can see that this isn't someone who's an annoyance but someone with something genuinely wrong and I hope anyone can guide me in the right direction because with her addiction kicking in at high gear it's starting to become a health and mental problem as well. Thank you for bearing w me!",27Jul2020,1

127,"
so my best friend and I aren't talking..

the weeks leading up to fourth of July we had been planning to hang out for the fourth. We were talking about camping for like two weeks but we ended up camping the weekend before so we were talking about going to the river and watching fireworks and getting food from food trucks, the whole week. 

Alilbackground

she broke up with this really great guy and started talking to her shitty ex a couple weeks prior and was like lying to me about needing to go home cause she was tired or needed to clean but would really be going to see him and it's like.....why do you have to lie to me? it's your life...that's just rude and sketchy (not extremely importantjust fuel to the fire I guess)

she dated this guy like a year and a half almost two years ago and he was always a dick to me when would hangout and she would always take his side and leave, if we were all hanging out. We stopped talking because we were supposed to go on a double date and we were seeing my ex's play and at intermission before the currents closed he yelled ""GAAAAAAY"" and was on his phone huffing and puffing about being bored. They left at intermission, though we had plans to get drinks and just go have a good time. 

So, it's literally like July 3rd she's dropping me off at home and I'm like so when you wanna get together tomorrow and shes like, ""oh well Joe's been asking to take me on a date and so we were gonna do something tomorrow"" and I was like ""we have literally been talking about fourth of July for weeks, but ok"" and she was like, ""well I never said yes or no sooo"" and im just like ok whatever. 

Then she overslept and messed up their plans and mine cause we were supposed to go to the mall, so I was like well we can all just hang and see the fireworks. And she's giving me energy like I'm gonna make him uncomfortable or be rude or whatever because I had openly expressed I don't like him because he always treats me the same way and huffs and puffs every time we hang out. So naturally, I excitedly reassured her I was just trying to have a great time with my bud and if he was gonna be a part of it that was cool. 

I planned to see some of my friends playing music on the river because we were so late, I knew it wasn't gonna happen but remained hopeful for just a good day. 

We pick him up and he's already got a fucking attitude barely says hi, doesn't say anything the whole ride. Then he's like walking so far away from us and alternating between walking really far ahead of us and really far behind. Sulking and pouting and I'm slowly getting more and more frustrated but really trying to stay positive.

I smoked them up and bought us drinks. We finally get to the food trucks and he stops at the top of the hill, arms folded as.if he can't be bothered...I'm standing there waiting for them and by this point I feel like I'm the problem so I just go off on my own. Plus the lines are long so I'm just like fuck it. 

She comes up to me and is like I don't know what his deal is blah blah and I'm like yeah me either, but I want food from here so I'ma stand in line. 

Then theyre like dancing and skipping and laughing having a grand old time and I'm like ""y'all can just do your own thing"" and shes like ""oh he just has anxiety or whatever, it's not you, we can still hang out"" 
And by this point I'm pretty tipsy and hurt and just so over feeling like this I'm just like no, I'm over it. 

She then starts telling me I'm not being empathetic to her and the position that she is in and taking things too personlly and what is she supposed to do...

And then they left and we haven't talked since...

But like I missed seeing my friends play, I was still invitinft, trying to be inclusive to the dude I know doesn't like me for whatever reason....

136,"23/f I'm a communications lead for a local volunteer environmental organization. I do fairly well on my own, we have good relationships with other orgs online, good content. But I find that the best way I generate content is to scroll through our socials until i find something i can relate to the cause/ is important to our local politics etc. or just about our upcoming events or community events.  The team is currently working on a project, but I find it hard to get people motivated, feel like I'm the only one talking and some of these folks do awesome work for us, and others are brand new to all of this so i feel like its me. 

I'm wondering what i can do to get people to the level I'm at where I'm going through our socials constantly, and feel comfortable posting ( like ill retweet things from my main account to find them and share on the org's) the team is really only 4 people including myself but I feel like i need to be able to delegate tasks to people, but i need the posts to be well constructed/ garner attention and i feel like I'm not sure how to communicate how to do that without seeming redundant like ""use emoji's but well, and don't type out big blocks of type, break it up"". 

I just feel like people aren't like mega down to post on our socials and feel a little afraid about it. Or maybe as the lead this is just how is it, but i feel like sometimes too every meeting is like here are the things I'm doing. and i feel like others arent inspired by our socials? though i try and ask people a lot of questions of like what ideas do you have for this, or how do you think we could improve socials, and ask them to post weekly.

I guess I'm just not sure how to encourage people, we had some folks before who have since left who were really engaged with our socials and posting on them, so maybe this is just the people, not the medium?

137,"This is probably a dumb thing to talk about here, but I feel like I might get some great advice/guidance here.

Alright, so there's this fellow Muslim family that lives within the same neighborhood as me and they have become somewhat familiar with me because I constantly hang out in front of their neighbor's house(their neighbors are cool with me).

The problem is that I think they don't like me because I'm often hanging around the block, mainly just doing my tasbihs(it helps with my anxiety lol). Whenever I see them, I get an awkward vibe like maybe they feel uncomfortable about me being around. Some of the family members actually do greet me, most of them just ignore me lol.

I was thinking that maybe if I gift them with a box of sweets/mithai for Eid next week, it'll get rid of this awkwardness between us, they probably might feel a bit more comfortable with me. 

Would this be a wise thing to do or should I just leave it alone?

Hi,I'm very new to reddit so excuse for formatting and other mistakes.I'm sorry this is so long but please read.

I(15f) have a very controlling mother(M),she always guilt me into extra lessons and activities like piano,ballet,chess,etc. from the age of 5 to now.I hate sports and I'm not good at them at all,I like anime and cartoons and I'm also do very well academically without trying and since quarantine started I've mostly done nothing but watch movies and tv and go to my grandparents' and hang out with my grandma.

Since quarantine is ending and some of my lessons are not restarting for a good while she decided to enroll me and my younger sister(5f) into tennis lessons,i begged her not to and my sister didn't want to either but of course M talked her into it by telling her that she'd get nice athlete clothes and hats (she is very into sports and is tomboyish) but i don't want to go at all.

I'm not allowed to go out with friends or go anywhere without minimum 2 weeks notice and she always says no anyway so i don't even try and because we don't live in the safest neighbourhood i'm not even allowed outside so all i have to do is stay inside and scroll through the internet

I tried really hard to talk to her like an adult by asking why she wanted me to go,why should i have to even though i clearly was against it,what can i do to get out of it,etc. and her answers were consistently ""Becuase i said so"",""You don't do anything anways"" and my personal favourite ""No 15 year old stays on their computer all day,everyday""

(My boyfriend and I are madly in love, I know for a fact that my boyfriend loves me I have no doubt of that.)

I'm a really expressive person and I talk my feelings a lot especially when it comes to love, so I tell my boyfriend how much I love him a lot and sometimes I try to be romantic and say really deep stuff to show my true raw feeling.
Now my bf does tell me he loves me a lot but sometimes it feels like it lacks the feeling.
For example we have this cute fight on who loves each other the most, we usually end up saying both equally but a few times I asked him why does he live me the most and he either says because I do or because he lets me win.
I've tried to get an answer from him but it never goes deep.
Other example is earlier today; I had a big breakdown about something with my family and he helped me get through it and was incredibly helpful a few hours after I had calmed down and everything was going good I texted him telling him how amazing he is for me and how I feel lucky and his response was only I love you and (something that's an inside thing)

141,"I'm (16M) from India. I have been a bright student from the beginning. From the childhood, I was highly interested in quantum mechanics and astrophysics stuff. My dad was an enthusiast who exposed me to those fields. I've read a lot of articles from my childhood about that. Now I finished standard X. After X, I joined a JEE coaching centre. If you haven't heard about JEE, JEE ADVANCED is India's most famous entrance examination which is the way to join 'Indian Institutes of Technology'. It is considered as one of the hardest exams in the world in which about 1.3 million students compete for 11,279 seats. 

The JEE MAIN (for admission in NITs) coaching syllabus is pretty okay. But for finishing JEE ADVANCED, we have to study for 2 years continuous without a single entertainment thing. I feel like can't handle the pressure of the examination. I can't sleep at night. Something is preventing me from sleeping. I can't feel happiness. I can't enjoy the 14 hour raw study from textbooks. I can't happily write all the weekly exams and aim for the top 10. The pressure is on that If I sit idly for sometime, some other person will surpass me. I have to solve tons of problems within a day. I can't stay focused from the morning till night.

144,"A lot of events have happened so bear with me while I try to condense. My boyfriend (23) and I (20) have been together for a two years. We moved into our current apartment December of last year. Up until a few months ago, our relationship was like something out of a fairytale. Over the honeymoon phase, but it was still the best relationship I’d ever been in. Or so I thought.

It began when he started skipping work to sleep in. The first couple times he faked feeling sick, but now he doesn’t bother lying anymore. He’ll lie to his boss and sleep until 3pm. I’m in between jobs as of 6 weeks ago so he’s our main source of income temporarily, and with how often he misses work we are barely managing to pay the bills.

On top of that, he’s being an absolute jerk. We’ll be joking around, and he’ll insult me for saying OBVIOUSLY sarcastic and joke-y things. Said with a huge smile on my face, while laughing. For example, he’ll be complaining about something menial but making a huge fuss. I’ll say “Oh no, how will you ever go on if you take the trash out? It’s a cold, cold world out there.” and he’ll respond “At least I take the trash out while you only worry about yourself. You’re too selfish to do anything but sit on your ass while I pay the bills .” And then storm out and not talk to me for hours. I try to talk to him, ask him if he’d want me to get a part time job while I look for a full time job in my field, and he completely ices me out.

Another issue, he’ll ice me out if I’m not in the mood for sex. Worse than anything I’ve experienced. Even if I say yes, but tell him to pull out, he’ll shut down completely and tell me I’m “fucking stupid” and an “idiot” for wanting him to pull out. I’m on the pill, and he refuses to wear condoms, so I feel like this is a good compromise. Clearly, it’s not according to him. If it’s not sex on his terms, he doesn’t want it. Annnnnnd then turns around and makes me the bad guy because we haven’t had sex in “forever!” which in reality is a week.

Anything I want to do, even if I want him to come grocery shopping with me because I know I’ll be getting a lot of things for the month, he’ll say “No, I don’t want to. I’ve been WORKING all day unlike you. Someone’s gotta do something around here.” But he just plays video games all the time instead of ‘doing something around here.’

I’m absolutely at my wits end. I’m miserable all the time which makes things worse, because he wants me to be happy and listen and cater to him. It’s a vicious cycle that just keeps getting worse. I love him and I’ve hoped for so long that he would turn his life around on his own. I’m tired of being the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in our relationship. Even when I try to sit down and have a mature conversation, I always end up apologizing and comforting him because I was upset about something he did or said, and “it made him feel like an asshole”. Should I just say fuck it and leave, or give him some more time to see if he does the right things?",27Jul2020,1
145,"ever since i graduated this year (and even before then), i thought about all the things i could do with my life day and night. i’ve spent too much time thinking about my aspirations and passions in life. 

for context, here’s all the things i’ve always wanted to do: become a doctor, a tattoo artist, a professional ballerina, an architect, a teacher, a professor, a youtuber, an animal rescuer/ foster parent, a police officer, a police sketch artist, a detective, a writer, a painter, a firefighter, a boxer, a graphic novelist, a pilot, an actor, an animator, a person who helps the elderly, a dentist, an IT gal, a gamer, a real estate agent, and a therapist. 

basically, what i really want out of a career is something i can focus on, help people, be physically active, be a problem solver, and express myself creatively. which are really hard to mash together. i know there’s a difference between hobbies and careers. my heart wants all of these life paths, and i know i could do any of them. 

i know this is a lot. please, any advice at all is very much welcome. how do i choose without spreading myself out too thin? also, i know i have a lot of time ahead of me, but i want to accomplish as much as possible in life so i can live up to be the person i imagined when i was a young girl in a broken home. thank you ahead of time.",27Jul2020,1

147,"\[Advanced apology for my multitude of questions, I'm just trying to be concise with this post and I have **no** idea what I'm doing when it comes to relationships\]

While at work, I met someone and we talk whenever he comes in- which, since we've started talking, is almost every day since around the beginning of last week. We have exchanged numbers, however, I have a few questions regarding this.

My main concerns are: are we going too fast, and does he think I'm interested in him since I gave him my phone number? I also don't know what a crush feels like, so is there is a possibility I am into him? I don't want to lead him on or confuse things- should I ask him about this or should I leave it alone?

151,"Hello. For some clarification, I’m 20 and have currently been dealing with a really scary and debilitating gender identity crisis (I think I’m MTF rather than a cis male). I have always felt like this for years but it’s gotten to a really dark point these past few months and I’m not sure how to feel. I go through long stages of denial but deep down I know how I truly feel on the inside.

Anyways, I was hanging out with one of my friends over the weekend who happens to be MTF. Given that we’re both stoners, we smoked a lot this weekend. I have a decent weed tolerance so I didn’t expect to get paranoid or have a bad trip but that’s exactly what happened.

While I was paranoid from the weed, she kept sitting down next to me on the couch trying to calm me down. Everything was going okay until suddenly, I looked into her eyes and felt these loud inner voices in my head telling me things like “Whenever you look at her you know you want the life she has” or things like “You know your parents won’t accept you like they did with her” and I immediately started freaking the fuck out. I moved to the other couch and tried to focus on the TV but whenever I would look at her, the voices taunting me and my emotions got even louder and I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.

Now that I’m home, I’ve taken some time to question the emotions I was feeling during a bad trip. Considering my friend knows about my gender identity crisis and confusion very well, I feel like I could go to her for advice. However, I don’t want to make her feel bad considering none of it was her fault and it was just my paranoia getting the worst of me. I care about her feelings way too much for her to feel like she’s responsible for me having a paranoid episode about my gender identity.",27Jul2020,1

154,"Hello Reddit,

I have been working at a large grocery store chain for the last 4 months as a cashier. I was initially working 30-40 hours per week and being scheduled any day of the week pretty much. Recently, school has started back up for me and I now only work Saturdays and Sundays (16 hours per week now). This is because my school schedule consists of me being on campus Monday - Friday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The store I work at opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 8:00 p.m everyday. So, working during the morning clearly isn't possible and I'd rather reserve the time I have after I get out of school to focus on studying, preparing for tests, doing homework, etc, hence why I decided to only work on Saturdays and Sundays. 

The first reason (x) I am considering quitting my job is because of the workload I have for school. The program that I am in is a 2 year degree being condensed into 15 months. There is also no option to be a part time student (not that I'd want to be part time anyways because I want to complete this program ASAP). So, I am taking 4 classes where I am taking exams each week for each class. Literally, every week I have an exam in each of my classes. That's on top of any other assignments, homework and studying I need to do. Btw, I am in a veterinary program where the work is pretty tough at least in my opinion it's not easy. I'm not struggling at all in terms of my performance at school, however 5 days a week at school and working 2 days a week leaves me with no days off. It is honestly draining and I feel like I have to spend more of my time studying and prepping for school to make up for the lost time I spend at work. I am conflicted because on one hand I just started working this job 4 months ago so I feel bad quitting so early. On the other hand I'm just wondering if it's worth putting myself through work at the moment. I (20F) live with my parents who don't make me pay rent, bills or anything at all. So, I have no financial responsibilities. All of the money I make is pretty much ""spending money"". However, most of the money I have made I have saved up as I hardly ever spend it unless it's on something I need. The money I have will last me well over the rest of my time in the program which is until the end of next year. 

The second reason (y) I am considering quitting my job is because of a recent experience with being sexually harassed/assaulted by a coworker. I was being harassed by a coworker since I first started working at my job (I mean as early as my second week working). A couple weeks ago this coworker went on to assault me (which was caught on surveillance footage). I told my supervisor and store manager to which an investigation was launched and this coworker was then fired. The way that the investigation happened (such as interviewing people around the workplace) combined with the fact that my job is a smaller store meant that literally everyone working there found out about it. I had a coworker tell me that it was ""really big news"", and another coworker was relaying a conversation they had with someone else to which she said ""cause of course we were all talking about it"". I don't know it kind of just rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel humiliated and is part of the reason why I was hesitant to come forward. It's uncomfortable going to work knowing that everyone knows about what happened. But also that my experience with being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted seems like a form of entertainment to a lot of people. In my opinion, instances of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault, especially instances that have been proven through investigation, are not grounds for speculation or people trying to interject their opinions/conclusions on what happened. It's honestly taking a mental toll on me. Not just the stress from work and school, but that I have to face people who have treated my experience with disrespect. 

I'm wondering how I'm going to look if I was to quit after 4 months. Not only due to the short amount of time that I've been working but also if quitting so early is going to affect me in the future. Retail and the veterinary field obviously have nothing to do with each other, and I have ""job security"" through the program I am currently in, but if I put that on my resume that I quit after 4 months would that raise red flags with my future employer? Also, putting in my two weeks notice I'm pretty sure people are going to say things about how I'm quitting so soon and will start speculating on that, which is just adding more stress to the previous incident. I could also just ride it out an extra couple of months but I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. Any advice on what I should do?",27Jul2020,1

*Hospitals refusing to accept patients. 
*emergency services not coming to you if you have symptoms of covid
*government reporting fake numbers
*not any action taken to stop pandemic
  First is first hospitals refusing to accept patients just because there is not enough doctors and nurses. My mom works at hospital as a gynaecologist and recently she have caught this virus from patient, not only she, whole hospital was infected as well. While they have waited for test results( it took about 5 days) almost half of out city got infected. Still officials not reported any case related to our city. Several deaths and everyone hospitalised at their home they taking all medicine by themselves and doing whatever they can. No instructions provided.
 Second thing is emergency services such as ambulance is refusing to come to ill persons home even If it’s serious.
 Government made some rules about quarantine, however everything is still working, shops, markets. Most of people not wearing masks.

Long story short, my 34 year old brother is in multiple organ failure and is currently in a hospital in Ft Lauderdale. 

He was just out here in my state, back in May, when he came to visit with my grandma 6 days before she passed away. 

My grandma, and him, are the only blood family I had. Our real dad hasn’t been around for our entire lives; but we do have step sisters. They found me a few days ago to fill me in on what was happening. 

I was able to set up a gofundme, to help raise money to be able to get across the country. Due to Covid, I have lost my job and money has been tight , as it has been for everyone. 

I’m not posting to ask for donations, I guess I’m mainly curious as to what to do when I get there. I can’t afford to rent a car. I’ve never been to that city, let alone state and I’m going by myself. A young female. 

I’m not sure, and I really doubt the hospital will allow me to stay overnight with him, or even in their lobby if I can’t afford a hotel. Half of the gofundme I’ve gotten, I sent to my step sisters so they can stay a few days until I get there. 

Any locals nearby that can give tips on cheap, but safe hotels/motels in the area of the airport and hospital? He’s being entered into hospice and tmrow I will know more as to where they are moving him to.

158,"I haven't realized it until recently, but music's been a huge part of my life and I love it. I spend 90% of the day humming songs I like or humming songs that I make up as I go. I tap my fingers and hands against my legs while I hum to keep a beat. I played multiple instruments and I loved it. I pay attention to the music in the video games I play and the shows I watch. 

I've tried researching majors for universities about music and it seems that the majors are only for people planning to be professional musicians or soloists.

164,"I’ve (19f) been best friends with this girl (19f) since we we’re in the 3rd or 4th grade. About a year ago she moved to Germany during a period of time we weren’t on speaking terms for a few months over something that was dumb, it was first we’ve ever had an actual fight but it was really just because of the fact i was at a point in my life where I had a wall up where if anyone wronged me in any way i would immediately cut them off like it was nothing. Right before i temporarily ended our friendship she was secretly dating a guy Bill (20-22m). Not his real name but that’s besides the point. Bill lives in Germany, they long distanced, since we live in the US, while simultaneously dating a boy in our city (which if Bill ever found out he would break up with her instantly). When our senior year ended, she up and visited her boyfriend in Germany, broke up with her boyfriend in our city, and not long after moved in with Bill. After a few months of living there her and i reached out to each other and rekindled our relationship. Ever since she and I had started talking, there has been countless instances where she has called me crying about the terrible things he will say. He constantly gaslights her, making her feel as any negative emotion she feels is delusional, over emotional, and sensitive; so much that she believes it, to a point. He doesn’t want her to dye her hair (and this is including just highlights), paint her nails certain colors, and wearing certain clothes. Although the doesn’t say he won’t allow her, it’s heavily insinuated there will be a huge problem if it happens. She cooks the most, and she cleans the most, with no recognition. He destroys her confidence in many ways and one of them being that he simply hates the fact he’s not with a jewish woman, because he’s half jewish. He also feels the need to control her every action, even the small things. For example, she called me crying because Bill made her read the cover letter of her resume over and over and over and OVER again because she wasn’t pausing long enough between sentences. One time she was cleaning the room and Bill told her to close the window, but she wanted to finish picking up the clothes so she didn’t do it the exact instant, so he made her drop everything and close the window. Not to mention he has an extreme addiction to porn and cant seem to control his urges to do drugs. 

She has no one in Germany, she’s depressed, has never been single since 7th-8th grade because she’s desperate for validation which is understandable, but she doesn’t know who she is without patching into any man that shows her attention. She knows if she chooses to break up with Bill that I would immediately buy her a plane ticket to come live with me and get her out of there, because I love her more than blood, but she’s the type of person to take someone’s shit until she just can’t anymore. It could take years. And i don’t want to out right tell her to leave him because she’s a very gentle person. I don’t know what to do to help her and give her gentle nudges to eventually leave him.

My girlfriend (27 F)  and I (22 M) recently broke up.  She and I were pretty messed up about it and it was still fresh. Last night I picked her up from a gas station close to her moms after calling me and balling her eyes out. I ended up comforting her for the next couple hours. She ended up telling me it was about how she was so sick of her mom being in the abusing relationship she was in to the point she totally flipped out on the man. Long story short she let him and everyone know what she had to think about it. 

Fast forward to when she was ready to go inside, I asked if she wanted me to stay the night at her place to comfort and talk more. I was met with a “No. I’m okay, I need to start learning to do things without you”. I was a little shocked to hear because I had a feeling she did want me there. After a few more “are you sure?”, I hugged her and told her if she needs anything don’t hesitate to call. She went on her way. Shortly after going inside her home took a whole Costco size of Benadryl and called her dad to tell him that she loves him and everything. He knew something was off and headed over to her house. She ended up collapsing hours later. 

Fast forward to tonight, I get the call from her father about her being in the ICU. I was in shock, dropped to me knees and cried. I really don’t know how to navigate this situation.

They text me constantly during that time, and if I don't reply within a minute they spam me. I didn't (ever) have a boyfriend until this summer and as soon as they found out my dad encouraged me to break up with him to focus on music and summer work. I eventually did for several reasons, but the main one being how my parents were so strict, constantly monitoring my texts with him.

To this day, I've still never gotten drunk, or tried any drugs. My friends who get invited to parties have done all that and I feel kinda jealous because anytime I get invited my parents want me to bring them in to meet their parents. This is so embarrassing that I just don't go.

Though I broke up with my boyfriend, I still talk to him and we still have feelings for each other, but can't be together because of my parents. He's on vacation right now and getting drunk every night. He always texts me drunk and buzzed on Nic and I get so irritated. I always tell him to shut up about the drugs, it's not impressive and I could care less. But honestly I just feel jealous that he's having the time of his life with his friends and his parents dont mind that he's getting into that kind of stuff. Eventually, though he love bombs me when he's drunk, I just say night, hours before I actually go to sleep. I just get so upset to see him having such an easy time.

my home life is honestly horrible and I know I shouldn't blame him, but I feel resentment that his parents let him do whatever and my dad monitors everything I do: piano, video games, phone calls, homework. I just need a breath of air and I can't get that.",27Jul2020,1
182,"First, some background. My mom has always had strict dating rules. Some are: 1) You can't date until you're 16. 2) You can't be in a house with the person you're dating unless there are adults present. 3) You can't be in your room with the person you're dating, even if you have other people in the room with you and the door is open. 4) You have to ask Mom before asking anyone out, and she has to know the person first. 

So, when I was 14 (I'm 16 now), my best friend (F) and I realized we had mutual feelings for each other. We knew we liked each other, but we did not start dating. 

One night, my mom went through my phone because I was ""acting different"" and read my conversations with F and realized we liked each other. She reminded me of Dating Rule #1. Then she put restrictions on my phone so that it would shut off at 9pm (10 on weekends) until 6am every day (I had been staying up until 2 or 3am talking to F, so maybe this was reasonable). 

Months later, F and I decided that we wanted to date. I told my mom. My mom said nothing. For the record: I was 15 by this point, and my sister had been given an exception to Rule #1 and was allowed to start dating at 15. I figured my mom wouldn't care if I did the same. She already knew F, but I did not ask my mom before I asked F out. 

Fast forward another month, F and I are at a party. We kiss for the first time. Then we kiss a lot more.

My mom found out that F and I kissed and she flipped out. She said she had never been okay with me dating F and I had crossed a line by sneaking away and kissing F (another 'for the record', F and I had never been on a date because my mom refused to let me be alone with F, so it's not like we were really dating. However at the party, Friend and I did sneak away to be alone. Another piece of relevant information that I don't have a place for: Friend and I had spent the night at each other's houses several times before we were dating, but after we knew we liked each other. I swear on my life that nothing 'happened' at said sleepovers. My mom was (understandably) upset about this as well though).

This fight lasted several days. Eventually my mom told me she needed a break and my dad would pick me up at the end of the day and I'd be staying at his house for a while.

I packed light because I thought I'd only be gone for a few days (I ended up being gone for a month). Before I left my mom's, I had to take out all my electronics and make sure my mom knew all my passwords so she could look through my accounts. While I was gone, I had no phone or computer or TV, and very little extra entertainment because I had packed less than a week's worth of stuff. I don't have anything at my dad's house because I'm only there 4 days a month usually. I have no friends in my dad's neighborhood because I'm never there, and this was over the summer, so I wasn't seeing friends at school.

While I was gone, I was made to believe that I had been sent away for good reason; that I had done something very bad and they were going easy on me. I was allowed to go back to my mom's after agreeing to see a therapist who reinforced the idea that I had done something worth the level of punishment I got. This all really took a toll on me. I don't think I can even explain the level of hurt and hopelessness and self-loathing I felt that summer, so I am not going to try. But know it was there, and still is sometimes.

I ended up not having a phone for 4 months total, and seeing the therapist for 7 months total. I had to apologize to my mom and dad, but I never (to this day) got an apology from them. F and I dated for 10 months total, the first 3 of which we had no contact. We were allowed to start going on real dates 1 month before we broke up.

Since then, I've believed that I was 100% in the wrong. But lately I've been so mad at my mom. That seemed like such a huge overreaction- and to make it seem like I did something horrible enough to constitute being kicked out and forced to therapy is insane to me. It seems like dating and kissing at 15 is normal. But I still have doubt because it was drilled into me that I was wrong. So basically, what I'm asking is, did I deserve that? Was that a rational response?",27Jul2020,1
183,"I'm 13 and its all gonna sound like some edgy stuff, but I'm really lost.

Today I proposed to my family that we all have dinner together, have my uncle come over and hang out, but my grandfather who can barely walk, my uncle who rebelled against society his whole life, and my father, and it was all my idea, it makes me feel like I caused it, that I somehow hurt everyone.

Later on I was playing on a minecraft server with my friends, and I exploited as a joke and the owner, who is a good friend was really mad and disappointed, and it feels like I hurt him, and that there is no way to apologize.

And I guess what you would call the ""cherry on top"", I went to see an old friend because I was lonely and sad, and they ended up getting really mad and threatening to give my address away and come and harass me, I cant even call the police because they will look at discord DMs and it will show what I really do during the day to my parents, and then they will hate me, but if I don't then they will just do it and its gonna happen anyways.

184,"So I am F21 and my dad is M47. When he was younger, he did harder drugs such as meth, and whatever else you can probably think of. He has long since gotten his crap together (that I know of.. he could be doing something I am unaware of but I give him the benefit of the doubt) but he also smokes pot, just to lay that out there. 

He has gotten very paranoid over these past few years, especially after losing his son/my brother. He constantly thinks people are stealing things out of his car, taking anything, messing with him, lying to him, etc. when there has been no given proof of anything. 
Someone also murdered his dog which I believe set him over the edge. I’m not sure if he’s been hearing voices or anything of that nature, but I know he needs help. I’m not sure how to handle this as his daughter but I love him very much and his behavior has taken its toll on our family. Any advice on how to help my dad be less paranoid would be appreciated.",27Jul2020,1

186,Hey everyone new here. So I need some advice obviously. This might be long. So I've been living in the st louis area for awhile now. I moved here with my ex whom I have a daughter with. Well we separated a few years ago but keep in touch for our kid. Well I got myself a apartment a ok job and a car. I met another women who I spent a year and some change with. Long story short I made some bad financial decisions and she got tired of it and left me. Well that put me in a depressed state of mind. I am still trying to get back into a better place financially.  So I called my mom and she wants me to move back home until i get back on my feet. I figured this would help so I can pay off debt go to school etc. I'm 28 so I find moving back into my moms would be embarrassing.  But I've been away from my family for a long time with maybe 2 visits in the last 8 years or so. I'm homesick and miss them. The complicated part is leaving my kid. She would stay here in Missouri with her mom for school and I'd get her during the summer and of course visit when I can. I spoke to her mom even told her I was depressed and she said maybe leaving st louis would help some. She said she wouldn't put me on child support as long as I do help out when I get stable back home. I am in now way abandoning my daughter. It would be very hard leaving her but I feel like it could be a good decision bettering my life which in store would better her future.  Her mom.said shed be well taken care of and she wouldn't let me not see her. I'm just stuck on what to do. I already lost a great relationship because of my struggles.  But I've been on my own here doing what I can.,27Jul2020,1
188,ever since quarantine and Covid my boyfriend has stopped talking to me and it honestly seems like he doesn’t care. i have asked him to care more and he promises he will but then only does it for a day or two. i have been trying for months now but to no prevail. i really love him but when i asked him if he still cares he said he does. what should i do?,27Jul2020,1
190,"TLDR: i’m moving out soon with my bf and three friends. i’m the only college student of all of us, with all of them either having full time jobs or trying to get them. my bf makes around 3 times as much as I will likely be making between working and money from my school from scholarships. I want to ask my bf to possibly negotiate our split of rent, but what would be reasonable to ask? And what could I do around the house to make up for the pay difference (like chores, etc)? 

I am planning on moving into a house with four others (my bf and I in one room, another couple in the other, and my best friend in the third). we’re all fine with this arrangement, as it is helpful for all of our current budgets. I’m the youngest of the four of us and the only one who’s in college still, so I have the lowest income of us all. i’m also the only one who isn’t currently living with parents so i’m already paying rent, so I don’t have anywhere near as much in savings as they do bc i’ve had to pay a lot of my own expenses for a while now. 

we’re looking to find a new place hopefully by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. So far, my bf and one of the friends have very well paying full time jobs. my friend is working but about to try to switch to working full time. me and one other friend aren’t working, i dont have one because I had to have surgery recently that made me incapable of working. we’re likely going to move out once we get jobs again. 

my bf is perfectly fine if the place costs a bit more. he can easily afford it, as can the other friend who works full time, and so would both other friends if they switch to full time work. If the place is too expensive, though, i’ll be the only one at a disadvantage for moving out. I think the current plan is to evenly split the rent between us five, but I don’t think it’s necessarily fair for me if we go for a more costly place bc i’ll be spending everything I make on rent and groceries. 

i’ve considered asking my bf if we could split the rent up differently between us two. I will be lucky if I can work 15-20 hours a week, and I get a refund from school (which is what i’ve been using for rent). my bf makes probably 3 times as much as i’ll have between working and the money from school. what is a reasonable amount to ask for on a split? i’ve offered to do more chores for us if he pays more on things we’d be sharing, but would it be reasonable to ask him to pay a bit more on rent since he makes so much more? and if so, what would be something I could offer to do more around the house in exchange?",27Jul2020,1
192,"So, it’s been maybe a month, but one day my brother messaged my Dad asking about his opinion on Trump. And we’ve been Republicans for a while, and even though we don’t always agree with his behavior, we support what Republicans stand for. Or at least my parents do. I’m still on the fence because I still don’t know a lot about politics. 

Anyways, so my Dad says his opinion and says he supports Trump, and I think basically stated what I said here, and then my brother replied with a “how could you say that?” and  “I’m not talking to you anymore”. 

And that was it. 

My Dad adores my brother. We don’t see him everyday because he lives a few hours away, but when we do, it’s the highlight of my Dad’s week. 

Since then, my Dad has tried messaging him over and over but to no avail. My brother is deaf, so messaging and face-timing are the only two options. 

I should also mention that even though I call him my brother, he’s only my half brother. Which means my Dad was previously married to another woman and had a son before he met my mother. So my Dad and my half brothers Mom have talked it over and came to the conclusion that my decision brother will just have to figure it out himself. 

However, my Dad is very heartbroken and angry. Every time we have a discussion with friends and family who don’t know the situation with my Dad and Brother, my Dad will bring it up, and then get more angry.

I’ve briefly talked with my brother about it and he replied saying that he will talk to Dad again when he’s ready. 

It’s all been strange because usually my brother isn’t the type to lash out or ignore people completely. He likes to handle things head-on, and complete them right away. I often wonder if the stress of his job has gotten to him (he’s a mail man, which is very labor intensive). 

Every few days my Dad will ask if my Brother has messaged me. And I never know what to say. Because I’m well aware that my Dad is hurt and I know he’s aware that we still talk here and there. Because when I reply “yes”, he will have that look on his face and say something like “well, at least he talks to you”. 

I just know this has got to end somewhere. Because it’s been a MONTH, and not only is my Dad miserable, but it’s really taken a toll on him. He’s a lot moodier now and will drag my Mom and I down with him if he’s having a bad day. He isn’t getting much sleep or eating as well either. 

I don’t know who to turn to about this.

I cry every night without talking to my mom or brothers cause I feel that will make them upset, and I don’t want them to worry all because of me.

194,"I’m deciding what to do about college. I want to be a theatre major (dangerous, I know) and I’ve sort of got 2 options. What I’ve found to be my dream school, and the place closest to home

Pros for dream school: dream school! Theatre program is amazing and their alumni list is pretty impressive

Cons for dream school: FAR from home (and I mean about 500 miles far, very very expensive, I’d have to leave my friends and family for months, also to go far away in this COVID world is quite terrifying as most classes are going hybrid/online and many events I’ve been looking forward to are canceled. As a theatre major I’d be in many plays, but all plays are canceled.

Pros for closeby place: MUCH Cheaper, I’d get to stay home, essentially I’d be in about $50,000 less debt

cons for closeby place: would force me to stay and live at home, I’d lose my shot at my dream school and possibly my dream as the closeby place doesn’t necessarily have an impressive alumni list, still in this COVID world is any of college worth it?

as easy as it would be to ask you to make this decision FOR me I know that’s not really possible. Does anybody have some words of advice?

I know one thing: if I should go to the dream school and it doesn’t work out after 1 or 2 semesters then I could always come home and just continue education at the other place. But I don’t really have the same option should I choose to go to the closeby place for a few semesters and then decide to go to the dream school.

 Should I give dream school a shot for 1 semester and see how it goes? Is it worth it in this COVID world to go into so much debt and receive less of an experience? But it’s my dream school. 

Also, my family could afford me going to the closer place much more and I’d be in almost no debt. But it’s not my dream school and I’d be giving up an amazing chance.

197,"Ever since I was little, I had constantly been ditched by so called ""friends"". Every time I try to make a friend in school, the relationship would just fall apart. It's like everything I do, I mess up. And since I thought I was some worthless girl who messed everything up, my self esteem lowered so much to the point of depression. And honestly, my thoughts were very twisted back then. I used to think that depression would make me happy again and make friends. It didn't help that my parents didn't care about my friend issues, or that I looked like a mess back then because I was too lazy to care for myself. This quarantine only made me feel worse.

I started to rely on online friends because it was just so much easier to make friends online that couldn't judge you for your looks. I'd made some very good friends online. They were caring and really nice. Or so I thought. This one guy I met decided to tease me for depression, and that's one stab in the heart. My online ""best friend"" unfriended me and never talked to me again. That's two. I meet some other boy and his friends, who hate me enough to spread rumors about me to other friend groups. That's probably four; it hurt me most.

You would think I learned my lesson. **Nope.** I was so stubborn that I kept looking for more friends. More people to hurt me. And I just kept at it for that temporary happiness I don't get as a lonely only child. Looking for more friends online, more ""friends"" to hurt me, more hate. My world really is breaking apart right now, because my dumb self thought I'd find a real friend. *Online.* Now, I came to that realization that I must not make a single friend anymore. I must isolate myself. Yet.. I feel so alone, and I'm just so desperate to fill this weird emptiness in my heart. What should I do...?",27Jul2020,1
198,"For many years I've been depressed followed by anxiety. I've never understood why because I'm a fairly happy, positive, free-spirited 31 year old female. It really never made much sense to me except now what I realized is that my environment has never changed.

Due to Covid-19 a lot of us have been able to sit back and watch things play out in slow motion. Since March many of us from the NY/NJ area had mandatory lock down and curfew. 

The summer came and life opened back up with social distancing. I was able to see friends and enjoy life again. Going out on the weekends and staying out reasonably no later than 10PM. I'm a homebody anyway. Either way I guess it was too much for my parents that while I'm out I get texts stating that im worst than a man for going out and they are ashamed to look at me. 

Seems harsh and dramatic but it's always been like that for years. I call it mental manipulation and emotionally/verbal abuse. What does that even mean to be worst than a man? As a woman, why am I even being compared to a man? Is that saying man can go out but woman can't?

 It was an instant trigger causing me to be depressed again. Making me feel bad about myself and them constantly praying to God to control who I am and fix my ""wrongs"". Like I'm doing something wrong. Mind you I did absolutely nothing wrong but mentally they made me feel bad for simply being myself. Doing what normal people do. Like socializing with society.

Going out to the beach with friends, hiking, riding bikes at the park, it's all considered bad. They put so much anxiety in my heart that I go back to square one feeling trapped with no confidence. I'm constantly feeling miserable and trapped inside of my own soul. Their plan worked because I'm terrified of going out there and being on my own. 

I've always felt alone in this world but I know that isolation can make you feel depressed and depression can make you feel isolated. I'm just so sad that I need to vent. Writing this at 12AM because I can't sleep. Writing helps and I write often but I need to make bigger changes. Typing this as tears fall down my eyes I'm tired.

Yes I still live at home. It's cultural and once again a way for society to control and set woman back. I can tell you my brother was treated much differently. No I'm not Asian/Indian nor muslim but the way society tends to treat us (women) is no different. I feel trapped but its all mental because I could be free.

I've held the same job for 10 years, make around $60K a year. No debt, car paid off, loans paid off. Which I've paid all on my own. I'm very responsible and have always taken care of my bills. I must say I'm very frugal and like to save. I don't ask anyone, especially my parents for anything.

I'm not a drug addict, alcoholic, never been in trouble or jail (not judging).Why am I treated this way? This is no way to live and being called names over years and being treated this way has taken its last toll on my mental.

I pray and hope I find my way out of this cycle. I didn't realize my own ""home"" was killing my soul. I have stories for days but glad I could let this one out. I needed to vent. This is an advice post so any and all advice welcomed. Thanks for reading.

199,"So i’m really at a loss here. I’ve been seeing this guy recently, only a few months and it’s been going pretty great so far. Only slight red flag is that he kind of smells like body odor but he’s very attractive and extremely sweet and we always have a great time together. But here’s the issue, I was up in the desert with some of my friends in their vacation home and I decided to invite him on the last night we were there to see how he is in social settings and just to have a great time and hang out with him. We all played a little beer pong and a card game and none of us really got that drunk except him. In the middle of the card game he disappeared for 30 min I assumed he was in the bathroom but he busts through the front door leaving it wide open and going straight for the bathroom. Turns out he had just been passed out in front of his car all that time. 
     He was in the bathroom for about 45 min before I checked on him and when I did, he was passed out in the bathtub with throw up in the toilet which happens to the best of us. Figured he’d get sick some more so I left him in the bathtub until I went to bed.
    When I went to bed, I went to go get him and he had thrown up all over himself. I got him up and told him to strip so I could give him a shower and he took everything off but his pants. He really needed a shower but just wouldn’t take his pants off so I had to wash him at the sink and then I put him to bed. 
    I checked on him once through the night and it smelled foul in the room he was in and I figured he had just thrown up in the trash can in there since I hadn’t seen any throw up on the floor. 
   When  I went to use the restroom in the morning there was poop all over the toilet seat as if someone had poop on their cheeks and sat on it... and I guess that is exactly what happened. I found his underwear in the bathroom trash. 
    When he woke up he pretended nothing happened and just said he got super fucked up and laughed it off but I really didn’t find it funny because that was the first impression my friends had of him and also I had to spend like half an hour cleaning him up when he isn’t even my boyfriend. I confronted him and told him how he threw up on himself and I had to clean him and that I was embarrassed and disappointed and he had no idea It was that bad and he’s extremely apologetic and trying to make it up to me but I just feel like itd be so hard to look past that and I felt it was way too soon for something like that to happen.

I’m currently trying my best to train my new puppy and it’s been a rough time. Whenever my pup and I are outside and my cousin happens to be too (at night) he’ll run up to her out of the dark and scares the shit out of her. So now every time my pups outside she’s constantly barking and worried. This also isn’t the only rule he won’t follow in regards to my puppy, just the worst currently.

He won’t do anything I ask him to do. If I need help with something he’ll do everything to get out of it. I live with my mom and grandparents and it’s the same situation. We can’t get anything out of him. I hate being angry with him because I know he’s doing his own thing but just a few tasks every once in a while.

201,"I was originally gonna ask one of the LGBT subs but I figured this would be a better place to get the more mainstream opinion. 

Basically, I have a weird relationship with gender. I'm an afab lesbian, but I also identify as nonbinary/agender. My gender presentation is kinda all over the place. I don't shave, I have short hair, and I sometimes wear layered sports bras to act as a binder. I also really mix up the terminology I use, I like to semi-jokingly refer to myself as a ""pretty boy"" or ""soft boy"", but I don't like certain other masculine terms like ""man"". In other aspects of my presentation I'm more feminine, I like dresses and skirts and am a big fan of the color pink. I use feminine terms for myself pretty often as well. 

I identify as agender because I don't really see these traits as being connected to any specific gender, they're just aspects of who I am. So essentially I don't really have a gender identity. The thing about pronouns is that none of them really feel right, even they/them seems to suggest something in the middle of the spectrum, whereas I view my identity as divorced from the spectrum entirely. 

So essentially I wanna use no pronouns. I go by a single syllable nickname so I figure it wouldn't be too hard to sub that in for the pronoun. The thing I'm wondering is whether or not this is reasonable? Would you be willing to use someone's name in place of a pronoun? Would it stand out more or less than using they/them? What about in comparison to neo-pronouns like ze/zir? Do you think I'm acting like a special snowflake cringelord? Lemme know :)",27Jul2020,1

Ever since then I have had severe health anxiety.
Also there was a time when I was very young that I went to Florida to visit my grandparents and my grandmother was very sick and she was very skinny and unable to do things for herself anymore.

I'm not sure if it did something to my nervous system from the meth or if it's a product of when I was younger or what the underlying factors of it is or if it's just apart of my OCD. 
Every single day, at some point, I feel like there is something wrong with me. I feel like I can feel organs, soreness. I feel like I have something wrong with my knees. Even after blood tests and scans. 
I am driving myself crazy and my quality of life is diminishing. 
This hypochondria is becoming DEBILITATING. 
I have been on medication on and off my whole life and it has only ever been a crutch to me and I always end up taking myself off of them because I don't think that they do enough for me for it to be worth it.
Unfortunately for anxiety and depression there is just antidepressants unless you want to get dependent on benzos.
I really don't want to be on medication; although I don't really know what to do. I'm very afraid of side effects and dependency and weight gain because I fluctuated with weight throughout my life and I'm at a point right now where I don't feel bad about myself all that much weight wise.
I'm also losing my insurance next month and I need to figure all of that out.. 
I do smoke marijuana daily but I even cut down my intake on that because sometimes when I smoke I become more aware of my body.
I truly appreciate answers and was wondering if anybody has any similarities to my situation and what was done to eliminate fears and feelings..
I'm also open to hear about anyone on any kind of medication and what the med is and what they're experience with it is..  
Please help me. I feel dead inside. I feel truly mentally ill.",27Jul2020,1

I feel tired and worn out every day, stomach issues so i’m on the toilet at least every hour, I am extremely weak with no muscle whatsoever and I have NO MONEY. I can’t find any type of work near me in my small southern town that I would be even remotely capable of doing. I’m extremely depressed and it dosent take much for me to burst into tears. I look around and people have money nice homes and things they enjoy money in their bank accounts and I have nothing but a old trailer that i bought after i inherited a small amount at 18. I just want a good life but it’s all so out of reach for me it just gets worse and worse im crying as i’m writing this I have nobody no friends nearby I just sit alone broke and depressed every day at home. Even if i got a part time job at mcdonald’s or something i’d only be bringing home 100 something a week that’s not nearly enough it wouldn’t even be worth it. It’d just be spent on fuel to get there and back. I don’t know what to do I don’t know how to move up in life I feel trapped in a dark corner and I honestly can’t wait until it’s all over one day.

206,"So I have this friend and I'll call her Ava. Ava and I are both 14 and have been pretty close friends for the past 2 ish years. Sometimes tho, Ava will make kinda mean remarks like saying ""get less fat"" or poking my arms and saying theyre fat or whatever. Obviously she says this in context but I dont want to go all into specific examples. I am not overweight for my age and height, but I do deal with body dysmorphia especially as a ballet dancer so these remarks hurt. She also used to deal with anorexia and bulimia so I would think that she would know better even tho she doesnt know that I struggle as well. What should I say to her next time she says something like this? I dont want to tell her that i have body dysmorphia but I do want her to understand that what she is saying hurts.

214,"My (18f) friend (17m) came out to his parents about a month ago. They did NOT take it well. We live in a very small town, full of very religious and very intolerant people. His parents made him quit his job, they took his phone and car, cut out all worldly contact and have been keeping him in his room all day. They are forcing him to attend online school “until he proves himself”. 

The only way he is able to contact me is with an old phone he held on to that they don’t know about. We only talk every week or so as he can’t always get away with messaging me. This week, he told me his parents were dead set on sending him to conversion therapy. I know he is so strong and has been through so much, and he tells me he can handle himself, but conversion therapy is so rough and a lot of people don’t make it out quite right. I’m so worried for my friend. I have offered several times to help him out by letting him stay here but he is refusing and saying he is going to ride it out instead. He told me he had done some research and came to the conclusion that he needs a car and a phone (both of which his family pays for) to be self-sufficient. 

So, what can I do for my friend? Is there any way I can help him? Is he going to have to ride this out or is there something we can do?",27Jul2020,1

I have a very edgy sense of humor. I like to make jokes about messed up things. I make a lot of discriminatory jokes against different races, genders, LGBTQ+, etc. These have always remained jokes and i have never actually believed these things i say up until about now. I have been making a lot of jokes against Jews. That is not a problem, but what is a problem is that i feel i am starting to actually dislike Jews. I seem to have a negative view towards Jews and the Jewish religion. I dont want to become some sort of neo-Nazi, but i also dont want to stop having my sense of humor. When i make jokes about other races and peoples, i dont believe them, this is just something that has been happening with jokes about Jews.

217,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. So In college I was having a very rough time. I come from a very abusive family and had a history sex abuse. My mother was extremely controlling and did not allow me to have friends in high school. In college I met this guy Mark through classes. He was an very popular frat boy you know the type. I was very shy and kept to myself a lot. I began noticing Mark would go out his way to say hi to me or to walk with me in the hallways. We exchanged phone numbers and he would send me homework answers because I was struggling with the workload. My family situation made it hard to function. My mother is an absolute lunatic. I lived at home and was forbidden from ever going to a party or even sleeping at a friends house. One fateful night I snuck out to a party on campus. Mark was there. He came up to me very drunk to talk. He was so sweet and friendly. I really hit it up with him and his friends that night. I ended up being pulled away to deal with my throwing up friend. It was my first real party. I was so happy that night. This was in November. The finished the fall semester but a few weeks into spring semester I had to withdraw because being terrorized by my mother and the painful feeling of missing out on campus life became unbearable. Mark began texting me asking what happened and if I was okay. I barley answered him. I was so cold. He began inviting me to parties. I kept saying no the first few weekends. I told him I had no friends and no one wanted me there. He responded by getting a bunch of His friends at the first party telling me to come. I was just so miserable and angry at the world. I didn’t believe anything good could possibly happen to me. I could believe this handsome popular frat boy could actually care about me. I thought he wanted to assault me. I thought it was a set up to walk into a gang rape. All I knew had been cruelty. I had a phobia of sex because of past abuse. Attention from men made me repulsed instead of flattered. I knew I was attractive and would dress like I was going to church every day at school. I did everything to desexualize myself. Eventually one night I ended up sneaking out again to go. It was a picture perfect night from start to finish. Mark hugged me when I got there. He introduced me to the girls there so I would feel comfortable. Ended up ignoring him to spend time with the girls. We drank and laughed and everything was so perfect. He tried to hook up with me later that night but I left once he started trying to put the moves on me. This boy went out of his away to invite me and ignored him and left before he could even kiss me. I was an idiot. I was just so intimidated by him. I was so afraid of men back then. He continued to text and Snapchat me. I always was cold to him. I went to a few more parties with him and his friends. He asked me to go out to dinner with him. I asked if I could bring my friend along as well. (Wtf was wrong with me I know) I liked him so much but I was just so afraid of being close to anyone. He just said okay when I asked if my friend could come to dinner with us. He got into a fucking car accident the night we were supposed to go. I saw the pictures of his totaled car and he was briefly careless so it wasn’t a lie just incredibly bad luck. When he asked if we could reschedule I blew him off. I was so horrible to him back then. I let all my trauma ruin something good that came into my life. It gets worse though. He asked me to come to a special event for his frat. I didn’t go. I fucking said no to this poor boy who treated me like a princess. He always told me how pretty I was. How cool I was. He asked me about the things I like. He was perfect handsome ambitious kind everything. He got me out of my shell he introduced me to better female friends. Then one weekend after the end of the semester I went on a weekend a trip with him and his friends. The first night went great. Until the night ended and he asked me if I wanted to sleep in bed with him. (Not for sex everyone was sleeping in one room but couples were sharing beds) I said no and slept on a dirty ass couch with no mattress. I was drunk when I said no the next morning I was so embarrassed I left. I said no because of my ptsd from my past. I sobbed because I was letting my abuse control my life and stop me from being with him no matter how much I wanted to. This remains one of my biggest regrets in life. I didn’t know how to stop letting it continue to ruin my life. This was the last straw for him. He took this as a final rejection and stopped trying. He stopped texting me I saw him one more time that summer and all I got a was a polite hi how are you? He was never rude never mean but his affection for me was completely gone. I ended up moving out from my parents house the next year. I started partying a lot. I had great friends. It was a happy time but I didn’t have him. I began realizing how much most men suck and started to miss him more and more. I started snap chatting and texting him while wasted. I acted like a jackass. I threw myself at him. He made it clear he wasn’t interested anymore but I kept doing it. If he didn’t answer me I would message him until he did. I would wake up horrified by the messages I sent him the night before. It was clear he no longer respected me. This is the bad part. One very drunken night after I began snapchatting him he asked me for nude pictures. I sent them it was the first and only time I have ever done this. I was so drunk I could barley hold my phone or stand up. He asked for a picture I must’ve sent him 100. Even when he wasn’t responding anymore I kept sending them. I just wanted to feel sexual for him. He screenshotted some of the pictures. When I woke up and realized what happened, I was horrified. I couldn’t believe he did that to me. This happened in the spring I didn’t hear from him again until I got a random snap from him in the fall one day with no explanation. Then I saw him at a big Christmas party. In the Uber on the way there I said “I’m not even going to say hi to him” As I was walking to the fridge he grabs me across the hips and pulls me to him and gives me the longest tightest hug imaginable. He then puts me under his arm and starts introducing me to his friend as he’s stroking my arm with his hand and holding me to his body. As we’re talking a mutual friend thinks it’s funny to push our heads together to make us kiss. Well we kissed. A little later we end up in the bedroom together. He was all over me. He was so into it. This time i finally let him.  It was like being in a time warp to my freshman year again. I still struggle a lot with intimacy but this was a big improvement from before. After this I wait to hear from him again. He never contacts me for the rest of Christmas break. Honestly I was devastated. I wanted him back so bad. I couldn’t believe after seemed so into me he was just gone again. I still think about him a lot. I don’t even know what to think about everything that happened. Before this happened to me I would’ve told a friend screenshotting nude pictures was an absolute dealbreaker. I know it’s so disrespectful but I can’t help missing the sweet boy I first met. I feel like he stopped respecting me and liking me beyond just sex. I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I’m also sure I will eventually see him again because of mutual friends.",27Jul2020,1

219,"My mum's friend is a similar size clothing to me, so sometimes we'll let each other look through old clothes that we want to get rid of. Typically it'll be stuff that I plan on donating to a second hand store, but I'll just let her look through it first (and she does the same for me).

A while ago, my mum brought home a bag of clothing and stuff from this friend of hers. But in with the clothes there were also some stuffed toys, brand new with tags still on. One was Dumbledore, from Harry Potter, and one was Glaceon, from Pokemon.

I kept the Dumbledore one for myself because I liked Harry Potter, and gave the Glaceon one to my partner who likes Pokemon. But now I honestly don't really like Harry Potter anymore, and I'm short on money due to job difficulties w the coronavirus. Would it be morally bad to sell the Dumbledore plushie online? I have a few other Harry Potter plushies that I want to get rid of (that I didn't get from her) and was going to just sell them as a bundle.

But considering that it was either meant to be a gift for me or go to a charity store, would it be bad to try to make a profit from it? Should I just donate it to a second hand store?

220,"Friend out of absolutely nowhere, started talking about her aunt’s death from decades ago on our group chat &amp; how she’s finding it really hard to deal with the grief &amp; wants our support. 

I was stunned she chose to talk about this in a place with me present because I have just lost an immediate family member recently that has turned my life upside down &amp; is extremely painful &amp; raw, while she has a full &amp; loving immediate family who she is very close with. Friend knows all of this extremely well, &amp; was with me through all the rough times &amp; supportive through it &amp; continues to be..until this. 

And the death in question was as I said decades ago &amp; she’s never mentioned this aunt before &amp; we’ve all known friend since before this aunt’s death. She obviously will have mentioned the actual death/funeral at the time it happened &amp; the grief at the time (we were teens), the same as we all have for grandparents &amp; other relative’s deaths over the years, but if she had talked any significantly further about how close they are/were or how much she’s grieving at the time or over the years afterwards I would have remembered. 

I found it extremely insensitive as it was, but she *told*, not asked, us that she’s actually planning on meeting us all this week specially for it &amp; said she’s going to travel up (she lives further away than the rest of us) to talk about it with us properly then. 

I’m feeling completely baffled that she has chosen to do this. She could have easily said &amp; done this with the other friends only &amp; not brought it up around me at all, never mind plan to put me through an actual in person meet up just for this to talk about it extensively &amp; support her. 

I understand more than anyone grief is not simple or straightforward, or bound by how close you are biologically to someone or how much time has passed, but it all feels really surreal &amp; almost like a form of being gas-lit about my grief. 

I don’t know how to deal with this other than not go to the meet up this week, which would actually involve me missing a very rare opportunity for us all to be physically together in one place &amp; will be very telling to them all if I don’t go. But I also feel like I can’t even talk in our group chat anymore since she made it all about that out of literally nowhere when otherwise we were all talking about something lighthearted. This small tight knit group of friends &amp; the group chat is something I rely on everyday as support &amp; an outlet to be myself &amp; have a laugh especially through the trying times I’m going through. 

I’m now also extremely anxious &amp; wary about seeing friend alone or getting sucked into any conversation in person or online chat with her in the near future incase she starts getting into it.",27Jul2020,1
221,"So im 19F and i live at home with my parents. Raised in a strict religion that doesnt like ""outside"" friends and encourages no higher education (than yr 10) (i also dont know much at all about where to start up again, education wise) so that you can participate full time in the religious volunteering.
Ive found myself wanting to leave and start my life, because of being unhappy for many years and recently finding someone who makes me happy beyond belief. (he is not in this religion, big no no) 
When i do leave this religion everyone i love and care about will not be allowed to talk to me or remain in contact. Family, friends, everyone. This terrifies me. The thought of letting everyone down and crushing my parents, i cant handle to think about. Even though my parents are not always nice to me, i still cant stand hurting anyone, im scared.
They will probably want me to move out soon after i leave the religion and because i work with family i will need to lose my job aswell. 
I just dont know what to do, im completely lost and terrified.

I want to rely on this person I've found, and i know he would want me to. But because of past issues ive become very independent and im finding it really hard to do so. Showing how lost and vulnerable i am is so scary to me and thats ridiculous! I hate it so much.
Sharing my opinions, concerns and thoughts that scare me, is scaring me! Not having someone to confide in or help me through things in my life has just become my life and independence has taken over so much that i cant open up anymore. Ive had to deal with all my issues alone. I dont know how to get over that.

Its alot to ask of a complete stranger to give me advice but I have no clue of whatelse now.

222,"So my brother has been liveing with me sense the start of covid-19. I did it because i felt bad and i knew that he was really worried about the virus. Before the virus was a thing he had asked to live with me back in January. I had said no because the last time things got bad between us for a number of different reasons. I didnt want our relationship to be affected aging. But come march he had a scare some heart pains, come to find out it was just stress related but i decide the let him live with me because he was supposed to move into a house right down the road. So it was going to be for a short time. Well then covid-19 fucked everthing up shut amercia down, my brother ended up looseing his job. And couldn't get the house because secretary state ended up being shut down. So he ended up basically stuck with me for the mean time until things settled down. Well come june when things started to finally open back up. He had decided he didnt want the house anymore and was going to start looking for apartments.  By the way my brother also has 3 cats ( i have 2 ) so a total of 5 cats are also liveing in my mobile home. So i got kinda frustrated because that was the plan we he moved in. To make a long story kinda short. I had just gotton out of a rough relationship of 2 years and only had the place to my self for 3months out of the 3 years i have been liveing here. And i just need my space to work on my self but its hard to do with a brother who gets to stay at my house with no job, smoke pot and play videogames. So i told him at the start of july he needs to find a job and a place to leave by the end of this month. Our relationship has taken a a bad toll sense he has started liveing with me aging. To the point we allmost dont even talk and its eatting at my metal health quite a bit. Its now july 27 and he still has no job or a place to live and i gave him till the end of the month. He has about 11,000 saved up.(i have not been makeing him pay rent) but the bottem line is, i dont want to throw him out. I love him to death but i cant keep putting my needs out of the way also. So do i kick him out knowing he may have to live in his car for a while (watch would really hurt me to do). Or do i put my own needs aside aging and tell him he can stay for another month with some stipulations. There is a lot more to this but way to much to type down.

223,"
I’m from Ohio, friend is from Washington, we know each other through our parents who are also good friends and so we’re basically family and have known each other for a long time. Obviously since we live so far away we don’t see each other often, but our families go on vacation occasionally and we went to Montana for 4 nights last week just to get out of the house and do something together that’s safe. 

I’ll call my friend E. We’ve known each other basically our whole lives, but didn’t talk to each other outside of family get togethers until a couple years ago and we text or talk pretty much every day. We’ve never been anything more than friends and she has said (and I agree) that would be weird. Basically a mutual friend zone. She’s also bi and at least from conversations with me talks about liking girls more often than she does guys. 

Anyways, let’s get to the story. The first day/night our families went hiking and it was fun but normal, then went back to our rooms to sleep. Second day was more of the same, but at night E and her sister [L, 14] wanted to have a sleepover type of thing since I had a room alone (hotel had spare, free rooms because of COVID which is weird but whatever). The room had a queen bed and a small pullout couch bed that was pretty small, probably the size of a single bed. Having a sleepover with them isn’t inherently unusual, we’re comfortable with each other and whatnot. 

But what is unusual is how the next two nights went. That night we all stayed up until about 12:30 playing various games until L went to sleep. E and I weren’t really tired so she came and sat on my bed so we could keep playing/talking (still not unusual). But as time went on she got closer and eventually rested her head on my shoulder, which is a little touchy considering neither of us are exactly touchy people, but not super strange. However, later she wanted to use my phone to read something on it but I resisted and held it away from her, and basically ended up lying down on the bed stretching it away. She was kind of on top of me at this point and she just gave up on the phone and put her head on my chest/shoulder and stayed like that while watching videos with me on my phone for like half an hour. 

Eventually, around 3, she went back to the bed with her sister and tried to go to sleep, which we both did until about 4:30 or 5 until we woke up to a loud noise from the elevator and couldn’t go back to sleep. Her sister slept soundly the entire time, no idea how. Anyways, she came back over at 5ish and sat above the pillows and just played with my hair while I was half asleep for like 20 minutes which was kind of an odd thing for her to do. Then she said she was tired so I assumed she would go back to her bed, but she just crawled down to mine and laid down with me for what was probably about an hour. Then her sister shuffled and she popped up quickly and made it look like she was sitting not super close to me on the bed, so clearly she was aware that lying with me was kind of a weird thing to be doing. She also gave some awkward compliments to me on my hair and eyes, and although we’re pretty good friends we tease each other 1000 times more than we make compliments on physical appearance, so it was definitely unusual.

We were all up and awake at that point so we just went about our day and did stuff with our families, then the same situation the next night except far less dragged on. L, her sister, fell asleep very quickly so we both went to my bed again so we wouldn’t wake her up by talking. She told me to lie down kind of on the edge so she could too since the bed was very small, which I did, and she basically had to lay on top of me (I was on my side) to see my phone and we played games on it for a little... since we only got a couple hours of sleep the night before we were both tired but instead of going to her bed she just told me to put the phone down and to lie down. Keep in mind that lying down with 2 people in this bed is extremely uncomfortable and very close together, so there wasn’t much of a reason to be doing it. The door creaked a few times over the next half hour or so and she kept kinda popping up each time and eventually decided she would just go back to her own bed, but she said she was going to 3 times before she actually did. 

Next day we had to get up early for our flight so they went back to their room for the night and that was the end of the trip. It’s been 6 days since we left and I’ve been texting/talking to her as usual, with no mention of either of those nights at all. I probably would have thought I was dreaming the first night if the second hadn’t happened. I guess what I’m asking is why did she do what she did? She incited basically everything that involved physical contact and seemed reluctant to stop and go to sleep even though she clearly knew the contact was unusual because she moved at least a little every time her sister shuffled or the door creaked. I never pushed back because I didn’t mind at all, so it’s not like she was making me uncomfortable. I’m just wondering what her reason for doing it could have been since it’s never happened before. 

TL;DR: Went on vacation with long time friend, she got very touchy and slept in same bed with me, I don’t know why. 
I definitely wrote way too much considering how this tl;dr is pretty concise. Hopefully it makes sense, this mostly happened in the middle of the night so my memory isn’t perfect and I also suck at writing these things so...",27Jul2020,1

Ignoring us as in we would say something to him directly and he wouldn’t respond or look up at all, until we repeated it again much louder. If this had happened once it wouldn’t be a big deal, but it happened multiple times so J and I both found it irritating. 

R slept over with us that night, and left the next morning. That night J brought up the fact that R had been ignoring us the day before, and we just talked about it for a little, and then J asked if he could vent. The problems he had with R were that R never interacted with him (or us really) on social media, he never texts us back in group chats or sends us anything, despite both J and I being very active. J also said he felt like R never texted him or initiated a hang out, it was constantly J doing that. And that he would see R interacting a lot with his other friends normally, but that he just never acts the same towards him. These problems didn’t come out of nowhere, J says that the ignoring earlier in the day made it click in his head that not only is he completely ignored online and over text, but now in person too. 

I also vented a problem i’ve been having with R. I feel very emotionally close with R, but I don’t exactly feel emotionally supported. I feel like whenever I reach out with a mentally problem or just needing comfort, I just don’t receive any words of affirmation or anything, usually just “aw sorry you’re feeling like that.” R also doesn’t open up to us that much, and has never once come to us with a problem or feeling. It makes our friendship feel extremely one sided. 

J suggested that we don’t text R for a couple of days, to think about everything and also to see how long it takes for him to text us first. After R left my house after that last hang out, he did not text me at all, and hasn’t in two weeks. We haven’t interacted with our best friend in two weeks. The last text I have between us was when we picked him up and I said “we’re here.”

It just feels weird to me. I don’t know how many days of radio silence I would let go by without texting my friend to check up on them. J and I feel hurt, and it feels like R doesn’t give a shit at all honestly. I know we need to talk to him and try to fix this, but I don’t know how to go about it, and i’m really mad. He doesn’t even watch my stories on anything anymore. 

I also need to mention that R isn’t a bad friend in every way, he’s a great human and that’s why he’s our closest friend. 

I know this seems like a petty or immature thing to make a post about, but I really do need advice, and we are all young too. I miss my friend but i’m upset and conflicted about what my next move should be.",27Jul2020,1

227,"I (17F) don't feel an emotional connection with my (18M) boyfriend.

Hi! I have been dating my boyfriend for around 6 months, and I feel no emotional connection to him. I kind of want someone who sweeps me off my feet but I feel as though I wear the pants in the relationship. I do not know if I can't feel emotionally connected to him because we aren't vulnerable with each other. But I just feel like it's a hassle to be around him and I find myself often daydreaming and not listening when we are together. Before we started dating I had semi recently (4 months prior) gotten out of kinda a sticky relationship that was more like a friends with benefits scenario. I just felt as that was so much easier and now that I am in a committed relationship, I miss that a lot. I also was my boyfriend's first kiss and he is very inexperienced, on the other hand I am still a virgin, but I have done everything else and was used to doing stuff often. I know this is superficial but I want a guy who knows more and can sweep me off my feet and I honestly hate teaching him. My boyfriend is very nice and good to me, but I seriously do not see us together long term. We have very different beliefs and oftentimes I feel like I have to sit back and not say anything when he makes rude comments about others (derogatory or uncalled for). He has no idea I feel this way, which is the hardest part. He honestly thinks our relationship is going smooth, but I couldn't agree more. He is very dense and not very smart (not in a mean way) and I need someone who can keep up with me mentally and in quick conversations. He kinda makes fun of me sometimes and refers to me as ""his bitch"" which as a feminist I HATE. But he wants me to go on vacation with his family in a little under a month, but I feel like I have to go even though I really don't want to be together. Can I just have some help and advice on what to do?? I can't tell a lot of people because I do not want it to get out!

229,I’ve recently built a pc around a month ago which I paid for myself and I have it set up in the living room. I want to have it set up in my room but my parents won’t let me no matter what I say especially my mom. I want it in my room cause it’s really noisy in the living room and when I played on switch my room would be so quiet. They say it’s because “upstairs is for sleeping” and that they don’t want my friends listening to them. I know that sounds pretty logical but they hardly spend any time upstairs and I think it’s just a excuse. Everyone is always in the living room watching tv or doing something and my friends always complain about noise. My mom says I can put it downstairs but my dad works there and the piano is there which is used every day. I Don’t stay up late playing video games and get off at around 10:30pm.

231,"so one of my roommates happens to be a 16 year old kid (my other roommate moved him in bc the kids parents kicked him out and he was gonna be homeless). he’s chill for the most part but lately all I get is an attitude from him when I ask simple/basic things. No matter what I say to him, he gets mad. Like we’re fundamentally different.

Example: “Hey roomie, can you maybe not be so loud on your game after 4AM? I have to be at work in the morning.” He agrees, but guess what? Ever since I’ve asked I’ve been woken up anywhere from 4AM-7AM at least twice a night. 

that’s honestly the only thing I’ve really asked of him. 

Him and my other roomie, who we will call K, invite one of MY friends to spend the night (in our TWO bedroom trailer) without even asking me and it is expected that my friend sleeps in my room with me since the 16 year old sleeps in the living room. Said friend spends a minimum of 3 nights here every time they visit and I just want my alone time when I’m not working. Am I wrong for being mad they make these plans without involving me? This is my first time living with roommates.

A good friend of mine recently told me that they tested positive for genital herpes. They have a history of having lots of sexual partners.

234,"  

I have known my sister in law for approximately 8 years, and up until recently I tried treating her as a friend, which meant I spent time with her regardless of my brother’s presence. However, this led to me being her confidant whenever they had relationship problems. During those 8 years, they have had 2 children (6 and 3) and he has one from a previous relationship (9). Over the years, I have noticed a few things that have resulted in me trying to distance myself: 

· Over time, every time we spoke, it became a time to talk shit about my brother or any other member of my family, or sometimes even my friends

· At one point, she requested that I step in to tell my brother to treat her better (get directly involved in their relationship) 

· Made backhanded comments about myself and my boyfriend 

· Shamed people for having different opinions than her, including commenting on how she thought I was “smarter than that” on a political view 

· I loaned her $100 so she could make a car insurance payment, and 2.5 years later, I am still missing $95 of it

Back in February, before Covid, she asked me to start babysitting for her once a week due to my brother taking on a job that would put him out of state for weeks at a time and she wanted me-time. At this point in time, I agreed because I felt secure mentally, academically, and was only 10 minutes away from where she lived. This quickly changed when I was kicked out of my living space, moved 45 minutes away, shifted to online classes (including labs), and I no longer had access to a majority of my belongings. After not even a week of me being kicked out, she requested that I come spend the night with her because she wanted company while my brother was away. I was hesitant to do this because I knew that her kids would cause a distraction when working on homework and that more often than not, spending time with her would lead to taking on more negativity than I wanted. Despite this, I agreed, but she never responded with a time. 

Weeks pass without her speaking to me, until Easter morning when she calls me to inquire of these plans, and if I could follow up on the previous babysitting arrangement and babysit during that week. I disagree as this was only a couple of weeks before finals and the workload was quickly becoming overwhelming. During the call, she of course seemed annoyed that I would not babysit for her, but texted me after the phone call. This text incorporated an apology for “assuming that I would have been there for her like she was for me” and that it was “not fair to put that on” me. I saw this text message as a clear manipulation tactic, and despite being angered by it, I did not respond. 

Since then, she has texted me once, where she noticeably did not acknowledge this manipulative text message, but instead mentioned how her children wanted to spend time with me and invited me to dinner that night, only 2 hours in advance. As I did not immediately respond (due to homework), she contacted my mom. In this phone call she told my mother how she had “talked me out of suicide” years ago, which is not only untrue, but a blatant disregard for my privacy as my mother had not known about this mental health issue from that time. In addition to this, she backhandedly commented about how myself and my brother don’t like my mom, but still love her as she is our mother. 

Right now, I do not know how to move forward, as I desperately want to be around the kids, but I no longer want anything to do with her. When talking to my parents about this, they have stated that if I state as such, it is likely she will use the children as leverage against me. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to handle this so the kids are not deeply affected?",27Jul2020,1

240,"I have a 1 year old male Pit bull named Bailey who recently my mom has been looking to re home. I am starting to agree with this for these reasons down below...

(1). He is badly allergic to fleas and something in his dog food. this and his anxiety has caused him to start eating himself. He bleeds and rips up his fur he cries from the pain. My parents can't afford to get him medicine or treatment.

(2). My parents bought him from this lady for 100$ and we also got his sister. (My Parents don't own her anymore) The lady had other malnourished aggressive dogs and crazy kids. My mom decided to give me Bailey. they were going to get him neutered but never did cause my mom wanted him to breed I did not. She was supposed to get him his Parvo and other vaccines so I could take him to a dog park and get him socialized. She never got him vaccinated and didn't want to socialist him so that he could be a guard dog. She didn't help me 11 at the time with training but expected him to be trained to her expectations. Due to this he barks when people come over and is aggressive with animals and doesn't listen. 

(3). He gets aggressive and attacks our female spayed dog Dakota. He attacks her for her toys and food and doesn't know to be gentle.

(4). My sisters soon to be husband and his young sister own a uneutered and unspayed dog and they smell of them whenever they come over so he gets really aggressive and scares them.

(5) My grandma, grandpa, and 100 year old nana might come to live with us and they have 2 old small dogs who are both females. I am worried that he may hurt one of them and my dad will throw him outside or take him to a kill shelter. My mom even said that if he hurts them she will shoot him and skin him. Then will give him to us for dinner. When he barks to much my dad goes after him and hits him, due to this Bailey snaps and growls at him.

241,"I did something horrible that I'm feeling so guilty about and I don't know what to do or what to say.

I work as a delivery driver at a pizza restaurant and I've been working there since January or about 6 months now.

To make it easy for myself, if there are multiple orders with just 1 or 2 items,  I would just put them in the same bag to make it easy for myself and when I arrive at a location, I will carry the items to the location.   I never had issue with that since the receipts are on the orders, but a situation happened that I'm fully regretting

I was taking multiple orders since  I was the only driver  and we were ready to close.  When I arrived at one of the locations, I took the pizza out of the bag since I had multiple orders in one bag.  When I I took it out of the bag, I somehow didn't have total control of it 
and I dropped it on the road :( 

At first, I thought nothing happened because the box was closed, but the impact was on the side.  I peeked at it and half of the pizza was squashed on the side.  I was in shock and hoping it was just a dream.

I arrived at the customer's location and I showed them what happened since they had the right to know what happened.   At first, they refused to take it, in which I understood, but since it was already over the closing time, I didn't know what to say about remaking it.  It was a cash order, so they decided not to get it.  I was calling the restaurant to speak to the manager to cancel the order or figure something out. While I was waiting for the prompts to finish, the customer opened the door and said they wanted the pizza.  They paid me the cash and I gave it to them.  

I don't know what to do.  I didn't tell my manager about this since the customer accepted it and everyone was tired, in which i didn't want to start with arguments.....I dont know if I should wait until I get a complaint, then be fully honest what happened, in which I am fully ready to.
Or tell my manager about what happened when I work the next day?   I'm just concerned if I tell them, but the customer never called to complain, how will they think of me.

Everyone sees me as one of their best employees.  I always do my best to make sure I don't mess up.  Yes I've missed an item few times and I admit the mistakes truthfully, but this one was something I know its my fault and I have every right to be upset, but at the same time, I don't want my manager to look at me differently like I'm a horrible employee because of what I did if I mention something, the environment changes, but the customer never called to complain.

To be honest, I rather tell the truth when the customer calls to complain, but a friend advised me to tell my manager regardless, even if they never called.

Yes, this situation was a bad call for me and I'm definitely learned my lesson, in which I am going to make sure this never ever happens again.

What should I do Reddit.  Tell my manager, even if the customer never calls or wait until they call and mention the entire truth?

Thank you all.

TL;DR:  I made a mistake, in which i dropped a pizza. At first they refused it, but changed their mind after trying to sort it out.  I never told my manager about it, but I don't know if I should wait to mention it when they call or tell them the next day and risk my job, even if they never call.",27Jul2020,1

245,"I'm 23f, he's 15m. We don't live together, and in fact live states apart. But we talk via social media and follow eachothers accounts. 

My family is very conservative. I'm the oldest of 6 siblings, my brother is somewhere in the middle. As I've grown up and lived on my own for years now, I've obviously grown more liberal. I'm pretty in the middle for the most part, but I would also call myself a feminist, and an advocate for those who don't have a voice. Of course, this is nearly a sin in most conservative households. 

Considering the circumstances, my family can be surprisingly rational (and unsurprisingly irrational). Point is, they don't treat women poorly or with inequality, but they also won't call themselves feminists for ""political reasons"". 

My little brother, however, is growing more and more into a misogynist. I post on my social media about finding missing women, about what consent means, about justice for victims of assault and my hopes for a healthier society (I don't only post about women, but about men and children and animal rights as well). However, it's probably only about 20% of what I post. But he replies to all of the ones about women by calling bs. He constantly starts arguments with me discrediting anything having to do with women. 

I told my family the story of how I was almost kidnapped a month or so ago, and he said I was lying for attention, and that it wasn't a big deal because I wasn't actually kidnapped or assaulted. I told him that it's a reality for a lot of people, and that I had in fact been assaulted in the past. He responded by asking why he should believe me, that I probably just wanted attention, and that I would've gone to the police if anything ever happened. I was dumbfounded. 

Any time I try to have a conversation with him he turns it into something like this. I have never lost my cool, I try to remain calm and turn it into a teaching moment. I try to have patience with him. 

But the point is, he will be an adult soon. He's already much bigger than I am. His behaviour is concerning and he won't listen to me, and my parents, while concerned, dont actually take any steps towards modifying his beliefs or behaviours. 

My whole reason for posting this, is how do I talk to him? How do I get through to him? I don't even know what to do anymore. The fact that he doesn't believe I was assaulted makes no sense to me, what could I possibly gain from sharing that? Only like 5 people even know. If he doesn't even believe my own life experience, how will he take anything I say seriously? 

Please help me understand how I can get through to him, and how I can maintain my patience.",27Jul2020,1
247," Both of my roommates have their own cat. This issue applies to both of them. I do not have pets, and I don’t really understand cats, but I know that litter boxes should be sifted at least every day? 

Neither of them do this, and while I work full time and am not here to verify this for certain, I can see (and smell) that the litter boxes both fill up. I can say for absolute certain that they do not sift them. When they are taken care of, they’re just simply emptied. This happens, with one, I would say probably weekly, the other seems to be about, after a week and a half each? 

The boxes are in our hallway, my room sits in the middle, and it absolutely reeks. A sour smell - not to mention that it’s visible. One of the cats has even gone out and used the plants in the living room as a litter box, and there was once a mess on the floor in the middle of the hallway. I’ll spare the details of how grossed out I am by the idea of the cats having to step in their own waste and getting onto the furniture. 

Like I said, I am unsure of how I should approach this - neither of my roommates really listen. One of them will only discuss serious matters over text, and the other will resort to yelling or denying. I would prefer not to clean it up myself if I didn’t have to - it was more or less an unspoken agreement that these cats do not belong to me and aren’t my responsibility.

253,"Hi all. I had a best friend of maybe five years, we ended up having a falling out due to differences in scientific/political beliefs (at least that’s what I came to believe after how a conversation ultimately ceased any further contact). This was about three years ago. Since we’ve talked only briefly, limiting it to happy birthdays and one time of trying to get together but it not happening of course. Today I reached out to say happy birthday and we’re speaking amicably about broad life updates. While I want to try to mend things possibly, there are issues:
1. Without going into the history, our parents have had problems with each other; her parents thinking my family and I have “poor values” and aren’t fit to be around their daughter. 
2. Clear political differences. While I care not to debate these things she is a fiend for debating anything and everything and tended to push
3. She has expressed hatred/bitterness towards people of my economic status/race based on current day stereotypes to keep it broad
4. I feel she may believe I have problems with her race/sexuality/etc. (which I don’t) 

To lay out reasons why I even consider this:
1. I never recovered from this loss of a friend. No one has filled her spot in the years since our problems
2. As silly as it sounds I believe we were soulmates or something to that effect. We were incredibly close regardless of whatever happened
3. I miss her for some reason

I know this is all broad and there are definitely more complexities to this friendship but that’s the basics. I feel stupid even having reached out to her because I feel we can never really be friends again or mend things. I truly think she will never be able to handle my race/supposed political values she thinks I have.

256,"For about 2 weeks I’ve tried the works: red light at night, no caffiene later in the day, a 1-hour wind-down period, daily exercise, no late meals, a cool room with a bed dedicated for sleep, waking up at the same time every day, and no napping. Yet even with the constant sleep deprivation this causes, I’ll lie down at night and stare into my eyelids for an hour straight until I get frustrated. I’ve tried sleeping pills but they mess with my cognition in concerning ways, and they don’t work either. 

I digress, I do get the urge to sleep. So much that I can barely keep my eyes open, actually. But, in the middle of the day. I just force myself awake hoping in vain that the lack of sleep will make me tired later. 

Any advice is appreciated here, thank you for reading",27Jul2020,1
257,"Hello, 
I’m a 24 YO male currently working as a PRN (as needed) Pharmacy Technician at a large level one trauma facility! I love my job for IT gives me freedom and I can pick shifts when I please. My pay is great &amp; I am greatly appreciated. Unfortunately this job does not give me benefits and I am approaching 26 yo. My family is pressing me to get benefits and I’m looking at all options. My current employer does not have any full time positions available, but I was told possibly in the future I could possibly receive a full time job. I did live on my own for sometime but I had some big life changes last year and had to move in with my parents. My current job is about 30 mins away from my house.

I was recently offered a position at a Starbucks again (I used to work for them when I was attending tech school) this store is about 30 mins away from my house as well. If I work 20 hrs minimum I will receive benefits through this company. Pay is minimum wage &amp; the commute is in the opposite direction of my house and my other job. If I worked this job I would formulate a schedule so I would only work at one of the locations rather then both on the same day. I need advice!!!! Is this a good idea or just a waste of my time?

I’m also a part time college student as of last year, working on my associates in arts right now! My goal is to get a bachelor’s degree in some sort of IT field in the future..... I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and just would like some advice for this other job and opinions!",27Jul2020,1

261,"Hi reddit, so this project was an laboratory report that the teachers left on thursday and to be presented on sunday at 6pm via online. So everything was perfect we had already separated the parts that each of us were going to do (we are 4 people in this group), we had to send our parts on saturday so this friend (we are gonna call G) could put it together on sunday and send it via Classroom. Everyting was fine until G sends a text at 7pm Saturday saying that she couldn't do her part and was sorry, only specifying that she was sick, never because of COVID or anything only that she was really sick and couldnt make it and was really sorry. Mind you A and I are not really close but we do text from time to time, she opens up pretty quickly about pretty seroius and personal stuff, and she had already told days prior that she was sick and it was covid and that she was feeling a bit sick but never anything to serious. So the moment she sent that message I knew it was bcs of covid but i didnt knew if the other members knew so I wasnt confortable nor I think it was my right to tell them the reason why she is backing off bcs is a very personal  topic that only she has the right to share. So I was going to put her anyways in the project but then the other two member started talking about how are going to finish this project beetween the three of us already excluding her, I thought she was going to intervene explaying the reason that she is not participating and say its bsc of covid and that she eanted her name included eventhough she was not gonna do anything, I think the members would understand since its covid. But no, she stayed silent so i assumed that she was backing off the report for real and understood why her name was taken off the report. So the 3 of us manage to finish the report, I had to stayed up till 4am finishing passing her part to this programme that makes mind maps so it looks good on the report (the other members did the summary of her part and send it to me so i could digitalized) I didnt know how the programme worked thus i stayed really late trying to figure it out so we could finish the report on time and send it to them sunday at 6am so we could all revise it and send it finally to the teacher. I woke up that day at 1pm bcs of the lack of sleep cheking if there were any messages from the members to edit the report, there were, we edited and send it on time. All this time this friend A had not said a word eventho she IS in the wsp groupchat and she could asked why her name was not on the report. It comes night 11pm and i recieved a text from A saying how awful of a person i am and how i lack empathy towards her. I calmly explained that if she eanted her name on the report she could have said so and if she had explained that it was covid the other members would have known the wouldn have minded leaving your name in the report. But goes on how she was so dissapointed that I and another member of the group M knew of her situation(which i didnt know M knew) and we shouldve stand up for her and propose to keep her name(ming you we barely know eachother we are just colleagues in the faculty and dont talk on a frequen basis, but she A and M are really close so why is she coming to me when im not that close to her?). She goes on saying that she shouldn have expected anything from me but even then she trusted me and i dissaponted her, that leacing her name was what everyone wouldve done, every reasonable, empathetic, human being wouldve done and she ""sees"" my true colors. Im not good at reading social ques maybe i soulve have proposed to keep her name? so i ended up feeling a bit guilty cuz she is going through a lot her dad is in need of oxigen so I apologized for not proposing keeping her name but reminded her that I thought It all could have been avoided had she expresed her wishes with clarity in the beginning, I told her that i hope that she becomes healthy again and her family too and promised her that in the next report we have if she is still feeling sick she would have her name in the report eventho she is not requested to do anything.

Am i an asshole for not putting her name in this report? I still feel a little bit guilty but kind of annoyed too cuz she in the group is usually the last to send her part and in the last report we almost didnt send it on time bcs of her. She also stated that she wasnt going to take part in the report, so that means that she was ok with her name not being in the report right? It also annoys me that she says all this things knowing that we are not really close, but it annoys me the most that she comes to me and not M her REALLY close friend, why I had to be the one proposing that, I am not that close to her, but M is, why is she going off on me and not her? 

I think that maybe a point of view from an outsider would really help me organize my thoughts.

262,"(Just some context before we start but I'm fifteen old male that lives in a small town, and this is my first post and day on reddit. But I apologize in advance if my grammar or spelling is off, but let's just get down to business but buckle up this is going to be alot cause I have alot to vent that I haven't been able to and I apologize for how much I wrote which is almost a book)

Like the title says I'm getting saying I'm fine or happy. Basically for the past year I've dealt with alot but let me start where it begins my school life has been an odd set of events. Since I live in a small town I am stuck in a place where diversity is little to none. So I only really get to see new people if I move or someone moves in. Since I was little I've kinda been a no mad for friends, and what I mean is I basically hop to friend group to friend group would say I almost move from friend grop to another within a 1 year to a 6 month period. So basically I've never had alot of trust for people, mostly because I've been constantly made fun of for my appearance or my weight and well I would just take it or be self destructive and joking them in criticizing me so they would stop but well it didnt so I've never had alot of self confidence. Most of the time I would set up facade where I'm just the funny class clown kid that never sad. I would definitely say I'm introverted but I'm not shy or anything I've pretty sociable and I can usually read a person very easily.

But to sum some up what time period where my issues take place is 2017 to now. So in 2017 I was doing my usual friend hopping but it was different this time I entered a group that was different and one of the big differences was this group was gender this would be the first time a girl group wanted me to hangout not to be just a punching bag or a stepping stool to me telling them about a guy they were perusing. 

(As for the rest of the post I'll be referring to this group as ""The Group"")

But for the group it was a very anti social group because each one of these girls were bullied for the same stuff as I have but the big difference is they had each other I had no one but my self. As I joined the group we clicked well and they helped me alot with my self like building trust with others and they helped me with getting out of a bad relationship. Ad I hung out with this group we started to show alot of affection through the group like hugging and or cuddling but it was nothing sexual or romantic and well thought this I've learned that one of my love languages is touch and well nowadays thinking back on this group I strongly remember the times where warm was shared through each other.

(As I am reading though this let me describe the members of this group through some stereotypes for each one by their name. But I'm not gonna use their real names

Lily = tomboy girl
April = sweet and naive
May = cold and up front
Kay = easily liked, but different 
Jill = loveable, but slow
Ayla = short and loud)

As I hung out with the group being a hormonal teenager wanting to experience love I took a liking to some and some took a liking to me. The first interaction was Kay. Kay probably still has my heart till today, she doesnt make me feel different the first day we met we hit it off and within the same day we stayed up till 5 A.M. talking and well she was the only one with the same love language as me which attracted me like metal to magnet. At random she would hug me and wouldn't let go or she would grab my hand. Or lay in my lap and or lay my head between her crossed legs and play with my hair. It would make me go crazy and make butterfly's fly around in my stomach. But the reason we didnt go straight into a relationship was because I was in a relationship and also blind to obvious signs.

This relationship I was in wasnt good I will call her mac and mac isn't a good person she would see how vulnerable I am and basically use me for compliments and self assurance for herself and then end up going to her friends and end up telling them how much fun she had ghosting me when we made plans to go hangout with her best friend. She treated me like a dog with a 20 foot lease and would ignore me till I started to pull away from her only to yank me away with hollow promises. That's why kay felt like she was an escape.

Kay treated me like a person but once I got out of the relationship with mac when she broke up with me over text after another day of ghosting me. It was a month away before she was moving with her mom on the other side of america and we finally got into a relationship but a week before she left which of course failed. And when she left I felt hollow for awhile looking for someone to fill the hole. I got back together with mac for 2 weeks just for her to get bored of me again. 

Then there was April. She was sweet but all she wanted was love but she never knew where she wanted it from but she would hardly ever tell how she really felt. I put my time into her and but once I gathered the the confidence I shared my feelings with her that I liked her and well she exclaimed she felt the same way but she couldnt date because lily liked me already and she didnt want to ruin our friendship but that what hurt more than being friendzoned was she asked out my best friend 2 weeks later... even then I still liked her and for awhile it was cat and mouse.

And after her was lily she was the first girl I didnt share the same feelings for she wasnt my type and well since she was a tomboy and she wouldnt be scared to be physical and well she didnt like my annoying traits and instead of talking about she would hit me on my shoulder and well it would sting but not as much as it hurt mentally and me feeling love though through touch alot of her slaps would hurt me alot more than she knew and when I rejected her feeling she couldnt control her emotions about it and she would be very stale around me. Like she would always be mad at me but if I layed with or hugged may or april she would demand I do the same it her so we didnt last long.

And that's the last of the intimate relationships I've had and kay has visited once since she moved and I was of course almost all over her from me being starved from the attention I wanted but I geuss I got the the taste of my own medicine because kay had a boyfriend and well as far as hugging that's how far we could go which hurt and I respected it just like she did me and mac. Funny how it works

Well from her visit came kind a test of our friendship. May had a little brother he was a very sweet boy he would help me watch my little sister when she tagged along on the group little adventures. He trusted too easily which brought his new friend Gedeon was sad boy. He was like mac in a way he liked to manipulate and from the first time I genuinely meet him I hated him at first I didnt like him because we he join our group and it was competition to me because he was the only other guy who joined this group that all the girls liked. But Gedeon was bad he attacked anyone in his way and first thing he did was get me pushed away 

I slowly stopped getting invited to hangout with the group and I would constantly see them post about him and they remembered his birthday and threw him a party and they forgot mine. He started dating april within weeks of being in the group something I couldnt do in years. And by summer there was a little party our town would throw for a week before school the group invited me but I made plans for others in preparation of them not inviting me so i went with them instead of the group and they were not happy. but the final test of our group Gedeon was harassing my best friend I'll call him abe and abe asked me pick him up which I did and the group saw this and saw this as a way of me choosing him over them. And by the end of night the vote came to 3 to 2 lily, may, and ayla wanted me out of the group
And april, and jill to keep me in the group.

This brought me to Christmas where my grandma and my father got very sick my dad recovered my grandma didnt. But I missed out on my Christmas with my mom and dad being in the hospital and my new years celebrated by me crying in the bathroom. From letting my little sister to see bc I was left to watch her as my older sister left to hangout with her friends. 

And like then I only had abe and well abe got a girlfriend and well I would get left behind alot because of it and some fights we had was me just being jealous and some fights was him bailing on me and I gave up on trying to keep his attention. Then once again I was set adrift group hopping. 

Which bring me to now thanks to the group got rid of Gedeon but is still in the after math of what it used to be. Gedeon turned the group into a mess where jill and ayla were isolated and april was forced to stay in a relationship for awhile because he would threaten to hurt himself if she didnt but she broke off of him. Lily is still attached to him bc he showed her the attention I didnt but he used her for her driving ability and him needing a taxi. And may was attached to her just as much but he moved away and they realized the group was not really a group anymore. So they made up and hung out to make up and they say they want me back. But they dont try to invite me. Which leaves me only with a group I fell into again where I cant commit into because of being stuck in the past. Me and kay have been talking but she missed her visit thanks to covid 19

I'm so done. My current friend see my slipping from my happy self alot. I dont care enough to keep up my facade any more. I spend alot more time in my head then In life it's almost August the anniversary of me becoming a shell of what I was I lost a 2 year friend group 

And all that I have is a old phone where I have all my saved messages where me and the group used to love each other. I dont have much to almost no motivation anymore.

But the advice I need is where do I go from here?

Showers once a week, never helps clean, left garbage around, and smoke pot constantly. Anything nice done to the place has been by me and Elizabeth.

We were super nice about it at first because we thought they were cool. The we realized really fast that they are gross. We talked to them a few time and they became defensive and tried to use their “autism” as a defense. Sorry but being autistic doesn’t mean being gross and inconsiderate person. They are also a germaphobe, have adhd, and ptsd. Pretty sure they are self diagnosed too. Trust me though we are understanding and patient. 

My roommate Elizabeth doesn’t have a shiny enough spine and has not been here to sit and talk with like to let them know we want them to leave. Our lease is a year but we can leave with good reason. Our landlords also know we have had issues with Luke. I’ve sent them pictures of the mess they left but they said Luke has to chose to leave.

It’s got its perks and appeal but it was never my dream to work this job or have this career. At one point I was strictly focused on said career and now I’m resisting.

I’ve had so many interest in my life that have inspired me to pursue them but I can never ever focus on one thing. For example I love writing, making music and have been interested in programming for the last 3 years. 

For some reason I just can not stick to anything. I’ll start to produce a song and then I’ll abandon the track due to random inspiration to start another one. I’ll smash through a section in a programming tutorial and then stop doing that to work on writing a screenplay, and then I’ll abandon that screenplay to write a short story, and then I abandon that to work on an unfinished blog that’s been under construction the last 4 months. 

I just end up with a collection started but unfinished projects that just disappoint me and remind me that all the time and work spent on starting other things could’ve very well made something great if I just had focused on one particular thing. 

Does anyone else have this issue? If so have you gotten out of it and trained yourself to finish projects and focus on one thing? Please help.",27Jul2020,1

268,"I am one of the two captains of a dance team and the person I am in charge with constantly talks over me. She screams over me when I try to speak. She immediately takes charge and doesn’t plan or talk with me to ensure we evenly divide our responsibilities.

This person is completely toxic. I came out as bisexual to them, and they outed me three times (in front of multiple people in some of those times so now over five people who I didn’t tell know).

I told her it bothered me. I tried to fix the friendship, realized it wasn’t worth it because she made me feel bad about myself by secretly pushing me down in daily conversation. She was extremely toxic and then SHE WAS GIVEN A SOLO.

I have a year over my co-captain and our instructor clearly had a favorite. Even though I had seniority, I got bread crumbs. I complained, and I got a 15 second small dance where most audience members just think I don’t know the work and am doing whatever I want. Which is exactly what I’m doing. They didn’t even give me any moves to actually do, they said freestyle because they didn’t want to actually write in the part.

I wanted a better solo, and when my co Captain was given a male dance partner who was too uncomfortable to do the role, I suggested I do it. Then, my co captain came out to me as bisexual in tears. Sobbing about how she didn’t want people to know that she liked guys AND girls. I was so done. She outs me, then cries about “But, what if people find out against my own will?” News flash- it sucks and you’ve done it before, so you kinda deserve it.

Either way, she’s crying in her room. I turn on my heels and leave, telling her I want an equal turn at my own spot. She cries, offering the solo but I only wanted to have a solo as well. I wanted it to be equal. Either way, she never went through with it and told our instructors that I should have the solo instead or that we should be partners.

When we practiced dance together with the whole squad, she constantly screamed over me. And I mean, scream. I’d scream and still be too quiet.

Our squad is starting a new season, and I want some advice on what to do. I’ve already contacted our instructors multiple times. My old instructor who gave her the solo quit, so now we have a new instructor. I’ve also constantly texted my co captain to make things equal, but she’s a terrible human being who is extremely selfish and doesn’t care about me because she’s most likely mad that I stopped being her friend and told others that we both know that she outed me. Shame, told others about her own actions and she’s mad at me. Shouldn’t have done it then.

Either way, I feel an incredible amount of hatred towards her. So much so, that it constantly takes up my thoughts and I feel a bit blinded by it. How do I move past this? How do I yell over her? But, most importantly, I’d also wants tips on being the best leader I can be for my team.

Also, it is incredibly frustrating when someone who outs you, complains about others finding out about their own sexuality. It took a lot of strength not to exact revenge, but it would be wrong. Though some of my friends told me, it would be equal. (This makes me sound like some kind of villain- I’m not going to out her!!!!!)",27Jul2020,1

In high school, he was actively distancing from me. I never knew his reason but I respected it. Finally in Sop. year, I called him to ask him and he said he wasn’t who he used to be and he was a bad person. Of course, he wasn’t and I said that whatever was hurting him, I could and would help him.

He moved schools And we never talked again.

That was 2016 maybe.. lately I have been having dreams about him. It was so real, it was scary. Ever since then, I can’t stop thinking about him and worrying if he’s okay. Part of me wants to find him.

 I thought it would be easy because he has a kinda unique name and stuff. To find him would be a serious man hunt. 

1. He has always hated his last name, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he changed it or something.
2. I would have to really reach a chain of people to even get an idea of a way to reach him.

271,"I made a post here earlier this week about advice on what to do so this is an update and more advice is needed. Basically I was extremely interested in someone I’ve been spending a lot of time with and it seemed pretty platonic other than a drunk hookup and some cuddling well the beautiful people on this app told me to hike up my skirt and just have the talk about what’s going on. So I did and it actually went really well and I felt relieved to know that he felt the same way and he’s just pretty apprehensive about getting into another romantic relationship and preferred being patient. That’s all well and dandy,  after that talk the next day we have a really normal day a little more affectionate and that night we started to hookup and before this got to far he kinda pulled back and apologized and told me he just gets nervous sometimes, and he didn’t wanna fuck anything up and it kinda boiled down to some self consciousness too. I completely understood it and he kinda tried to just shut down from me and I just brought up something that made me really insecure with him and we had a super nice long talk about all the stuff that we were worried about and what made us insecure and it was nice and at that point it was super late so we laid back down and he ended up initiating something again and we were making out and he went down on me and then before I did anything I just told him I didn’t wanna do anything that was gonna make him nervous and then I went down on him and blah blah whatever that all went well and we ended up cuddling and the next morning we were fine we cooked breakfast with our friends and then we went back to our separate rooms and hung out later that day and it was more or less normal but he just wasn’t as affectionate as he normally is. I received barely any attention until I fell asleep and then I started getting cuddles. Then I brought it up to my friends who have also been getting closer to him since I’ve been bringing him around and told them that I thought it was weird that like we didn’t kiss or anything. so eventually he comes over and we cook dinner and watch a movie and he sat on the other side of the room most of the time and when he did come sit with me he didn’t touch me at all. Then we left and worked out and I’ve just been really quiet and distant bc I’m just confused at this point. I wasn’t expecting him to instantly drop on a knee and pull out a ring but we spent the time to dig I to what we felt and what we expected from eachother and then completely went in the opposite direction. Idk if this is grounds for another talk, if I’m just overreacting, I’d I should just give it time or what.

277,"Hello, 
I’m a 24 yo male currently working as a PRN (as needed) Pharmacy Technician at a large level one trauma facility. I work 40 hrs a week. I love my job for it gives me freedom and I can pick shifts when I please. My pay is great and I am greatly appreciated at my employer for the most part. Unfortunately this job does not give me benefits and I am approaching 26 yo. My family is pressing me to get benefits and work more, my father told me I have to much time on my hands and not being productive enough. I’m looking at all options. My current employer does not have any full time positions available, but I was told possibly in the future I could receive a full time job. I did live on my own for sometime but after me and my ex split after 6 years,  I had some big life changes and had to move in with my parents. My current job is about 30 mins away from my house.

I was recently offered a position at a Starbucks again (I used to work for them when I was attending tech school) this store is about 30 mins away from my house as well. If I work 20 hrs minimum I will receive benefits through this company. Pay is minimum wage the commute is in the opposite direction of my house and my other job. If I worked this job I would formulate a schedule so I would only work at one of the locations rather then both on the same day. I need advice!!!! Is this a good idea or just a waste of my time? I went to my family for advice and they shamed me and told me this is completely stupid. I’m confused and not sure what to do.

I’m also a part time college student as of last year, working on my associates in arts right now! My goal is to get a bachelor’s degree in some sort of IT field in the future..... Once I graduate from community college I plan to go full time school at my university of choice. I have always wanted a degree and I can’t drop out. School means so much to me and I just want to obtain a degree. 

I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and just would like some advice for this other job and opinions in general on life. Life has been up and down lately and I’m really trying to stay positive and be productive as possible. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I feel like a failure and a burden to my family, I really want to benefit myself and become a hard working professional with a degree in the future. I appreciate any advice! 

Thank you :)

Much love :)",27Jul2020,1

285,"15 (f) 

Last year, my friend gave this person at my school my phone number. 

This person, I’ll call him Marc, is legally blind. But he calls a lot. I’m sure he’s probably lonely, so I completely understand why he calls so often. 

But we had an issue a few years ago when he would start calling for many hours on end, and then he swore to call every half-hour if he can until 7pm. I told Marc (politely) to stop doing this. But he would not listen. And this was before I had a cellphone, so all our landlines died because of the calls, except on one phone. And so my dad got involved, and we had to block him eventually because this had been going on for a month. 

But last year, someone gave him my cellphone number. And he’s better with calls now. But he can talk for two or three hours. And he still does call a lot, just not as much as before. I don’t have the heart to block him because I feel like he’s lonely and just wants a friend. But I always need to work my day around his calls, or sometimes I don’t have the mental energy (which I know sounds weird, but I’m quite introverted, so things like this are a bit draining to me at times). 

It started to become an issue when he would voice-text me saying “Emergency, call me now”. Or “call me now, it’s an emergency”. Or “emergency SOS, call me now”. And it’s never an emergency.  But I call anyways just in case there is an emergency, and it scares me so much. I talked to him about this and he would say he “accidentally” text emergency SOS 

I want to talk to him about the calls. But I don’t want to be rude. How can I talk to him?",27Jul2020,1

\*note\* for the numerical scale, 1 is ""you're complaining about nothing"" and 10 is ""GET A PSYCHIATRIST"" (not making fun of those who have one. I have one too. He diagnosed me with PTSD a few months ago). 

Hi there. Yes, you probably read the title right. I'm going to give a brief rundown on my brief life, and I'd like you to tell me if I have had a traumatic life or not. Also, yes, I'd like you to give me a number on a 1-10 scale, if at all positive. Numbers are easier to look at and rationalize, for whatever weird reason, and it really helps me to have a definite number. I have issues deciding anything for myself (shrug), so I keep either downplaying my life or blowing it up, I haven't quite decided yet. Hopefully this helps.

Also, if you have any suggestions for what I need to do, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much, and hopefully I write this concisely, haha. Also, if it matters, I'm a 24 year old female. 

\*note: please be brutally honest with me and give me a correct number, if at all possible\*.

\-Age 3: Nearly drowned, and remember it vividly (i.e. water rushing down my throat, blacking out, hospital, etc. etc.) I also almost drowned 3 more times (9: My sexual a\*user tried to drown me; 13: I hit the water in the middle of the night and almost couldn't figure out which way was up; 16-17: I nearly fell asleep under water until the lifegaurd pulled me out). Moral of the story? Water and I don't mix.

\-Age 4: Parents divorced (not really traumatic but sets up other events in the story).

\-Age 5-7: Had a s\*x dream that was in first person where a man was having slightly graphic s\*x with me (he was on-top of me and thrusting) (for perspective: the man in my dream was Brock from Pokemon, and we were being watched by the characters from Blues Clues). \*To my knowledge I was never s\*xually abused by a man, but I also have no idea what could've happened, I had a lot of men in and out of my life around this time, one who was acused of hurting a young person\*. 

\-Age 8: Was kicked out of the house in the middle of the night (10 pm or so) and watched my mom's boyfriend at the time grab her by the hoodie and ripping it while throwing her down the stairs in front of our/her house. (he k\*lled himself 1-3 years later). 

\-Age 9-10 or 11: Was se\*ually abused by my slightly older cousin (2 years older and F) which finally ending with her full on r\*ping me.

\-Age 11-18: Lived with my potentially emotionally a\*usive father in which he: told me he'd kill my cat if she got pregnant when I was 11 and was 100% serious (""I'll put her in a pillow case and toss her in the river""), would scream in my face when angry (happened once a week from 9 until 17-18), called my mother names in front of us, told me my mom didn't love me and only wanted me for money (11-14), locked himself in his room for 2 days and refused to speak to me or my siblings (I was 14 and he was the only parent in the house, sister was 16, brother was 12), has said he would k\*ll himself a few times, called me a liar and an attention seeker when I told him I wanted to k\*ll myself at 15, has grabbed my sister and I by the front of our shirts at least once to threaten us, made a s\*xual comment about my body once when I was 13-14 (he told me I was popular with the boys because of my chest and then proceeded to stare into my eyes while making boob-squeezing motions at his chest), I tried to save a ladybug from drowing (as he was trying to drown it) only for him to grab it out of my hand and smoosh it right next to me while making the scariest face I'd ever seen, like he was going to hurt me, etc. etc. He's gotten better as I've gotten older, but mostly for my brother. Still, he's gotten better, so at least that's a positive.

\-Age 15: Developed an eating disorder (Bulimia Nervosa) as my parents constantly called me fat and ugly (I asked my dad if I was pretty and he said ""if you lost weight and put on makeup yeah"") and my Mom would yell at me once or twice and ask ""what happened to you"". Thankfully, I no longer purge and have been purge free for almost two years :)

\-Age 18: Had an emotionally a\*usive boyfriend who would make me cry for fun, lied to me about several important things (he was supposed to be a senior at his age, but he was a freshman and didn't tell me on purpose, his cousin had to tell me), told me he'd murder then r\*pe my corpse if I didn't sleep with him using an Avenged Sevenfold song. (This isn't me reading too much into things, he literally told me ""if you and I don't start doing stuff soon, this is what is going to happen"" in a completly dead/angry voice), tell me if I didn't give him the names of my guy friends then they'd take me to the woods and r\*pe me there (this was AFTER he found out what my cousin did to me), and messeged me for three years trying to get back together. I, stupidly, tried to talk to him as I was afraid he'd kill himself, but then one day I decided that I didn't care anymore (maybe harsh, but still) and blocked him after telling him to not talk to me and to not contact me, as this was healthier for both of us. By the way? This was after 1 1/2 *months* of dating. It wasn't long term AT ALL.

That was pretty much the full list. Writing it out, it almost doesn't feel like much. Regardless, I'm curious as to what you might think (number wise) and if you have any advice for me. Anyway, have a great evening/day, and I look forward to the responses. Bye!

287,"Flirting with (m)y best female friend

Ok so this is my first text post so advice would definitely be appreciated. Long story short I have feelings for my best friend and need advice on if and how I should proceed.

  I recently caught heavy feelings for my best female friend, we’re both sophomores in high school and are super close. We became really close after I went to her vacation home with her family for two weeks, and we kinda bonded over our exes, she is bi and got played by a female junior that moved (at this point in time we were freshmen). And I just got out of a relationship that got toxic very quickly. So naturally it was platonic.

Until recently 

It started the middle of quarantine, in my country the quarantine rules were strict; you could only hang out with one person from another household. so we hung out a lot just on bike rides and such. One late night of texting around 2/3AM we started jokingly sexting abt food. Ik how it sounds, she would send a picture of like, bread and be like “Ik how bread  turns you on😈” and I would reply with a picture of like a banana and be like “I think you know what to do with this 😏” and it went on for a good hour and progressed but nothing actually sexting. We hung out a lot more and I started to feel something, and I started getting the feeling she felt something too.

This type of joking sexting also re happened but with holes (it’s another weird joking thing but with the same vibe as ^^^^) 

She also drunk snapped me an entire 15 minutes rant of her saying how much she genuinely cared abt me and how I am important to her, but she never specified in which way which got me curious so naturally I asked our mutual friend to ask how she felt (ik This is an elementary school move but I had to know) 

The (very reliable) friend came back and said “I’m not gonna tell you exactly but I honestly can’t tell, ik she cares abt you and has thought abt it, but she’s just so vague and honestly it’s anyone’s guess”

At this point in time I was literally dying to know and would still flirt with her but no major moves because she’s soo important to me I don’t want to be hasty and mess it up. 
 
Which brings us to the present, she came with my family on vacation to a city,(she’s sleeping in the other room rn) and here’s the highlights of the trip I think its flirting but who knows:

We were laying down on an L shaped couch and were Lowkey getting closer and closer while watching a how I met your mother, she was comparing me to ted and I was comparing her to robin but shorter and more of a bottom

We were laying down looking up at the sky at night, she got up and I asked hand to help get up and she said “this is why I top”, I replied “nah just wanted an excuse to hold your hand” then we just jokingly talked abt that like “gosh Matt your such a simp” and id reply “nah I’m too gay for that (I’m straight but it’s a running joke”

Talked for like 2 hours on the couch no phones abt literally life politics relationships feet, at one point in time she was showing them off (in a joking way it’s a bit) and we were joking abt how cute they are, how It’s getting to me and how scandalous she was

We were walking in the elevator, and she was tapping on the elevator with her acrylic nails (it’s a bit) and I would jokingly grab her wrists to get her to stop, she would Lowkey struggle but then she stopped and just looked at me with her cute ass brown eyes and I literally just died and we were quiet for a bit Lowkey holding hands, then the elevator opened up and we got out like nothing happened

We were trying to move some furniture in my room and I “accidentally” was moving a piece of furniture directly in her way and she fell onto my bed and said in a joking mannar “dang(fake name) ik you wanted to get me in bed but this” I was caught off guard so I went “I mean....” and we continued like nothing happened”

Yesterday we went to an antique shop and were wondering around an attic and we were completely alone, and I joked abt a theres probably a ghost looking at us. And then dared her to flash the ghost, she did (I wasn’t facing the direction and it was just her shirt) and afterward she said she would flashes it all if she was wearing a different bra. 

These are just the highlights of the week and idk what I should do because I really care abt her, all ik is I have been waking up at 5 am with her in my head and it sucks cause I like to sleep.

Any advice Reddit?",27Jul2020,1
288,"Throwaway Account. 

A gf (34) of mine (32m) is a methamphetamine addict. Looking at her youd never know. Shes a functioning addict. Sleeps regularly, eats regularly, has a decent job. Shes been using consistently since she was 12 (when her mother got her started). She has all of her teeth. No skin defects. Shes actually very attractive. 

Anyhow - she has only recently began speaking about quitting. Getting clean. She suffers from severe depression and anxiety. In the past she has been suicidal. Not within last 4 years though.  

She is a  contract laborer so therefore has no insurance (we're in America - Texas - Houston area). She has been to a rehab 15 years ago and she didnt gain anything from it. Given that she has no insurance what options do we have to get her help? She does not want to go to a rehab because that'd mean losing her job. She has a home, car and other bills. She is fairly confident that she can get clean on her own (I'd be helping her as well - i do not, nor have i ever used). But, she is scared of the reintroduction into society as a non user. 

This is what she sent me earlier:

""It's the anxiety of going in public.
It's the finding new friends.
It's the running into old friends.
It's the inevitable failures that are sure to happen.
It's the finding out who I really am.
And the finding out of who I've been.
It's the idle time and having nothing to fill it with.
It's the reality of life that scares the shit out of me.""

So my question is - what can she and i do at our level to help her overcome some of these obstacles?

TIA.",27Jul2020,1
289," So I started smoking weed back in October 2019, let me give you a brief that I have been unhappy for the longest time and quite a lonely person, not much friends and those that were there, left. Very few remain.
I have been sad and depressed for a while ( not diagnosed) and 1 of my mates told me to try hash.
I was reluctant at first because I never smoke or drank before that day at all and looked down upon people who did so, but since I was sad I tried it and boy did it feel good, I had the most amazing gut paining laugh in my entire life and it was almost blissful, I felt happy again but it sadly lasted for a short while when the effect wore off. After that day I have been doing weed/hash almost everyday but due to lockdown I am unable to get weed so I started to smoke cigarettes, I don't like cigs but I just do it for the ""hit"". Never in a million years I thought I was come to this, I actively lift 6 days a week, follow my diet strictly but I have been smoking alot these months, idk what's the correlation is between smoking and sadness, I need help and advice, thank you.",27Jul2020,1

292,"I need some advice on what to do. Or if there’s anything I can do. This is going to be really long I’m sorry but I have to explain everything. 

So I, a female, over 18, live in an apartment complex with my dad and my dad tends to hang out with the most ghetto people he can find. That’s just the people he attracts. 

He likes to hang out outside drinking beers all day with this one guy, we will call him Max. 

I’d like to add that max is a druggy. Max brought over heroine and tried to get my dad to do it. But my dad tells him no. After I overheard that situation I told my dad to never let that guy in our apartment ever again. 

Max and my dad still hang out but they only hang out outside now. 

lately my dad has been noticing max has been checking out underage girls and commenting about how hot they are. Well my dad is like what the f*** and yells at max. So my dad stops hanging out with him for the rest of the night. 

I keep telling my dad how sketchy the guy is and he needs to stop hanging out with him but my dad isn’t the brightest and still does. 

Well fast forward a week and they’ve been hanging out and drinking ALL day outside and my dad notices max checking out young girls again. He yells at him and I guess max shows him pictures of young girls on his phone. I’m not sure what the pictures were. If they were child porn or what. Next max threatens to basically rape ME and my dad gets mad and goes after him. Well max gets a machete and starts threatening my dad. The neighbors I guess recorded a lot of it. 

I’m not sure how it all went down as I only heard from my aunt about it, my dad talked to my aunt after the situation. My dad didn’t want to tell me for some reason. 

But I’m wondering if we should tell the apartment managers? If they will even do anything about it? I’m hoping to get him evicted. Especially since he’s such a danger to everyone. His wife works for the state and she I believe is a druggy too. That’s a whole ‘nother story. 

But I’m kinda scared about what the guy will do. I’m nervous he will try to break into my apartment one day. 

My dad I guess is pressing charges. The police didn’t arrest him because the jail is full but he’s had the cops called on him plenty of times and they never seem to want to arrest him for some reason. 

I definitely need some advice.",27Jul2020,1

Also do about 10 hours a week unpaid yet any overtime I do gets rounded down even if it’s 10 minutes off the full hour.

She also told me that she was his second choice abd that he was talking to another girl. I asked her “are you sure you don’t like this guy cuz it sounds like u do” and she said “ eh but I don’t wanna be with him because I know things and I wanna find someone that’s worth my time” When she left she texted me and said “im going to go to bed so goodnight, it was fun playing with you abd getting to know you” we actually have a bit in common too.

304,"I have an immuno-compromised mom, I guess. She's very frantic about this covid ordeal. Well, here's the issue. In October, my dad's work is going to start *requiring* their employees to go back to the office to work. Problem is, my mom doesn't want my dad coming back to the house possibly carrying the virus because my mom is convinced the virus will do a toll on her health. 

So now, the only option my dad has left is to retire. Yes, my dad with 3 children, 2 just starting college, and 1 in the middle of medical school. Is my family fucked? I think so. My dad's plan is just to go back to work after this covid stuff dies down, but I highly doubt he will be able to find work. 1, he's old, technically a senior by now. 2, he's got some obsolete knowledge in his working field, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for him to learn the new trends in his field.

I'm very worried. I don't think I can trust my school and the government to support my family financially. Hell, the college my sister will start to attend didn't give us shit in financial aid even though we've got 3 kids in higher education concurrently. 

What do I do? I swear my family's going to become severely burdened with financial issues because we're trying to get 3 kids through school. And I'm not confident I'll be able to get employed after I graduate, especially if the economy doesn't fare well when I get out of school.

I'm also not sure about working while in school because I'm struggling in school as is without any other distractions.

Can someone help, direct me to resources that will help my family out? I've no hope in scholarships because I applied to so many in high school and my freshman year in college, but received none. I don't know what else to do. Sure, I'll try scholarships again but I'm not a genius in school nor is my financial situation so dire that a scholarship committee will want to help my family. I also don't really have a sob story, and I'm pretty average demographic-wise.",27Jul2020,1

I have no idea wtf this is, is it a scam? my boyfriend tells me to put the money in my bank but im scared itll somehow give these people my bank info if its a scam. hes telling me to transfer it to him but i dont think thats a good idea either. also my bf said he cant see the transaction of the $250 on his venmo, only the $0.01. now the persons asking for the money back - they only have one friend which seems sketch.

311,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a year now with the best communication either of us have ever had. We understand time and space is important so when we do hang out it isn’t every day of the week, 24/7. Our time together is always valued which I think we both appreciate. I’ve fallen head over heels for this girl so quickly and she is the best thing to happen to me by far in my life; I feel guilty saying this because I don’t want her to ever know that and feel obligated to me so it feels nice to type out. We’ve both grown together a lot in such a (relatively) short time and learned each other through important mistakes followed by honest communication. Things have only been better by the day so I would say things are at their best currently which is where the dilemma comes in... about a month ago she brought up the idea that she is 100% she isn’t going to be able to put the effort in for our relationship when she goes off to university. 

This was heartbreaking but ultimately we made the choice to spend the summer together and make the best of the time we have together. The thing tearing my heart apart is that she accepted it what seems so easily and now doesn’t seem upset about the situation. I feel like just an experience to her that will be brushed under her belt and not truly loved anymore. After crying on a video call with her about just being overwhelmed with how soon her leaving is approaching she only tells me she’s accepted it and is sorry. Why am I so upset with the fact she has accepted it ? It hurts me so much because this has been so difficult for me but why not her ? 

The other part eating away at me is that I feel like such an asshole for those feelings. I want it to be easy for her in no way do I want her to have to go through unnecessary pain but why does this toxic side of me shine through in my mind ? I just want advice on if I should bring these feelings up to her and if so, how ?

314,"So I went to witness a baseball game my son wanted to be enrolled in that was more or less just decided on by the other side of his family.

I saw close to 70 folks with no masks on in a big city in the South shore MA.. I was shocked nobody at all was wearing a mask where it was crowded, seriously nobody and I assumed the city had some sort of safety regulations enabled for kids sports.

I Stayed in the car and was able to see the field. It rained out quickly before it began.

Both sides agreed before on how serious this virus was, and our families needs to be safe. 

I assumed we were all continuing to take cautions with crowds at the very least, and understand the need for PPE. 

I was hesitant about the sports, and was upset to begin with, but gave hope to see if people actually were somewhat smart about it...

I’m at risk for my health for something like a pneumonia causing virus..

My son has been telling me lately we don’t need masks on and it doesn’t matter. 

There is now the impression there is no risk from the other side of the family to my son.

In addition my spouse's contract requires her and everyone she has contact with to follow all CDC guidelines and all who are around.

I picked my son up upset from what I witnessed at this baseball mock game, but could not turn him down when he ran over to the car and opened the door, it also started to rain.

I mentioned it to my spouse right away and mother while also taking images of the whole activity and crowd.

I am afraid I may not be able to see him if the other side of the family is not at the very least practicing some sort of safety moving forward. 

Or if I’m now exposed to something from my son.

Am I overthinking this?

I don’t understand at this point what to do after seeing nearly a whole sports team and crowd with a no masks agenda.

I’m assuming it’s nearly the majority of the city at this point.

I am in a different city a lot more north.

316,"Hi so i’m an 18 year old female who recently started working. Well our crime rate is high where i live and people have been know for stealing wallets and such mostly targeting woman since our wallets are bigger and we don’t carry them in our pockets usually. Well at work peoples wallets started to loose some cash or cards randomly so i decided to carry mine on my person using a “mans” wallet at work (i work in fast food we can’t have purses hanging on our shoulders while working) but i’ve noticed when out and about i get strange looks and scoffs one person even saying “you’re to pretty to have a wallet. Don’t you have a boyfriend?” Anyway Should “men’s” wallets be more acceptable for everyone to use? i mean if anyone can help make this a socially acceptable issue it’s reddit since this is where all the trends come from even though we never get the credit and facebook steals it.

317,"So it’s me and my parents and my sister at dinner and my parents are both casually drinking (I guess not that casual because I had to drive us all home), and we get home and I pull my mother aside to talk get her advice on something pretty personal to me. She starts getting a bit combative as she clearly doesn’t agree with what I’m saying, so she asks my dad for some backup.

My dad comes over, hardly knowing what we’re talking about but he absolutely loves my mom so he tries his best. He says something and my mom points out how stupid it was (it really wasn’t that stupid, but my mom is a smart woman so I just let it slide). We talk a bit more and my dad brings up a story that would help with the conversation, and my mother cuts him off saying again how ridiculous and dumb he is. He is confused and just trying to help, which I say, but she gets angrier and starts cursing.

I ask her why she’s being so hard on him when he’s just trying to help, and that if she wants to continue then she could just tell him what she wants him to talk about or tell him why what he’s saying is wrong. She is not hearing it, she’s cursing and yelling and leaves, telling me to just talk to my dad if I’m so defensive of him. My dad tries and I figured I would just drop it because it would make things worse for them. 

My mom gets even madder and leaves, saying I think she’s insane “just like during every vacation” and I’m getting emotional now because she’s my damn mom, and keeps storming off. She turns around and continues arguing, then getting in my face and hitting the walls with her hand. I tell her I’m not having a conversation with her if she’s going to be violent and yell and curse. She tells me I have to grow up by shouting in my face, then stomps away screaming.

After about an hour of my mom yelling at my dad, throwing things, slamming cabinets. and insulting me every time she passes by, here I am sitting on the couch with a microwave burrito, as my mom sleeps in the guest bedroom. 

This happens about once a week or two, and it always starts with my mom somehow. She is absolutely terrible to my dad at times like this, telling him how much of a screw up and how stupid he is (in much worse language). He just sits there and takes it because of both his respect for her and his knowing that it will never end otherwise. 

It addles me because she is an intelligent woman, but she never admits she is in the wrong. I can’t help but beat myself up wondering whose fault it is every time something like this happens.",27Jul2020,1

I feel love yeah but that's really it I feel happiness. But I dont feel guilt or empathy I dont feel guilt for stealing from people the only people I dont steal from is because I dont wanna mess shit up for such a low little reward that has nothing to gain everybody else though I dont care if I steal. I love stealing pickpocketing anything like that I love pulling it off and trying to it's so much fun and for no one to know it's so much satisfaction. I am in live with it.

I've even started digging through everything and drawing up a diagram of the business in hopes it will give me a better idea of what I'm missing out on but even that doesn't help.

I'm certain that I need help, but because I'm a bit higher in the ranks, there are higher expectations of me, and I'm afraid that asking for help in this regard, would be used against me in a review.

No more to add, lets get started.

I´m a 22 years old (m) kinda introvert and depressive, while growing up (from primary to high school) i met a bunch of new people but only made click with a few, this people ended up becoming friends of my, at least a group of 15 teenagers were formed, over time this group got smaller so my ""real"" group of friends were of 6 , F, O, N, V, L, J and me , we had incredible experience together and went through bad times too where we also support each other and finally consider ourselves a little family, but family's aren´t always perfect, about a year ago everything went to shit when F and I discovered that N sexually abused of a girl (external friend of the group lets call her P), he admitted doing it so F and I cancelled him, despite that the rest of the group stayed with him (even the girl). So its a while since F and I got kinda isolated from the rest and I feel really bad for it cause i talked with the rest about not force them to choice between us (N and I) cause i think that can be selfish in some way. But now everything is different, 3 days ago the ex of V contact me through Instagram (we are still friends, she is very cool) to tell me that she was abused psychologically while she was in the relationship with V, telling shit to her while he was drunk and stuff, hitting the walls, being mean when she didn't wanted to have sex, etc. I was very surprise, but in someway it made sense to me, because i know how V is when he is drunk (jerk) and he never speak to much about his feelings, the one that shock me was when she told me that V raped her when she was blacked out after a drinking session in the beach for new year with the others (i was working/drinking in my job that night) V was the designed driver so he didn't drink even a single drop of alcohol, so this girl went blacked out and woke up with him on top of she doing it. Now i´m the only one she told this, idk what to do, i feel like a have a very big burden in my shoulders and i´m only hoping she making this public (it seems that its the way she is going to follow but not sure enough) police and justice are not an option cause in my country it doesn't exist (people with money and rapers in general don´t get any sentences in this country apparently)

His mom and dad know about the situation because they saw the video. &amp; soon this will spread like wildfire to his friends.

I'll make this as short as possible, one year ago my bf and I went out drinking. I brought him home since i was the most sober, took him to bed and went to the bathroom, changed and went to sleep. So apparently I woke up a couple of hours later and went to sleep in his roommates bed. Now I have no recollection of how I got there, I only remember waking up and being mortified his roommate is 70, married. I left as soon as possible and went back to my room. His son had filmed me walking around the house, now his wife thinks I had an affair with her husband.  However this night I hadn't blacked out and it happened after I fell asleep. My boyfriend has caught me sleep walking before, 3 different times, one just going into the bathroom and staring at the mirror for half and hour. Walking him up and telling him we would miss. our train of he didn't get up. Standing in front of our room and hitting my head against the door. As well as not being able to sleep for days and sleep for 2 days straight.
All of those I dont remember, having full on conversations with my parents &amp; so on. I dont know what I can do, we are indian and that generation doesnt believe in sleepwalking.

But when I came back my family has legit cleared up all my stuff, my room, my desk, my cupboard EVERYTHING. They didn't even ask or tell me anything before doing it. I mean I'm still a daughter in the family and I deserve my rights in the home but since I was away for 4 weeks my family decided it was their right to invade my personal space. In fact invading was okay but checking all my personal documents, books, clothes and just throwing anything they thought was trash is not okay. Some of those things has my memories and they just wrapped it up with plastic wrap or threw it away.

I had a dream the other night that he killed himself. It felt so real and I woke up horrified. He’s been suicidal for a very long time, but at least when I was with him I felt sure he would stay alive. Since that dream I have been so worried. I don’t know what to do. I can’t reach out, he broke up with me and it is clearly not my place anymore to make sure he is OK. I have so much anxiety surrounding this and I feel such a heaviness when I think about it. I can’t tell if it’s irrational or not. I don’t want to look back on this feeling and regret not doing more, but I don’t know what more I can do. I guess I’m just looking for any sort of advice or relief from this feeling.",27Jul2020,1
337,"Hi everyone, I am asking for any advice I can get because I feel like I am handling things the wrong way. I feel bad when maybe I shouldn't or half should. There is so much I feel a need to mention and I hope it doesn't bother to read through.

So my 24 year old brother last year in December began to live with us because he couldn't handle being with my dad. Because of the type of person I've grown to know my dad as, my mom and I welcomed him to live with us.
Things started off stable, he had a warehouse job that had him leaving really early because of distance and he always came back in the afternoons just in time for dinner. After a few weeks though we began to notice that he was bringing someone over and that he smelled like weed alot. I don't know much about weed and if it has any adverse effects at all but it wasn't tolerated at my mom's and I think he should have respected that. When we saw him with someone else on the cameras we laughed it off because of how comical it was catching him on the cameras try to sneak behind the cars with his friend. They'd wear hoodies to cover up their faces. 
Eventually though my mom had to talk about it with him and that's when he confessed to her his bisexuality and that it was actually a man that was coming over. To be honest it was something told confidently that maybe I shouldn't have known but it didn't matter because months later I saw a grindr notification from his phone. I didn't have a problem with it and was more worried about how she would react. I told her that she has to love him no matter what and she agreed but she still took it hard. I had to forgive my mom a bit for her catholic and traditional upbringing but I am glad she still loved him and had him stay even if it's going to take some getting used to for her. It isn't really a big part of all this but the fact that he was involved with hook-up culture bothered her even more especially when he confessed that he had slept with the neighbor before he even moved in (we already knew he was Gay and was actually really nice so we still have a good connection with him). That was something else my mom told me that was confidential but when my brother knew I knew he was ok with discussing it. I'm glad he could express his personal interest to me but when he ""swore to God"" that the only man he had ever slept with was boyfriend I began to realize that he was lying and telling everyone something different. It reminded me of the time he told me he tried cocaine only once but I think about how that could be a major lie.
Even though this isn't much to be mad about things got worse. I've written alot already so It's best I describe his behavior as it has been, unchanging. When we were forced to move to our knew house in the midst of Quarantine he had already been laid off from work. Even after things calmed down though he got really lazy and didn't try hard to get a job. He would barely fill up applications and less so actually turn them in. To interviews he showed up with a bad haircut, bad attire, and High. My sister told me that he's always been like this, never wanting to work (She lived with my dad too). Even after something went wrong with his car motor and he was left in the streets because he had already used up his 5/5 free  tows that year, he wasn't motivated enough to get his car working.
 Instead he initially was desperate for money asking my mom for 20 and telling her that he would promise to get a job, asking my sister with her 2 daughters for money , and asking me for 5 dollars. I told him I lost them and his response was to go through my room moving everything to find it. That's when we started to think he was doing something else. 
Even after that he was bring his boyfriend over (Idk if they are officially a thing) and sneaking him into his room, a small trailer in the back yard, and feeding him our food that we were really struggling to afford (both of them don't work). When my mom scowled him about it he then started to leave for another town in the middle of the night. I don't know what he ever did over there but we were afraid since he always just disappeared without a trace and then would later ask for a ride home. There was never any shame from him. 
After some time he finally stopped disappearing but instead would bring over his lover again and repeat everything. My other brother even found out that he was letting his boyfriend/lover shower in our bathroom behind our backs, using our things. Now when he came back I was also worried because he wasn't asking for money anymore and still was able to get his hands on weed. 
Now I know people probably think the weed isn't a problem but he now is starting to drink and have hangovers with his boyfriend who comes and goes secretly. I am afraid he might by using pills too because I can't understand how someone would let marijuana alone take over every aspect of their life (as far as I know weed isn't addictive).


Now my mom by this time was suffering occasional swelling in the gallblatter but she was worried about the expenses and I never managed to convince her to go to the hospital (I can't remember her ever going to a doctor for her own needs) When my mom was eventually sent to the emergency room after she had Kidney stones and an almost bursting Gallblatter from three years of letting things get really bad, we were all left shocked. The only things I knew before I had to let her stay overnight and go home was that the she had high blood sugar, a liver infection from the Kidney stones, and an almost bursting gallblatter that swelled up three times it's normal size. Tbh I know these things are sort of common and maybe I was being super dramtic but hearing about those that have died in the midst of surgery and seeing how far things got with her,  I was left that whole night hoping the person I most loved wouldn't die without being able to do anything, it was a nightmare. 
Her surgery was that next day as things were really dire and action needed to be done quick but she is strong and got better quick. The doctors had told her that she can't stress out. I was the one who told my brother he had to get his act together or get out, he promised me he would change. I wanted to believe him because my brother looked at promises no better than dirt, constantly lying and promising things only to act half-sorry. He had an attitude too. Always swearing and getting mad when we woke him up in the afternoon (because he never slept either). It was overall a very negative mindset and with him I felt my mindset fall to terrible place, always stuck at home with someone who had little regard for the rest of us.
After what happened though, I thought this was a second chance to do right, he could finally get a job and help my mom out with payments. 
Unfortunately nothing changed, I was hoping that if anything he would quit it for awhile but just when we were ready to pick my mom up, he was in charge of going to pick her up but was high and that right of the bat was going to stress her out, I went instead. Everything irresponsiblle thing he did and every promise he broke from there on hurt 10 times worse because I knew that nothing would change him for the better. 

The truth is there would be nowhere else for him to go after us, he wouldn't want to go with my dad, he already had to move out from my sister's, we want to get him internalized in rehab but for what? Smoking? We don't know the life that he hides from us. He says that rehab is for ""weak minded people"". I don't think his boyfriends place wanted either of them. Even if he did go with them though, he would be in a house with robbers and a prostitute who would be exchanged drugs and I couldn't imagine what that would do to him. It's either that or the streets, my mom doesn't want to kick him out, she can't bare to imagine what he would turn out to do with his life. She even talked to him this morning about it, telling him he would have to go but he promised he would never bring his lover over again, except when he went to buy a lighter I decided to go and check if someone was there. Honestly I do feel terrible for invading his privacy but feel worse that I was right. Having to discover him there, us seeing eye to eye without ever having any other interaction felt wrong.

 I just want to help my older brother but I don't even know the truth, he used to be so different, clean and all about manners but now he let's maggots rot in his room with pee bottles everywhere. It feels agonizing to watch him ruin all the open opportunities that come and go. I don't want my mom to stress out anymore but it's all that we can think about and I don't want to be the one that tells him he needs to go because I know we'd just be kicking him to the curb without even a car. I want him to start going up in life, but if he gets a job or fixes his car, I want it to be because he wants to and not because we have to demand him to do things. If there is any professional help I can contact too please help me get started somewhere. I sometimes feel like I don't do or say enough, but then I also feel like he doesn't trust me because I push him to do better all the time. If there is also any advise or suggestions I should take to understand things better or help him understand his behavior then please send them my way.",27Jul2020,1
338,"So, this thing isn’t as bad as others you’ve seen here, but still... I’d like help.

A couple of years ago, I got anxiety because of bullying, and whenever someone does something that reminds me of it (e.g. name calling) I go into my own little headspace and just get super duper worked up, like, my anxiety just skyrockets at that point.

Anyhow, I’ve been dating a girl for the past four months, and she’s my first ever proper girlfriend because well... so many people weren’t interested in me. I love her, and she loves me, it’s just that whenever we see each other at school, she shows little affection to me because her friends usually call her names whenever I go to hug her and such, and she’s afraid of that.

Her friends also call me names, which, as I said before, induces my anxiety and makes me feel absolutely horrible for the rest of the day. I really want to spend more time with her, but the people she hangs out with just ruin our time together, any advice on how I can approach this?",27Jul2020,1
339,"I am renting a carriage house in British Columbia, Canada. The carriage house is a separate building, located away from the main house, you actually cannot even see the main house from the carriage house, as the house is up on a hill and the carriage house is down below, with lots of trees in between. Our driveways are separate, actually the driveway to the carriage house actually comes out onto a completely different street than than the main house, but we are on the same property. 

There is a small garage type space connected to our rental unit. It is maybe 6 ft, by 20ft, not big enough for a car, but lots of storage. It has an exterior door entering into the garage space, as well as a door entering into it from inside our suite. When we moved in, our landlord said he would like to keep access to the garage space to store his kayaks, and winter tires. We said no problem. The suite was advertised as private, and he claimed he would not be around much, except if he needed to grab his tires, or his kayaks. Totally reasonable. 

Since moving in, he has been a terrible landlord. He hadn’t done any of the things he said would be done before we moved in when moving day came, (he had many things stored around the rental suite outside, truck canopy, tools, broken down lawnmower etc that he said would be moved but never were) and he has not kept his word about not being around and the suite being private. He is constantly outside our unit, coming into our fenced backyard to grab his tools he stores there, coming and going from the garage space, he walks in and out through our gate and driveway, his child hangs out on the lawn right outside our windows and also comes and goes from the garage space and stores his toys in there. 

There is nothing in our rental agreement about the “shared” garage space. It is not mentioned at all. I guess what I am asking is if I could get a mediator and claim that he is coming into my unit without my permission, and violating rights to quiet enjoyment and privacy under the tenancy act. The tenancy act states under the quiet enjoyment section that the renter has sole use of the rental unit. Since the garage space is part of the building we are renting, can we prohibit him from coming in and using it. Also can we prohibit him from storing his items around the suite, in our fenced backyard etc. 

He also parks his ride on lawn mower that he uses to mow the lawn directly outside one of our windows, and claims he cannot move it anywhere else because it has to be plugged into a trickle charger so it doesn’t die. Since he is plugging it into our unit, he is using our hydro, which is a separate meter, and is paid for by us. Can we make him unplug/move it because he is not allowed to use our hydro when we are paying for it. Separate hydro is for the sole use of the tenant when paid for by the tenant. 

Any advice is appreciated.",27Jul2020,1
340,"I'm a college student at a university that I am, simply and lightly put, unhappy with. Frankly, not a day goes by where I don't regret the university that I have chosen. I'm applying to transfer, but my depressed ass made it nearly impossible for me to get accepted at any of the colleges that I want to attend, and so does my financial situation (I have no one to cosign a loan). In other words, more likely than not, I will be completing my undergraduate education at this university that I hate. 

How do you accept where you are in life, even though you're unhappy? I am constantly consumed with thoughts of what could have been and I know I'll be miserable if I let this go on, so how do make it stop? How do I learn to live with my failures without tearing myself apart every day? How do I cope with this situation and make it to graduation? I just want to be happy.",27Jul2020,1

342,"My mother language is not English, so apologies.
I'm(21f) privileged and I know that, I never had to fight for anything, but yeah I'm working on my diploma etc.
I don't have any real problem but I just can't feel very happy these days, specially today, I've been stuck home for months only seeing my mom, dad and boyfriend, and I think I'm not dealing well with all of these world situation.
Because lots of days I'll just get real sad about really small things like a burned popcorn, a problem with a program, my hair, my face.
Recently I've kinda of ruined my hair, but not much, just so it is orange and awful and that really makes me feel bad, as in I failed myself, and I know that this is really a dumb thing to be so sad about, but is just like I can't help myself. I'm having my pity party and I just wished I wasn't, I've spend most of the day sad and not wanting to feel anything and now that I can sleep and don't feel nothing I just can't.
I just feel so swallow, but so sad and helpless at the same time, cuz I have college things to do but I just don't have the will to do it. I don't want to do nothing. I don't have a game that I really really want to play, or a TV show that I look forward watching it. I feel like I don't have any hobby that brings me joy.
I feel happy talking to my bf, and sleeping, sometimes cooking but I don't want to gain more weight than I've already gained.
And I'm so sick of feeling sorry for myself it's so annoying.
I want to not care about all the people with great hair, and great resolutions for themselves. I want to not feel bad just because I haven't got to the place where I want to be. I want to work(I'm searching for a job, but it's hard), I want to feel good about myself(haven't felt that in a while), I want to see my friends(can't because of quarantine).

344,"A couple of other friends were all drinking and she asked in front of everyone if I could clean a dirty pitcher for her to make a drink in. Out of all the people in the table she asked me for some reason...

I reluctantly agreed, but I could tell that it seemed like she was taking advantage of me because I probably would say yes and the others were giving me looks as if she was.

345,"Okay.. For some context, I am from a country where arranged marriages are the norm and interreligious marriages amd living together are frowned upon. So I fell in love with a guy from another religion almost 8 years ago and even though we have our fair share of fights, we are still going strong. Two years ago, both our families came to know about our relationship which started a huge fight which ended up with me being in  kind of a house arrest situation with suicide threats from my parents until he left abroad for his job. We pretended that we broke up and not in contact anymore. Since then, things have been tense at home and constant jabs at my character and about how ungrateful I am to my parents. I try to not argue back because I am currently stuck after my graduation with no good opportunities for a job or even studies and I have to stay at home until I figure a way out. I keep quite and try not to provoke them as much as possible. Since then,  they have started bringing proposals from all over and eager to set me up for some arranged marriage. I have been failing miserably at convincing them so me and my boyfriend kept trying to find a way to leave my home.  Staying with them has affected my mental health so badly that I keep getting thoughts about suicide and hurting myself. 


In April, I found a job nearby which helps me stay away from home from 8-7 and I had taken hardly 3 or 4 off days in the last 4 months. ( I am a doctor and with the excuse of covid 19, I try to keep my distance with them  even at home.) It's been quite peaceful and I made good friends here. And my colleagues were amazing. Up until now.

Currently I got a learn and earn opportunity not too far away from home but far enough that I will have to stay away. I was selected and I am supposed to join in two weeks. But when I broke the news to my friends here, they lost their shit and they have been acting like I betrayed them??? They do know about my struggles to get away from home and most of my problems but now they are making me feel guilty for leaving. They keep saying that if I planned to leave,then why did I have to be so close to them and since we are really close, it will break their heart if I leave.  I mean I get it,it's coming from a place of love and even I am upset to leave this place( I am a huge introvert and have severe anxiety issues so adjusting to a new place is definitely a small nightmare) but then if I stay at home any longer I will definitely lose myself.
2 days ago,I had to call the hospital and let them know that I am willing to join, and my friends were trying to convince me to not say yes. They kept gulit tripping me and snatched my phone and told that they were going to delete all the contacts. I thought they were joking around until I got back my phone and they had indeed deleted the number which I had to call. Luckily, I had messaged prior to that number so I didn't lose it. And I had sent an email to confirm. Today, I accidentally found out that the HR guy was trying to call me all these time and they had blocked the number so the calls were getting rejected on their own. 
I am definitely pissed off and I really wanted to snap at them but then they are in fact sad that I am leaving. But what they did had definitely crossed a line. 
I don't know what to do. I don't want to start a fight before leaving but then I don't want them to think that they can do something extreme like that and get away with it. Also I feel as if something between us is broken and I am unable to pretend normally with them.",27Jul2020,1
347,"Im 16 and before quarantine, had just arrived at a new high school. Since i didnt have much time to meet people in person, I resulted to texting on Instagram instead. I've met lots of people this way, and I dont mind texting for a few hours as long as they're up for it too. I have no intentions for anything dating related, just friends. One of the girls I texted, we did for a few hours the first time. It was fine, but after that she decided to text me again, everyday. There's only so much to talk about over text, and asking me everyday about what i was doing was a little annoying. We dont have any shared interests either, so i thought she'd just move along. It was so annoying i started to seriously dislike her for a bit. Eventually she caught wind of some of my signals, but it seems like shes ""stalking"" my profile. (liking everything i share, shes the first to react to my posts. Acts friendlier than my own close friends. I have major social anxiety (partly why Im trying to be alot more open) and it scares me that she might like me. I hate rejecting people. I did it once and it was the worst thing ever. Maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe shes just being friendly and Im an asshole. Im not sure. Any thoughts?",27Jul2020,1
348,"My boyfriend and I get along great in person, and I think he's an amazing person/boyfriend, but I often feel like I'm putting in more effort trying to connect with him long-distance wise. It's been even more apparent during quarantine, but I've put up with it until now. The thing is I want to find ways to interact with him and cope with being away for so long, and he's also affectionate in person so that shouldn't be a problem, but he feels more distant when I text or try to find things to do with him.

Part of this has to do with his distaste for texting, which I can mostly manage, but I've been trying to find other ways to communicate like phone calls, playing games together or watching movies, but we can't do phone calls because my internet causes the audio to mess up, we don't have any games to play together (+ he can't use his computer and I don't have a console), and he says he'd rather watch movies together. I've tried telling him before that I'd like it if he'd try to help me work things out so that it's not only me, and at this point it feels like maybe I'm the only one who wants this, but I'm not sure how else to talk to him about this.

350,"There are two types of perfectionists in the world: The first type were told that they're imperfect their whole life. So they do everything they can to turn in the perfect work, often at the detriment of their other aspects of life, or even missing the deadline to triple, quadruple check their work. 

The second type were the smart and talented kids. They take it as granted that their work is good. They could write an essay in a day and get an A. So if they foresee that their work is not going to be good, they flat-out *give up*. 

I'm the latter type. Since I could ace exams, even IB (rigorous high school curriculum) graduation exams, by cramming, I never learned any discipline. I never learned how not to just throw my hands up in the air if I'm falling behind in a class and go, ""I guess I'm failing this class now!""

I didnt hurt her, I just pushed her in the pool and that was it. I never should have done that, but at the same time she shouldn't have bucked at me and approached me the way she did.

Obviously you people aren't psychiatrists but I have trust issues dealing with anybody in the medical field. Its my personal opinion these people only have these jobs because it gives them a good paycheck and solid reputation to their friends. 

I just need help. I dont want medication because I dont want to have to depend on it to be a normal human being. I guess what I'm asking is there anything outside of medication, or talking, and going for walks outside that I can do to make me feel human. 

Nobody wants anything to do with me right now, all because I got upset and started screaming to the skies. Yet my own family treated me like a murderer. If everybody would just leave me the fuck alone when im upset there would never be any problems.

361,"At the beginning of last month my ex dumped me, just said she lost feelings, and then she asked to take me back only to dump me again in a few days because she thinks she just felt jealous I was doing better, so it didn’t end great, and all my friends were friends with her longer, so I’m going into senior year without anyone really... not a single close friend, I’m just gonna be sitting alone for lunch, I won’t get prom, or hanging out with anyone, it feels like I got no one except people I’m related to now. I try to get my mind off everything and be chill and just ride it through as it comes, act like nothing bothers me, but sometimes it gets to me, I don’t really like being alone all the time, and now I’m sitting tearing because idk what to do anymore, I’m lost",27Jul2020,1
362,"I have quite a bit of relationship anxiety and sometimes I have trouble knowing if everything is okay or not/whether or not he’s still interested.

I’ve been in this relationship for ten months now and it is my first. He isn’t a big texter or on his phone as much. He’s usually hanging out with friends so sometimes I won’t hear from him for a couple hours and it can make me really anxious.

Another thing is I’m usually the one texting to make plans. Ofcourse he doesn’t seem annoyed. by it but I would also like for him to ask when we’re gonna hang out again.

When I text him he always texts back though, he’s just not really the type to text for fun. He usually only texts to make plans or if he actually has something to share. Whereas I just text for fun a lor. I’ve accepted his texting habits mostly as he also keeps in contact with me thru social media by sending memes and pics, I just want to learn how to feel okay when he doesn’t text for while and if there is a point where I should worry.

So in conclusion: How do I know everything is still okay in my relationship? And is there a point where I should worry? Also, how to feel more secure being alone and not getting texts from him in a while?",27Jul2020,1
363,"UK resident here, a close friend ive known for years, who isnt the brightest (hot headed, attention loving, womanizer type, sigh) has always been a tad over the line but suddenly he keeps referring to anyone not of his colour as the N word. Its seriously stupid, I dont get why everyone just goes with it, cringes me to the core hearing him say it like he is some hard man. Really want to slap him silly but I know this wouldnt be the best way. But he could easily say it in front of the wrong people. How the hell do I confront him about this?",27Jul2020,1
364,"Me M25 met this broad F25(older than 3 months) that was a mistress to some guy that tried to set us up together. She told me this after we realized the guy started asking weird questions about her whereabouts because she 'blocked him' (I was confused why they stopped communicating) then he tried to refer me to his company. Weird part, his company is in the same building as hers but they don't run into each other.

 Back story, dude is 36, and according to my gf was her close friend first and he was helping her out with her future plans (like advice, career, school, guidance and stuff). She used to stay late at her office cause she didn't have much friends and was always studying, and the guy did the same cause he was trying to beat traffic. Then he talked about how his wife wanted a divorce and he he wanted to marry her instead, even went as far as showing screenshots. My girlfriend is booksmart but I thought she was kind of dum for buying into some shit like that, at least let them divorce first! According to her, she was struggling to find a relationship for some time, which is weird cause she is the total package. They start fucking 4 months after he joined her company and afterwards immigrated to Canada, which he also helped out with. He told her his wife was only here to help his papers and stuff and she was a just a living partner till the divorce is finalized. They get a job at the same company, I presume he helped her with that, and even her next job right after as well. Their relationship lasted 3 years, they had alot of on and offs towards the 3rd year. 

I have been observing the girl from a distance, when we 1st started dating, I asked for past relationships and she told me only about how she got raped by one of my old friends that also tried to set us up 5 months before we met FML (during a period when she tried to cut off the relationship with the married man, PS she went back to the married guy after), but she never mentioned the married guy. Tbh the guy knew his way around words and i even Iooked up to him for career guidance at some point. Until one day when he made an innuendo about how important in my life he was for helping me find a job at his company (which I declined and got a better paying one cause fuck that), and how I met my potential gf through him (even though I maintained we were just friends).

Ngl when my gf told me what happened I broke down in tears. I mean life and love isn't as it seems, but it's hard when you're already committed. I told her I'd stay cause I love her but if I see any sign of communication btw the 2 I'm out.

They had a weird relationship, I was snooping through her emails one time just to know what's going on (she's open with me and I have access to everything - I admit I fucked up) and saw they even went to couples counselling at some point for trust issues. They talked about buying a house together and even almost starting a business together (giving people career advice smh). This man has 2 kids bruh. I told my gf she was a piece of shit and whatnot cause I was pissed, she seems remorseful and all. We all make mistakes, I did not do that level of fuck shit though so it kind of hurts. To make matters worse she had an abortion for the man and the dude that raped her.

It's like eating your cake and having it, I love her honestly. She's smart, helps me be better, supports me and motivates me. But some part of me thinks about that shit and worries about her and karma.

It's 4am and I'm up thinking about this shit lol

Yh I told the guy to cut the fuckshit, the jig is up, I broke up with her, and stay the fuck away from me. I and my girl have been together for 7 months now, and yes it's been a madness, she told me this in our 2nd/3rd month.

What do I watch out for, does it always end up badly? What do you think? Or am I living in the past?",27Jul2020,1

371,"Hey all,

So my brother has been caught with edibles before and we (me and my parents) had a small talk with him about why he should not be having it at such a young age. He doesn’t exactly do much exercise and pretty much spends his time playing video games (a lot of the time).

However, just last night when everyone was sleeping, I heard a few footsteps race down and open the door. After like 10 minutes I heard a car drive off, the front gates slam, and my brother comes back up the stairs. Mentioned to his mates (he plays games until late)  he’s got “nice stuff” with him. I could hear all the sounds like the bags of edibles etc. I first thought he was making food but took a few sniffs and it defo didn’t smell like it.

Now both my parents have smoked weed before and so do I sometimes (never in front of my brother) so we are quite well educated on that matter. The only issue is, what do I do? Do I rat him out? How should I talk to him about it?. I’m just really concerned because he really isn’t active and constantly plays games and I just don’t think it’s a great thing for a 14 year old. Last time, we just took the edibles off him but what would be a better idea this time?",27Jul2020,1
372,"Alright, this might sound crazy but I will try my best to fully explain my problem. Whenever I slightly think about certain things or hear someone talk about certain topics that 'trigger' certain thoughts in my head, such as a house getting robbed or someone dying, I get super paranoid that what I've heard or said to myself/others is gonna ""backfire and jinx"" on me or in my life. The reason i feel this way is because in the past I've had subconscious thoughts that 'I've let slide' and later on in life these same thoughts have appeared and happened (kinda like karma or some shit idk, not that i've even done anything wrong by ""letting this thoughts slide""), and when i realise how everything ""lined up"" i remember how i had a thought and didn't ""pray against it"". Because of this i ALWAYS find myself saying things like ""god forbid \_\_\_ happens""/""no jinxing with \_\_\_"" constantly everyday and i over pray.. sometimes praying about the same thing 10 times within a few minutes, saying the same things to myself and God. And it drives me crazy. If someone can help remove the feeling/thoughst of thinking things are gonna jinx because i didn't pray against a thought or statement, it would be greatly appreciated man. Because the way im living right now is like im walking on ice and i feel if i forget to pray, that certain thing/thought will end up happening in life in a different/similar fashion",27Jul2020,1
373,"I've always presumed I would have a child in my life, I'm not sure why but it just felt like I would and that was that. It felt like the natural thing to me and something I always wanted. I expected to have them by 25, although I never had a serious relationship until I was 26. I'm 30 now.

My wife, who I married in 2019, is 35 (cougar). She already has two children from two different failed relationships. She has said that she would have never considered having any more kids with anyone else but she's willing to do it for me as it's such a big thing for me. We've been trying recently but no success yet. 

However she's 35 so already at an age where things are more likely to go wrong, and more worryingly she has a phobia of things medical related. She is terrified of needles and had said she wouldn't have any medical procedures like a cesarean or take any medication to help. She refused a cesarean with her last pregnancy and has had two natural births. 

We were in the hospital recently with suspected appendicitis and she was told she might die if she doesn't get a needle to do bloods and she refused and was shaking and in tears (It wasn't appendicitis). I never realised it was as serious as this until recently and just assumed it was all talk and she would do it if it was an emergency situation, so it's shook me up a bit. 

I'm now going back and forth doing mental head tennis on what the best thing to do is.

374,"This is the only time I ever plan on asking reddit for help so I hope my throw away accounts lack of karma doesn’t completely fu*k my post 

     Three weeks ago I met my dad for the first time in 17 years after I moved into his apartment, He was literally never there for me growing up and I didn’t even know if he knew I existed. My Mom and me grew on the edge of poverty for basically my whole life, she was a single Mom and my family ended up hating her because she always asked them all for money. (Personally didn’t think she had the recourses or commitment to have a child, but unless I go dancing on the high way an abortion is 17 years to late) I’ve lived in a crack town for 10 years and my biological fathers has never paid a dime of child support, I’ve went to sleep hungry so many times. My mom works all the time and she try’s really hard but we’ve never been super close. 

       The second my dad picked me up from the airport he hasn’t once acknowledged the fact he completely abandoned me until now, and he try’s and acts like my “dad” all the time. Personally I don’t look at him that way, I barely see him as a friend. Last year I told his sister on Facebook that I exist. And for the first 6 months I was born my mom said she left him a voice mail almost every day about me. But he claims “he only recently found out I exists because he was on Facebook because of the covid” (by the way he’s very honest about how much he hates covid and thinks covid is fake) it’s been really hard living with him and let’s just say he drinks every night and isn’t a very responsible father, he also blames me when I complain about Somthing. He yells at me for keeping food in my room but I pay for my own groceries and when I leave food out he eats it constantly, I literally can not afford it. He calls his dog “son” and only calls me by name. He’s got a very short temper and is quick to anger and violence. Let’s just say he’s a 2/10 father. 
I’m only staying with him for 16 more days I already booked a plane ticket home (he said he’d pay for it but ended up not being able to) I snapped tonight after he walked in on me in the bathroom, he opened the door I immediately shut it and tried to keep it closed as he was trying to open it.

why is it that I lost my passion and interests?
For example, a few years ago I was really into spirituality, I was into music, played a lot of guitar. I was obsessed with Dungeons &amp; Dragons... I had passion, was interested in the world and its events...

this all kinda faded and it's really sad. I just want to have it back. It's a dumb and ugly life without those passions and interests. How do I get them back?

I was depressed and very stressed in regards to my future for a long time, and I couldn't enjoy anything really. And after this I fell into apathy and kind of wasn't passionate about anything anymore. Maybe the depression killed this joy I had

And now I'm rather numb and dumb and it might also be the fact that I spent so much time watching YouTube and stuff and numbing my brain

379,"Im asking advice on my issues since im a 21 year old mixed male. Im mixed with african and european. I want to know why is it so hard to find someone if people tell me i have to get better from my depression. I get thrown for a loop since no one wants to he with me whether or not i have the meds for my illness. I still have bad days on meds or not. I have persistent depressive disorder, its hard to be happy with all the shit I've been through in my life.

I know women do not want men to be less confident and less of who they are. But if i never get a chance then what? Dating doesn't work for young guys like me as well as it does for older people.

I know someone will singleness is a gift, please don't say that. As I've been alone for most of my life as a kid, teenager, then now adult. I understand you have the choices of going where you want, but if your partner respects you enough and your not doing anything to hurt her or him or yourself then your fine.

I believe i have issues when it comes to not having that physical touch. I know most people will say just pay for sex or something. I would but at the same time. I having to pay someone to touch you and having someone touch you because they want to. Are two different things.

I know another person will say get a dog or cat or any animal. These are good choices. But its not the same. A human touching a human is different than a human touching a dog. I mean non sexual by the way. I would pay a hooker to just hug me due to how lonely i get sometimes. 

I guess my main questions are, how am i suppose to date in a world like this?

I understand rejection, but i don't want to spend years of my life to get a match to only get rejected. So why is dating so time consuming?

And finally why is human touch such a bad thing to want in this.day in age? Being a man i desire touch like any man or woman. Everyone has a lull inside their chest.

383,"This was before the covid school closures but when we were at school I was in a friend group of 4 (including me) and the three “friends” would always make me feel left out, uncomfortable, ignore me, talk behind my back, etc. 

I had trouble going to school every morning because I was scared.

When covid closed schools down, I took the time to think about how I can distance myself from them. I completely stopped talking to any of them. They didn’t message me either. I didn’t expect them too anyways. 

Yesterday, I left the snap gc because i felt like I didn’t belong in that anymore (they barely talked on it too— they had a separate one without me and would talk about it continuously in front of me) 

This morning one of the girls snapchatted me asking why I left the gc. I left her on opened because I don’t owe anyone an explanation, she should think about how her actions could have affected me. 

A few hours later of being on opened, she snapped me again saying
“Oh I see how it is.” and since this is a snapchat, she sent a picture of her looking angry/irritated.

I laughed this off because I really thought it was funny that none of them ever talked to me for almost 4 months and now they talk as if i’m the weird one for leaving a chat??

389,"
If you read my previous posts you will get somewhat more of an idea of what hes like, but lately i am so tired of walking on eggshells around him that if he even so much as complains about something im doing in a nonangry tone, i cant help but go to another room and secretly cry. For example, the other night i made him a snack and then i picked out a movie for us to watch, and I went in the spare room where he was putting something away and we were talking absolutely fine for a few minutes, and i was in a good mood and cracked a simple joke about a GLOVE?? nothing bad or insulting at all, and he immediately flipped a switch and told me i was “just annoying” and to get out. At this point I dont even say a word back anymore, i walked out of the room and quietly went in the bathroom and closed the door and cried while i ran a bath. After my bath i walked out to the living room and he acted like nothing happened and asked when we were going to watch said movie. This happens often, another example being earlier tonight when i was laying down on the other side of the couch from him watching my own movie while he was watching youtube on his phone. I had just gotten back from the store because he asked me to go down and get him a snack so i left in the rain in my pjs and bought him what he wanted, and then he asked me to massage his arms. I always do this for him it’s automatic because i do it so often, and when i went to lean closer so i could reach his arms i accidently hit my head LIGHTLY off his, not even hard enough to feel an ounce of pain just a little bop. He immediately flipped a switch again, told me to get the f*** away and that he did NOT want ANYTHING anymore (referring to the massage) and i slowly and quietly backed away and laid my head down and just stared in the dark room for about 10 minutes thinking about how this sort of thing affects me. 

I have told him in the past he needs help regarding anger etc. and hes agreed and disagreed at different times, one time being last week in the car having a full blown episode to the point I cried afterwards once i was on my own out of the car and got in my own car. We went for a walk with our dog, and before we got in the car to leave for our walk he asked me to strap the dog in to his dog seatbelt thing. I had totally FORGOT he purchased a new one, like absolutely forgot about it and i straped him into his old one which was still FINE and did the job. When we arrived to the trailhead, he went to get the dog out of the car and immediately went off “I TOLD YOU TO STRAP THE DOG IN TO THE NEW ONE. YOU CAN GET HIM NOW SINCE YOU DID THAT. “ and he started walking away with triggered my dog to start barking and writhing and i had trouble trying to undo him during this. I sang out asking him to wait so I could get the dog manageably, and he kept walking which set off a major frustration in me along with the annoyance of trying to undo my poor dog as he watched what looked like his dad running away from the car. When i finally got the dog and got down to catch up to him, he acted likr NOTHING happened and was laughing with a stick for the dog, and i was so angry i took the retractable leash in my other hand that wasnt being used, and i threw it in the water and started crying out of pure frustration because i felt like he could of handled that better and SIMPLY said “hey babe you strapped him into the wrong one” and at least waited next to the car while i got the dog out. He absolutely blew up at me over this, to the point he made us turn back around and get back in the car to leave because “I DONT WANNA F***ING GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU NOW. I WAS TRYING TO BE CALM BUT YOU CAUSED THIS AND U WONT EVEN APOLOGIZE. GOOD TO KNOW YOULL NEVER CHANGE” and i was crying and afraid of my next words like usual, and i said “im sorry i seriously forgot the other strap was there, i cant help that but u didnt need to get sooky and walk away like you did”. His response was “Thats YOUR problem you cant control the dog when im not around (which isnt true i had him all winter while my bf was away working not paying for a damn bill or dog food once besides his half of the rent that he tried to force me to also get a roomate that i didnt want so he could be rent free) and he also said “U MIGHTVE FORGOT BUT U WONT CHANGE CLEARLY THIS IS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. U DO THIS DUMB SHIT SO OFTEN IT WOULDNT BE A BIG DEAL IF IT WAS EVERY FEW WEEKS BUT U DO SOMETHING LJKE THIS ALMOST EVERYDAY”. 

I always try calmly telling him that theres more in life to worry about and cry over than dumb things like forgotten irrelvant things that can be solved in minutes, and stuff like forgetting to take laundry out of the dryer, etc. (he also lost it at me many times for this yet he left it in the dryer for 4 days last week and ignored me everytime i reminded him to take it out). Im so drained i feel like he’s emotionally ruining me to the point i question everything but then i think of the good moments and i dont want to leave. 

I also caught him last week telling his so called “best girl friend” mentioned in my previous posts that he wanted to “nail the guts out of her” and tried to defend himself by saying he was mad at the time with me , which is another story because i felt so stuck i reached out to a friend who was great for advice but happened to be a male that my bf didnt want me to talk to so i didnt tell him, although i deleted nothing and left it there and let him read it bc i had nothing to hide. I know it was wrong of me not to tell him but i cannot talk to any males at ALL without him complaining or checkimg my accounts 3x a day but whenever im uncomfortable about any female he tells me im crazy and acts like i ruin all his friendships with girls when in reality he does by seeming to be interested in them all, although we been together 4 years. He literally blamed me for the reason she blocked him and said that i “finally got what i wanted because i ruin every friendship he has with a girl” which is untrue he snapchats 3-4 a day regulary and i dont say a word, yet i KNOW i didnt ruin anything and he did by telling her he wanted to bang her. I even let this go and tried to forget it even tho i was upset and when i told him it really hurt me that he said that knowing he had a gf, he said sorry but then continued to go off on me saying “U DONT KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE IN MY SHOES DATING YOU. I GAVE UP LONG AGO” and proceeded to say nasty things to me about my weight because i had a really bad winter alone while he was gone and gained 14lb but already lost 7 of them, and he gained over 30 so he has no right to belittle me and act like hes a king. He also said nasty things about our sex life that hes never said before saying he does all the work etc. which isnt true, i always try to do things for him during sex and hes too caught in the moment and says no, and continues to do all the work and if i try to overpush it he gets mad so i dont anymore i accept it and let him do the work. Then he went on to say as mentioned above how i don’t listen ever bc i do dumb things all the time and dont use my brain (like the dog strap story, and the laundry in the dryer or burning his pizza a little bit, etc). 

I dont know what to do I really feel like i need a break and should go home to my town for a week for a breath of fresh air alone with my friends and family, but ive suggested this and he tried to talk me out of it , and makes me think itll make things worse bc every move i make he will question it because he belittles alot of my friends over things he has no business talking about and gets sooky sometimes when i go see them for long periods of time during the evenings, etc. Im currently in bed at 6:11am and havent slept since 4am, he turned me down for sex last night and i came to bed and he stayed on the couch and masturbated instead, which bothered me but i kept quiet as usual. we both came to bed tonight and i fell asleep sooner than him because again i asked to have sex and he said no and i was fine with that, he continued to watch tv. Fast forward to 4am he wakes me up tossing and turning from a bad dream so i try waking him and he rolls over basically on top of me and i dont move him i let him be, until a half hour later he rolled back over on his own. I turned over to go to sleep and laid my arm on him, and he woke up absolutely raging and jumped out of bed swearing on me saying horrible things like “THIS IS WHY I HATE F***ING SLEEPING WITH U. ID RATHER SLEEP ON THE COUCH EVERYNIGJT. U CANT STAY ON UR OWN SIDE OF THE BED.” i sat quietly the entire time and he was still yelling as he reached the couch 2 rooms away and was so enraged he said “CAN U JUST F*** OFF FOR ONCE IN UR F***ING LIFE. FUCKING ANNOYING” (mind you i wake up daily to no room in bed because hes way over on my side)) which really hurts my feelings but im used to this stuff now, and when he wakes up in a few hours he will act like nothing happened and as usual ill worship the ground he walks on and cook breakfast and do whatever he asks etc. walking on eggshells afraid for the good moments to stop and the dreaded moments to start again any moment. 


He also got mad today out of absolutely nowhere after i cooked supper and cleaned up after, while in the bedroom getting something he randomly shouted out “I WISH YOUD STOP WEARING MY F**ING FLIPFLOPS OUTSIDE TO TAKE THE DOG TO PEE IVE TOLD U THIS LAST WEEK” which really pissed me off and confused me because he wasnt even looking at the shoes or in any reasonable situation to bring it up, and i have NOT WORN THEM since a week ago even tho i only ever did TWO TIMES and they’re in fine condition nothing happened. I got upset and said theres no reason to yell over this and he was tryna spark an arguement and i said i swear on my life i didnt wear them ive been getting my sandals soaked instead out of fear he will get mad for wearing his waterproof ones, (i feel anyone elses normal bf wouldnt care if she shoved his sandals on regardless) but anyways my point is this kind of thing is constant but whenever hes at fault or does something of the same nature that he claims i annoy him with, he immediately justifies it by saying i do it often and i don’t listen so its ok if he does the same things once in a while. I am so drained I dont know what to do for the sake of our dog I still am here but i dont even know if i want this anymore, like i said its just the good moments and the dog that im holding onto a bit of hope that he will change.",27Jul2020,1

394,"(Just a trigger warning, this does involve small mentions of child abuse)

Tl;dr brother is mentally ill, his wife has autism, had daughter, i had custody when she was 2-3, she was returned to them when she was 4, i see her twice a week and today she mentioned her dad (my brother) hits her. I don’t know whether the hit was justified, how hard it was etc. all i know is that he hits her on the couch. Should i report it or wait for more information? 

My brother is fat, almost 200kg and he’s quite mentally ill if you ask me, he doesn’t like it when he’s not in control and always brings up things of the past about how he was mistreated as a kid and how i never got in trouble, how everything isn’t fair, blah, blah, blah. (But i can tell you now we both got the belt, not just him). He decided to have a kid with his ‘wife’ (they never got married) but the issue is that she has high functioning autism. No one found out until they had their child.
Neither if them could take care of their daughter (who i will call L) so i ended up with custody when she was 2-3, they got her back when she turned 4.

I see her twice a week and today we were eating cake and having a tea party. Out of nowhere she says ‘he hits me’. It wasn’t prompted at all. I ask her ‘where does he hit you?’ And she responds with ‘dad hits me on the couch’ and i dropped it. I’ve been taught not to act interested in concerning things or asking further questions when it comes to children because it affects the way they think and talk about it.

Now that’s all the info i have. I don’t know if she was being naughty and he hits her as punishment or whether she annoys him and he throws a fit at her. Knowing him it’s most likely him getting frustrated and angry with her. The way he texts me he makes it sound me taking her 2 days a week is relief. (Btw, his wife works all day).

Due to my lack of information should i wait for L to randomly say things about it or report it now? I’m worried if i report it now L will be questioned which could be a negative thing. I’m also worried if it’s to early to report because if they question my brother with no evidence he’ll become angry, cut off my contact with her and be on bad terms.",27Jul2020,1
395,"Title. I’m in grade 9. Out of nowhere I’m Really struggling to apply what I’ve been learning in online class (especially math). I’ve never been a genius, but I’m in an extension maths class, and have been for a while. But recently, I’ve been so confused.
In math, we do the theory section where we get taught, and take notes, and it all seems fine. But then, when I have to go and answer textbook questions, I just really struggle. Either I over complicate the question, or straight up forget what I’ve been taught minutes before. Overall, I end up approaching the questions like I hadn’t been taught how to approach them. I kind of spiral from here, and now I almost go into every question expecting  it to be too hard. Instead of seeing a hard question as the exception, I see it as the rule. I then decide that I’ll just do the question after class as homework, meaning that I end up staying up the night before class struggling just as much and feeling terrible about myself. I’m not sure how much of this is misunderstanding the info, and how much of it is anxiety/mentality.

I know I have the option of talking to my teacher, but I feel like so many of my questions can be so easily answered, and she’ll end up judging me for having so many problems. Also, I feel like, rather than having one or too clear bits of information that I don’t understand, I have like 10 small aspects of a chapter I’m struggling, and I won’t be able to articulate my issue.
The class has recently become kinda competitive, and we had a test a month ago that we had to score 90%+ on in order to stay in extension. Somehow, I got a 92. But if I start talking about my problems, I feel like she’s gonna start thinking that I don’t deserve to be in the class anymore, and will remember that next semester when deciding class placements.

Finally, I feel kinda awkward going on a one-on-one call with my teacher to explain the problem (the teacher isn’t creepy or anything, just intimidating), and I won’t properly explain my problems.

it’s hard to turn my thoughts into cohesive sentences so i’ve done some bullet points;

- don’t feel like living here sometimes
- can never guess how they will react
- scared of angering them and losing every kind of privilege
- scared of not knowing what’s allowed or what will get me in trouble
- everyone is so quick to anger
- can’t feel comfortable or confident, the atmosphere in the house is always tense or depressing
- feel sick and scared when parents are annoyed for any reason
- memories of being hit and force fed peppers as a child still bother me

397,"When I was 10 I got a cat named Luna, my mom let me buy this cat without my dad’s permission and my dad absolutely hated Luna.
My dad hated cats, and he was mad at my mom for letting me bring home a kitten, but he let me keep it. She was MY cat, and I was the one who took sole care of her and watched her grow up.
Fast forward 2 years, and Luna is starting to spray things.
My mom kept saying we were going to get her fixed soon, but we were tight on money and we couldn’t.
One night when I came home from school I put my backpack down, only for Luna to spray it.
My mom wasn’t home, so I asked my dad what to do and he just became furious.
He went and got Luna’s old cage, grabbed her, held her up to me and said
“Say goodbye to Luna”
And then drove off and dumped her somewhere in the countryside in the middle of the night.
My mom came home later and asked why I was sobbing and my dad explained what happened and started bragging. 
Saying that “When I dropped her off you should have seen how she looked at me.” 
and
“I saved us a lot of trouble.” 
My mom and I drove around that entire night trying to find her, and drove the next few days looking for her, but we never did.

Ever since then I’ve felt extremely guilty. I keep seeing animal experts say that house pets that get dumped in the wild, will most likely always die, and Ive never been able to cope with the fact that Luna probably died out there.
I feel like it was my fault that that night even happened and I think about it constantly, even though it’s been 4 years.

399,"So one of my best friends is pretty close to my crush. I believe that both of them are really just friends (who knows but genuinely, i believe so). My best friend used to do streaks on Snapchat with people but stopped recently, except for (what i think at least) the one with my crush. When I ended up coincidentally starting a streak with her, I asked her if she still wasn't doing them and she told not to bother. I'm close with my crush, just not in the same way both of them are. She told me last week to consider shooting my shot with him, she thinks we would be great together (this was outlined in detail), and that she would help me out by making me seem great to him. 

But last week both of them hung out and she didn't bother to invite me. The fact that my best friend told me she would hype me up to my crush when she saw him makes me think this was a bit of a misunderstanding as a whole on my part, as they both texted me when they were hanging out. It just feels pretty shitty for me that my best friend would likely choose me over my crush, but wouldn't bother keeping a streak with me like she would for him (they just talk a lot to keep the streak going). I'm telling myself it's likely just the type of friendship they have, as I too have very diff kinds of friendships. Yet now I'm basically jealous of both of them?

402,"hi, 15f here. my parents are... a little open about their foot fetishes. they never specifically say it's a fetish, but it's just passing remarks (usually from my mom) that 'my dad likes his feet rubbed' (or something along those lines) and just generally bringing up feet a lot. it makes me very uncomfortable, and i've told them this many times but they won't stop. 


my mother also touches my feet a lot, whenever she gets a chance to, she'll massage or tickle them. for most people i'm sure that would be fine, but with the knowledge that she probably has a thing for feet, it makes me immensely uncomfortable. i have told her this too, and she doesn't stop.


my mother also makes a decent amount of sexual jokes around me, and sometimes even about me. one time i was eating some white icing innocently when i was 11-13 and she said something along the lines of ""if i told you what that looked like would you stop eating it?"" i don't know if that kind of thing is normal or not, but i really didn't like it. at the time, i didn't want to speak up about it because i didn't want her to know that i knew what she meant by that, (because i was too young) but now i usually do call her out when she says those kinds of things around me, and again, she doesn't stop.

411,"
When i was 6, my mom went in for a tooth surgery where a surgeon incorrectly inserted a needle into the roof of her mouth and pierced her trigeminal nerve. 

She developed trigeminal neuropathy which caused daily crying and screaming and smashing for years up until I was 13. A large portion of people who do contract this disease commit suicide, especially if it’s in the head. In fact, it is often called the “Suicide Disease”. 

During this time, when the pain spikes became really bad and endured for long periods of time, she would tell me, “when I’m gone just don’t remember me like this. In between fits of drooling and screaming, she would hug me and tear out my hair in frustration. She would then leave, and I did not know if she was coming back. Neither did my father for that matter, but he didn’t try to stop her. 


She would come back a day or two later, and the cycle would continue. 


I remember this was very difficult for me at first, but after a few months i became apathetic. At this point, I did not care about her pain nor  especially anyone else’s. 

After about a year, I began torturing animals and abusing some of the more vulnerable kids at school. 

The animal abuse stopped but my antagonistic behavior worsened into high school, becoming mostly verbal. I went to the principles 3 times in the first week for tipping off one of the teachers.

A miracle nerve blocker cured the disease and our family is now relatively normal. I am 18 now and finishing my bachelors in math this year. 

I thought kids who had similar experiences in their childhoods developed PTSD or anxiety or something, but I am just completely apathetic. I don’t care about anyone or their feelings.  In fact, it annoys me when someone complains about pain. However, i do feel a tinge of pleasure when i see someone suffering in pain. 

An example of this would be watching a father on the news choke up over the death of his teenage son. My family was tearing up, while i felt a blast of euphoria. I was smiling uncontrollably and had to turn away in order to not freak my mother out. 

Feelings this strong are rare and are usually in smaller doses, but they do happen occasionally. 


So, what is this?? Clearly it’s not normal. Is it the result of my childhood experience or something biological? And is there something I should do about it?",27Jul2020,1
412,"As the title says, I don’t know how to open up to my family. Well, in a more specific term, I don’t know how to remove my mask. For the longest time I have been afraid to tell my family how I really am apart from what they see on a daily basis. It probably sounds silly, but for some reason I can’t curse in front of my family at all and I am currently 19.  

To give background, ever since I was young I have always been scolded by my parents      ( specifically my mum) whenever I called someone stupid either to my brother or to whoever I was speaking to online when they did something dumb. So, having that in mind I thought wow if they will snap at me for calling someone stupid imagine how they would react if they heard me call someone a dumbass or yell out fuck. Now here’s the twist, even though they’ve yelled at me before for saying minor bad words, both of my parents have used words like bullshit and bitch in front of me. This caused me to be confused about what I can and cannot say to them, but to play it in the safe side I never said anything. 

I know that my brother also probably feels the same way as me since I have a feeling he swears but only to his friends. If I can I would like to be open with my brother about it first because I know he would understand. But, I don’t know how to go about it since this no swearing environment has kinda affected us. Honestly I thought about just walking up to him and saying every curse word in the dictionary but I want to know what you guys have to say.

TLDR: I can’t swear in front of my family because I was raised not to curse, even though my parents do.",27Jul2020,1
413,"Well when I started seeing my last therapist we had a very good relationship and they helped a lot. I was starting to really get things back in line, it felt like they could understand me and we talk about that I should go on medication but do to life being busy I just never got around to it. Also, I was functioning well enough it felt like was ok without them, could use them and would help a lot but I was doing a lot better. 

However, few months ago many things went wrong all at once that put a pause on it for a short time and when there was a mini settle I contacted them to start back up. They told they wouldn’t talk me again till I was on medicine (just as a way to make sure I would actually set up the appointment , I can be stubborn so I get that), appointment with the psychiatrist said and done and meds sent to me type thing, alright not the best but alright. I set the appointment to get the meds and it would be set for a month+ away, just how it was being a new patient to that office and sent her the copy to show it was set.

However things got even worst and I was literally begging to talk because it was the worst I’d been in almost two years bad enough I had returning to elf arming but they stood that they wouldn’t talk to me until I got onto medication. Due to the past I wanted to understand, but the appointment to talk the psychiatrist office was sets so I felt that was enough. They told me that my goal should be looking for a doctor in the area that would give me an appointment but with the state I was in, physical and mental it was almost impossible to find someone else. And even if I did a similar out come would have most like happened of make an appointment that would be a month away do to being a new patient.

So now I feel guilty looking for someone else but I’ve lost some much trust in my past therapist.",27Jul2020,1
414,"I am currently able to dedicate more time towards self-improvement and in that sense I am looking for resources to help do so.

This is a fairly general question and can be answered in that way. Hopefully it is not unsuited for an Advice Subreddit.

With resources I mean things like, but not limited to, books, courses, practices, habits, exercises, lifestyle changes, and so on.
Examples could be the book ""Atomic Habits"", the Berkeley course ""The Science of Happiness"" on EDX, a mindfulness practice, a posture-improving exercise and so on.

With self-improvement, I mean things like, but not limited to, knowledge, skills, well-being, social aptitude, and so on.
Examples could be cultural knowledge, learning a language, learning to program in Python or Kubernetes, beneficial projects to embark on, and so on.

I'm hoping to hear about things you'd recommend that have proven useful for you and added value to your life.
Feel free to point me towards any online resources, either broadly or specifically, or what felt helped a lot in learning or was interesting.

Two personal examples are that I took an online course on Docker and applied that to help improve my home domotics. Another is a mindfulness book that allowed me to develop a practice which improves my mental well-being a bit.

Looking forward to what you can propose!",27Jul2020,1

416,"Lately, in my country, there were some discussions about school and how it's not that great. These discussions made me a bit sad, because I always studied and tried to get good grades in school, thinking that this way I'll have a good future. Near the end of high school, I realized that focusing so much on school and useless things wasn't worth it, but I didn't have what to do, because I couldn't travel back in time to change this. 

Now, I feel like I've made a big mistake: I always focused on school and useless things, and I didn't try to develop some useful skills in my free time. The current situation isn't helping me: I'm in college, which I don't really like, and it hasn't great future options, unless I would want to be a teacher, and I don't know what to do in the future, despite the fact that I've started learning some web development in my free time since late March. And when I see how other people make money today, sometimes without college and at early ages like 17-18-19, I regret that I focused so much on school. And I'm kind of scared of the future, especially in my country (Romania), but I don't want to move to another place, because right now I feel pretty good in this country, but I'm insecure about the future in it. 

I know this may sound like I'm complaining, but I feel pretty bad, because I know that the fault is mine, as I have made this decisions.

why do i do that? maybe this is too much of a rant to be on this sub but i went thru some pretty horrible scarring things that ruined my perception of trust when i was 15, and ever since i haven't been the same. i feel like that might be the root of it all.

-Hi, I never really make posts to reddit so bear with me while I try to explain all of this.

Also sorry for the wall of text there’s a lot of backstory.

Also also I do ask for advice in this but I’m not fully sure if it fits the criteria for this subreddit, if it doesn’t please tell me and I’ll take it down right away.-




So back in 2018 I started highschool and decided to  switch schools from a very small (around 40 students) private school to an over 1000 student catholic school. I chose to do this because I wanted to have more opportunities for extracurricular as well as just more options in regular courses. However, after going into it I realized I had really bad anxiety. I wouldn’t talk to any of my classmates or teachers. I would only ever speak if spoken to and do my best to keep the conversation short. I also think I’m a pretty lazy person so I never did my homework and procrastinated a lot. 

As my first semester progressed we had to do a presentation in my science class. I hated the idea of that from the beginning but figured I had to do it no matter what. But I ended up procrastinating preparing for it and the night before we had to present I had nothing ready for it. That’s when my anxiety went into high gear and I knew there was nothing I could do. However I thought of something.

I went to my mom during the night and acted like I had been vomiting and was sick. I made it seem like I had a fever and got to skip school that day. This opened up a lot of possibilities in my mind. If there was ever something in school that had my anxiety up or I just didn’t do the work for I would pretend to be sick or to have not slept the night before.

My mom is really caring so I could even just suggest I hadn’t slept the night before and she’d say I shouldn’t go to school if I hadn’t slept. However eventually when I kept doing it she realized I was missing out on to many classes and started to push me to go more and more.

My solution to this was to escalate the problems. Not sleeping last night turned into having recurring nightmares that kept me awake. I kept pushing what was happening until one day I was out biking with my parents and I actually fell and hurt my side.

Although I had actually fallen it didn’t really hurt that bad, but I lied and said I had hit my head and was feeling really bad. I had done this before so I knew the symptoms of a concussion. We ended up going to the hospital and although I wasn’t technically diagnosed with one it was enough to get out of school for a week.

Fast forward a few months and my anxiety had just continued to get worse. I had missed multiple due dates on assignments that had already been extended for me and I didn’t know what to do. Looking back on it I know I should’ve just been honest or had done the work or anything but I didn’t. What I instead did was pretend to have fallen in the shower and hit the back of my head.

I actually hit the back of my head a few times to make it look like I had fallen. I went to the hospital again and the same thing happened except this time I acted like it was a lot worse. On the car ride there I pretended to be really tired and going in and out of consciousness a bit. I don’t know how much this fooled my mom but from how she acted she seemed very very very worried.

We get to the hospital and I do the same thing I did before and it works the same I get two weeks off of school. Now this is when I realize this is unsustainable and come up with a different plan. I begin acting like I get severe migraines that pretty much incapacitate me for days.

It works. I got my family to believe I have these migraines which ended up with me taking medication for migraines I didn’t actually have. I even went to specialists to talk to them about the migraines. 

Because of them I got a doctors note saying I could stay out of school. After another month I started having a teacher come to my house like two times a week to do work with me. This lasted all throughout the rest of my grade 9 school year.

Starting grade ten I started coming back to school on a lessened schedule so only two days a week and only for one period each day. I even had to go to a special classroom where students did individual work instead of an actual class because it wouldn’t have worked with how I was coming in. 

Even with that I still missed some days and was generally not doing very well. But after a while I started doing better. Getting my work done and going in every day I was supposed to. After the first semester of 2019 was over I started going for more days and longer periods. By the time Christmas was nearing I was feeling really good. I started going to the gym and eating healthier and I had a few friends who I knew from a youth group I went to.

After 2020 started I was still doing alright but then this whole Covid thing began and quarantine started. 


Now after all that backstory I can actually say my point.

I feel such an underlying guilt in everything I do. There are times when I can ignore because I’m doing other things but every night when I’m trying to fall asleep I can’t because of the guilt and shame and regret I feel. I can’t talk to anyone I know about because they all already think it was real. I’ve had very “personal conversations” with them as they always messaged me asking how I was doing and telling me they were supporting me and to let them know if they could do anything to help. And I went along with it.

I got so deep into the lies that it just started to actually feel like it was real. But deep down I know it wasn’t and it isn’t. 

I know I’m terrible and disgusting and the scummiest person alive for doing something like that. I’m so ashamed. I didn’t mean for it to be like this. For it to get out of hand and become my life. I don’t want to hurt anyone I just wanted to not feel so much pressure from school. 

I have no clue what I’m going to do when quarantine ends and I go back to school. I know the right thing to do is to tell everyone but I don’t think I can.

I actually feel like I’m drowning and there is literally no way to escape from why I’ve done.

If anyone has any ideas on what I should please tell me.

I know I don’t deserve to be ok after doing this and that there are probably better ways to handle it then by making a long winded reddit post at 5 in the morning but I don’t know what else to do at this point.

I’m so tired of living like this.

426,"Hey there. 

I (17M) snuck out last Friday to hang out with a friend who was going through a particularly rough time. We ended up getting some pizza at a local pizza place around 11 pm. My parents thought I may have snuck out and the next morning they asked, to which I told them that I had gone for a walk with my friend. I didn't mention the pizza place as it was quite far away and they would be pissed off had I gone there so late. 

Fast forward to the other day, my dad walks into my room asking me if I had gone to said pizza place as my mom noticed a transaction to my account from there, which wasn't there previously (she constantly checks it for god knows why). I told him no. My bank frequently delays the transactions until the next day so I told him that I had gotten pizza the following day for lunch. 

Today, he came in again and asked if I had gone there, and I lied again and told him no. He threatened to ask the bank when the transaction was made, and I told him to go ahead, as if not to give up my lies. I understand now that lying was the wrong thing to do, but I was already too deep in the rabbit hole to come clean. I may as well stick it out.

Can he contact the bank (the account is in my name), and request the specific info and exact time the transaction was made? Thanks in advance.",27Jul2020,1

430,"For the sake of this post, we'll call him John. John and I grew up in the same town and became best friends when we were 12. He became like a brother to me, since I went through a lot with my family and mental health during middle school. Our families even started to get along well. We were super close. Even though other people joked about us dating, we bot made it clear that's not something we wanted. when I was 15, my family moved across country, but John and I stayed close and would frequently visit each other. John moved away from our home state for college and now lives even further away so we don't see each other often. This weekend though, John and some friends were road tripping to a state sup er close to mine and we decided he'd come visit and he could spend the night here and meet up with his friends the next day. He got here and we just did normal stuff went out to eat. caught up, and then at the end of the night he and I went out with one of my friends from high school. Around I AM we got back to my house and put on a movie. John and I have had sleepovers many times without issue, so I trusted him to sit on my bed facing the TV while I laid down. He says ""can I do something stupid? ""and I just said ""what? ""I not"" yes"" or ""no"") and he immediately is trying to kiss me and get on top of me. keep in mind. I'm laying down and he's not.I said no and got up to sit elsewhere. I'm a survivor of multiple forms of sexual violence, so I get uncomfortable super easy. He immediately starts apologizing and calling him- self stupid. I told him I didn't really want to talk about it and kept watching the movie. During the movie, after not talking for like 20 minutes, he tells me he 's always loved me and I told him that I don't know what to say. Finally, I go to sleep but keep getting woken up by him loudly sighing and moving around. even calling a friend to tell them what had happened. At one point he even woke me up by asking me ""what I was thinking"" (I guess he was under the impression I was lying there, awake,thinking about it when I was just trying to sleep because I worked the next morning.) In the morning I wake him up so he can get on the road, and he tries putting his hand on my back and I snapped at him for it (I' m probs the a-hole with that l and said I didnt want him to touch me. He said he was sorry and didn't want our friendship to suffer. I just kept telling him that I didn't know what to say. I walk him to his car, give him a hug, and right before I walk away he says ""you need to hold the men you talk to to a higher standard"" (I have a really shitty past with men, and the day before I had told him some issues with the current guy in my life.) This made me mad because after suddenly trying to get with me. he's trying to tell me about how the men I date are bad. It felt like a last ditch to make me love him, or something. 

Ultimately I feel violated that he waited until we were completely alone. I was in bed, and it was the middle of the night to make a move on me. I wasn't gonna let him drive home that late, so it put me in an uncomfortable p o s i ti on. He also didn't tell me what he was going to do before doing it, and didn't give me the chance to consent. ( ""Can I do something stupid?"" ""what?"" was the whole exchange.) what irks me the most is how he wouldn't drop it. It couldn't just be a mistake, or misreading signals, he had to keep talking about it and putting me into uncomfortable positions when I didn't want to talk about it. John was treating it like a teen movie where the girl hurts the boys feelings, rather than him making me uncomfortable. 

Am I a bitch for not really wanting to be his friend anymore? I feel uncomfortable, and like our entire friendship was a lie. “I’ve always loved you” just tells me that our close friendship may have had ulterior motives. I feel like an asshole for not wanting to speak to such an important person in my life I need advice because people in my life are telling me I’m being dramatic.",27Jul2020,1

I am 20 years old and very happy now, but I used to be an agsty kid.

When I started puberty though, around the age of 13, it started with losing confidence. I was very emotional and it was the start of the worst period of my life. It was the worse at the age 15-16. I was always unhappy, thought about suicide all the time and never wanted to do anything, I was angry at everyone, always. Avoided hanging out with friends, avoided recieving any attention etc. 

I overcame that at around 17 and became (over the years) the happy, confident person I am now. However, my ""physical"" anxiety hasn't gone away in the slightest. I try \*so\* hard, not to shake when talking to new people, not to cry when being yelled at, to speak up in random situations, but I just can't seem to work out how. 

I \*am\* confident. I love talking to new people, I love being the center of attention, but my body doesn't respond well to it. Any presentations, any speeches, while I love doing them, I start to shake almost immediately, my voice cracks and tears start building up in my eyes.

Of course the situation is a little more complicated than I'm letting on here but we're on pretty good terms and I know it'd be no problem at all if I asked her to talk for a bit...

I know I should just straight up ask for some time if that's what I want but idk... I don't seem to know how without feeling extremely guilty for doing that. If she had time, she'd reply to messages sooner so that means she doesn't have time for whatever reason. Maybe she's spending time with her boyfriend or is having a class or is taking care of stuff in the house and I'd be asking her to make time for me and that just feels very wrong to do...

437,"Hello reddit, I am not using a throwaway even though my better judgement says other wise. Anyways, I had a friend of three years on playstation, who I considered a real best friend. P (friend) is 25 years old with a wife and 4 kids and I'm 16(M). We played almost everyday for the three years that we knew eachother and I felt I could really trust him. It turns out that wasn't the case. One day when we were playing dead by daylight with mutual friends, his wife messaged me on messenger. She had found me because he had me added on Facebook. She then sent me a long paragraph summed up to be him sexting an mutual friend of ours that happened to be 11 years old (B). Now I should mention, I was an idiot and asked why she messaged me before I opened it, and when I did so he went quiet and left the party. When I seen the message I was completely shattered and told our other friends that I would excuse myself. Her message stated that she confronted him about it and he said he'd stop. Not only did he lie but he also created multiple accounts just to talk to her. After 10 minutes she finally responded back with a screenshot of him completely trashing their house by dumping catlitter everywhere and breaking shit. If his tantrum wasnt enough evidence of guilt, his wife (K) proceeds to send atleast 30 screenshots of him texting her and my heart sank. I couldn't even read it. It was hard and I didnt make it half way through. He was sexting her, she was calling him stuff like daddy and sexy. He kept trying to get her to send him nudes but she didnt have a phone. She then proceeded to sneak and steal her dad's phone to send him pictures. K said that he even sent her a dick pic that was undeniably his because of the room he was in and the underwear in the picture. I asked her not to send the screenshot of that because I obviously didn't want to see his dick. After a talk with K, I then confronted B. I opened the conversation with a ""wtf is wrong with you"" out of rage. She then asked me what I was on about. All I had to say is ""I know"" for her to go ""Oh... i dont want to talk about that right now"". I then lost my shit and and proceeded to chew her out when it wasn't even her fault most likely. She's 11, she was just a little ignorant to the rights and wrongs of the internet but to me I didn't care. I felt like she should know what's right and wrong. After arguing with her I start talking to K again. I forgot to mention the fact that K had went on P's playstation and blocked people on his account, B being one of them. She brought up that she had blocked another mutual friend of ours and I asked why. Turns out he was also sexting and sending money to one of my other friends that was of age but was married to my friend. To put it simply, I had two friends that were married to eachother, I introduce them to P, P sexts and sends money to the wife. I still don't know if my friend is aware and I tried messaging him to no avail. That was only half a year before this incident. After learning that I then started messaging other friends she said was blocked to see if he sexted them aswell. Luckily out of the 3 I messaged all denied allegations meaning they're either lying or nothing actually happened. Back to my conversation with K, the day after the incident she told his parents after me begging her to. They sided with P for the reason of ""he's my son"". At that point I'm convinced his entire family has mental issues. After she tells me his parents reaction she then asks me do I use drugs, me being African American I responded with ""wtf?"". It was out of no where which Is why i responded the way i did. She then tells me that she overheard P talking to his mother saying that I take drugs to cover his ass. I was pissed but I still hadn't texted him. It's been a week and I have barely played my playstation because I just can't. I feel discouraged because I played every game I have with him. I told our inner circle of about 10 friends the full story. The outer circle (people we play with less than 2 times a month) were only told that ""we won't be playing with him for a while"". I told P I wont be talking to him until he gets help. He texts me everyday on everything saying he misses his friends and how sorry he is. One of my mutual friends says he seen P and B in a party together the other day. I got pissed and sent him a text along the lines of ""if you were really sorry you wouldn't be in a party with her"". He told me he wasn't and said he had her blocked complimented with a screenshot of her being blocked. I don't believe him but I'm not sure. K is still with him after him cheating multiple times and wont turn him into the police. I've been discouraged from making youtube videos for my 5 consistent viewers and he was always one of them which is why I'm worried to make anymore. I worked for 5 hours every video and put a lot of work into them. Thumbnail, music, sound quality and all. For it to all be stripped away by my fear of one person really makes me sad aswell. I don't wanna say I'm depressed because I haven't been diagnosed and I don't wanna make such a bold claim. I just need advice on how to cope with the issue and what to do. I wanna help him and his wife and I'm probably missing details. You're allowed to dm me if you want.",27Jul2020,1

442,"So I have joined a fandom that has literally changed my life, i really feel kike i can be myself now. I met some friends there which i really cherrish. But recently, a couple of my friends and some other friends that i dont know as much have fallen into deprrssion, or atleast they feel really bad concistantly. Since I have extreamly much empathy, I feel super bad for them basically every day, and i think its impossible for me to ""forget"" their pain. This has eventually put a toll on my own mental state, I feel like i basically only have two ""main"" moods, either i am really giddy and ""happy go lucky"", or im really ""neutral"" and i talk in a really depressed/relaxed voice, when i am like this i almost allways want to be compleatly alone, it is of couse partly because i am an introvert and quite antisocial sometimes, but when im happy i usually feel like i want to socialize with others. I have a really good friend i talk to very often, and 99% of the time i talk to him i am allways happy, but now that i cant talk yo him currently, i feel like i get in my ""depressed"" mood much easier, or rather after seeing all of my friends have it do bad i have gotten into that mood much more often.

Im going to be honest, I dont really know what i wanted advice for when beginning to write this. I think i maybe wanted to know why i so easilly become ""empty"" (mood-wise that is) and if there is a way to imrove it.

Of course its good that i allways feel happy when talking to my friend, but i think its weird how i only feel good (concistantly) when talking to that specific person, maybe its bad in some way that its only them i easily get happy by? Although its hard to tell, because he is my only friend that i *talk* to with voice (all my friends are online friends), so i cant really tell if he is the *only* one that easily makes me happy.

I dont know if it is just placebo or something, but i think i feel a tiny bit better for letting my thoughts out. Thanks in advance for... i dont know what to be honest, some kind of helping reply?",27Jul2020,1
443,"My mental health is causing me to self destruct my relationships 

For context, I am F20 and my partner is M23. 

I lost my job recently due to COVID-19 causing our company to lose a lot of money and so they could no longer afford to keep me employed. Although I know that this isn’t my fault; it has still taken a knock to my confidence and I am feeling very tense and on edge lately. As a result of myself feeling this way, my relationship has suffered because we had 2 months apart during lockdown and with the absence of my boyfriend’s presence, I started to smoke weed to cope with my anxiety. 

My boyfriend does not approve of any drugs at all but I felt so guilty about keeping this from him that I told him about the weed and he flipped off major and then proceeded to text MY best friend to tell her that he is thinking of leaving me. Naturally she told me and I just haven’t trusted him since. 

When the lockdown started to lift, my boyfriend and I would meet up in fields 2m apart with no touching but I feel this only added to our tension as we would just spend the whole time bickering. 
It made me not look forward to seeing him so I started hanging out with my friends more to vent and keep my mind at ease. My friends are into drugs and we started going through a phase of doing balloons and mushrooms once a week. Naturally I haven’t told my boyfriend this and my friends wouldn’t tell him but I feel guilty keeping this secret from him. It’s hard to tell him though because I know he will majorly over react. 

I have also booked a holiday next year with friends to Ibiza which my boyfriend would kick off over as he has always said he doesn’t want me to ever go on a “chavvy club” holiday. On top of this I am going to get a small matching tattoo with my girl friends and he also disapproves of tattoos and has often said he would leave me if I got one. 

During one of my classic meltdowns I stupidly doxed my number on Instagram at a stupid hour asking for someone to call me, and some guy did and we had a 6 hour phone conversation and became good friends as a result but I felt I couldn’t even tell my boyfriend about that in case he got the wrong idea. Because I could tell this guy more than I could tell my own boyfriend I did start to develop a small crush on him and the past 2 days, he has hung out with my friends and I in real life.  I am very happy he has because it’s confirmed that I do not actually have feelings for him, I think I just had that classic “new friend” excitement and because he is a man, I mistook it for more. 
But even though I am certain my crush was just a mad moment, I feel so guilty for ever thinking that way because I feel as if I have emotionally cheated on my boyfriend. 

To top it off, this new friend has hit it off with one of my best friends and I had told this friend about my mad moment, so NOW I am paranoid that she will tell him, as the whole ordeal is incredibly embarrassing. 

I just feel so lost right now, what should I do?",27Jul2020,1

I did, somehow, I never really see what my SO does on the thing, but I rummaged through applications, photos, cute ones with the family, friends, I wanted to start moving them for me to keep 😁.

450,"Advice.

Im in a relationship of 2 years with my boyfriend we are both 17. And earlier i got mad at him because he masturbated to lesbian porn. I got really angry and jealous that i started crying and he didn’t seem to care that i was mad or that i was crying. So then he said it was normal and i got more angrier because it seemed like he was trying to normalize it. He said he finds lesbian stuff attractive.(Before this he told me he wanted to have a threesome with me and another girl.) I got angry because to me it seems like the fact that i think about it he is getting turned on by lesbian shit and masturbating to that. I got really insecure that now i compare myself to those girls. And i told him earlier before anything happened that i wasn’t insecure only about 5 things and he told me “Well you said your not insecure about anything. It really made me feel bad and i got really angry. And then he said he was sorry for masturbating to that and that he would stop and he said “You are the most attractive to me.” and i thought again and said to him “So you find other girls attractive but you find me the MOST attractive?” And he said “Whatever”. And also he said “Its my body anyways” to masturbating to lesbian porn and i got angrier and said “But its your brain you can control it to what you do it to” and he got mad. So basically he was mad because i got mad at him he was masturbating to lesbian porn. So i was just mad and crying the whole time and didn’t care and left me crying and went to sleep and turned down his ringtone so i wouldn’t text him and call him. 

Also i need advice because we got really toxic and i noticed he changed and doesn’t care about me or doesn’t love me the same anymore. He just goes to sleep or leaves me. He doesn’t make me feel any better during fights or arguments. He also never really apologizes for things. He doesn’t ask questions if i eat, how i sleep, my day nothing. I tell him he doesn’t care or loves me but he says he does. 

We both play xbox and he made me block two friends to prove if i love him because i would go play with them at night when he would sleep and he said it was “our time” which that never existed and he never even said it was before or nothing. And one time he woke up and would not stop signing me out and i didn’t change my password so i got off. And he made friends so now i notice he basically puts me behind everything his xbox. And i tell him and he says its not true. And we got into a fight and i would keep signing him out and he changed his password something i never did. Also his attention dropped to me. Now all he does is watch youtube and play xbox. And he gets mad at me for wanting to talk to him when he is watching youtube because its basically the only time we can talk. And i said to him many times if he cares or loves me he would show action but he doesn’t.

452,"Hi Reddit.

My name is Connor and I’m a 17 year old guy currently living in England. Ever since a young age I have always had huge goals for myself and what some people refer to as “unrealistic expectations”.

My two biggest goals in life are 1) to be a multimillionaire who is financially independent with my own successful business based in New York and 2) to be known for something good and big in my life time. When I say “good” I’m referring to of good nature - I don’t want to be rich if it isn’t for something of good nature, I want to help people. 

I have been told on multiple occasions that the chances of becoming a millionaire from working class, what I am, is very very slim. I’ve been going against it for a long time and In September  last year, I landed myself a promising apprenticeship in Technical Content for a big company - something I enjoy doing. However, this isn’t completely where my heart is as I want to branch more into marketing and move to New York by 24, hoping to become financially independent at 30 with at least $1,000,000 in the bank. I’ve began connecting with people on LinkedIn over in America to try and learn about their lifestyle and personal habits that have made them successful in order to adapt them to my own.

So I ask you all this:

- Am I setting unrealistic expectations for myself like everyone says? 

- Do any of you own businesses in America and can give me some advice ?

- Can any of you give me some advice on how you can go about moving countries and getting a job once doing so? 

Thanks everyone :).",27Jul2020,1
453,"My boyfriend and his family own a lot of property in Texas that they use to produce cattle. Part of that job requires working dogs for the ranch. When his family decided to breed their ranch dog Biscuit, my boyfriend determined he wanted one of the puppies for himself. Keep in mind we are in college and he lives in a one bedroom apartment. I told him that I didn’t want him to get a dog as I know he wouldn’t be able to handle it.

We have been dating for approximately 3 years and I have a good understanding of his capacity for responsibilIty. That said, he would just brush me off when I expressed my concerns. Biscuit became pregnant and again I told my boyfriend he should not take one of the puppies. Again he brushed me off. The puppies were born in August 2019 and I expressed the same sentiment, but what do you know? He was the owner of a new puppy by October 2019. So here he was with a 2 month old puppy in 17 hours at a top tier university in a one bedroom apartment. 

I was inwardly livid, but I thought, “well this is his life now, maybe it will be fine.” I came to quickly find out that I was right to think that he couldn’t handle it. I gradually had to take on more and more responsibility with the dog as things began to slip through the cracks. He had no sort of potty training regime so she would have 10-15 accidents in the house a day. He would not wake up in the morning to take her out. Often the dog would be in her crate from 11:00 p.m. till noon the next day. At about 8 months she began to potty outside exclusively but that was only one solution to the many problems that arose. 

The dog is a cross between an Airedale and a Black Mouth Cur. She is extremely active and becomes bored the instant after she gets up in the morning. As a product of this she whines, cries, paces, jumps and worst of all chews anything and everything she can get her mouth on. She does not listen, she’ll yank your arm out of its socket on the leash, and she’s not getting the enrichment she needs while living in an apartment. 

Now, because I feel bad for the dog, I take it upon myself to make sure she gets let out at a reasonable time in the morning, that she’s fed, and gets exercise at the dog park at least 5 days a week. DESPITE not even wanting the dog. And on top of all of that for the longest time he REFUSED to get her spayed up until this week when she’s nearly a year old. She could not attend training classes in our area because of this. I taught her as many simple commands as I could for her safety. My boyfriend is extremely lazy and irresponsible so he does none of these things unless I ask him to multiple times. When I can’t come over to his apartment because of class, homework, etc. he does not do these things. 

I really just need some advice I don’t know what to do. The stress of this dog consumes so much of my time and it’s really thrown a wrench in my relationship with my boyfriend. I love him but I did not and still do not want the dog. I also want to let it be known that I am very kind to the dog and she loves me a lot as I am essentially her sole caregiver.",27Jul2020,1
454,"Well when I started seeing my last therapist we had a very good relationship and they helped a lot. I was starting to really get things back in line, it felt like they could understand me and we talk about that I should go on medication but do to life being busy I just never got around to it. Also, I was functioning well enough it felt like was ok without them, could use them and would help a lot but I was doing a lot better. 

However, few months ago many things went wrong all at once that put a pause on it for a short time and when there was a mini settle I contacted them to start back up. They told they wouldn’t talk me again till I was on medicine (just as a way to make sure I would actually set up the appointment , I can be stubborn so I get that), appointment with the psychiatrist said and done and meds sent to me type thing, alright not the best but alright. I set the appointment to get the meds and it would be set for a month+ away, just how it was being a new patient to that office and sent her the copy to show it was set.

However things got even worst and I was literally begging to talk because it was the worst I’d been in almost two years bad enough I had returning to elf arming but they stood that they wouldn’t talk to me until I got onto medication. Due to the past I wanted to understand, but the appointment to talk the psychiatrist office was sets so I felt that was enough. They told me that my goal should be looking for a doctor in the area that would give me an appointment but with the state I was in, physical and mental it was almost impossible to find someone else. And even if I did a similar out come would have most like happened of make an appointment that would be a month away do to being a new patient.

in drama they do skits and performances which i find interesting and cool and i wish to one day either perform or be stage crew on a production.

459,"Well, I don't usually post my problems on the Internet as a lot of people do have theirs and don't go sharing them, but I want another perspective on what could I do: so if anyone kindly reads this, I'll be very grateful.

 The thing is, a friend and I are on the same group of friends (we are about 10-14 people, so its normal subgroups happen when its a big group). Because of the coronavirus we had a lot of plans we wanted to do but we couldn't due to the voluntary confinement here (Like a picnic outdoors for example. The zone where I live is so bad with the number of cases going up, that they had to take measures again sadly.). Some of them just blatantly ignore us and meet anyways for doing that picnic, even if the voluntary quarantine should be done, but that doesn't stop there. They meet without telling us if we want to go, yet they send pictures of them that day on our WhatsApp group and post it almost everywhere possible.

My friend tried to talk to them about feeling out of the group but just felt really overburdened by the fact they just told him he can't criticize the life of others and what they do over and over again, so he just left the group and joined some days after. (That caused quite a drama there those days). Shortly after that, they all met for a birthday party without telling us not a single word yet posting they were there, again being a little bit hipocrite. 

And it just really feels bad because I don't really know what to say to them and explain myself: I really want to go meet them after all of this pandemic ends or at least lowers down, but I don't know what to do without being bashed as toxic or dependant behind my back. What could I do, besides ignoring it and do what's best for me? Because its not only me, but some other friends from there that they're ignoring, too.

Eventually I’ll say I’m not feeling well or just that I’m not going to meet them without any explanation, mute them and hope to never see them again. 

I’ve done this with 4 men and I think I’m finally acknowledging I have some kind of problem. I think it’s my low self-esteem. I feel like I’m trying to prove to myself that I’m attractive. And the thing is, I’m actually conventionally attractive and I love to look at myself in the mirror. I know this but I think I still have some issues left from when I was 9 years old. I was fat and didn’t think much of this, had no perception of attractiveness actually. My mom and dad tried to make me lose weight and went a wrong way about it, and I ended up with an eating disorder at 12. At 14 I was so thin my teachers and random people were asking If I was eating. After a year I was orthorexic and worked out every day at home. Fast forward one year and I started binging and vomiting after. At 17 my relationship with food and my self-esteem got SO much better. I started going to gym and lifting weights. I’m 19 now and at peace with my body and eating habits but I still want men to be attracted to me even though I’m not attracted to them, and literally, want nothing to do with them. 

I don’t do the same with women. 

How do I go about this? Has anyone else experienced the same or similar problem? I don’t know where else to turn. I can’t get a therapist for private reasons.",27Jul2020,1
465,"Alright, this might sound crazy but I will try my best to fully explain my problem. Whenever I slightly think about certain things or hear someone talk about certain topics that 'trigger' certain thoughts in my head, such as a house getting robbed or someone dying, I get super paranoid that what I've heard or said to myself/others is gonna ""backfire and jinx"" on me or in my life. The reason i feel this way is because in the past I've had subconscious thoughts that 'I've let slide' and later on in life these same thoughts have appeared and happened (kinda like karma or some shit idk, not that i've even done anything wrong by ""letting this thoughts slide""), and when i realise how everything ""lined up"" i remember how i had a thought and didn't ""pray against it"". Because of this i ALWAYS find myself saying things like ""god forbid \_\_\_ happens""/""no jinxing with \_\_\_"" constantly everyday and i over pray.. sometimes praying about the same thing 10 times within a few minutes, saying the same things to myself and God. And it drives me crazy. If someone can help remove the feeling/thoughst of thinking things are gonna jinx because i didn't pray against a thought or statement, it would be greatly appreciated man. Because the way im living right now is like im walking on ice and i feel if i forget to pray, that certain thing/thought will end up happening in life in a different/similar fashion",27Jul2020,1
466,"So pretty much, I'm (M17) in this group of about 14 ""really good friends"" and we've been going to school for about 5 years together. However, for myself and some other people in the group it feels like we're the weak links or the side-characters of our friend group. Some things that led me to this conclusion is that my friends don't talk to me/ ignore my streaks on SC,  I look on Instagram and see that 3 or 5 of them have been to a party or somewhere and I feel left out and, most recently, the fact that there are 2 surprise birthdays coming up, despite the fact that my birthday is sandwiched in between the 2 and has been forgotten about.

467,"I moved in with a couple who I am friends with at the beginning of this year. 

The girl is a bit of a fantasist, she will make up stories about the smallest of things but also make up massive lies to seek attention such as, for example, she attempted suicide by hanging and almost died but was found hanging from the stairwell after an hour by a friend and taken to hospital where she was revived. 

She also seemed to have an awful lot of 'abusive exes'. One night I was in bed and heard a bit of a commotion. I had a Whatsapp from the man saying that she was in the front room, had drunk a bottle of wine within ten minutes then gone into the bedroom screaming at him and kicking and punching him and telling him to get out. I have never seen him be violent towards her. 

I sleep like a log, but in the morning I am told he has been taken away and arrested because he 'violently attacked her in her sleep'. She tells me she has video footage of this, but when she shows me the camera seems purposefully pointed towards the wall and she is heard screaming stop hitting me stop hitting me and him in a calm voice, with no movement soudned going 'for fucks sake do you ever stop bullshitting?'

He is taken into custody for domestic violence. It is during this time that I see just what a liar she is. She has several men  over while his side of the bed is still warm! One of whom she gets attached to. He tells her he is happy to sleep with her but not to get feelings as he isn't going to get them back. 

She tells me 'he's scared of how much he likes me. He's scared of my pussy it's so tight, he's just overwhelmbed by me. Hes taking me shopping in Portsmouth for my birthday' etc etc. Birthday comes he doesn't call. She also says oops we did it unprotected, fuck. I offero to buy her the morning after pill, she said 'its alright ive got a couple of days I'll get it' she never does. 

Rewind to before the original partner was incarcarated. She tells me they have been trying for a baby but with no luck for months. 2 days after he was taken away we were both having a laugh about having our period at the same time. I know she definitely did have it, without being gross I saw 'evidence' in our shared bathroom. 

Fast forwards again, she is now pregnant! Now I don't know about you but i learned in school that you don't have period when you are pregnant. She tells the guy her happy news and he tells her in no uncertain terms ' you are getting rid of it' . She tries and tries to bend him round, he is not having it. 

A week later she tells me 'my period app just told me the dates, Its definitely my partner's'

The partner is out of jail now. I think she is carrying someone else's baby. In fact it's pretty certain. Partner is over the moon. He doesn't even know she cheated. 

What the fuck can I do? What if he finds out? What if he finds out I knew and didn't tell him?

&amp;#x200B;

She has been very cagey and gone from being always texting me to no contact at all. 

Just to note, he is half asian, she is very white blonde, the guy she cheated with is also very white blonde. Partner has children from a previous relationship also with a very pale white woman and they children are quite dark. What if the kid comes out pale as milk?

Any opinions?

I moved out shortly after she became pregnant, she was lying about everything frm the police raiding our house because she is a big time drug dealer and was under observation (untrue, the partner sells a bit of weed, she called emergency services because she had a panic attack and they broke the door)

to 'don't use too much of that flea spray, it cost £90' (It was £6 maximum on ebay)

474,"TL;DR at the bottom!


I’ve had this friend for almost 3 years now. We’ve had a very rocky relationship, ranging everywhere from him being unhealthily in love with me, to him ghosting me for a month because my wishes did not align with his romantic interests. Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider our friendship a toxic one and I’m not convinced it was ever anything other than that, but I will say I had a lot of love for him at one point and still cherish the good in all the mess. Recently, though, things have gotten unbearable for me and I’m not sure what I’ll gain from posting this if not, at the very least, some momentary relief in sharing my story to whoever will listen. 

This friend of mine has battled shit thrown at him in life that I could never begin to understand. From abusive and suicidal family members; bullying and sexual assault; as well as a variety of personal and familial undiagnosed mental illnesses, I literally cannot wrap my head around how much he’s suffered from and continues to suffer from everyday.

This friend has openly and explicitly leaned on me for intense emotional support from the earliest days of our friendship and, at first, I took on his mental health as a personal responsibility of mine. I viewed it as a mission of sorts to fulfill whatever role he required of me by the day, even by the hour. Frequently, I was his therapist, while other times I acted as a mother figure, friend, romantic interest, sexual fantasy, teacher. Anything he needed, I felt myself molding into for his sake. Often, this would require that I put myself in situations that were very uncomfortable for me, but I’d either manipulate myself into believing I was enjoying whatever was happening at the moment, or at the very least, that it was necessary to keep him happy and alive until tomorrow (he’d often confide in me about his battles with suicidal thoughts, and tell me that “I was the only thing that brought him joy and meaning in life”). It didn’t help that his friends would tell me I was exacerbating his depression by not being with him romantically, but I can’t exactly blame him for their behavior.

As expected, the first year or so of our friendship took an enormous toll on my mental health. I had completely lost any sense of self identity and self worth that did not revolve around how he was feeling on a daily basis, so when he proceeded to ghost me completely for a month after all this, it broke me. It took a lot of my own willpower and the love and care of a dear friend at the time to pick myself up again. And after that, I vowed to myself that I would never, ever take on a role for him that was anything other than a friend. I’ve been working on developing forgiveness and re-establishing my trust in him; it’s been very hard for me, but I’d like to believe I’m taking better care of myself now than I was a year or two ago. 

What makes all of this even more difficult, though, are his political and humanitarian beliefs. We‘d often disagree on politics in the past, but I was able to brush it off as a difference in the ways we were raised and the cultures we came from. It’s worked alright up until now (granted, I also tolerated a lot of behavior before that I cannot imagine being okay with today). He has his heart set on voting for a particular presidential candidate that would feel like a blatant attack on myself and my other friends’ identities &amp; existences. His inability to empathize with the suffering of those he does not know / does not relate to (which, I understand completely is likely a symptom of the immense trauma he has experienced) has only worsened over the past few months, and there’s this heavy pressure on me to ‘educate’ him and have these difficult conversations about how harmful his words/beliefs can be to those around him, including me, because “I’m the only person he has left to care about” and will listen to. On top of all this, he prides himself a lot on his ability to ‘remove his emotions from conversations like these’ which means I’m forced to do the same if I have any hopes of getting my thoughts through to him. I’ve essentially realized I have to use logic to teach him how to have empathy for other people, and I‘m just not able to do that.

It’s not that I haven’t tried, but he’s hurt me a lot during these conversations. Too many times, he’s attempted to debate me on whether or not the oppression of certain marginalized communities I identify with actually exists. Beyond this, I also have friends in communities that are heavily discriminated against that I care for deeply and it’s so conflicting to remain close with someone like him, while I also claim to advocate for said friends as they know of his harmful beliefs.

I don’t know what to do, I’m so lost. If I think about this for too long, I become anxious and start to feel ill. Recently, I learned that a childhood friend of mine passed away and the news has been so painful for me to cope with as I’m (luckily) not very experienced with death and loss. I can’t even begin to think about the possibility of the world losing him so permanently. I know more about him than anyone else does, and the fact that I could, in some way, be responsible for any harm that may come to him is terrifying. I can’t even imagine speaking to him about this, I can barely talk about it anonymously on reddit.

I’m in love with her and I want things to work, but she’s not going to change, she constantly accuses me of things without any evidence, and she knows I’m not actually doing anything she accuses me of, she just does it for the sake of it.

She needs to have the passwords to all my accounts, if she doesn’t have them she will argue until I give in and give them her, if a girl messages me I have to block her instantly no matter what it’s about. She is NEVER wrong in her eyes, everything she does she believes is the right thing and anyone who tells her different is wrong and she will argue with them.

486,"Basically, I need to know how to deal with creeps. I've had many uncomfortable and several scary interactions over the course of 21 years, and every single time that I've reflected on the situation, I've felt like I didn't handle it correctly.

I'm asking this question currently because I had a bad experience with a creepy cashier just now. So, I started walking to a convenience store around 2:55 A.M. I know that's fairly late to be out walking, but the convenience store is super nearby, and I bring a taser with me when I leave the house at night (only to be used as a last resort).

The convenience store wound up being locked, but the cashier saw me at the door and let me in anyway. I walked in, quickly grabbed what I wanted, then brought my items up to the counter.

The cashier started asking me questions while I was paying. He asked me where I lived. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said ""no"". He kept asking me why and being pushy and I was just uncomfortably cracking jokes about how boyfriends were too much work. At one point he asked for my name, so I told him it, and he reached out to shake my hand. We shook hands ... and he didn't let go. I tried pulling my hand back but he held onto it, rubbed it, and commented on how soft my hand was. He did this on two occasions (both times he went in for a handshake and held onto my hand while I tried to pull away). At another point, he said something about how since I don't have a boyfriend, I should go out to dinner with him. He then asked for my number. I told him he could put *his* number into my phone. I figured this was good because then I'd have his number, but he wouldn't have my number. He took my phone, entered his number in, then abruptly called himself using my phone (meaning he foiled my plan and he now has my number as well). 

This whole time I was trying to make it obvious that I had to go. Eventually, I started *insisting* that I had to go and he did let me go (he actually followed me out to the parking lot, but by that point I was OUT of there and wasn't listening to anything else he had to say. 

Anyway, unfortunately, this dude now has my number, my name, and several other important pieces of information about me. I got flustered and couldn't think up any lies on the spot. He's now texting me *a lot* and telling me that he wants to take me to dinner at 7 P.M. on Sunday. In a normal interaction where a guy is trying to ask me out or whatever, I have no problem saying ""no"" if I'm not interested. But when it's ~3:00 A.M., there's nobody else around, the dude is at least like 30-45 years OLDER than me, my only form of self-defense is a taser that I have no practice using, the man has just proved his creepiness twice by not letting my hand go after a handshake while I tried to pull it away, and I'm scared+just trying not to piss them off by altogether turning down their advances ... That's an entirely different situation.

So, anyway, I guess what I really want to know is how to deal with situations like this in the future, because I don't know that I handled it correctly.",27Jul2020,1

We can't go out super often just because of his schedule. He'll have to go to work at around 2 PM on some days and some days he has to leave early in the morning. 

We've watched shows and movies together. We've gone out to eat together. We go to a little downtown area near us sometimes, but rarely because it's the same stores, restaurants and people. There's not a lot to do around where we live. We don't have a movie theater, we don't have a mall, we don't really have anything around us, so if we want to do anything we have to go a city over. We're in between two, so we either go left or right basically, and there's more places, but it's still just stores.

489,"So... my sister is so difficult and weird that I don't know what to say anymore. She has developed tourette's syndrome when she was 7 and I guess that makes her talk out more of what's going on in her head (sorry for those who don't understand what tourette syndrome is). 

So why am I here specifically? She gets extremely rude to us. She always thinks she's neve wrong and she drives us crazy for years of being thr one that's so rude and disrespectful to her family. And she seems to have no shame and she's kinda unintelligent with emotional connections with people. Example, one time she did something wrong in the kitchen just a little mistake and then out uncle said to her by explaining the right way to do it and how she should never do the way she did it (this was 2 months ago so I forgot specifically) and she got mad and slam the door only because she got lectured at even though my uncle was talking calmly and slowly she still gets mad for that single act.

Like I said earlier, she has tourette syndrome now if you don't know what that means I tell you. Tourette syndrome is a mental disorder that makes you do noises and have tick movements. Why do I bring this up well this disorder also makes you speak what's on your mind and she is prolly unaware of that. Someone says something to her and she would prolly mutter to herself ""bit-ch shut up"" or something like that. We always ignored it because we didn't know what to do but now we need to do something as of last night.

So last night, she and my mom got into a argument about clothing or whatever. My mom got mad cuz she was being disrespectful and she banged on the wall. My mom got so pissed that she yelled and lectured her for years of being disrespectful to all of us. She got in detail of every little thing that wrong with her and it was kinda sad. My sister was crying as well. My mom went long and long about how no matter how hard she tried my sister is always the same. She doesn't want that no more. No one does.

This morning, I overheard her in the hallway. Her tourette syndrome kinda exposed this sentence. ""Bitch not my fault you started the argument I didn't do anything wrong"". I was kinda heartbroken because my mom works hard for us because we had a tough upbringing (not gonna go into that) and she really tried to raise us the best she can. I have my own issues, but at least I have the emotional intelligence to listen and apply what I learned but my sister is so dumb that she can't process to change her life.

490,"Hi there! I’m a 27 M here with a not so positive outlook on life anymore. For 3 years, I was working a factory job with a 3/4 schedule that had 12 hour shifts from 5:30pm-5:30am. After being there for so long I felt like my mental and physical have been put through my enough and I made a life altering decision to leave.

I now work a 6am-2pm job M-F thinking it would be the best for me. And it was!.... for about 2 weeks. Now I feel like I have no energy again and only end up sleeping about 3 hours a night before getting ready for work. I would get home after my shifts and immediately take long naps just cause I feel powerless.

I was wondering if I could get any advice on what to do with myself and to feel more energetic even after work. Thanks.",27Jul2020,1
491,"hi, i need help, cant even think straight right now.

Im 21 years old male. Currently student at ""A"" university. Electrics and electronics engineering department. I like my deparment. I wanna be developer/programmer. But school is really hard and filled with egoist proffessors. I failed one year and retake whole year. Really shitshow teachers believe me. I couldnt even look my final paper which im %100 sure i passed but teacher scored me lower and i failed again. I asked may i check my paper sir i really do believe i make better and he said no ill look for you.etc etc i dont wanna bore you. I dont like the city where ""A"" university is. I dont have any friend and i mean by ALL means i dont have any friend. My whole life spending in front of a monitor keep programming. no im not the fatto you see right now which is self-conscious. Im actually really friendly and have a lot of friends across the city. I tried to make friends here but everyone here is different than me. Some of them kids who still brag about alcohol and drugs, some of them are ""tryin to be fuckboy"" who is just a pussyguard/simp which acts different around girls, some of them tryin to be coolboy and stonecold all of em just trying to be not themself, acting different. like i say i dont wanna bore you.

 I have been re-take the university exam this year for changing my school to ""B"" university. to get the same deparment of the university. But i have failed. ""B"" university B city is everyone i wanted. I have my longterm friends there my brothers. The girl , i think i love her is there. Whenever i think about her thinking her face makes me smile, feel warm, if i could stop the time i would prefer stop it while on her arms huggin her. I think i love her. and she was not really empty to me too. she is talking lovely with me i think shes onto me too. the city i  like more more friendly people, i have new friends even i dont live there, more festivals, lower rents etc etc. but like i said i failed.

theres another option, i can change my school with another system which i can go B university but different deparment Industrial engineering. and im not really sure about it. in A university i have eu acreditation which ill have in B university too but i wanna be programmer/developer and industrial engineering not really for me i think i dont know i cant think straight im in eee still learning myself how to program i can do same shit in industrial engineering to i dont really know.

So two options:

1-) stay A university, shitty university life (not really sure i would even graduate with this teachers), dont be with your love

2-)go B university, learn what you dont want to be, work really really hard to self learn programming.

&amp;#x200B;

like title choices have consuquences, i really would like to go ask this an elder people with knowledge to which is important your lifetime work or your love but i dont have people like this around me.

492,"So... my sister is so difficult and weird that I don't know what to say anymore. She has developed tourette's syndrome when she was 7 and I guess that makes her talk out more of what's going on in her head (sorry for those who don't understand what tourette syndrome is). 

So why am I here specifically? She gets extremely rude to us. She always thinks she's neve wrong and she drives us crazy for years of being thr one that's so rude and disrespectful to her family. And she seems to have no shame and she's kinda unintelligent with emotional connections with people. Example, one time she did something wrong in the kitchen just a little mistake and then out uncle said to her by explaining the right way to do it and how she should never do the way she did it (this was 2 months ago so I forgot specifically) and she got mad and slam the door only because she got lectured at even though my uncle was talking calmly and slowly she still gets mad for that single act.

Like I said earlier, she has tourette syndrome now if you don't know what that means I tell you. Tourette syndrome is a mental disorder that makes you do noises and have tick movements. Why do I bring this up well this disorder also makes you speak what's on your mind and she is prolly unaware of that.

Those details don't really hold that much importance except that I folded most of the pages.

THE QUESTION 
How can I tell what pages are the ones he marked and how long ago they were folded over, since the book has been closed and at times smushed so the pages might've flattened. 
How do I make sure I don't mix in pages that I might have refolded... or anything along those lines so I can maintain the sentimental value for his brother.

School: 

I scraped by in undergrad and I had this idea that I wanted to keep going. Well, I enrolled in community college not once, not twice, but three times and quit every single time. I also enrolled in a graduate course and quit when things started to pile up and become hard as fuck.... I’ve given up on it temporarily. 

Just as a background, I studied sociology instead of choosing something that I knew would challenge me internally. I purposely took the easier route and still graduated with a 2.78 grade point average. 

YouTube:

Again, I’ve uploaded about 50 videos over a 3 year period. I have these ambitions of doing it full time, but 50 videos over a 3 year period certainly won’t cut it. 

Work:

I quit my last job, but this is something that I feel capable of doing since it’s life or death. I quit my last job but I felt it was warranted since they were asking wayyyyy too much from me. I tried to toughen it out over a 7-8 month period and nothing changed and my heart was no longer in it. 

Writing: 

I did a bomb job at this. From 2016-2018 I was super passionate about writing and sharing stories online and I stopped. I stopped and I started gaming for hours a day. Video games. 

Conclusion:

Has anyone else lived a similar experience? I want to stop quitting when shit gets challenging but it seems so hard due to habit and taking the easier route.

Any tips on changing this?

Beyond that, I think even if I did have a good comeback, I'd still just walk away sad because I know their put down about dancing is true about me. I have a hard time laughing at myself and accepting that maybe my dancing is just a flaw I'll have forever. I always hear women say a bad dancer is a turn off and women love partying.

505,"My partners teen cousin has recently identified as racist and uses every opportunity to push his newfound ideas onto anybody within earshot.

As far as we can tell he had a falling out with a number of his old (ex?) friends, all of whom were black, over refusing to fight with them against another group of friends of his. A group of 6 black teens arrived at his house to beat him up and were fought away by him and his father. 

Following on from this he was threatened not to step foot into the local town or they would ""get him"". This led to extreme anxiety - panic attacks on driving into the town and moving to his aunties house so they couldn't find him. He has started therapy to help manage his newfound anxiety. He has now convinced his family to move to the other side of the country deeming it safer and better for all of them. His parents, unsure of what to do with him in such a fragile mental state, agreed (which is madness in itself). 

He arrived into my house last night and started off again. 'black bastards"" this ""they need to go home to their own country and leave mine alone"". 

It's disgusting and I told him as much. He was warned that racism isn't tolerated in my house and that if it continued he could leave. He asked me to hear him out and knowing the story I allowed him to tell me what happened.

I explained that he can't outlaw a whole race because of 5 or 6 people, that he's heading towards a life of being an outcast because the majority of people don't accept racism, and went through each individual point and brought it back to something else that couldn't be pointed to a racial issue. 

I explained systemic racism and the importance of black lives matter. 

After an hour or so of this, he decided to shut the conversation down with ""they're cunts anyway"" and my partner changed the subject to stop an all-out argument.

It's sad because prior to this altercation he was one of the biggest allies in regards to racism and now he's flipped 180.

509,"Using a throwaway because lots of people I work with know my normal account.

**First about me and my current situation**

I work for a large company which mainly does work for the government of my country. I've been there about 4 years now and have carved out a nice niche role for myself where I am considered the SME. I like the company and work with loads of great people. The company has a reputation of somewhere you work for life and I could see myself doing so, its difficult to get into and you don't usually get the chance to come back if you leave.

I feel like what I do makes a difference and I earn about enough to be comfortably middle class (being the first in my family to go college and get out of the working class, low skilled, jobs). The problem with the niche role is of course that there isn't really any progressions from this position.

I am engaged to a wonderful woman who I met about a year before starting this job, she earns about half what I do, my salary pays all the bills and her salary is the money for doing fun things together. I work a reasonable commuting distance to live close to my home town so can visit all my family often.

**The story so far...**

About 6 month ago the assistant director to my unit in the company moved to be a director of a competitor in a different country, I only met him about 4-5 times in my career so it didn't register outside of ""huh, he's leaving"" when the email came around.
 
A couple of months after that I was contacted by a recruiter for the competitor the director moved to, apparently they wanted to pivot to a similar operating model to my current company (makes sense since the director for that area came from the company) and wondered if I was interested in moving across on a 5 year contract. I told them I wasn't interested as I am happy where I am. Plus my current role is perm, why would I go to a 5 year contract?

A month later the director contacts me and asked me to have a look at the job profile and have a long think if I am sure. I took a look and it is basically setting up and running a team of about 5 people who each do part of my current role. After a week or so I politely declined again. Saying again I am happy where I am. 

Last week their recruitment contacted me again, with an offer. They're offering 5x my current salary to move across (I rang back to double check that wasn't a misprint). They've said to think on it and let them know by end of September.

**Where I am now**

I enjoy my current role, I make enough to live on and have lots of colleagues I get on with really well  but that 5x salary though.

I would have to move country and have all the culture shock that comes with that. It would be a big one too; the internet is censored, no Netflix, no Reddit.

 My fiance would be able to come but not work due to visa restrictions. It would only be for 5 years then I would have to find another job somewhere.

I don't know if I would get the same feeling of making a difference, I have no idea how I would get on with colleagues with such a different culture, especially as a manager which I have no experience of.

I don't know how my fiance would get on with not working as she's never not been in school or work. She says she's happy whichever decision I make and she would find something to do but again with everything so locked down it could be a struggle. 

**Final thoughts**

I am happy where I am and like being near family, having the stability of my current role, I like contributing to my country. In the offered role I would be on a fixed contract, a long plane ride from family and not contributing anything to my country. The only benefit I can see would be the salary, my problem is that is a BIG benefit. I'd be pulling 1% money.

512,"TL;DR: Has anyone who was naturally introverted, shy and socially anxious, ever become an outgoing ""life of the party"" type of person, or am I always going to be bound by my nature as a more reserved, quiet person?

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short I grew up the anxious, shy kid. Always called ""quiet"". There's a number of reasons for that I'm sure part genetics but also some traumatic events from a young age but none of that really matters to the question I'm seeking advice on I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now in my early 30s and I've made massive improvements in my social skills. It's taken a lot of hard work but now I have no problem chatting with strangers although it does cause slight anxiety, and I'm always a bit anxious meeting new people and worried I said something stupid or embarrassed myself it's still way better than my teen years.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a successful career, had a job where I managed \~250 people and frequently spoke in front of groups of hundreds of people, very senior execs etc. Took a while but now even that doesn't bother me that much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved to a new city with a new job and noticed that a couple people have remarked that I'm  ""quiet"" or ""reserved"", both at work and in non-work social events. I don't think they mean it in a negative way but to me it comes off negatively because I've tried so hard not to be that guy. Once I get to know people I'm much more talkative but I guess I'm uncomfortable in social situations with new people still and my natural inclination is to say nothing than risk saying something dumb or coming off too ""chatty"". I never have any trouble speaking up in meetings at work or saying something I think needs to be said, but again the natural inclination is to be more reserved. 

I get very positive feedback all the time, told I'm kind, intelligent, smart, hard-working, great team player etc. but I just hate being known as  a quiet guy.

Anyways, I've always wanted to be more outgoing. One of my buddies, Jimmy, he's one of my closest  friends and a naturally charismatic, funny and charming guy that can become your friend in 15 seconds of meeting him. I'd imagine him moving to a new town and within 2 months having a big circle of friends, hosting parties, well liked etc.  That's just not me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'll never be like my friend Jimmy, but if I could get 50% of the way there I'd feel great. If I had to describe the biggest difference between the two of us in these situations it's that he's completely confident in himself whenever meeting new people. He'll make dumb jokes, even say silly things that I might be embarrassed by, or that the wrong person might consider mildly ""offensive"" but his confidence and natural charm 95% of the time people just laugh it off. He doesn't care, and I know that's one thing people find endearing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously the answer is ""be more confident"", ""stop caring what other people think"", etc. etc. I've heard my whole life and I have made massive improvements on that front, but it's easier said than done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I guess I was hoping someone who was naturally more shy, and reserved might give thoughts on how they became more outgoing and a ""life of the party type"".",27Jul2020,1

Recently he said he's always had these ""feelings"" for me, he doesn't know if he cares in that way and is afraid to repeat the past mistake. I happened to kinda fall in love with him truly for the first time and he used me to get smth from me, but didn't go fully with it because he realised he might be repeating the past and he told me, it still hurted me because I thought he truly cares and it was the scariest thing burning out that illusion. I thought about cutting off contact

Now, he has these manipulation tendencies or way of being that he thinks pushes people away, suicidal tendencies and sais that without me he would be long dead most likely because he feels like I've been a guardian angel for him.

522,"I used to be very close to this person and at one point considered them a best friend. We met in our second year in college and, along with a few other people, were each other's first real friends that we made on campus. 

At this point, I've known him for about 6 years and I realize just how shallow the friendship was between us. Below sharing a few similar interests we have radically different world views, outlooks on life, our senses of humors. He says left and I say right. While I don't wish him ill, we are completely incompatible in our views and personalities and don't want to be around him anymore. Among several other problems, he uses his female friends like emotional crutches and has never made an attempt to address his insecurities. It's exhausting to be friends with him because he'll take up all your time talking about his issues and completely dismiss your own. 

However, he's still really close to many of my other friends and is always at parties. I think my other friends are aware that I don't like him, but like him well enough to keep him around.  For the last year, outside of the occasional get together, I don't communicate with him (except for a happy birthday or congratulatory text) and I never hang out with hi one-on-one. I feel like a fraud for being cordial with him at these get togethers and kind of just want to tell him that I can't stand his guts.

Should I just keep being passive aggressive until he gets the hint that our friendship isn't what it used to be? Should I tell him what I really think about him but cause unnecessary drama in our circle of friends. Last thing I want is to be the ""problem"" person not invited to parties.",27Jul2020,1
523,"I need advice on how to handle a situation without involving law enforcement. 

My partner of 5 years is snapping. We live together but I'm currently staying elsewhere due to the fact that other the last few days he's been losing touch with reality more and more.  It started due to lack of sleep. He's had issues with sleeping his entire life and sometimes only gets a couple hours, and sometimes he gets none at all. He also has chronic pain which makes it worse for him.

Over the past couple of weeks he's been losing  time and then not believing me when I try to tell him what happened. Or he thinks what happened two nights ago happened one night ago. He's dead sure I'm wrong, and he gets agitated at me when I try to tell him (not agitated that he can't remember right -agitated that in his mind, I'm lying to him.) He's also been slurring his words a lot or saying random incohesive things. I think sometimes he's dreaming and then either responding out loud to the dream or trying to tell me about something in the dream but he can't even get the full thought out, or it's a part of a thought, or it's slurred. And when I try to ask him about it or clarify he gets agitated with me and thinks I'm just not listening to him good enough.  He's also been drooling a LOT which makes me believe he might be on something that he's not telling me about. 

It got really serious a few days ago when he couldn't find something he needed (to remain as anonymous as possible I'll just leave it at that) and he started becoming increasingly paranoid. He's a bit paranoid by nature, but he started accusing me of hiding things intentionally or collaborating with other people to hide things from him. He's been accusing me over and over of hiding things he's looking for, and I even try to rationalize with him why I would ever do that, even if just to avoid the situation we're in. He's not hearing it. He also started accusing me of other things I haven't done (like take my clothes off for money, something I'd never do) 

When he gets like this he can't be reasoned with and if I offer any kind of help I'm rebuffed and usually belittled. At the same time he asks me for help, but when I ask for clarification on what's going on (so I can actually help) he just gets frustrated and looks at me with disgust.

Let me clarify right now that I am in no personal danger. He's never threatened me and never come close to hitting me. He'd destroy the whole house before he touches me. But after the last few nights of this, it was becoming clear that me being present was not making it better for him, and that he was losing touch with reality, and that he was blaming a lot of it on me, so I'm staying elsewhere for both of our own good right now.

I fear there may be substances involved although I don't know what they are. But I'm aware that it's likely also a factor here, which makes it that much harder to bring him into reality.

Anyways, the only reason I'm posting this is because I just want to help him and other people close to him do as well. We cannot get law enforcement involved, that's a for sure. He doesn't want to believe something is wrong with him and I don't want to put him into a facility against his wishes. And we (me and his family) just don't know what to do to help him. But at this point it's become to where I can't manage anything because he has no grip on reality and is starting to turn against me while simultaneously telling me I've abandoned him.

I'm really desperate for any ideas here from someone who has dealt with anything similar. I do not want to lose the person I love. Thank you for your time.",27Jul2020,1

525,"Throwaway just incase. A little backstory:
My parents got a divorce last month. The time leading up to the divorce was very bad. My father is the most narcissistic human I have ever met. He still firmly believes he did nothing wrong, while being a terrible husband and such.  
My mom has moved on, and is doing decently well and got an apartment for herself. My dad has not moved on at all. He is slowly getting crazier and crazy. He has been drinking a lot, which he only did socially before. He also had guns at his house, and my brother went and removed them from the house. My brother is also not well in the head so that's just icing on the cake. I recently found out that my father has been stalking my mom. I have a fear that he is going to do something bad. He is very mentally unstable at this point. He has had multiple meltdowns, and everyone around him is slowly turning on him because they can't take him anymore. People at work don't want to be around him and such. He has threatened suicide recently many times, including when my mother was with him. He did the classic ""If you leave me I'm going to kill myself"" stuff with my mother. I don't personally believe he will ever do anything, but I don't think I have any choice but to call him in at this point.  
I told my mother to get a restraining order, but there's one slight issue. They have sold their house and they must sign off on it together with both present, next month. The realtors said that they must both be present as both of their names are on the house. My dad has spiraled for the worst and I believe he will not make it that long as he's getting crazier and crazier everyday.  
My question is, if my father is admitted to a psychiatric hospital is this going to affect the sale of their house? They both need this money to live(although my dad isn't moving on) so the sale of this house is very important. My dad recently told my brother he demands his guns back as well, which scares me. Sorry for the crappy write up but it's hard to articulate this all into words. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",27Jul2020,1

528,"I have and still struggle with binge eatting, I have lost a lot of weight but still a long way to go. 

I have recently come home from university. To live with my 2 sisters (it's a very complicated situation.)

I'm 22. Perfectly entitled to make my own decisions, even if they are bad ones.

Since I have come home from university I have found a high volume, but healthy diet, is really good for me. I enjoy it and enjoy the act of eating. As long as I am maintaining or losing who cares right? Let me do me.

They nag at me. Alot. About how much I eat. Alot. Like I'm eatting too much protein. Too many eggs. Even though I am weight lifting and not gaining weight. 

It results in an argument about calories in, calories out which somehow they dont agree with. Often resorting to character assassination and how I am fundamentally floored in some way. Very deeply personal insults. That hurt.

I am the person who lost this weight, and yet I am still constantly be questioned. I am so angry about it. The lack of trust. It's nothing but a personal insult.

I feel the only way to avoid arguement is to put my head down and say ok, even when it gets very personal.

This is my childhood home and I have every right to be here as much as they do. 

It makes me so angry even now writing this, the family that my whole life told me to lose weight and ""did everything for me."" Yet it was when I made my own decision and did things my way I started making progress. Simultaneously complimenting how good i look and then everytime i have a meal tell me I'm eatting too much. 

I'm still just that little fat brother to them. Who cant control himself. I'm so so angry.

They do not drop this, they will literally nag until they feel better. 

Entire situation only makes me want to eat more, I am emotional and insecure I will fully admit, but this just is unfair.

I honestly dont believe they do this because they ""want the best for me"" I feel they are bored and have alot of energy from cabin fever and need a way to channel their toxicity.",27Jul2020,1

530,"My mom and I (20F) dont really get along well. We dont argue often or anything because we dont really talk to each other at home. I try to stay away from her and not talk about anything that really matters to me. But we are both aware of the coldness between each other. But on outside she acts like we are fine. She shows this bad side of her when an argument arises.

So today was a really hard and important day for me. I received the results of a very important exam that I have been stressing over for a year. She was aware I was stressed as she told me right after the exam that she was worried I would get sick or something. It's so hypocritical of her because she didnt make anything easier for me. She would always subtly say stuff that would make me even more stressed. And much more stuff. And Im not really good with dealing people like that. I come off as more direct and aggressive but that doesnt do anything for me. And I tried to ignore the stuff she said to me this year so that I would focus better on my studies - she knew it and took advantage of it. But once the exam was over she suddenly started to act all good - because she knew I wouldnt tolerate it anymore. She would give me attitude if I didnt study or would criticise me however when she was talking to people she would say ""oh the most important thing is her health. I dont mind about the exam"". She never once said this to my face. She never acted this way. She ignored how stressed I was and ignored the difficulties I had. 

However today, when she learnt I received the results, she just came into my room, causing me to wake up and she said in the most insincere voice ""did you receive the results sweetie?""  Like she claims to know I was so stressed yet she was all cheerful and ignored the fact that maybe I had a bad result (which I did). So I told her to go away and its not really her business. So she gave me attitude again, raised her voice and just slammed the door. Is this how you treat someone that just received such an important result? Completely ignoring how stressed I was. She acts as if she took the exam herself. And whole day she treated me the same. Whenever she came into my room she left with slamming my door.

Im just so tired of thinking how unfair she acts towards me. I know she doesnt care, and she didnt hide she didnt care the whole year. She probably guesses my result isnt good so she acts all cheerful and pressures me to tell my result to her. I dont know how to deal with her. Please any advice?",27Jul2020,1

I wasn’t entirely sure which subreddit to post this under so advice seemed like a good place to come! 

I’ve recently applied and been hired for my dream job in a school! I’ve sent off all the relevant paperwork so they can get to work on my DBS check and in the meantime I’ve been sent a medical questionnaire which ties into the DBS. It’s a really intense questionnaire and they wanna know everything, and I mean EVERYTHING,  about my medical history. One of the last questions is about mental health and I stated I have suffered from depression and anxiety for many years now, although one very specific question asked if I had ever attempted to hurt myself. When I was 17 years old and in a pretty bad place I took an overdose and landed myself in hospital but it wasn’t very severe and I was discharged the next day. I was prepared to disclose this as it didn’t seem major to me and it’s way way in my past and I’ve changed and grown so much since then. It was a stupid thing I did when I was basically still a kid. However, my mums friend then told me she was denied a job working with kids after they found out she took an attempt at her own life and both her and my mother told me it was best to leave it out. 

What I want to know is, is it super immoral of me to leave that out? Will they find out anyway from my GP and will I then be in trouble for not disclosing it? Is my mums friend just exaggerating and it won’t make a difference at all even if they do know? 

I just want some guidance on what to do here and perhaps someone with experience on the matter could shed some light on how to go about this.",27Jul2020,1

538,"I'm writing this pretty much just to let it out.

My dad has very unstable mental health. He's never been abusive or anything like that, but he's always complaining about everything and getting really mad about random things. He's frustrated about not having a better life, more money, a better family. He would like me (single child) to act happier and more loving towards him. He's also alway complaining about my mom not being skinnier, he also snores extremely loud so it's been ages since they slept together.

You see, I'm a pretty quiet person, I don't laugh that often and I don't show my love (hugs, kisses) as much as other people do, but that's just my personality. I also complaing about things I don't like, in a casual way. Otherwise I've almost finished college and even though I don't have many friends I live a healthy life . My dad is often out of home because of work, so he doesn't understand me that well. He's always making jokes that upset me (even though my mother keeps on telling him to stop) and if I say something then complains I'm always butthurt.  It doesn't matter if I try telling him that's just the way I am though, he still feels bad about it and feels thinks the atmosphere at home is uncomfortable.

My mom also gets angry with him every once in a while. Usually because he gets home from work and starts complaining about the house not being clean, or there not being enough groceries. 

Sometimes he gets really mad and says ""I'm this close to just say fuck everything"". I've tried talking with him about it but he's not open. He just says he's not ok and to just give him space. Some years ago he got really depressed and had to take a leave from work but no matter what he's closed off about going to therapy.

On top of everything, I grew up around my mother so I have a better relationship with her, plus she's more communicative which makes things easier. Because of this sometimes my dad feels like he's all alone by himself and we're ganged upon him.

Anyway, I know that's not everything, but I can't help but think things would be better if I had been a happier child. Sometimes my parents make me feel like it'd be better if I had been a loving child, always laughing, had a lot of friends and was passionate about some career. I just can't help it I'm the way I am. I used to be shy at school and felt alone. I never gave them any big problems but I was sad often. I was also very stressed out during my first college years and used to complain about how they didn't want to talk about it with me. I'm so much better now, on my way to applying for a pretty good job, but I'm still very independent and logical. I'm more of a pitbull than a golden retriever, if you get me?

So yeah, I'm just sad my dad is like this. I wish he could accept his life and be happy about it and just have fun with me and my mom. We're not rich but we can still live comfortably while watching our expenses, and we could get along if he was more open about his feelings and stopped going on rampages about things... I will always work on being a better person but he still needs to accept me for who I am because that's not going to change. My mom too isn't going to become a VS model any time soon.",27Jul2020,1

How can an existing thing no longer exist anymore? That is impossible. There has to be an afterlife or something, or reincarnation. Once something exists, it will always exist. We can’t just become nothing forever. I don’t know if I sound crazy or what? People always compare what happens after death to what happens before we were born. But you can’t compare those two at all, because we couldn’t even calculate time before birth. However, once we finally are born, then we began to calculate time and the eternal nothingness that occurred before birth came to an end. We became alive. But once we die, you’re telling me that’s the beginning of eternal nothingness forever? Eternally, forever, and ever? Impossible. Our energy has to live on somewhere. Nothing ends forever, it always lives on. Whether it’s through soul, energy, or another life. My brain cannot comprehend how something can just cease to exist forever. In order for something to exist, we have to experience it. So in order for death to exist, we have to experience it. And what is “death?” Is it really dying? Or is it simply just the end of physical being, which is then passed onto energy somewhere in another universe or turned into another human being which is then born again? 
But to those of you who do believe in nothingness after we die, why is that so?",27Jul2020,1
544,"My best friend is clinically depressed since senior year highschool, we graduated last year and all the depression symptoms have deteriorated really bad since then. He refuses to talk about his feelings, always replying with ""I'm okay."" Or leaving when he is about to open up with excuses. I try to support him by just talking normally with subjects unrelated to his feelings but he doesn't seem to want to talk, his messages are always vague with little to no detail and the messages are dry, he does want to chat though as he sends me texts sometimes but the only effort he puts are saying ""hi."" In a conversation. Anytime I try to talk to him he puts brick walls. He's very paranoid, not posting anything negative and only replying with positive comments or saying nothing at all, avoids any controversial topics or topics at all. Etc, I asked him ""cats or dogs"" and he left the conversation.

It takes a toll to reply to him mentally, I want to help a struggling friend but he's just becoming someone I avoid, he can hurt my feelings (pointing out how much I eat) but I can't say how I feel because he's gonna think I hate him. I know my friends feel the same about him. I'm afraid to leave the relationship because it might just worsen his condition. He's taking anti depressants but I'm not sure about therapy.",27Jul2020,1
545,"So I've been thinking about this a lot.

My hobby is singing and every time I sing, I feel alive and powerful in some way. I even think singing is almost a passion I can pursue.

So the problem here is that I can't think of a way where singing is important or a strong contributor to the world. 

I extremely value my time and I spend most of it on building a business and improving my life in general. Practicing how to sing takes a good portion of that time because I really wanna develop my voice. So when I feel singing is useless, I think to myself why should I spend hundreds of hours on it when it's not gonna benefit me emotionally by contributing and helping people?

If I become really good at singing, I still feel teaching it to other people won't make me content because I don't view it as a beneficial skill in life. For example, if I knew how to cook, I would be way more happy with that than singing because cooking could be a life changing skill to me, and other people.

I want a hobby as a passion that makes me fulfilled AND contributes somehow to the world. I've got the happy part but not the second one.

Please give me some advice or another perspective on singing.",27Jul2020,1

Also I personally think I may want to skip college and go into a trade or the millitary. I dont want a career, I want to build some wealth for a while and get into real estate/other entrepreneurial things. Thats my goal, to not get a paycheck. But my parents understandably would flip shit if I decide to not go to college.

So my idea is I take a gap year and do some limited schooling to be a mechanic and then look for an apprenticeship. If I can get a job and see if I like it, I stick with it. Otherwise I return to college. And If I hate that, I can just enlist in the army.

548,"I have to make a choice.
I don’t know how to do it I’ve tried the old pros and cons, what it will give you etc etc...

It’s 50/50 with no actual way to decide what I want. 
We all face big decisions but this is the first time in my life I’ve actually not known, usually the tough ones I know deep down but not this.

A) Live out a dream for the next 12 months doing something that will end after that time period.

B) Go for the job/career that will also make me happy and give me a bright future.

Due to being out of the country for a length of time already if I take option A option B is taken away from me for 3 years minimum.


How do you decide between the emotional or the rational.

I always want to take the rational choice it makes the most sense until I listen to music or see some other stimuli and I get overwhelmed with emotion. 

Maybe I’m just not very good at sacrificing. 24 years on this earth and I wish I was older because I don’t have the life experience for this. I guess we can’t know the future.

Living with no regrets sounds great but this is the absolute definition of being stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Any advice at all is welcome, people who have lived their dream or those who haven’t and wish the could have, anyone who’s had to make big choices.

551,"I thought my boyfriend trusted me. He snooped through my phone, and got upset over something (which I was able to reassure and explain that it’s okay, he’s over it now) but it was a big blow out fight, and he said a lot of mean stuff (stuff that he says he doesn’t mean now).

Ironically, I want a relationship where the phones are open. My feelings aren’t hurt that he snooped, I guess. I would’ve preferred he asked for permission, but it’s okay. I want my partner to feel secure, and I want my phone to be a tool, and not a secret place that I don’t share with my partner. I want that to be mutual, but we have different opinions on the matter, so because of that we keep our phones private. 

But since he snooped through my phone, I asked if I could see his. He told me no. We have had issues in our past of him hiding things from me, and a share of things that made me upset and uncomfortable  (turning off notifications so I couldn’t see messages pop up on his phone, little white lies involving girl friends, late night voice messages with a girl, and very far in our past he did get involved with another girl emotionally—sexual messages, etc— but tried to tell me they were “just friends.” I’ve forgiven all these things and we’ve grown from them, but sometimes they bubble back up when we have transparency issues again). Because of all this, I’m very big on transparency and openness. I’ve never snooped through his phone, but the fact that he snooped through mine, and he won’t let me see his, really upset me... to the point of wanting to break up over it.

I packed up my stuff and left, started driving home to my state, but he was so devastated, and said things will change. He said he wants to give me the relationship I want. He really wanted me back, his kids missed me, and he got us a counselor. I have trouble giving up on people, and if someone is willing to fight for me, I’ll keep trying, too.

So I came back. I asked to see his phone (which if he would’ve handed it over, I wouldn’t have even looked, I would’ve just handed it right back to him... it was more for the principal of it). He again told me no, and says he has extreme anxiety over someone looking at his phone, and wants to wait til we can talk to a counselor about it.

Why would he snoop through my phone, but won’t let me see his? Ultimately, I trust my partner. I do. I know he loves me, and for all of you on the outside looking in, it might be hard to see.

My SO works, we are comfortable as far as I know.

Lately I've been trying to do more for myself, but my budget doesn't really allow that. I've been trying to bring it up but he just says that I shpuld ask him for more money when I need it. But then when I do, he gives me just enough to get the groceries for the next day, so I would have to ask him again the next day. I even tell him at that point that that's only enough for 1 day and that I'll need a little more the day after, so the next day I have to ask him again.

Yesterday he gave me 30 euro on top of my grocery budget and told me to buy some nice clothes for myself as he needs new clothes too. 
The thing is, his t-shirts alone are 70 euro a piece and only a couple of weeks he spent over 100 euros on boxershorts.

I'm grateful, but this just makes me feel like shit. 
Because now he expects me to get new clothes, but this is hardly enough to top up my emoty makeup and stuff that I haven't replaced for as long as I don't have my own money. 

I just feel like giving it back and not buying anything, because it will probably just end up in my grocery budget without actually buying myself something. 

I asked him this week if I could maybe spend 50 euros on a webshop because there were some things I needed/wanted, it took me a long time to gather the courage to ask, but his response was: maybe soon. 

I even asked him last night if i could give the money back so I could order from that webshop, but he said no.

558,"TW: sexual assault

This post requires a backstory, tldr at the end.

I (a cis woman) have a boyfriend (let's call him Tony) for 3,5 years. I have always considered myself bisexual and lately as homoflexible, which means I'm more into women than into men, but not a lesbian. I really wanted to explore sexually with women so we decided to look for someone to join us once or more when we liked it. 
So Tony meets a woman at his school (Lisa). Lisa had a boyfriend (Jason) but it was a terrible relationship because Jason is abusive (I won't go into that part). Jason allowed her to sleep with other women though, but Lisa always told us she needs to love someone first. Absolutely no sex without love. Lisa tells me the entire time how much she loves me, but keeps Jason her #1. Stuff like inviting him to things and not me, always choosing his side etc. Every time I felt terrible because of something she did, she told me how much I meant to her etc. Fast forward a few months, Lisa and Jason break up and we have the threesome. At this point, I'm very in love with Lisa, although I see how terrible she can be sometimes. Everything is always my fault and she obviously can't do anything wrong. She's also very hesitant to sex with me and not with men. I get it, first times can be exciting, but we had sex like twice in 10 months excluding the threesome (but she definitely gave more attention to Tony). But she does have sex with men in this period. We're also still not together because she wants some space. A few weeks later she tells me she had sex with Tony. So Tony cheated on me. At least, that what Lisa told me. She then continued to tell me what trash Tony is and I should be with her. I break up with Tony and I want to start things with Lisa. At this point we're 7/8 months into it. I don't trust her yet because of all the times she made me cry and feel guilty, so I want to build that up before I get into a relationship with her. Then Lisa suddenly goes ""it's not gonna work, I don't want a relationship at all"". Then I find out that Lisa actually had sex with Tony against his will. I was super pissed and obviously got back together with him, as he did not cheat on me. Then Lisa gets together with this dude I ""didn't have to worry about"" a week after she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship. She also had sex with him on the same day. It contradicts with everything she told me or how she treated me.
I hate her but I'm still in love with her. How can I get over her?

561,"Hey all, hope everyone is doing well during these times. 

Yeah basically the title sums up the story. My friends and I were at a beach session a couple of weeks ago and as per usual we were pretty turned up. The conversation about a staycation and renting a house for a few days was brought up, I initiated the idea and told my buddies if they would want do it. First thing they said (which I totally understand)  ""money this, money that''.... Whatever... 

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, so for the passed (past) couple of weeks I have been planning this staycation initially for the 3 of us and telling them what cost what and how much they should bring. Get this, one of them said that they would pay $300.... I asked is that for a night ?.... No, for everything in total. Okay cool, that isn't bad but an extra 50 to 75 would of been rock solid because I also booked a boat and a DJ. Granted I have been updating them constantly about this. He comes over to arrange and look at places, and then drops multiple bombs on me how he is only going to spend $200 in total and he may also have to fly out on the dates that I have booked. He said the only reason he is telling me now is because it is all up in the air. Then he is going back to said place at the end of the month! 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and the other friend still hasn't responded to anything at this point. Definitely think he has been trying to avoid paying anything. This is where I make it easier for them. I booked everything, paid the apartment and got the DJ and the boat. I told them all they would have to do is pay the boat entry fee and bring booze and pay for food. They had a free place to stay for that weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night other friend finally messages after i've booked everything. He says he doesn't know about the boat party. I go ahead and tell him that it is on the 15th... he says he will have a think about it! I did all of this for ""us"". Guy, it's not about the money, it is the sheer fact that they are always up for it whenever others have the idea but nobody ever does anything, I finally did! Now all these excuses have come up and shit, and I feel like such a complete idiot for believing that they would be down just as much as I am. No! I don't know if I am overreacting, and I don't know what to do at this point in regards to them.

I feel so let down by the both of them. Not even the first time this has happened. Funny I thought as we matured we'd fucking be more honest.

I (14F) live with my single mum (47F) in an apartment. For a little background my mum is far from perfect but I always thought she'd put her kid above all else to protect me. She has some issues that's for sure like she constantly tells me I'm an anti social, friendless teen with no hobbies that doesn't help around the house and that all I do is use the internet. That is simply not true because although I am an introvert, I have a close group of friends and hobbies that require me to get out of the house.

So today when she came home from work she told me that we would have a guest in 1 week, this 50 year old dude she keeps in contact with on Facebook that still loves with his mum and has old fashioned beliefs about women in general. From my understanding she used to be in a relationship with him in college but they haven't seen each other in over a decade. I freaked out and although I know it's technically a violation of privacy I couldn't help but log in on her messenger account to read about him. I KNOW this makes me a terrible person but I just had to know what guy were talking about and why he's coming here. From what I saw he just downright told my mum that he can take leave from work in a week and that he's coming in our city. My mum told him that she was expecting him later, but didn't tell him not to come.

This guy looks like a total creep, he has sexist jokes on his page, and still lives with his mum I do not want him in my house. I told my mum and she just said that I'm anti social and that that's why I don't want people around me. Then I told her that she should have at least discussed this with me first and she just joked about not having more time to ""prepare"" me. I told her that if they want to meet so badly why doesn't she just visit him? And of course she told me she can't because he LIVES WITH HIS MUM. 

I told my mum that maybe she needs to talk with a therapist about this and ask the professional's opinion on the matter. That's when she got super defensive and aggressive and left the room. I said that because she has been to a therapist before to talk about her daughter's ""problems"", but the therapist told her that she found nothing wrong with my behavior and that she didn't need to see me.

Maybe a month or two ago, I walked in on my father looking at p*rn. It was quite clearly an explicit website. At the time, I acted like I saw nothing and continued on my day. However, it has been weighing on my mind for months. 

I'm aware that it's possible to maintain a healthy relationship whilst enjoying things like this, but my parents have been together for a pretty long time now. I don't know if my mother knows. I want to tell her, but I am afraid that it will damage my parent's relationship. My mother loves my father very much and I don't want to be the reason she distrusts him.

I am worrying that if I tell my mother, she will react badly and it will end in divorce. I'm probably overthinking it, but if it did end in divorce then it would greatly affect me and my younger sibling, my parents who both have already been through one divorce each, and probably my two older (adult) half-brothers. I expect it would also affect my relationship with my father's side of the family.

Also, I know it's probably illogical, but I am also wary of my father now. I didn't like being touched before (no trauma, I just don't like physical affection that much) but I really don't like being touched by him now. I'm not entirely sure why, I'm probably just being paranoid.

So for background information I dated this boy for about a month when we were 14 and 15. We broke up for over some typical teenage drama, however we reunited about two years later. Our “new” relationship was friendly yet flirtatious and turned into an occasional hookup every now and then. We lived about two streets over from each other so we would hangout semi often, however he went to a private school a few towns over from where I lived so I didn’t see him on a daily basis. This is only relevant because during high school I come to find out he would cheat on his girlfriend with me. Younger me sat there and went well this is none of my business and avoided having a conversation with him. Fast forward to us both being in college and he goes to university about two stated over from mine. I would see him during breaks and occasionally during the school year as the city my university is in has numerous celebrations that gather people all over the nation for a few weeks at a time. However, my family moved across the country last year so we have only seen each other about two or three times since then. He texted me a week or two ago asking if I could come see him, which brings us to present day. I’ll be heading there next week to see him and I hope to have a discussion regarding what the hell is going on with us. 

This past year I have heard him say things like how he has always had love for me or that he’d marry me but I have chose to not try to take it to personal as I hold some hesitation. I feel like this comes from how he went behind his ex’s back to hookup with me and how we have never directly had an emotional conversation in person. But I always find him on my mind every now and then. When I see him I feel giddy and full of glee and I try to lie to myself but I know I do have emotions towards him. My worry stems from a lot of whatifs, such as if he really has changed from being a dick, if I’m just a piece of ass to him and the likes. But theres also a side of me wanting to believe he does have feelings too. For context I will be done with university after this Fall and he said he’d want me to pursue a career in the city he just moved to because it “would be nice to have someone he cares deeply about nearby”. His birthday is also on the 31st and he is skipping celebrating with his friends to move &amp; set up his new apartment before I arrive on the second. This obviously causes me so much confusion as theres never been an outright discussion regarding what us exactly is.
The last thing I want is to get stringed along or get a job in the same city as him if it has all been a ploy. I’m usually someone who is very comfortable expressing their emotions but at the end of the day I feel anxious talking to him about it due to my own personal fears. I also don’t want to feel like I’m putting pressure on him into thinking I want to be his girlfriend right at that very moment. So I guess what I’m asking is how the heck do I approach this??

I know this post probably makes me seem stupid, but any advice would be appreciated.",27Jul2020,1
575,"So, basically the backstory here, I have been living with my boyfriend for a while, after leaving my parents house at 19. Things were okay for quite some time, financially, etc. recently I had to leave a job that was severely harming my mental health, and took a huge paycut doing so. I now struggle to pay rent and pay bills. My boyfriend sadly is not understanding about it at all and my depression and anxiety just keep getting worse and worse, I can barely get through a day without having a complete breakdown, or wanting to harm myself. My parents know a little about my struggles right now, with money and the relationship-but they told me at first when I left, I was not to come back. However, now that things have calmed down some with them, I really am considering moving back. How do I go about asking? Has anyone else gone through this? Or something similar?",27Jul2020,1

577,"Obviously I don't mean topics like ""oh my son works with this"" or ""he's dating this nice girl"". I mean personal stuff, like things I've confided in her with, like my sexuality, a recent medical diagnosis, things I'm struggling with mentally or in a relationship. I told her that I hope and wish that she doesn't talk about these things, and she's admitted to a couple of things. I tell her it's not OK and to please stop, but then she defends herself saying ""oh but it's normal for parents to talk about their kids, you'll get it when you have your own, you wouldn't be any better. How was I supposed to know my friend's son would overhear us talking and bully you in school for it? Besides that was years ago why are you still giving me shit for this?""

I feel like she doesn't respect my privacy, I tell her that certain things are for me to share or not share, and certain things people don't need to know about. And yet she defends it, not even acknowledging that it was bad that I ended up being bullied because of her. I love my mother and cherish her, which is why I'm comfortable talking to her about anything, but I get really uncomfortable knowing she talks about some of those things with her friends ""just to share experiences and learn from each other"". To me it's personal, sensitive, but she can't admit to doing wrong, she sees it as an objective thing, that it's normal and I should just deal with it. She even talks to me about her friends' kids if they've been through something similar to what I have and I'm then currently talking about. That's also uncomfortable, because I think about them like wtf I don't even know these people, why would you tell me something so private from them?

It seems to be something all her friends do and because of that I should just accept it in her eyes. Is this something most mothers do? Should I just accept it? If she doesn't stop, I'm not gonna confide in her anymore, but I don't want that to happen",27Jul2020,1

584,"I have a friend group that I’ve hung out with for a long time, some of us go back to second grade. It’s around five or six of us, and since we can’t really see each other in person, we mostly play video games when we have the time. I’d say we’re all pretty close. 

One of my friends, let’s call him Robert, is a lot like the rest of us. He likes to poke fun at people, but unlike the rest of us, if you make fun of him- no matter how playful, he’s real quick to anger and eventually mutes you or outright leaves the call. 

I’ve had repeated problems with Robert as he absolutely loves to mess with me, but every time I do the same to him he gets genuinely angry and threatens to leave. His first outburst came when we were playing Valorant and I tell him not to peak a corner and he tells me to trusts him and then does and ends up dying “How’d that work out for you” I say in a joking matter, and he just loses it. He tells me he’s never playing Valorant with me again and that I’m toxic to play with. I tell him to calm down and we continue playing, but that’s when I first noticed he could act like a bit of douchebag at times. 

The second outburst came when he was playing a game and streaming it for us to see, I vividly remember him making fun of me all day, so I realized the opportunity and as the stream started to lag I kept saying his new computer couldn’t run the pretty low-spec game he was playing, I suggested he refund it and buy a new one, I was pretty obviously joking and everyone except him found it really funny. He proceeded to mute me and whine about how I “go to far”. 

Sprinkled throughout these outbursts were instances of him throwing serious non-playful jabs at me, usually attempts to humiliate me, I don’t really mind them, but it’s important for the story. 

His last outburst came when I got on and he was just about to get off, before he did, another friend of ours asked him why he was getting off and he replied “I don’t like your guys energy right now” referencing a small disagreement I had just had with my girlfriend over something completely trivial. 

That finally got me angry, I took a scorched earth approach and used the opportunity to call him out on everything he was doing. I said he was toxic and if he needed to tell me something to just go and say it rather than throw little indirect comments and then hide behind plausible deniability. 

My friends are mostly on my side, telling me that he’s definitely in the wrong, but disagree with me calling him out, so paradoxically they agree with me, but instead of telling Robert to calm down and talk things through, I’m the one getting told to do so.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not as close to Robert as I am to others in my group and in reality I don’t really care about our friendship if he’s that much of a douchebag so consistently. 

I’ve just taken the approach 

He’s had similar problems with another member of our friend group, who admittedly tolerates Robert’s behavior far better than I can, but still ends up angry at him. Me and Robert are kind of in a cold war right now, we’re not really speaking to each other and any time I get on he just leaves. 

I know none of these are a big deal in terms of what’s going on, but this dude is disrespecting me seemingly every time we get on and a little playful ribbing is enough to have him in a fit of rage.",27Jul2020,1
586,"So I’ve been dating this guy for about two and a half years. We met because we were working together. Things are different now because we have two totally different jobs and do not work together anymore. 

We had a break (about a week) because we were arguing a lot and needed some space. Before we went on break, his Instagram was deactivated. When we got back together, he reactivated both of his Instagram accounts (one main account and one spam account). He took our relationship info out of his bio and deleted all of our pictures together. Then he refused to add me to his account. Finally he lets me on but still doesn’t post anything about us AT ALL. I found it weird because he was never like that before and I really felt like he was trying to hide me. I ended up getting trust issues and got mad when I found out he was like other girl’s bikini pics. I found it disrespectful to me. We argued about it and he agreed not to do it. Then o saw that he did it again (to one of his coworkers). That started an argument and I got very suspicious of the girl. 
Let’s just say we got into multiple arguments over this girl within a span of a like 5 months. 

Fast forward, he doesn’t have Instagram anymore but has Snapchat. He watches that girl’s snap chat stories (and sometimes only hers). I asked him to delete her and he said no. I feel so childish but I still can’t get over this. I don’t know what to do or what to think about the situation. I kind of feel like he is deciding that she is most important that my security I.

589,"Since July of last year I have gone through many changes. I started a graduate program, and I ended a four year long relationship. I was cheated on after two months by the next person I started seeing. The icing on the cake though, is that I steadily gained 40 lbs in six months. I had resigned myself to the stretch marks on my thighs and love handles, but I broke down into tears when I saw them appear on my stomach. I am unhappy with the turn my life has taken and the reflection of it on my body.

In June I started using myfitnesspal and told myself it was time to lose the weight again. I know everything I need to do. I've created weight training programs, I'm using myfitnesspal, and I have told several people that I'm trying to lose weight. Unfortunately, I am still struggling. I was 200lbs when I started in June, and I am 199lbs now...

I overeat. And I keep overeating. I don't know how to stop. Even when my brain is actively telling me I'll regret it, I still continue eating. 

My questions for the community are as follows: 1) what is the best forum or subreddit for getting help and advice for this issue; 2) what triggers have helped you stick to your goals, and is there anything that can be tried to stop me from eating more (other than padlocking my fridge); 3) I know progress is going to be slow, so how can I stay disciplined, rather than getting discouraged when I only lose 1-2 lbs?

591,"My 58 year old mother moved in with my husband and I in November after her partner died because she couldn’t afford to and was not physically capable of staying where she had been living. They lived on a shoestring and she was left with zero income, no assets and no job when he passed away. She’s in relatively good health but had been caring for her partner through a long illness for a couple of years and his was the only income in the home. She came with two ancient dogs, a senior beagle with a cancerous mass in her ovary because she was never spayed and a 100 lb., completely blind senior lab with bad hips and rotten teeth. We had to put the beagle down in April when it became apparent that her tumor was causing her pain but the lab had starting messing in the house about once a week and has had an extremely difficult time getting outside, we have a few stairs, and is constantly getting stuck in places where there isn’t carpet, like the kitchen. My husband is at the end of his rope. Our home is small (two bedroom one bath with a renovated basement master bedroom) and it already housed myself, my husband and our two teenaged daughters along with our 2 large dogs and 3 cats before my mother moved in. We’ve spent most of our savings helping my mom and her partner pay her bills for the last couple of years and even more to help her move and buy a car along with housing and feeding her since November. She started a new part time job two months ago and has applied for subsidized housing but her wages have hardly been enough to pay her existing bills and expenses and she will not be able to take her dog with her when she moves, which will likely still be months away.    My husband has been great through this whole ordeal but he won’t even spend time in the family room anymore, he says it smells and is always filthy and he’s tired of tripping over animals. He isn’t crazy about pets but tolerated ours because the kids and I love them and they are well taken care of. I feel like I have to tell my mom it’s time to put her remaining dog to rest, which we have spoken about before but not in urgent terms. It’s one more loss for my mom who has lost so much recently but her living with us and her human sized animal is too much and it’s causing a rift between myself and my husband. This living situation has also strained my relationship with my mother. As the go between, I feel like I’m constantly berating her and haven’t been able to enjoy having her around. It’s been exhausting but I feel like it’s coming to a choice between my mother and my husband. She’s done everything I’ve asked of her so far, albeit slower than my husband had expected, and is recovering well from her losses but I feel like a monster for asking her to give up her last companion and always riding her about what she has to do next with the goal of “getting our life back”, as my husband puts it.

592,"For the better half of two years now my brothers (M21) OCD has been really bad. Staying up all night arguing with my mum getting her to finish his rituals and repeat herself a lot, and yelling and screaming abuse at her if she messes up. It’s caused her to go into a deep depression and I (M17) rarely see her happy, she cries everyday. 

It’s rough not being able to intervene because when I or my sister (F23) do intervene my brother only gets more mad and takes it out on my mum, not us. It keeps me up at night waiting for the fight because I’m so terrified or what might happen, so terrified of my mum getting upset again and so terrified of my mum or brother killing them selves. 

My sister promised to let my brother go to her house for a day, she then said her boyfriend would be there and my mum got mad, we all know my brother wouldn’t be comfortable with that. 

My mum then sent a text out apparently listing everything that needs to be discussed as a family. I didn’t get this text, instead my sister asked me if I did and what I thought. She said “of course you didn’t get it fuck sake.” 

I know why she didn’t send me it, probably because the levels of stress and anxiety I’ve been failing have gone on to affect me physically and my mum is looking into getting me to see a therapist with and without her. 

I’m so terrified of this meeting. My brother will refuse to listen to any sort of criticism of him. He will get aggressive, my sister will take her anger out on him and my mum will desperately try to control the situation before giving up and crying and leaving the house for a bit or for good. That’s the most likely outcome and I don’t want to be there for it but I also don’t want to sit in my dads stressing about the outcomes of a meeting in my mums house. I just want the abuse to stop. I want my mum to be happy and I want my brothers OCD to jsut fucking go away. But it won’t and idk what to do.

604,"I (21F) think I've never experienced romantic love, but I'm not sure, cause I really don't know how I should know I'm in love. When I asked people other times they tell me things like ""you know you're in love if they make you happy"", ""you know you're in love if you think a lot about them"", ""you know you're in love if you get nervous when you see them"", ""you know you're in love if everything feels special with them"", ""you know you're in love if you enjoy being with them"", etc. 

But, I mean, all my friends make me happy, and I enjoy spending time with all my friends. All of them are important and special to me, but they are my friends. I love them as friends. 

There's this friend (23F) that's one of my closest ones that's really really special to me. I mean, all my friends are important and special to me, really, but... I don't know. We hold hands, we cuddle, and even when I had hold hands and cuddle with other people too, with her it feels more special. Her cuddles are the most confortable ones, holding her hand feels amazing... we also do some things that we wouldn't do with other people. I'm not sure I should put them here because they are personal and she doesn't know I'm writing this, but I think that's a big thing that makes all more special (I think maybe I should clarify it's nothing sexual. She's my friend, and even if she wasn't, I'm asexual sex-repulsed. We do things that are exclusive to us -because we want to- but nothing about them it's sexual).

I get nervous everytime I'm going to see her, but I'm not sure whether if it's because I'm going to see her or because she's very unpunctual (not on purpose) and I have to wait a lot and that makes me a bit anxious. I think it's because of the second thing. Anyway, I miss her everytime I'm not with her in person or talking, and I think about her a lot. I enjoy really much her company, I don't mind what's the activity if it's with her. I also really love to give her gifts by surprise. I know the things she would like, and I love her smile and excitement when I gift her something she didn't expect. 

She was the first person I ever talked about my mental issues to, even if I had other friends I've known many years before of her. I trust her so much. She understands everything and it's really supportive. 

We want to live together when we leave our houses. She's the only person I can see myself living with right now. Living with her feels like the best decision I could make, but I'm scared for my parents (but that's for another Reddit). 

Other thing that I do is that, when we meet, the next day try to write everything I remember about it because I don't want to forget anything about it. That's a thing I only do when I meet her. I plan to stop doing that when we live together because it would be imposible and it would be so weird to write all our days in our house, but right now, I do it. 

Well, the thing is, I'm pretty sure it's just a really beautiful and strong friendship, but I had sometimes asked myself if maybe I like her romantically. I actually feel very confortable with us being friends and I was good when she was dating people! I never felt jealous or bad in any way when she had talked about any of her partners (now exes) or about people she likes. I was also good when I met her (now exes) partners. So... that's other reason I'm not sure that I like her that way. I'm pretty happy being her friend and I've never (really, never) felt jealous or bad in any way that she was dating people. 

Even if I did, I think I wouldn't ask to date her, at least not soon, because I know she wants to be single (two people broke her heart), and also for anything in the world I would like to risk our friendship. She agrees, one day in a game talking about if she'd date any of her friends she said she'd never date me because she'd never want to risk our friendship. Even if I like her that wouldn't break me and not dating her wouldn't ruin the friendship for me. I'm really happy with her and with our relationship and the moments with her and everything. I'm very happy with the idea of living with her (and I hope we can). I don't need to date her. And I'm not sure I like her that way, I say all these things because our friendship is really special to me and she makes me very happy. 

So, there's my question: how do you know you're in love? What things make you aware you are? I was in the past with someone for 2 months and we broke later because I realized I really only liked her as a friend and I just said yes because she liked me and I didn't want to hurt her. I wouldn't want to make a mistake again like I did with that girl dating her and then realized I liked her as a friend. We stopped being friends after that because she didn't want to be just friends later. That and the fact that I've never felt bad about her exes and that I'm pretty good and happy being friends make me doubt, but I sometimes had thought maybe I like her romantically...

TL;DR! - I've never known how to know if I'm in love. I'm ace sex-repulsed and I find it difficult to know how to be aware of that. I know sex's not that important but not having that attraction I guess makes it more difficult to know. I have this friend that sometimes I thought I maybe like romantically but I'm not sure.",27Jul2020,1
605,"Okay I (F19) have never been on a date. 

A little back story, I grew up fat and not the prettiest, I've known this. Even to this day I know I am not as pretty as other girls. That being said, I have big boobs, a nice ass, my body shape has definitely evolved, and I have been told that I am very pretty. I know I am not as ugly as I think, I get hit on by many guys irl and online and I have been asked on countless dates, and many guys have tried to start a relationship with me. I never fell through with because of my really bad confidence issues. I do have a stomach, and thick thighs and sometimes you can see my double chin. I hate that about me, I always feel ugly. I have had guys want me for my body but that's for sex, and it sometimes makes me feel like I'm not relationship worthy. 

Regarding my weight, I have tried many things to get over it. I started being a plus size fashion icon, did plus-size modelling. I help other girls push through their insecurities. I can walk anywhere with all the confidence, knowing I am the ""baddest bitch there"" even though I don't feel like it. I just don't know what will work. 

I finally met a guy I realllllyyyy like online, he lives close by and we vibe well. He asked me out on a date and I want to go but I am so scared he'll find me ugly. Like I know I'm not, and I know it's personality that matters and ""fuck it"". But I genuinely am so scared that if I go and he finds me ugly and doesn't want to talk to me anymore, I'm gonna be SO UPSET. This mindset has stopped me from going on a date ever. I really want to get over this but I don't know how. I feel like physically sick thinking of ever meeting up with a guy on a date, and I just can never bring myself to do it. 

TLDR: I feel too ugly and fat to go on a date, I have tried many things to go past these confidence issues and nothing seems to work.",27Jul2020,1
606,"Hi guys,

It’s my girlfriends birthday next month and as one of her gifts I was planning on getting her a switch with a few games but had a few questions:

1 - should I? I’ve heard mixed reviews and haven’t actually played one myself.

2 - what games are good? She likes things like Mario, Zelda etc nothing online or competitive.

3 - what’s the deal with the remote? I think there’s 2 types or something?

4 - is it a multiplayer/split screen console? We’d want to be able to play together.

I’ll be getting her the full version not the portable one.

608,"Hi everyone, as the title suggests this has to do with my current living situation. My roommate and I are both in our early 20s and moved in together at the beginning of July. We’ve been close friends prior to this but have never lived together. One thing that became apparent very quickly is our differences in handling the pandemic. I’m very cautious, maybe too cautious at time but I don’t think you can be too careful in this situation. She, on the other hand, has invited multiple people over to our apartment, visited friends, gone on multiple dates, etc. I would be fine if she had a closed group of people she was seeing but with things only getting worse I don’t appreciate that she’s in close proximity to a different person almost every day of the week. To top it all off, she went to a birthday dinner for a friend over the weekend with him and his family. She mentioned offhand that his grandmother didn’t attend because she has COVID symptoms but that she lives with his family. I expressed concern but she brushed me off because his parents and brother had already been infected back in March but that didn’t really do anything to ease my discomfort. Then, she went to a bridal shower with an entirely different set of people yesterday. I want to clarify that we’ve already discussed this and I politely asked her to reel her social life in. She’s very outgoing but I am too and I don’t think she’s understanding the severity of the situation. Since first discussing it nothing has really changed so I don’t know what to do. We work together so I don’t want things to turn hostile but I need her to understand that while she may be comfortable attending all of these events and taking the risk, everything she’s doing also impacts me. I also don’t know if I’m being too over the top and hard on her over this situation, I lived alone previously so I never had to address how others were handling the pandemic. Any advice would be appreciated!!",27Jul2020,1

(that may also be because E is going through some hard stuff right now) I asked him what's happening, and he said that he suspects that NP is a pedophile. NP is eighteen, so the oldest in the chat. He makes sexual jokes with me (I'm a minor, like the rest of the chat), and E thinks he actually is serious when he makes those 'jokes'. I'm not so sure, NP seems like a nice guy, but at the same time he's technically an adult, and adults wouldn't make sexual jokes with minors, right? What should we do?",27Jul2020,1

618,"We were together for 4 years. I felt we grew apart in many ways (at the time). Looking back, he was trying his damn best and it ended up all paying off.

He never had any money, credit score was in the 500s, savings non-existent, unwilling/unable to travel. 

Little did I know, he managed to increase his credit score significantly, build a hefty savings, was willing and able to travel and was getting into stocks and bonds. Money isn’t everything I know, but it was always such a turn off that for the past 4 years, he didn’t care to better himself. It wasn’t until I left him that he got his shit together.

It’s worth mentioning that I left for those reasons, but also because I was SERIOUSLY struggling with my mental health. I was severely depressed and having crying spells. Anxious all the time for no actual reason. I thought it was because of him and the fact that I lived 3 hours away from my family, but now that it’s been 4 months, I’m realizing it was always me.

We got back together for a week 2 months ago because I thought I was better, not the case so I left again. It was then that I learned he was bettering himself AND talking to a girl. They’re now dating and their relationship become official a week after I left him again.

I’m pissed at myself to treating him like shit towards the end of our relationship. I was convinced he was holding me back and that I needed to move back to my hometown. Now that I’m here, I’m realizing I’m not missing out on much and really it was me that was unhappy with myself the entire time.

He was a fantastic partner. Selfless, loving, caring, romantic, great in bed, and so much more. I gave that up TWICE because my brain convinced me to. I fucked up and there is no way we’d ever get back together again. I was CRUSHED when I learned he started dating her and said super hurtful things.

621,"Just for context:

My mum passed away 7 years ago and my dad passed away February 2019. Our parents left us with our family home. Right now, we're at a bit of a crossroads in terms of life. We are living in the suburbs of a capital city in a good part of the city. Given cost of house prices where we live, we are in an advantageous position, at least in theory. I count ourselves so lucky given the unfortunate circumstances we find ourselves in. Myself and my sis get on well. However, given our age and life stages we are between a rock and a hard place.

To begin, the house needs a lot of work. My dad went on a bit of a DIY(destroy it yourself) craze throughout the years and the house needs a lot of work(but is livable and homely) This means we are currently trying to assess whether we sink money into the house which will be significant. This would have been an easier decision 5 years ago, but my sis is dating someone and is at the age where she's thinking about next stage. In fairness, she is further along the conventional life path than I am and I get her need to map out a future roadmap. In terms of my own situation, I am currently looking to finally get on pursuing my career. Things happened that have left me behind where I want to be.

Just wondering what we should do? It's not extremely fraught or anything but some sort of guidance would be great. My attitude is to treat the house as a bonus. Think of it as the family home. By nature, the feeling of security is not important to me, whereas for my sis, she needs that. I thinks he's worried all be a burden to her but I'm not a loser. She says she 'worries' for me, but I don't need people to worry for me, I need them to believe in me.",27Jul2020,1

I’ve dealt with extremely toxic relationships (parent/sig other) in the past and I fear I’m bringing those into our relationship. Small things like accidentally hitting a game board and spilling things seem to frustrate him a lot and me seeing him frustrated throws me over the edge. Generally as a response I cry or become extremely defensive regardless if his anger is valid or not. I tend to just expect violence or belittling even though he has very rarely done this(he’s never been violent). When we have drinks it seems to be worse. I don’t want to lose him but I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to stop drinking/ take breaks with it and sometimes it helps.

Besides their religion they have made a lot of big mistakes that has landed us in completely poverty and stacks of debt. Our family did us really dirty as wel. This has put a lot of stress on them and I became their human punching and yelling bag. I still have burn marks of those days. A lot of those events have let me with a lot rraumas and issues I still deal with to this day.

Ever since quarantine I have had the chance to really confront them. So far I have made some good progress, but they are very manipulative and very pathetically plus they have very narrow mindset. This makes confroting extremely frustrating to the point I sometimes get emotional. At that point it's basicly game over. They call me insane and unstable and talk how bad their lives and how much they did for me.All complete BS, but they don't see that. They only see what they want to see. Honestly abandoning me would have been way better.

I am ussually quite composed, but the talks about past events and recent events makes emotional. Especially when they dismiss it as crazy talk. I am so ready to just leave and never talk to them again. The only thing holding me back are my sibling whom I care for, but I am only human and either I am going insane or I am leaving.

627,"He is 24, with a mild generalized  anxiety disorder and mild OCD. His OCD usually centers around him  feeling 'unsafe'. Checking doors, checking expiration dates on food,  checking the window whenever there's a noise, checking his pockets to  make sure he has everything he needs. It's usually relatively mild and  he copes well.

The past week he  has spiraled into prolonged, intense anxiety. He wakes up in a state of  pure panic, but he says there's nothing in particular he's panicking  about - he just can't shake the feeling and it's debilitating. He feels  like he's in fight or flight mode as a baseline with no discernable  trigger. He has also been complaining of dissociative feelings, feeling  like time is stretching (a 10 minute car ride felt like 2 hours), and  intense, overwhelming deja vu.

He  has called out of work for 4 days now, and I'm worried he might lose his  job. He lays in bed with the lights off, wide eyed and complaining and  that he can't calm down.

He used to be on our mom's health insurance, but that lapsed and he never signed up to get moved onto his company's plan.

I am close with my bf and one other friend but that's it. I feel lonely most of the time when I'm not with one of them.

633,"My (29f) wife’s (39f) brother (33m) moved in to our house 3 weeks ago. He asked to stay with us because he and his wife are separating due to excessive drinking and fighting. They have 2 kids, 10f and 6m. No talk of rent or duration of stay was discussed between my wife her brother.

My wife asked me if he could stay in one of our guests rooms temporarily. I agreed, despite currently experience a pregnancy loss and trauma from a previous horrible roommate situation less than a year ago. So I wasn’t excited for my space to be invaded. And I work from home now, so I’d have to be very quiet during the day when he sleeps. He works nights.

The first week was fine. We rarely saw him, but when he was home, he would walk into my home office and want to have a full blown conversation about his separation and why he was justified in leaving. I didn’t mind this, however I need to work. This happened almost everyday for a week, about an hour or 2 each time. Then he revealed that he had met someone and was planning to sell his house. And wanted to continue partying as much as he could.

He has 2 days off a week, Sunday and Monday. So he has his kids. He didn’t ask us if it was ok they stayed at our house. I think he just assumed it was ok because they are our niece and nephew. They are welcome, but it would be nice to have been asked since it’s our home. The kids are good, however they don’t have basic respect for others’ things. They jump on couches, hang on the arms of chairs, drop glasses, slam doors, etc. I was very annoyed when they showed up and just threw their backpacks on the ground and rushed over to my elderly dog who is easily overwhelmed. My BIL corrects them, but when he drinks, he expects others to watch his kids. On his days off, he drinks excessively... like a 750 ml bottle of whiskey in 2 days. My wife and I don’t drink, so it makes me uncomfortable. The other night he left the freezer door open and some of our food went bad. He offered to pay but didn’t want to admit he was too drunk to close it. He also told us that he is going to get a little basketball hoop for over his bedroom door....ask if he plans to be here for a while. I’m not ok with this, but don’t know how to tell him. He has a short fuse and has blown up at his family for the smallest reasons. He uses his kids as leverage... he threaten to never bring them to their grandparents house again after his mom brought up his drinking. He is clearly an alcoholic.

Since there was no talk of rent, he hasn’t pitched in any money. He uses our utilities, of course, our paper products, toilet paper, etc. Doesn’t do anything around the house except for his own dishes. This highly annoys me because I think I’m a little overprotective of my things and I work really hard to have nice things and a nice home. He gave us $10 for eggs the first week he was here. That’s it. 

My wife doesn’t think this is a big deal despite my multiple conversations with her. I’m not in a great mental space since I’m currently experiencing a pregnancy loss after years of IVF, and frankly, I don’t want people in my home. I also feel bad because I know my wife is trying really hard to keep me happy and be there for her brother and niece and nephew during this time. So I’m sure my freak outs make things worse.

Not sure where to go from here. When the kids are here, I get so overwhelmed and just want to run away or get a hotel. Any advice would help.",27Jul2020,1

I am scared people will notice how stupid or bad of a person I am when I am alone with them. Does anyone know this feeling or felt the same way? Even just a little? I feel so lonely every time after another panic attack.
And does someone have any advice or Tricks on how to act when you are nervous around people. Are there some topics you can always talk about?",27Jul2020,1
637,"My  sister (31F) and I (28F) are polar opposites. She's very warm, loud,  extroverted, needs human connection 24/7 or starts getting depressed.  I'm quiet, thoughtful, creative, rational, introverted (can be  extroverted when I need to be), need my space, can't really make small  talk all the time. Anyway, we haven't lived together in 7+ years. A lot  has changed in our lives during those 7+ years. By some cruel joke by  this universe hehe, we have somehow ended up living together during this  pandemic.

Last year, I started a  new job at a remote company; my boyfriend and I planned to travel a ton  in 2020.  The plan was that I'd pay for ""our"" apartment, she'd live in  the apartment, and I'd come visit in between my travels.  Alas, due to  the pandemic, I've been stuck here since May. So it's just been the two  of us.

She's currently in a very  stressed out time in her life (TBH she is always stressed out about  something), but I know she's not in a good state of mind. She's stressed  about her work, about her immigration status and her future (I mean we  all are, right now) but since she's very sensitive to stress, I think  she is really affected. She has a job but isn't really making any money  right now. I'm financially supporting both of us right now.

Like  many siblings, we have caused each other a fair amount of distress in  each other lives. She constantly says I'm not there for her enough, and I  constantly push her away because I hate how needy she is. Over the  years, I have simply come to terms that I cannot give her the kind of  emotional support she needs. I just don't have it in me.

We  grew up in the same house, but our parents had a very complicated and  aggressive (mainly my dad) relationship. My dad was the best dad in many  ways but he was also physically, emotionally, and verbally abuse  towards my mom and sometimes us. He stopped as we got older, but the  last time I remember him being physically abusive to us was when I was  17. Anyway, my sister learnt at a young age how to be aggressive, mean,  and hurtful (like my dad), but also learnt to be loving, caring, and  warm (like my dad). Growing up, the only way I knew how to survive was  to ignore all my emotions, and I'm now a 28yo who has a wall around me  and can't really break it down towards my own sister. I think she is a  wonderful person but reminds me so much of my dad that I'm just not able  to bring down my wall.

Like my  dad, my sister is so supportive of me but at the same time she is always  trying to find some fault in me, and how I can do more for her. I  already support her the best I can (financially, cooking, I buy her  clothes and other things she needs). I just don't have it in me to  support her emotionally more. For example, she's hates to drive, and  yesterday she asked me, ""Isn't driving stressful?"", and I said, ""With  you, yeah"". She freaked out at the comment, and basically ended up  having a panic attack and blaming me for all of it. I know I could have  been more supportive, but it's human to just have a slip of tongue. Why  does it have to go so far that she has a panic attack?

She  often snaps at me, and when I tell her to cut it out, she calls me  ""crazy"", ""sensitive"", and the fact that she doesn't feel comfortable in  our own house to speak her mind. I told her there's a fine line between  speaking your mind and being rude to someone, but she just doesn't want  to understand my POV.

To be  honest, I just want pack up my stuff and go live with my boyfriend for a  while (he lives in a different state) but I'm scared to leave her alone  because I know she struggles by herself. She hates living by herself,  so leaving her alone during a pandemic will cause her to blame me for  the rest of our lives. She won't forget it easily. I obviously will  always financially support her, even if she doesn't need it (I have  monthly automatic wire payments to her account each month).

What  do I do reddit? I'm so out of energy to give her any emotional support.  It's coming at the expense of my own mental health. We are both so bad  for each other, and at the same time, she will really struggle alone.

Please guide me, I'm so lost.",27Jul2020,1

So i tried waking him to go see what was goin on. I always make jokes about how if we have a break in im as good as dead because he would sleep through it being such a heavy sleeper. So the door continues and im aggressively shaking him awake. He finally wakes up confused and just looks at me. So im like “go check the fucking door” and he makes me get up with him. Like our house is small, if someone is coming in and you want to “fight them off” then im going to hide and barricade myself in a room. He thinks i should run for safety but im ?????? I DONT KNOW WHATS OUT THERE. So not only do we not agree on the plan of action after the fact, by the time he got to the front door, the person knocking had left or wandered away.

Marriage is a partnership and love alone does not save you from divorce. Balance, communication, etc is what gets you through.

645,"Hi all,

The Background:

I’ve been suffering with pretty severe Agoraphobia, DPDR &amp; Panic Disorder for the past year or so, which I now take medication for. It’s better now, but a new environment which I feel pressure to be in is kind of my worst case scenario, and about the only thing nowadays that triggers a string of bad panic attacks. Once I’m familiar with the location, it’s usually better, but can still flare up from time to time.

I graduated from Uni this week, and have been offered a ‘ticks all the boxes’ job at a very small (2-4 person) company (my field is incredibly niche in my area). The interview was ropey (again - unfamiliar location that I can’t easily leave) however I just about managed to power through it without losing it. 

The start date for the job will be after they’ve moved to another, bigger location, which is fairly far away from me but still local enough to be a 30 minute or so commute. 

The Issue:

The boss of this company, whom interviewed me, has sent me a contract to sign for my position, with the start date being about a month away. I know for a fact the new unfamiliar location, and the fact it’s my first actual job that’s like gold dust round here, means I’ll struggle initially. I’m not sure if, when or how to approach this before or after signing the contract, or really what to do at all. 

Should I explain in writing before signing and see if it’s an issue? I’d be willing to make up the ‘lost’ time (if I needed to get some fresh air etc) out of hours or at weekends if needed, or sacrifice my pay, but I don’t want to say this up front and get taken advantage of.

I’m in the UK, if that’s relevant at all.

Any help would be absolutely brilliant. 

Thankyou",27Jul2020,1

650,"TLDR: Girlfriend really changed out of character the past 1-2 weeks, maybe cheated on me and then broke up with me. I am a mess and don’t know how to distract myself and move on. 

She broke up with me yesterday after telling me just last week that she is certain she wants to be with me. We’ve been together for a while but I just recently started really falling in love with her and thinking there is no reason to ever break up. Last Saturday she drunkenly snuggled up to some guy at a party but immediately told me the next day. We had a long discussion about breaking up or continuing and she told me she now is certain she wants to be with me and that she has never felt this bad in her life which alone would be reason enough to never do something like that again. As far as I know and everyone involved nothing happened besides some cuddles. I told her I want to continue but do it a bit slower. We had dinner on Thursday and I felt really comfortable around her so I thought I could go to her place as usual and sleepover. It did feel a bit bad sometimes and I had some stupid thoughts that day but overall I enjoyed my time with her more than I was mad at her. 
Part of staying together was her ‘plan’ to not go out too soon again and to not drink. Well on Friday she asked if she could go out with her friends and I told her that she said she wouldn’t go out and drink in the near future but that I cannot and don’t want to forbid her to do anything. She stayed home that night. The next night she again said that some friends invited her to go out but she and her other friend wouldn’t drink. I told her the same things again and she said she would go but wouldn’t drink. An hour later she asks me if she can have a beer because the boyfriend of her friend allowed it too. I told her the same things again. 
I told her to text me throughout the night. She did that until I went to bed. My last words were ‘text me when you get home safe’. She said she would. Around 4 am I wake up and no text from her so I call her but she doesn’t pick up. The next morning, still no text from her, I just send ‘...’ because she couldn’t hold her promise. She read that almost immediately but didn’t reply. A few hours later she broke up via text saying she cannot be the girlfriend she wants to be for me and her right now and that she can’t be in a relationship right now and will go on a trip with her friend to figure things out. 
A few hours later I get a call from her best friend that was with her last night and she told me everything that happened. Apparently after starting to drink she said ‘my boyfriend doesn’t care if I do so I’ll drink as much as I want’. At some point that night all the alcohol was empty and some people wanted to go to a gas station to get some more. It ended up only her and the dude from last weekend that went for the gas station while the others waited behind. Well the two of them disappeared for a few hours not picking up their phones. Which happened to also be around the time I called her. Than her friend gets hold of her on the phone asking where they are. They said they’re on their way back. They never returned. Than the friend asks for a live location share and at some point received it. She started walking their way but they weren’t moving. After some time the live location refreshed and suddenly she is at a new location far away. Turns out they got a taxi and went to his place. 
My (ex)gf claims nothing happened between the two that night. But who knows. She always was very loyal and emphasized that loyalty is number one and that she had been cheated on before. Especially in the last few weeks we talked about loyalty. Than she betrayed me last week and I really believed her and what she said and that we can move on from this and have a future. Now she’s saying she has been feeling for some time that we might not work out in the long run and that she had her doubts. I had a feeling that she seemed distant few weeks ago and approached her about it and she told me ‘ahh you’re so cute, everything is fine’. We will be moving to different cities in a month and she didn’t want a long distance relationship and we had some fights over it. The cities are only a 100 miles apart and I told her I will visit her at least once a week since travel is cheap between the cities. So I thought everything was good between us and she always talked about the future with us and planned trips together and everything. 

All this felt like it came out of nowhere and hit me really hard because we talked so much about everything. Last weekend was really out of character for her and I believed what she said about never doing anything like that again and that she wants to be with me. Then Saturday night happened and no one understands it. Not her mom, not her best friends and especially not me. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and all the things I used to do for fun or distraction don’t work. I’m crying a lot, which I haven’t done in years. I couldn’t go to work today. My life just fell apart and am now really afraid and feel lonely and empty. Everything reminds me of her. Would that have happened a few month ago I think I would have been fine. But the last few month I really started loving her and missing her when she’s not around. I don’t know what to do and how to get over her and move on.
My main question would be: How do I get over the immediate pain right now? I know it will fade in the future but I what do I do right now, before ‘time heals all wounds’ kicks in",27Jul2020,1
651,"Hi. Longer story short, my apt complex intercepts packages (does not tell you they have something of yours) despite my constant begging for them to stop. And constantly begging them to put them in the right place when they take them.

We have an Amazon Hub room with Amazon lockers and a large mail room.

They'll take my Amazon packages, despite a dedicated place for them. The delivery company employees usually take them to the lockers or the room. Not sure why the office ever takes them. I've told them (1- To stop intercepting them) they can leave the packages anywhere in the Amazon Hub room, anywhere in the mail room, or at my door - which is literally right in front of the Hub room and mail room. Also that I'm NOT concerned the packages will be stolen - otherwise, Dear Office, you're not doing me any favors.

The office has minimal hours and so I need access to my packages at any hour. But at this point, it's become more about the principal than anything else.

When they have my packages, I beg them to release them to the mail room or Hub room. But they ignore all requests/complaints. The office is very near these package rooms.

I need ideas on what cheap, large, and worthless (or annoying to have like 50 to 1000 of) items that I can ship in large packages to my apt complex to really annoy them, so they get the message to stop taking my packages and refusing to redirect them to the proper place that's accessible 24/7.",27Jul2020,1

Last year I worked two jobs. One was fulltime, I worked as a paraeducator and my other was as a part-time children's librarian. On top of that, I was going to a local community college (literally one class shy of being a full time student) and was also providing childcare for my mom.

This school year I was planning on going to college fulltime, but after doing the math it looks like I'm only going to be able to afford one semester. I can't apply for mid-year scholarships or grants because unfortunately I don't think they exist (that I could find at least) I'm a great student, but I failed my first year of college because I overestimated how much I could take on at once.

I was really suicidal last year, and between that was very heavily bullied at my fulltime job. I feel like I should add that I do have ADD, and was homeschooled (self led) from the very beginning of middle school to high school. I'm the oldest child in my family and my mom and I have been through a lot together, she still relies on me for emotional support + childcare. Because I've been home for so long she's having a hard time letting me go. I feel extremely trapped at home.

I live at home and pay pretty cheap rent. I don't have a license or a car yet because driving makes me extremely anxious. (I'm working on that tho!)

So far I think my options are either:
-go for the first semester, get my grades up and enjoy/experience independence and college life as a young adult. It would give me taste of what's to come and the next semester I'd go home and start working again to save up for the next year.
-keep working, going to community college, and get an apartment (would be difficult as I dont have my car or a license yet)
-keep working and get an apartment 
-stay at home, keep working
-stay at home, go to community college

I'm not sure I explained this the best way, so please feel free to ask questions!! I just don't know who to ask because my Mom really wants my to stay home but I need to get out out of the house.

Should I repair under worst case scenario (2500) or trade in and roll the loan into a new vehicle loan?

There's one he seems to have dated for like a year and then another that I'm not concerned about since they only dated for a month-ish and he's told me how he felt about her.

Would it be too nosey of me to ask about the relationship he had for like a year? Like, that's why I don't believe him about the whole I love you thing. There's no way you can date someone that long and not say it. He hasn't mentioned her at all, so the only way I could bring it up is basically by saying ""So I was looking through your Facebook...""

I know we've only been dating for a week, but I've been screwed over by boyfriends hiding things until years into the relationship before. I just want to know who I'm dealing with and if he really means what he says. He's admitted to lying to me once before, but that was for something minor so I didn't really care.

Should I ask? Should I ask if he's still friends with his exes? I feel like I've told him all he wants to know about my ex, but I know very little about his exes",27Jul2020,1

So yesterday on my way home from my 12 hour shift, my mum calls me and starts apologising, she said “your brother is having a psychotic episode which has been going on for a month, he thinks everyone is out to kill him, he thinks all cars have cameras that are filming him at all times and he’s gone to the police last week and told them that you (me) have illegal guns along with mums neighbour and my other brother”

671,"So! About four years ago, I was a pretty shitty person. I was drinking pretty heavily, unhappy with my life and very self destructive. I was living with this girl and some other housemates. She was witness to the crappy things I did, I cheated on a boyfriend, who was also her friend, who she of course told (rightfully so). I then cheated on another dude with a MARRIED MAN, which was disgusting. Though in my defence, said married man was incredibly manipulitive, closest thing to a sociopath I've ever seen. My mother had also suddenly died from alcoholism, which sent me in a tailspin. This chick was my friend, but grew to hate me. I cleaned up my act and started working on myself a lot, and I can honestly say I'm a totally different person now. But I think of her often, and of the things she witnessed that I did. I find myself wanting to explain myself and say sorry to her. I didn't do anything directly to her, I just know she still thinks I'm a piece of shit. I don't want to be friends, because I have always found her very harsh and judgemental towards others and very self righteous. I cannot seem to let this go. All advice appreciated.",27Jul2020,1

My dad doesn’t know about any of this because he’s living in another state for two months. I’ve talked to him a few times since he’s been gone, but I haven’t found a way to tell him anything about what’s happening now with my mom. And my mom says she doesn’t want to talk to my dad because that might give him hope that they could be together again. My dad keeps telling me that he still loves my mom and wants her back.

My mom has asked me to be apart of her wedding, but I recently told her that I can only feel comfortable doing that if my dad knows that she is getting remarried. But the issue now is that I found out my dad is having complications with heart problems and depending on his next appointment, might have to have surgery. He’s also been struggling with his mental health recently, and has been telling me that he’s afraid he’s not going to make it another day.

Telling my dad news like this will already be heartbreaking for him, but I don’t want to tell him something that could hurt him so bad that his heart literally gives out or he does something to hurt himself. I don’t know what I should do now.

We parked our car somewhere in the city center to get some lunch, and then we drove straight to the airport to catch our flight. As I returned the car to the rental company, I noticed that my bag was missing from the trunk.

There was no time to make a police report because the policemen at the airport told me this is not their responsibility, and the police station is far enough from the airport that if I went there I would've missed my flight. Also, sadly my travel insurance does not cover theft.

Is there anything I can do? Is there any chance at all to get it back?

692,"Hii, I'm sorry in advance, this is gonna be a little all over the place because it happened 2 days ago and my thoughts are just all over the place. (also English isn't my 1st language so sorry for any mistakes!)
So Saturday I went to a festival with my friends. Everything was good and we were having fun, but sometime I lost them in the crowd. I sat down beside a tree and a little later a guy came over and asked if everything was alright. I think he was maybe in his twenties, but I'm not sure. However I'm only 16 (turning 17 in 3 weeks) and after talking a little (idek about what, I was drunk so my memories are really patchy - don't judge please) he kissed me. And even though i kissed him back, I do remember him being really pushy about it and also he took my phone out of my hands and wasn't gonna give it back, but I was getting really uncomfortable and my friend texted me about where I was so I wanted to reply to her.
So point being I kissed him back, then quickly took my phone out of his hands, then when he started leaning back in i pushed him away and with the excuse of having to text back to my friend, thankfully he didn't try again. Then we met up with my friends and eventually lost him (he did came with us for a little i think even though no one invited him).
And I don't know, I guess I just need reassurance that I'm not crazy for feeling like he took advantage of me being that drunk, and that what he did wasn't okay, because I just can't help but blame myself because I did kiss him back.

693," I met this girl in a Facebook group 2 years ago and we started talking since then. She was only 14 and wanted a friend so I (17 then, F) continued talking to her. I didn't know she was 14 until some days later and she has already started calling me her sister which was a bit weird. I know I should've ended it at that because it's creepy for a 14 year old to talk to a 17 year old but I felt bad for her and wanted to cheer her up. Never knew it'd be such a chore.

The problem is that I feel like her therapist/mom. She has so many problems (was bullied a lot, has extremely low self-esteem, financial problems, is s\*i\*id\*l, overly-apologetic, very sensitive) and I do want to help her but every time I'm talking to her I feel so tired and I just want to get away.

She is nice and funny but every conversation ends with me trying to convince her she's good enough and I'm exhausted. If I say something that could even hint at me being slightly frustrated with her, she starts freaking out and will put herself down and apologize over and over again.

She has become overly-attached to me and is also being too respectful (if that's even a thing):

\- her mood for the day is based on how often I talk to her.

\- she made me promise multiple times that I will never leave her and we'll always be together

\- she becomes sad when I don't reply (most of the time she thinks I don't reply because I'm angry at her)

\- she never dares to disagree with me (if she does, she apologizes for it)

\- she always apologizes for being ""rude"", even if that ""rudeness"" is just not saying please one time (which ends up with her saying other bad things about herself)

\- she always says ""Can I ask you a question??"" and ""Please don't get angry or frustrated!!""

I always tried helping her, but texting can only do so much. She needs real help and even if she had money she wouldn't go to a therapist because she doesn't want her parents and friends to worry (this is also her reason for always keeping to herself)

If I were to tell her:

\- about this problem, she would (again) start blaming herself and putting herself down (""I'm so selfish, I always talk about my problems, I'm so stupid and greedy"")

\- to stop talking, she would become very unstable (""I'm so sorry, did I do something? I'm so stupid, no one likes me, this is why I'm bullied, I'm so dumb, I want to d\*e. Please don't leave me, please"")

How do I do it? I can't handle it anymore, I just feel like blocking her or deleting my Facebook account altogether but I don't want to make herself feel worse.

I already made some slow progress with her but I just can't do it anymore. I can't take care of other people's problems, I have problems too, I'm so stressed out.

TL;DR: How do I cut off ties with overly-attached online friend that has extremely low self-esteem and drains my energy every time I talk to her?

During this conversation I happened to mention that early this year I had went down into their other private office room to take back something they had taken from me. They went white as a sheet, paused, before saying ""what else did you find?""

I paused, before saying ""nothing"" but I told them obviously that was now a conversation all its own. I established it must have been locked in their desk, and that they brought it to work because they could not possibly let it be discovered at home.

The problem is I know that this thing they're hiding is probably illegal. Based on what I know about them, it is unlikely to be drugs, but we have had one or two conversations about a certain very taboo that I'm just hoping it isn't, because it sends chills down my spine.

700,"So about two months ago I started a new job. During the first few weeks I wasn't paying attention to anything else than what I was supposed to do, but then when I got more comfortable I started looking around at what other people were doing and stuff like that.

And so one day I noticed this cute guy working there but I didn't think much of it, since it's pretty common to think somebody looks good at work, without feeling anything more. From time to time I would notice him, but not that often. But I noticed that he was very shy and wouldn't make eye contact and just look at me very subtle and we would make eye contact by accident. I even found him a bit grumpy, he just never seemed to smile.

A few weeks ago, so like 3 weeks ago I was cleaning up and ready to go home when I turned around and I see him walking in front of my, and we walk past each other and make eye contact, for the first time on purpose, and I saw him smile a bit. But again, I didn't think much of it and two weeks go by with him and I making eye contact a little bit here and there but he still did not look very happy. It also felt like everytime we would walk past each other or make eye contact it got very awkward...

But then a week ago I felt that something had changed, the first thing I notice when I see him is that he is actually smiling.... And I even think to myself that that might be like the 2nd or 3rd time I see him smiling. So the week goes by and I see him looking at me a bit but very subtle again, but now every time I see him he always seems to be smiling when I am near him (no eye-contact). 

Sometimes when we eat in the cafeteria, we eat at the same time, but then he never seems to notice me which also makes me very confused.

So last weeks Friday I was there late and there were not many people there and I turn to see somebody coming around the corner, and it's him. We make eye-contact and he smiled a bit. 

And so today (Monday) the weirdest things happen between us. When I get to work I check in and then I turn around and put my head up and see him looking at me and so we make eye contact and we both put our heads down but one second later we make eye contact again, and smile to each other. NOTE: we have never spoken to each other.... 
A bit later he walks past where I work and I of course look at him and I can see that when he walks past he looks from the corner of his eye at me, this happens a few times. 

After the first thing that happened in the morning it's a really awkward thing between us, more awkward than usual. A few hours go and I see him again when I walk in to a room and we make like a short accidental eye contact and  I see the corners of his mouth go up a bit, but don't think much of it. Then later we are in the same room again and make eye-contact one more time and I see that when I look down to get some shoes he looks at me and then looks away. A bit later I have to get something and only way to get there is to go past him and so I go and come back with the thing when he sees me walking and moves things so that I can get by easier, even though I could get past. Then a few minutes later I have to get something else from the same place so walk past him, he sees me going. So I go and get the thing and when I turn to go back I see him going the same way as I did with something else with him, and when I see him I'm pretty positive that we won't make eye contact, since we've only made eye contact one close to each other. But right when we walk past each other we lock eyes.

At the end of the day I'm cleaning up and stuff, and I go an clean of my tools and I see him walk past me to the room beside, and so right after I wash I see him behind me standing there, not looking at me and it felt like he wanted to ask me something but then changed his mind and didn't know what to do. He then walks away for a few seconds and then when I'm walking out I see him walking back and looking if I was still there and then he looked to the stairs at the exit door where everybody usually walks out, and we make one last eye contact.

All of this is making me very confused. He behaves a bit awkward when we are close to each other and seems very shy. And since the thing that happened today first think in the morning everytime we were near each other felt so awkward like we both wanted to say something but were to shy, so we then instead just kept making eye contact.

What do you think this all is? Why does it feel really awkward between us even though we have never spoken to each other. What should I do?

TL:DR: a co-worker (M22) became awkward after our weird interaction this morning, and now we both behave awkward near each other and make more eye contact and he actually smiles sometimes.",27Jul2020,1

His tone was very calm and relaxed almost as if he had been asked it before (idk how to describe it). I pretended I didn’t hear him ask. I can’t remember the rest of their convo bc I was so drunk. But we kept talking until I had to leave. 

It was very odd how his friend barely whispered the question when I was standing right there...

Do you think that was his true answer or he was just trying to get his friend off his back? Should I be offended?",27Jul2020,1
704,"i already posted this on another subreddit about being better, but thought to get some advice here as well as im really lost rn

i have to give some background i guess.

i suffer from anxiety &amp; depression due to some really bad past traumas that had happened when i was a teen. nevertheless, ive graduated from uni this year with a decent grade &amp; things are looking up.

i was in a very toxic relationship with an ex boyfriend, (24) in which we both had really bad parts to play in the toxicity &amp; by the end of it, i decided to let it go because he thought so small of me &amp; treated me like i was an embarrassment to him. fast forward nearly 2 years later, we are stillllll stuck in this cycle. i cant let him go. he cant let me go. ill even go as far as to say that since our breakup, i have have been the protagonist. i know hes changed for the better &amp; he wants to show me. i just cant shake the fact that he treated me the way that hes treated me. its almost like an unhealthy obsession on both parts.

i abuse alcohol &amp; drugs, &amp; when i do, i go right back running to him even though i say that we should stay away from each other, because its for the best. i hope we can get back into our lives in the future, but we're just no good rn. i have a really hard time forgiving people. i wish i could forgive him cos i want him in my life more than i dont.

lastly, i have identified some narc tendencies of my own. i can lie. i can manipulate. i have done aome pretty narcissistic things to my ex bf &amp; my friends in general... and now that i have identified them, will i be this way forever? or can i change. i dont want to feel sorry for myself, because in the grand scheme of things i was suicidal when i started uni so im so suprised that i made it out.

i dont want to be this hateful, hurtful, toxic person but i have no idea how to change. 

thanks for reading💖",27Jul2020,1

707,"I have an ex who I was with 5 years a go. He still try’s contacting me but I’ve blocked him on pretty much everything. Only til Wednesday I receive an email (now blocked) I need advice on what to do! This man made my life a misery from the age of 14 (I’m now 22) he however was much older than me (23 when I met him at 14) we only spoke online and called but yes I was young so I didn’t realise the dangers. We exchanged explicit photos, little did I know what I was getting myself into. 

I turned age 16 of course he wanted now to meet me even more, I however didn’t meet him till I turned 17 (or near 17) biggest mistake ever!! I told no one about him and he lived close to London whilst I lived up north. He was open about being into younger girls and said that’s why he liked me, he said he used to be on drugs. I found out getting there he still was very much on drugs but I felt as tho I was brain washed and I chose to ignore this! He smoked crack, weed and snorted cocaine.. He must of been 26 at this point but looked much Older from the drugs, I went through hell whilst being in this mans home which he strangely lived with his parents who ignored the things he put me through. His parents knew he was a pedophile as I wasn’t the first or the last young girl he done this with, although I was of age when we met but speaking inappropriately to me on the phone and sending images to me it was clear he was sick and twisted. But no one stopped him! 

Whilst I visited him secretly for several months I can’t describe the abuse he put me though and the mental torture but I’m glad I got out of there when I did, I was nearly turning 18 at this point I believe if I was there much longer I wouldn’t be alive, as the last time  I seen him he had me at knife point. I never reported this man, I was scared, he threatened me and he had all these images of me from under age to 17. I thought I would not want to put my family through the stress, although they found out I was meeting this man however they never knew the details, only that he was my bf who lived far away. After leaving him, the messages didn’t stop he wouldn’t leave me alone, he tried getting me back. He even blackmailed me which was the reason why I stayed for so long, he sent my friends photos of me naked. It was so embarrassing but what’s worse is I deleted these messages.

 I removed all of the evidence because I was scared! Not realising how crucial it was that I had tons of messages and photo proof to get him done! I ruined my own chances at getting him back for the shit he put me and other girls through. I realised when at his home he had a computer with all the images of me and other girls on, even on his phone he had chats to younger girls it was sickening for me to find (these I never deleted). I suspected he cheated on me after finding other girls underwear on his floor, this made me leave as that’s when it escalated, he got mad I found it and that’s when he grabbed the knife. I knew I had to leave him! But now I don’t have anything as proof now, I can’t keep worrying about when he’s going to message me, he knows where I live i can’t help but worry. Now I feel like if I go to the police where can they get the evidence, will this be retraceable? Messages were exchanged online, on apps and texts. Can anyone who has been through the same or something similar please advice me how I can go about doing something. I reported anonymously on crime-stoppers years a go but they’re not police and of course nothing Happened from this. 

Any advice i would be grateful for! I spared a few details of what I went through but I really just wanted to give background so maybe someone will understand and advise what I can do?",27Jul2020,1

709,"Ok so this could be a very very long post but I want to keep it short to start. We are both 19 and moving out in mid August. She has always delt with mental illness and was diagnosed with major depression about 3 years ago, she is on antidepressants for that original diagnosis. However back in October she smoked weed and had a very bad exspierence, every since then she has not felt like herself and has all sort of different symptoms like, not being able to wake up, frequent panic attacks, feeling disconnected from the world and many others. Also since then we stopped smoking. I've looked into it and I belive she is showing not only signs of depression but also dissociative disorder. I recently talked her into calling her doctor and she made an appointment to talk about her medication because it is not working like before, however that appointment isant until late August. I also am currently talking to her mom and finding a therapist for her and I to talk to together. She dosen't want to talk to a therapist because its obviously a very difficult topic to talk about infront of a stranger. However I recently was able to talk her into possibly seeing someone together. I'm still working with her mom to find one that would be covered under insurance.

I want to get her help soon because she is not doing well, I guess what I am asking is for is advice as I go through getting her a therapist, what to say and what not to say and also for people to share there own story.

712,"My sister is a very self centred person. She is the youngest of four and is one of the reasons why my twin brother moved to my dads a year and a half ago. It has always been hard living with her but since the quarantine it has been even harder. Yesterday she got back from my dads (after nearly a month). For a month I have been so happy and I haven’t argued with my mum once. Last night I had a mental breakdown and had to leave the appartement because I was so distressed by her. She had gone on my side of the room (we share a very big room) and I asked her not to in future and she was denying she had. I asked her to shut the door when she came out of the room and she found excuses as to why she left it open. When I confront her about these issues she rolls her eyes and denies that she did that. This afternoon I made rules with her, my mum and my step dad and it did not go well. My mum said that I was to blame  for the constant arguing since last night, and I agree that I took part but it is not my fault because the house was peaceful when she wasn’t here. My sister refused to look me in the eye and was acting extremely rude when I tried to set some rules for our bedroom (rules that should be clear to a person who cares about others, ie letting the other person have the room when they have a friend round) She is now saying she is going to live round my dads (she CANT do that as he is just going to encourage this behaviour and manipulate her into hating my mum) because my mum told her to make her bed and tidy her room. Every time she is told off she screams and then cries to be forgiven. I genuinely do not know what to do anymore and have told my mum I can’t keep living with her if she acts this way (cannot live anywhere else though). I am also very sensitive to people shouting and the house not being quiet because of past trauma. I also need a safe space (my side of the room) and privacy. So this may seem ridiculous but it is hell for me as I am constantly triggered when she acts out. There are a lot of other things she does, but this post is already long enough.

713,For context this took place a couple days after 4th of July. My sisters boyfriend came over and made us aware of something that had happened. A couple hours later this led to him being arrested on our front porch. The cops here don't arrest people for absolutely no reason. I won't go into details about the circumstances but it was pretty bad is all I can say. I unfriended him on snapchat later that night since he had broken my trust for him and the next day my sister said I made feel bad for unfriending him and that I should just add him back. For the record I didn't. Just two days later he is arrested again and this time I am unaware of the circumstances. Never for a second did I wish that he would've stayed arrested. But my sister has just been nasty towards me ever since. Should I just cave and give him another chance?. Because right now it looks like he will be sticking around for the time being. I'm usually a forgiving person but due to past experiences this is very hard for me to decide. Any help will be appreciated.,27Jul2020,1
714,"Before beginning, I discuss things like depression and suicide in this. If that's not down your alleyway, please don't read the rest of this. Thank you.

I am at a point in life where I'm about as lost as last year's Easter egg. I've been dealing with severe depression over the last year, to the point that I stopped showing up to classes in college. I started eating less and less to the point where I couldn't even finish a personal pizza in a single day. My plan turned into killing myself by the second week of my second semester.

My feelings of self-worth were in the dumpster. I could barely take care of myself at the time and I ***don't know why.*** It was like I just shut down and there was nothing I could do but sit and wait until I faded away into the sands of time.

Now, the problem with making a plan about killing yourself is that you eventually have to act on it. And no matter how much I wanted to, the guilt of my mother, father, and siblings seeing my body in a casket stopped me from doing anything every single time I wanted to. My worst fear was that I would go through with my choice and that my mother, father, or one of my siblings would follow.

So, I was on my bed every day, staring at the ceiling of my dorm, not wanting to leave my room, not wanting to be alive, not wanting to disappoint my parents... Just wanting to be happy for once.

Covid-19 canceled the rest of the second semester.

Frankly, I don't know what would have happened if I had to stay through all the way to finals week. I might have killed myself as whenever I think back to that time, a fog seems to wrap around my brain and put me right back into the moment.

I returned home and faked doing my classes (all of which I had F's in and had no clue what was going on anyway). I told my parents that I'd made excellent grades - all A's and one B.

While they never saw my grades, I'd already prepared a fake page using HTML just in case they asked for it. I figured that I'd rather live with a lie than let them find out that their son was a hopeless, depressed, suicidal fuck.

The lie began eating me inside-out. It made everything worse. I had to keep track of my fake grades, act like I was working just to keep up the appearance that I was still working hard to be in school...

Since then, I confessed to what I did. It wasn't easy, but it was a start.

I'm no gifted student and I hate gauging intelligence off of tests, but I do need context for this next part.

I made a 1400 the first (and only) time I took the SAT. I didn't have prep except for one PSAT.

This doesn't make me feel smart. But, in the eyes of a parent, it makes them think that their kid is a little genius.

Returning to the present...

I told my parents that I'd lost motivation to be in my major. It wasn't a total lie, but it wasn't addressing the main point either. If I'd told them that I was wanting to die every day that I was at my college, would it have made a difference? Would they help me find mental help? And how would it affect the rest of my life? If I'm on antidepressants and they don't work, well, **what the fuck do I do now?** 

Because of my high SAT score, my parents are wanting me to go to a strict school that helps teach discipline. It's a program that lets you get into other, better schools like MIT, but it also requires that you put in your maximum effort (both physical and mental) and more every single day. I'll be disqualified from the program if I'm taking medication, and the main goal of the program is to get into MIT-like schools, which I don't want to do.

I know that this was a lot of context but I'm just so lost right now. I need to know what to do and I just can't figure it out.

**TL;DR - College dropout with severe depression needs advice on how to tell their parents that they wanted to die during college.**

I really need some advice on this. This morning my wife was denied a job in which the interview was perfect. Like literally.

Yet this morning they call and said that they would not have time to train her for the position and went ahead with another person. My wife is so much more impressive than me in every way. Im honestly just a loser. However, I look at this situation with pure anger. Like I have always been told I need to always check these boxes to get the job. I have not had a decent job in fucking 4 years ever since I graduated college. Yet when she checks every single box that she needs to she basically gets told to screw off and that its ""them not her"". That they are ""Too busy to train"". How is someone like me supposed to compete with that? She has more skill and more everything compared to me. I could not even begin to be as skilled and intelligent as her and she still is rejected. How am I supposed to find a job after something like that? Why even try anymore? Why even try anything anymore? I am just absolutely devastated for her (even though she’s taking it well) and myself and what I’ve always been told. I do not even know what reality is anymore.

725,"This might get a little long and if it does, I do apologize. But I really wanna get this out there in the hopes someone could help me figure all of this out.

Back in December, I graduated college with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies. Basically, I wanted to use the degree to go into journalism. But really, I don't really mind as long as the job is halfway interesting and it pays well! And I'm pretty much guaranteed of a decent paying job with this degree. 

Earlier this month, after the Fourth of July, I was laid off from my job I had been working at since I was 19 (I'm 26 now). For years, I had basically forged a plan in which my REAL dream was to pursue a music career or at least be in a successful club band of some sort. If that didn't work out, my college degree would allow me to have a ""real"" job and be able to pay my bills and it's something I'm good at. Basically something to fall back on if need be. But music has always been a top priority for me. So much so, I feel its embedded in my DNA. I have a robust collection of vinyl, cassettes, CDs, my room is plastered with all my fave musicians and artists. I'm always making an effort to listen to at least a couple of albums a day and try to write at least twice a week. Because I've always felt I belonged in music and I personally think I'm a decent songwriter and have really mastered my craft in the last decade I've been doing it. Here lately, I've even carved out melodies and made up songs on the fly just by playing some stuff on the piano. It's not bad for someone who has never had formal training on the instrument tbh.

At any rate, it's always been a dream of mine to try to make it in a big city. I live in North Carolina and there's a few good music scenes around here. Charlotte maybe or Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Asheville. But my eyes had always been set on the big leagues; New York City, Atlanta, or Los Angeles. Somewhere where talent is swarming all around you. It's dog eat dog, of course. But at least you're surrounded by artsy people who kinda have the same end goal as you. More importantly, that's where much of the big wigs of record companies, indie or commercial, reside. So it just gives me more interest in pursuing these cities to see if maybe I could be the next successful musician to hit the scene.

The music I'd love to play is piano-based or acoustic based. Think something folky but with classical and jazz influence. But enough pop influence to where it has an appeal to a wider audience. Perhaps something like Joni Mitchell or Kate Bush. Something along those lines. 

Anyways, the reason I've come here is because I really don't know where to start. My life is kinda at a stand-still. Which I recognize a lot of people's lives are as well because of COVID. All of this BS is really putting a damper on all of our lives and there's nothing we can do about it except wait it out and hope it gets gone as soon as possible. And it makes it harder on me, personally, to make a decision about moving away to a place I've never been before. Even worse, knowing that the club scene is pretty much nonexistent all over the world because of the pandemic. So there isn't any places where I can play gigs, open mic nights, etc. And that's the kinda thing I live for. I love the stage and being immersed in a room of 100 people or so watching you do your thing and cheer you on. So I pray everyday that all of this goes away, because I miss it so much!!! Not to mention, an ex of mine just left for New York City and seeing him beam at the sight of the skylines is making me wish I was in his shoes right now.

But Reddit, can you please give me some advice on how I should go about this situation? I have saved up plenty of money over the last couple of years and I really wanna try to start a new life but I don't know how to go about it in this new world we're living in right now.

So instead of drinking they got high and I got really drunk like it was bad. So we were bored and were like well we should do something like invite boys. My friend was going to invite her guy friend and he was gonna bring someone, no problem didn’t know him but I like to meet new people it’s fun. My other friend had no issue with it either. They couldn’t make it so I invited 2 guys and when I did at first they were like it’s fine can they take us to get food and blah blah blah. Then my friend starts saying stuff like I really don’t want to go like we don’t even know them making me feel bad and stuff. They guys lived pretty far so I felt bad just saying don’t come anymore and either way they were gonna take us to get food which is what My friends wanted. So we get in the car with the 2 guys and I’m being absolutely judged and hated by my 2 friends and i guess my friend said she was feeling forced but I was drunk... I guess they felt unsafe.... So pretty much they got mad at me for making them go on this ride with these 2 chill guys and we went home were supposed to have a sleepover but they left and that was the end. After I felt horrible and messaged them and said I’m sorry I take full responsibility for last night it shouldn’t have gone that far to where I was making you guys feel forced to go. Is this a real reason to end a friendship? I mean friends make mistakes all the time and we learn from them. Would you forgive your friend?

733,"I rent a house next door to people who have been brutally beating their dog and neglecting all their animals, including chickens. Today, I called 911 when I heard them beating their dog again. The cops sent people from Animal Control over an hour later, and they stayed for less than 5 minutes without doing anything. Because Animal Control came over and spoke with me, the neighbors now know it was me who called on them. They are frequently intoxicated, always armed, and generally angry people. I have tried contacting their landlord (who is also my landlord) but he hasn't done anything about it. 

I am worried that, if I take anymore action against my neighbors, my safety can't be guaranteed. That being said, I can't stand hearing their dog howling every few days when they kick and beat it.

734,"So I'm in a bit of a predicament here - 4/5 family members tend to side one way socially or policy-wise in America. However, my dad supports the other side, and I'm in quite the pickle.

One part of me loathes anyone who supports the man that has caused so much tension in the country the past 4 years - the other part of me is questioning whether or not I should pardon my dad or think differently because he is family.

The political differences have caused multiple fights between our family in 2020 and I fear it's only going to get worse over time, especially if November's results go a certain way.

Can I sell it if there is no serial code? I literally don’t remember where I found it, I happened to come across it in my room a couple years after I picked it up off the ground. I thought nothing of it because I didn’t think there was a chance it could be real. But now that I found it again and have the time, I might as well get it checked out. 

Is it illegal to sell if it’s real ? Tracking down the owner if there is no serial code would literally be impossible because I can’t remember where I found it.

I am going to be completely honest, my boyfriend became verbally and emotionally abusive towards me to an excessive point and I even had to call the police on him twice due to threatening behavior. After this incident I continue to try to make the relationship work, having always been too forgiving of a person. Then I cheated on him with my coworker but when it happened it was accidental and I admitted the truth to my boyfriend immediately after the incident and explain that it was truly because of my sense of unhappiness and having felt trapped in the relationship. He forgave me for the incident pretty easily which I found a little strange, mostly because I have completely different outlooks on cheating as hypocritical as that sounds in this case. Well long story short, I was scrolling through his phone when I found nude photos his ex roommates wife and mother of their three children time stamp from 2017. After further investigation into his messages, I found some messages that even had mentioned women's breasts and mildly flirty comments. They lived together in the same home for many years, I gave this women's children Christmas presents and was very kind to them. I confronted the bf, my own bf, and the woman in the situation.

However, in the past, I did notice some things with S. She would gossip a lot about other people and tell me everyone else's secrets, and she sometimes spoke behind our other friends' backs. I brushed it off though since it didn't happen often and we were young.   
But now, S is starting to show more red flags and has changed. I had another friend, whom I am very close with and have been with for about 5 years, (we'll call her L). and she told me some off-putting things about S. She told me that S said she is going to be popular and have a good reputation since she hangs out with K, (a popular girl who is also one of mine and S' friends), and that I and L will be in the 'average' group. K was the one who promised her popularity and a great reputation. She also was saying some stuff about me too.

744,"I am approaching my final year in college for a bachelors degree in computer science. Recently I discovered due to COVID all of the classes I have are going to be done online. 

When I told my dad this he basically assumed I wouldn’t be going and I didn’t really say much about it. I was supposed to move into and off campus house August 20th where I would need to pay first months rent. In order to stay home I’d have to break my lease which would require me to pay the first month anyway and screw over my roomates I went in with.

I don’t know how to express to my dad that even though classes will be online I very much think being able to hang out with a friend is very beneficial to me. I have a lot of social anxiety especially when I am not at school because I don’t have any friends at home and don’t encounter a lot of social situations. 

Anyway to layout my options they are 

Dad route: break lease; get job at home; save money (about 8k for the year just for the rent (I have scholarships for tuition)); take classes at home.

I guess my route: stay at house and get job at school to help pay. 

Long story short I am conflicted on what to do here. I want to go to school, see old friends, and make new ones. However, I don’t like taking money from my dad I know how hard he works for his money and with the pandemic as it is money is a touchy subject everywhere. Half of my friends graduated already which is another thing. Most importantly it won’t be as fun because I can’t go to bars or party’s just friend hangouts which for me is better anyway but yeah. On top of that I take autoimmune disablers for my Crohn’s disease.

745,"In a recent conversation with a friend, I said something I thought I'd never say to anyone, but after it came out I started to think about it nonstop.

I said:

&gt;I'm in love with the battle. Against my past, against my mind, against my body weaknesses, against my limits, against everything else. Endurance became a primary goal and the more I expose myself to harm the less it hurts, the stronger I feel. The more capable I see myself.

I spend a lot of time in silence having long conversations with ""former versions"" of myself and it feels like I've been living for a thousand years. And the fact is in all those former versions pain was always present in some way. Huge amounts of physical and mental pain (school fights every week when I was younger, getting beaten up by an ex-boyfriend, panic attacks, anxiety, fear). I remember spending countless nights fighting to breathe, to keep my mouth shut when all I wanted was to scream and raise some hell to feel alive. A few nights ago I felt the same way, but I just flew through every painful memory I stored in my head, all my destroyed concepts of trust, love, and all those good things everyone searches for. And for those hours I just felt it. I let it hit me with all strength and watched what happened to my mind and body, almost like if a separate self of me was sitting at the corner, analysing every detail. I took it as ugly as it was and the next morning I was still there. Breathing and thinking, ready for another round.

Before the pandemic, I simply loved to spend hours and hours at the gym until I feel the sore I wanted. The more I sore the closest I felt from what I wanted to become. Tough, strong... I loved to spend hours sparring at the boxing classes even when I couldn't breathe anymore or keep my fists high. Every time they hit me was a reminder: You need to change your game, you need to survive, you have to be smarter than that if you wanna win. Mind and body working, aching...  But alive. I didn't feel good, I felt progress. Improvement, bit by bit. Punch by punch. Dodge by dodge.

I already know how it hurts, how much damage it causes, and how long it takes to ""heal"" (physical and mentally speaking). I'm not that scared anymore.

Now, I'm asking myself if I became a ""pain lover"" or a very resistant person. I just don't know.

For every solution, there's a new problem. This is my new ""problem"" and I'd like an outsider analysis.",27Jul2020,1

750,"My sister met her boyfriend in college, we're not sure how, and has cut almost all contact and moved in with him (in the same state as our family). 

My sister was depressed in college and apparently this guy has been there for her, but they share some really unhealthy relationship habits. Instead of looking for a job after college, they both did food delivery 12-15 hours a day and moved out together. They bought a car, but put it under my sister's name, they are together 24/7 seemingly and when my sister would still see us, he would always come. Even at our grandmother's funeral, he dropped her off, waited an hour (at an all day affair), and picked her up again. It's like he never wants her to be alone or she never wants to leave him, ever.

She's since stopped talking on the phone to anyone, including my mom who had a great relationship with her prior to all this. When they lived in their apartment my mom came to visit one day and my sister started freaking out saying things like, ""You can't just visit whenever you want! You need to call ahead and let me know when you're coming!"" Things like that, until my mom started crying and said she just wanted to see her daughter. Eventually my mom got to see her, but the boyfriend was there the whole time as well. My mom said my sister has lost so much weight and the boyfriend would reply, ""I know, I keep telling her to eat more"" and my sister would say things like ""yeah, I'm just never hungry."" My mom would suggest, ""we should do some mother daughter bonding,"" and the boyfriend would reply, ""yeah, I always tell her she should do things with you."" Over text my mom asks about her, but my sister always assures her that she's happy.

 She'll reply to my texts about non family things, things like work or finances, but never about her plans for the future or anything personal. If you ever ask if she wants to visit, she just doesn't reply. Our brother is in the military and visits twice a year and she still doesn't reply when we ask if she wants to see him before he goes. 

Since a little before COVID-19, my sister and her boyfriend moved back into his parents' house. Prior to this he supposedly had an estranged relationship with his family and couldn't be around them. They also moved out together to ""be independent"" but now they're not working and are living under his parent's roof. 

At some point early one, my younger sister unfollowed everyone (including family and friends) on Instagram and only followed her boyfriend. The boyfriend did the same. Our cousins would talk to her everyday over text and talk and she suddenly cut them off too.

I think she's been emotionally manipulated and has become dependent on him, similar to how cults attract and keep new members. My other sister things our younger sister has gotten into drugs and that's why she's lost so much weight and (according to my other sister) her hair has become so damaged. 

We don't know what to do. We don't know how to make sure she's okay. It's like we just have to accept that our sister is dead. We're all worried and don't think she's in a healthy safe space, but it seems to me that her mind is fucked to a certain extent that she isn't thinking clearly.

College
•Pros:
- no uniform or rules on dyed hair (good since I have no personality so I use style to give myself individuality)
- better education and resources
- new crowd, fresh start
- will help me get used to travelling
- better opportunities overall

•Cons:
- the only college I’m interested in is far away
- can’t find any info on buses, what a pisstake
- plus I’m poor so if transport isn’t free I’m gonna struggle
- will have to get up at like 6am everyday (not the easiest for me)
- basically just hard to get to
- I’m a shy kid, what if I can’t make new friends?

—————

Sixth Form
•Pros:
- very close, within walking distance
- familiarity
- more of a sense of community
- most of my friends are going
- only have to get up at like 8am earliest (still hard, but better than 6am)
- get to boss around younger years :)
- the easy option

•Cons:
- no fresh start
- uniform rules are strict
- ngl the people there suck
- boring environment
- generally kind of a shitty school imo
- just kinda... “same old, same old” y’know?

If it helps, the subjects I’m interested in are Art, History, and English Lang+Lit.

College = better, but more of a struggle
Sixth Form = shittier, but more comfortable

755,"Hello!! This post is rather long, I apologize. I only wish for things to be given a clearer picture. The title is the TLDR. 


There's this girl that I like that I've been ""chatting"" with for the past few days, we've had long chat session that lasts for 6-8 hours. We've been talking about our interests, hobbies, families, philosophies, families, weird sides of ourselves, sent childhood pics and such. So we're kinda that deep? Also, I have feelings for her. 

So there's this lingering feeling that makes me think that she might like me, since we've been talking for this long, and we've talked about a lot of stuff. 

But at the same time, she's a valedictorian in our school and one you'd consider pretty that boys in our school would fall for, and she's good at interacting with people. So she's top tier shit, so that makes it less likely that she actually likes me. (I'm also a high honor but other than that, I'm your average gamer weeb). 

So the thought of all these makes me uneasy, anxious, or basically can't settle my mind of it. To the point that it's disrupting with the things I do (which are just videogames, anime, and yt vids). And I see myself enjoying it less because I can't take my mind of the thought. Then I just decided uninstalling messenger and distancing myself for a bit, but I'd still chat with her though, but not as much (I haven't told her this yet, so I'm basically borderline ghosting). 

I do not know what else I'm going to do, other than distancing myself and pulling my shit together first then going back to her again.

TL;DR - “best friend” treating me like garbage and barely conversing with me, did not invite me to birthday trip as well.

okay, so my “best friend” just turned 18 a few days ago. i’m a year older than her. we were in the same grade (she has a laaaate birthday) and we have been friends since kindergarten. well, the friends she regularly hangs out with don’t like me, they have never met me, but they all hate me and she won’t tell me why. on new years, i was invited over to her house for a party and her small friend group was there, about 5-6 people. i sat talking to her little brothers the whole time because they went into the basement to play video games and just left me sitting there. then she came back up and told me “oh you can just go to bed in my room if you want” and then left. so i went to bed at 10pm and didn’t even stay up till new years. fast forward to now, i text her and will try to tell her something important or just have a conversation and it’s very dry one worded answers like “okok” or “ty”. well, on her birthday, i sent her a paragraph thanking her for being a good friend etc etc and added “ily! have a great day! i have your gift whenever you want it” and all she said was “ty lol.” so i didn’t say anything to that. i texted her a few hours later asking when i could drop it off or something, and she didn’t reply. well a few more hours go by and she’s in lava hot springs with her boyfriend and their friend group. i slid up on the story and said “oh cute! how long will you be gone?” she said “i dunno monday” and that was it. so i have an internet friend and i decided to give him the blanket i got her instead of her because she wouldn’t answer me about giving her a gift and didn’t invite me on her birthday trip, i’ve been friends with him for about 6 months and he’s way nicer and cares more than her EVEN THROUGH THE INTERNET!!!! am i in the wrong for that and should i stay friends with her, or do i drop her?",27Jul2020,1

In October I am planning on working for a whole month in a big Orphanage Compound in central Africa. and I am SURE I will be at more risk of catching it there than at this party.  
I am inclined to go to the party to catch it and be recouped by October when I have to travel. does this sound logical?  
It would be quite catastrophic to have the virus on the date of the trip or while there. I would affect other people's work and health so... I definitely don't want to catch it while there or have it when traveling.

I went in for a ""try-out"" shift (of which I was supposed to have 3) and they hired me halfway through my first one. The manager is very excited about having me on the team. This will be easy work and great money, but exhausting and long hours.

This morning I had an interview for a secretarial position in a large medical company that pays less, however during the interview they discussed a strong possibility of advancement. This job also offers insurance benefits and PTO, both of which I have NEVER had at a job (it would be SO nice to have health insurance). I have never done this kind of work, but I feel confident that I could learn quickly. The interview went extremely well and I left feeling very confident. Their decision will be made by the end of this week OR early next week (there are 2 of the same position available).

Ideally, if hired, I'd like to work the new position and have weekend availability at the restaurant, but weekend shifts in that industry are very much in demand so I can envision that not being a possibility. I don't know whether to stay at the big money serving job or accept the other opportunity if that is offered, which may end up being better long-term. Also, I will feel terribly guilty and like I wasted the restaurant's time if that is the decision I make.

What would you do in my position? Any thoughts are appreciated! Thanks for reading!",27Jul2020,0
763,"I'm 15 and right now I have like one friend which I barely talk to cos whenever I try tho they don try and give one-word answers so idk what you'd call that

but I had 2 more. one got a gf and is acting so different and Idk why, and the other just ignores my texts randomly

I really do try and idk y I can't make friends or when I do keep them around. I always ask them how they are and if they say they're sad I always ask them what's wrong or how can I help, I always try to talk to them a few times a week (even if that means I always text first) I also try to keep convos going even if they aren't trying. 

people never text me first either so maybe I'm annoying??

I've been looking for ages on Reddit and discord to find ppl with similar interests but they either don't respond, stop responding mid-conversation or they talk to me for a few weeks and start ghosting

so I think it's me that's the problem and id like to improve because I feel so lonely and bored 

so any pointers would be appreciated

also ill include this cos idk if it's important but I usually tend to get on with ppl older than me (17 - 21) but I never make friends with them cos  I think they'd be uncomfortable being my friend considering they're way older and would probs like friends their age",27Jul2020,1
764,"My wife and I, while not poor, are not wealthy people. Her family does ok for themselves, but again, not wealthy. However, her father's sister is a multi-millionaire, and her father is the only member of their family that she likes, so she made him the executor of her estate and he is setup to inherit most of her wealth when she dies. My wife is also setup to inherit about 20K. Last year, her aunt fronted us 15K to help with a down payment for a house. She also paid off our recently financed car to help boost our credit (paying it off boosted our credit a whopping 6 points). I was hesitant about accepting this money, but too late for that now. 

My wife and I spoke to 2 lenders and they both told us we should wait a year to purchase, as we both have fairly young credit history. We told her aunt our plan to wait, and she immediately demanded all of the money back. We told her we didn't have it all, because we spent some to pay down our credit cards (also at her aunt's suggestion), and we would have to get our car refinanced to pay her back for that, and there's now way we would be able to pay her back in full all at once. She threatened legal action, which I welcomed, because there was no written agreement whatsoever. There was also no agreed upon date by which we were required to purchase a house or we'd have to return the money, there were no witnesses to any of these transactions. It would be our word against hers. I was very irritated by the whole situation because my wife and I moved out of a nice rental and in with her parents to save money because we believed we would be buying a house in a years time, and now we are stuck here and have had a lot of trouble finding another rental. Well, my wife and her dad didn't think it was a good idea to go to court, so against my wishes, we gave her back the money we had, and my father in law paid her the rest out of his pocket (about 18k), so that we could be done with her aunt and just owe money to him, which we could pay back at out leisure. We took out a loan against our car and gave him that money, so now we owe him about 13K.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last month, my wife's aunt died, and sure enough, my father in law inherited her properties and a cash sum of about 1.5mil. My wife is also still set to get her inheritance, but her dad told her he still expects us to pay him the rest of the money he paid her aunt. And this is where I am getting frustrated. If he paid her aunt, and her aunt died and gave him all her money, hasn't he recollected the money he paid to her? It feels like he is collecting that money twice, and at a detriment to us. I told my wife how I felt and she brushed it off because she said it's the right thing to do, but I don't feel like we should be obligated to that now. I'm also taking it a little personally because we have a 7mos old, and that money was supposed to be a good nest egg for him. Also, before the aunt died, her father made it seem like we could pay him back whenever we had the chance, no rush. Now, he is planning on recouping it all at once, again, at a detriment to us. This has been bothering for weeks. Her father is a very kind, generous loving man, and I'd like to believe that maybe he just hasn't connected the dots, but I don't want to bring it up and look like I'm money-grabbing.

So am I being greedy? Should I just let it go? Is there a way to bring it up and try to get some understanding without sounding like an asshole? I'm at a loss.",27Jul2020,1

He kept looking at me a LOT and I started to get uncomfortable.

She posted it anyway. 

Am I wrong to believe that I am now less attracted/interested in her? A picture is definitely not a deal breaker but the fact that she did something eventhough she knew it made me uncomfortable seems to worry me.

770,"So my younger brother (11M) often says things that I'm sure he doesn't realise are hurtful, but to me (14F) they are. I'm sure I've said things that I don't realise are hurtful to him too. 

He often focuses on my looks, style and intelligence (he calls me ""it"" sometimes, often implies that I'm so ugly I'm a monster, etc. I don't even remember his exact words half the time, all I remember is that they hurt). I'm certain he just considers it banter and teasing, but I don't. He's been asked to stop by both me and my parents and he hasn't - I think the only reason he's been given for not doing it is ""she doesn't like it"", so it probably made him want to do it more to try and annoy me. He's the youngest of 4, so he may feel like he has to prove himself as ""the funny brother"" - I'm the only girl, so I often feel like I have to prove myself as intelligent or sporty and he may feel the same way. I'm the third youngest and my other two brothers are both adults and have moved out, so I'm the only one who he can joke with and about on a regular basis.

I often lash out pretty viciously without realizing(""just stop causing problems"", ""be quiet for once in your life"").  I don't intend to cause hurt - he's never acted like it has hurt him (though I'm sure I have), and I haven't been asked to stop yet (although my dad has said I can be really mean to him sometimes, which is what made me take a step back and think about what's good and what's not). I feel like I overstep my boundaries when I'm angry at him and say things before thinking about the consequences.

I want to lay down the lines clearly since I want to have a good relationship with him and be able to mess around, but I'm unsure of how to do it. I'm not the most confident person and I struggle talking about more personal or sensitive topics.

771,"Yesterday while I was swimming at the beach, just minding my own business, two girls swam to me and said that their friend thinks that""I'm cute"". I didn't know what to say because I never get that so I just said something along the lines of ""well, thanks, I don't get this a lot. where is she?"" They said that she is farther away with her dad because she was shy, and pointed to where she is. 
They ask me if I like blondes and I say 'yeah' 
(I was still shocked lol)
One of her friends says she is thick. I get asked what I care about in a girl(something like that) I say that I care about both personality and body.

I say 'ok cool, where do you guys live?'
they say the county they're from and that they are 30 minutes away from the beach 
and I say I'm an hour away from the beach and we go here on weekends.

 I might've fucked up here because I said that it would be a bit long distance relationship. 

I don't know what I was saying honestly.

One of the girls asked if I'm russian because she heard my accent and I tell them that my parents are Russian. She excitedly tells me she's Russian too and here friend is Polish. 
I tell them I'm from the Czech Republic.

I started to get cold cause I've been swimming for a while (bc the water was cold even though it was very hot outside) and asked for the girl's contact. 
Her friends told me her Snapchat. 

This is where I'm getting sad and think I've been pranked.

I get out of the water and add her snap and go lay in the sand to warm up.
 30 min later I go back to where I, my parents and my sister are at and I notice that the girls, including the one that said I'm cute are all at their spot and on their phones.

So later i go check my phone again and see that she still hadn't accepted my request. I am about to go home so I walk up to the them and ask the two of them whether their friend has seen my request. (idk why the one that liked me wasn't there anymore) 

They literally tried to ignore me... really?
All they did was mumble and say something like 'yea' or 'no'. 

Do you know what I think is weird? The fact that they were on Snapchat when I asked them the question. 
I think one of them declined the request on their friends phone while she wasn't looking and she added me on Snapchat. 
While i was still at the beach, I messaged the other girl who added me and texted 'hey, is this you?' 
And she texted 'yea' .

She didn't text anything after that and the whole day after that nothing. Right now it's 2 PM and still nothing. We're they just bored and wanted to joke around or was their friend actually for real?

777,"I am best friends with her for 3 years now. and I haven't seen her in 2 weeks because of vacation and it has been rough last week. She was mad at me because I said she was going to do some sexcual things with boys while she was on vacation. she didn't like this and was angry at me for 3 days, because she thinks I called her a slut. 

After that everything was fine until the next thing happened: So, my best friend and I were talking on snapchat and she was going to the pool. And so, she sends a snap in her bikini and I see she has a camel toe. I thought she won’t understand what I mean if I tell her so I make a screenshot of it (my phone can make screenshot on snapchat without people getting a notification). So, I did not want to confront her about it on snapchat and so I said that she has a problem. When she comes back from the pool, she calls me and ask what the problem was. I say she has a camel toe and probably can't wear this bikini anymore as expected she does not understand. I sent her the screenshot with a circle drawn around it. In the meantime, she gets home and has to hang up the phone call. So a few minutes later she replied to my screenshot. And she is extremely angry at me for making a screenshot of it. She wanted me to delete it, so I immediately did. She says I am dumb for making the screenshot and that she doesn't want to talk anymore. I try to explain why I did it, but she gets even more mad. she tells me that she will never send a picture to me ever again and after that she only reads my massages but doesn't respond. She doesn't want to listen when i tell her i did it because I cared about her. I had even already searched on the internet for ways to prevent a camel toe, but won't need that knowledge anymore. 

I am sad because of this because she is the most important person in my life (after my mom). So, when I had dinner with my family, I wasn't in the mood to eat and my mom noticed. She asks what is going on, so I just tell her I am tired and don't want to eat. and now my mom thinks I have a fever because I always eat very much. this isn't really important to the story, but I thought I would share to show how important she is too me.

778,"So, to make any of this make sense, I’m gonna give a little back story. 

TRIGGER WARNING: THIS POST TALKS ABOUT SEXUAL ASSULT!!!

Okay, years ago when I was 12 years old (I’m 25 now) we had a family get together at our house. A good bit of my family was there and one of my cousins was visiting from out of state. I was always very close with her growing up and always saw her as a big sister. She later shown to be kind of a toxic person as the years went by(this is kind of important info). Well, because there would be a lot of drinking going on, we often had many family members staying the night. Unfortunately, this led to one of my other cousins staying too (it’s unfortunate due to him not really being a good person, and everyone in our family knows it). He was super drunk and came over to where I was sleeping (in the living room on the couch) and woke me up. He started talking about how fucked up life was and whatever else ( I couldn’t understand most of what he was saying due to him slurring his words). I was feeling a little uncomfortable, but didn’t know what to say or do, I was scared I would somehow provoke him. He then placed his hand on my thigh and started moving it towards my inner thigh and towards my crotch. He was squeezing me and moaning and started reaching into my pants. I was terrified and didn’t know what was happening, I wanted to go get my parents, but then I was scared of that making him angry due to their bedroom door being right where he could see me. So, I jumped up and told him I had to go to my room real quick. Luckily, he didn’t follow or make a big deal about it. I ran to our spare room at the other end of the house where my cousin that was visiting was sleeping. I woke her up and told her what was going on and she told me I could stay in there with her until morning. She locked the door and was asking me if I was okay and everything. The next morning my cousin and I told my parents and all hell broke loose! My other cousins were going to beat his ass, but my mom and aunts begged them not to, and my brother didn’t seem to believe me. It all went by so fast, and it seemed like no one was really taking me seriously. It all blew over quick too, but I continued thinking about that night all the time, I still remember it and it still bothers me. So, fast forward to a few weeks ago. One of my aunts that was there when it happened came to visit us and have a pool day with my mom and I. Somehow we got on the subject of that day and that night when that happened. I stated that I remember it all vividly and I remember no body seeming to do a damn thing about it. My mother then proceeds to tell me that because the cousin I went to about it came to her about it too, she thinks my cousin coached me to say all that happened just to stir up trouble. Hearing that made me sick and instantly mad and hurt. I told her it definitely wasn’t her coaching me and that he really did touch me inappropriately. Then, my aunt butts in saying “oh well it was years ago, so no need to worry about it now”. Now I am stuck thinking so betrayed and hurt that my own family was choosing to protect my shitty child molesting cousin over me... I’ve been wanting to talk to my mom about it again, but I feel like it will just start an argument and it would make my relationship with her strained. What should I do? And am I in the wrong to be upset like this about it still?

TLDR: I got molested when I was 12 by a family member and my mom and aunt didn’t believe it really happened due to how it was brought to them. Now I feel betrayed and don’t know what to do in regard to moving on.",27Jul2020,1

I've been trying to engage people I see are by themselves/invite them to join our group in conversation; never know what someone is going through or how much they might need some company.

I talked to him about his headphones and audio equipment for a bit. Eventually the conversation shifted to a public figure and I told him that I didn't know who that was. He stated that they've been in the news and all over social media. I told him that I don't really watch the news and I'm not really on social media.

He looked at me with shock/disgust and even started to repeatedly say that I was ""crazy"". I don't know why, but this really stuck with me and still really bothers me. It really made me feel like I was irrelevant or out of touch. It's not like my choice of abstaining from news as social media has left me in the dark about really important news nor has it had a negative affect on my professional, romantic, and personal life.

783,"I'm a 20 year old college student who has never had many friends growing up due to my over-protective parents. Through circumstance, I've made really close friends for the first time in my life during my first year of college. The only problem is that they attend a different college about a 2 hour drive away. Despite being 20 and living away from my parents, I still have to ask them permission to visit my friends. I think I should have the freedom to visit my friends every once in a while when the occasion arises because I care about them a lot (because they're my first close friends) and because it's hard to plan get-togethers when we live far apart with busy schedules so if an opportunity comes up, I should take it. My parents think I care too much about ""random people"" and should spend my time doing something else more productive. I personally think I should put my foot down and establish that I'm an adult and should be able to personally choose what to do with my free time so long as it doesn't harm me or negatively affect my academics. However, part of me worries that maybe I do care a little too much about my friends since I've never had close friends before, and it's entirely possible that I'm inexperienced with how much I should care.

Ever since I was little, living with my parents has been difficult. My dad is, shall we say, ""delicate,"" and tends to react to things a lot like a small child would do (i.e. getting very angry about small things, constantly complaining about things that don't meet his standards, complete lack of adult decorum... I feel awful writing these but I swear they're not exaggerations.) Because of his emotional turbulence, being around him is hard, and requires a kind of care that really takes a toll on me; keeping him happy is like being a parent but without the authority, if that makes sense. That on its own wouldn't be enough for me to think about leaving, of course. Some people are naturally high-maintenance and I shouldn't hold that against them. However, along with getting angry easily, he tends to do a few things that I never questioned until a few years ago, but now seem a bit worrying. I'll list them out in bullet-point form because I don't want to ramble on and make this a novel, so sorry if this isn't laid out well.

When I finally opened up to my mom about this for the first time in a couple years, she kept the same opinion, which is that ""he is who he is"" and that we just need to adapt to the fact that he's ""fragile."" The one time I tried to approach him about one specific thing I'd like him to stop doing (I think it was calling people ""f\*cking m\*ngoloid r\*tards"" for the crime of not being as good a driver as he is) he told me if I didn't like it, I could leave. I was thirteen at the time, and I'm fifteen now, so this is going to require way more money and preparation, but I have dual citizenship and am seriously considering leaving them and finding somewhere to live and work in my other home country.

787,"I’ll try to make this as short and concise as possible:

My neighbor told me that her son sexually abused her granddaughters and this is why the grandchildren now live with my neighbor, the Grandma.   This was over a year ago and we assumed the piece of shit son was locked up or not allowed to come around.  So with this information in my brain, a red flag went off recently when I noticed one of her sons was apparently living next door with the aunt.  I was suspicious but unsure it was indeed THE SON until the drunk neighbors down the road came yelling at the neighbors door, trying to break in at 2AM saying “the child molester son came down to our house and asked our 11 year old to come play”.   We called the cops while this was going on because I can’t mind my own business of the safety of little children is involved.  The cops must know the neighborS are all drunks because they weren’t listening and told them all to go home before he arrested them.  We stayed inside to avoid being directly involved in this disaster. We confronted our neighbors about this because where we come from, sexually abusing children is not ok and not something of which accusation are thrown around lightly.   

I literally had to explain why this was an issue...so Grandma says he doesn’t go in her house and he is moving out of the aunts house.  And yet he is over there, every day, with his victims and other neighborhood children.  We asked Grandma why he is allowed around and she said he was never legally charged, that she reported it to CYS but they never did anything.   This is coming from the same lady who swore up and down she protects these children when we confronted her about all the weirdo crack heads hanging around next door at the actual crackhead aunts house.  Grandma also shared in the same conversation that the one little girl “re-enacts what the dad did to them “ on her sister.   Knowing all of this and knowing she lets this monster be in the presence of these poor little kids makes my blood boil and makes me want to go over there and give her a piece of my mind, but these folks are so messed up it wouldn’t matter. 

So with all of this and much more info that would be too much to type, I called the child abuse line for my state and made a report.  

I need to know what happens now and what do I do if nothing happens?  I know for a fact, straight from the horses mouth, that this man is the man who sexually abused his own small daughters and is allowed to hang around further scarring these children. And I have little doubt in my mind that he isn’t over there abusing them more.  So what do we do? I can’t just sit back and let this go on right under my nose.  These kids deserve a chance at life and they don’t have one if they stay in this situation.",27Jul2020,1

790,"First some background sorry for long post

Back in High School  I didn't realize this but my mom has the tendency to act like a narcissist and it only got worse as I got older. 

I went to a prestigious high school (IB Curriculum) I always did well in school until my senior year. My senior year was a disaster. My ""friends"" stopped talking to me because I had the balls to stand up to someone that wanted to control everything about our entire friend group.

(granted didn't handle it that gracefully- I called her a bitch but HS drama whatever) 

I was always really self conscious about my weight because I am overweight and stress ate. (My mom constantly reminded me of this) My senior year was the first time I had an actual boyfriend so I got distracted. That relationship ended when he just decided to stop talking to me and I tested it by calling him from my aunt's phone which he answered on the first ring. I called from my phone. Immediately to voicemail. 

Since I was in IB curriculum my senior year was the hardest year instead of the easiest in terms of the school assignments/lectures.

I had my first real experience with death with my great grandfather passing in I think December, my grandfather (to whom was the glue to my mother's family) suddenly in March, and then my great grandmother in April. Total of 3 people on my mother's side. 

There were I think two other less related funerals I needed to attend in between these during my senior year. 

Consequently it affected my grades and was nearly failing. Because I don't think teacher should be involved in my personal life I hadn't let on to my teachers at all. All of my teachers realized a serious drop in grades which was unusual for me and did nothing.

My history teacher to whom made it very clear she did not like me tried to stop me from graduating. The second semester of my grade in her class was determined by one huge quiz. After taking the quiz I went up to her and explained I was not ready for this quiz due to family reason and ask politely for a retake. She told me no. 

At parent/teacher conferences after being told about all the family deaths she told my mom that I never paid attention in her class and that I never got more than a C. I normally had a B or A in her class and I have slight ADD so I would doodle on my notes and sit in the back as to not distract others. We had to go to the principal to get her to let me retake the quiz. The first time I got an F the second time I got a high C almost a B. 

The only teacher that gave me a break after hearing why I was missing so much school was the new English professor. 

After finally graduating I was burnt out. I didn't want to go to college but i told myself I did. I spent two years with a chemistry major at a university doing the minimum to pass. Then switched majors to accounting. Still burnt out, started failing classes, more I tried the more classes I seemed to fall. Now I'm 25 turning 26. Finally graduating with a 2.9 GPA and almost 100k in debt. Watching myaft classmates graduate with master's already and I'm struggling to get a damn undergrad degree. Watching them get their dream job while I struggle to prove myself in an low internship position. Even my fiancé is more accomplished. He is 2 years younger has had his undergraduate degree for almost a year now and has an awesome job.

797,"So, I am a 17 yr old (almost 18) boy. I just passed my grade 12 last month. I never have a really true friend or best friend with whom i can share all my thoughts and problems or just tell about what's been going on in my mind. It's not that i am too much introvert or I don't try to make friends, it's just whenever I try to make someone my friend or think that he/she is the one person who will understand me. 

So, I am good at studies since childhood, like I have always got 1st or 2nd rank till my grade 10 in school ( and also in some other competitions too) and I have been also a little good at some other things like drawing, gaming, helping people out,etc. So due to all this, I was a little popular in my school. I have many friends too, but I have never felt truly happy among them. I have always felt a little odd (a little bit empty) among them, as they (my friends) always thought of me as a topper and some  of them were a bit jealous type and always try to make fun of me cause I got attention from all teachers and other students in class. They never tried to get close to me, even though I tried a lot to get close to them. They always try shut me out (kinda forgot about me) when there's any particular group activity or anything. But whenever they want help regarding studies, they always came to me to understand any topic or to borrow my notes, etc. Even if they have any personal problem regarding anything, many of my classmates came to me as I usually gave them good advises, and I truly felt happy by helping out them.

But when I have any problem, and i tried to share that with them, they almost always ignores me by saying that 'uhh... you can't have any problem, you are the topper. You are just lying or kidding.' I even tried to tell them various times that it's not that case guys. I'm also like you, I also have problems regarding studies (left study  for about 8-10 months in my grade 12 due to this, and I had my very important exam in Jan. 2020, but my friends just thought that I'm studying very hard and I'm lying to them about getting distracted), relations,etc. 

In my 11th grade, I went to another city to prepare for my exam. 3 of my so called friends also came to prepare for that same exam. One of them, whom I thought to be my best friend since grade 7th, suddenly stopped talking to me in mid of 11th grade just cause his mom told him not to talk with me. Cause i wasn't getting that much good marks in my practice tests. He didn't even tell me the reason, and here I tried to contact him for 1 and half month. Later my own mom told me that why he stopped talking to me. Similarly the remaining 2 so called friends betrayed me, even though I had helped them so much. Like one of them was really bad at studies, but he came to me in 10th grade for some help. So I, myself, taught him almost all the things. Later he got 99.07 percentile in the exam.

My parents don't understand these types of 'my feelings' and neither I can share with them all the things frankly. I also have an older sister but she just minds her own business.

And yeah, in 10th grade there was a girl who started talking to me. She always asks for my Math's solutions, which I always gladly gave to anyone who asks for it.  She became a really good friend of mine(from my view). Then later in mid of grade 12th (when I was out of my home town, studying for exam), she too suddenly stopped contacting me. I tried to contact her very much but she didn't respond anything. After some months, I talked to her at last. When I asked why she suddenly stopped talking, she said that we should stop contacting each other as there's now no reason to talk to each other. I was like wtf is going on. She never made it clear even though I tried to ask about it a lot.

So, now since the lockdown has started, I'm feeling really lonely. Even I aced my 12th grade and my main exam, I'm still not kinda happy. A lot is going through my mind these days, as my parents also started arguing about anything and my sis recently did some kind of not that good things. Whenever they start arguing, they always made me the mediator and tell me all their problems and other things. They thinks that I don't have anything to think or to worry about my own. I think that they have forgotten that I'm still kind of a child, but they have took me as too much mature for my age.

But now they (my family) are all living peacefully again, but still all those things they told me while fighting with each other, and my own problems like betrayal of friends,etc. keeps coming in my mind over and over again. And there's no one to share about these things, let alone talk about my own self. My friends almost calls me daily, but still they always cry about their own problems. Also, 2 of my friends almost got suicidal, but they called me and told me all their problems and I kinda talked them out of it. But I think now all these kind of things are having a really bad impact on my emotional and mental state. Now, I don't even try to share my problems thinking that everybody else will too ignore those just like the rest of people. 

But I kinda get too much frustrated today, so I'm trying to share my problem here.

I don't know where to put this. I've never experienced this.

Over the weekend, we had a small gathering (fits within the CDC guidelines and we've all been tested recently) to celebrate having a good month in June. Our group is like a small family so these gatherings tend to get wild and people get very drunk. I had stayed sober this time because I had driven myself.

One of my coworkers got absolutely obliterated. He couldn't stand up, from sentences, was just absolutely smashed. I live out near him so I offered to take him home. 

Everything was fine until we got to his house. I had to make sure he got inside cause he couldn't stand. I got him into his bed and he (I thought) proceeded to pass out. So I was worried he might choke on his vomit and went to turn him on his side. Well I guess he was still awake and he proceeded to grab me and start putting his hands in my pants. 

I removed them and told him no and tried to get him to just sleep but he grabbed me again and put his hands in my shirt and bra and tried to take my bra off. I told him no again and pushed him down on the bed and went to grab him some water so I could just leave.

When I came back and put the water down, he grabbed me again and did the same thing and then proceeded to try and push my head down while undoing his belt. Again I said no and pulled away. I kept saying I'm not your girlfriend and he kept going I know which is a big yikes. Then after the final time I pulled away, he seemed to have passed out and I left just wanting to get out of there. 

Over the following day I started to just be more and more uncomfortable as I thought about it. Come to find out he doesn't even remember that I drove him home, let alone know I was in his house. I can't look him in the eye and feel extremely uncomfortable. I was previously sexually assaulted by an ex and this is making me relive some of those feelings. I want to blame myself - I should have just left. 

I don't know if I should even say anything. What would even be the goal of that? I also don't want to cause drama or be seen as a drama starter/victim. I love my job and I don't want to lose it. And I'm sad because he's so nice usually and very sweet to everyone. He even thanked me this morning for driving him home and I could barely look him in the eye.

I'm very sad that this happened. I don't know what I should do about it.

Tl;dr I drove my drunk coworker home and he proceeded to shove his hands in my pants and shirt and tried to get me to go down on him. He doesn't remember and I'm very uncomfortable now. Don't know what to do.",27Jul2020,1
800," So over the last 2 months I started to get know and date a girl. We became official a month ago and I’m starting to feel like things are dying because I can’t see her right now. We call nightly and talk for hours but she continues to talk about just seeing me and I end up feeling so bad that I can’t make her feel physically loved. 


We’re both going to different colleges but plan to hopefully go long distance for a while (it won’t be too hard because we’re only about 2 hours away) but recently I feel like things won’t end up working out. My mother has a heart condition so I don’t want to risk getting her sick and I don’t know what that seems like to my girlfriend. I don’t want it to seem to her like I don’t care or don’t want to see her because that’s literally all I want to do right now but I don’t want to risk getting my mother sick + even though I’m moving out in a month my mothers kinda keeping me on a leash because she doesn’t want to get sick either.

I’m starting to get that feeling where I can see the writing on the wall. I might just be anxious because of something’s she’s told me she’s done to previous lovers like have a one-night stand with someone in the past and I know she’s talking to her ex about getting a better senior photo (who is crazy manipulative and would only do it if she agreed to get coffee with him. Fun story he knew her order, and has used things like that in the past to use her). I trust her so much and that she would never get back with her ex but I know that’s she’s done things like cheat and even though she’s said she’s changed I still get anxious about it and I think a lot about how it will be when we’re in college in a month. She seems to really like me but I have my doubts. 

How do I be a better boyfriend to her during quarantine? What do I do about my anxiety about our relationship? Should I move past it or voice my concerns? What should I do about her ex?

A family member recently passed away from natural causes (non-covid). I was very close with this person when I was younger (they basically helped raise me), but haven't spent much time with them recently as I've since moved away from my hometown. They've been living in a nursing home for two years and, because of coronavirus, the family hasn't been able to visit.

After they passed my family initially said that they were going to wait a while and have a small service. Now it seems the plans are changing to have a service for 50+ people. I live quite far away, but I was still willing to do the multi day drive to be with my family during this rough time. However now I'm leaning towards not attending... They live in a location where cases are currently very high and there would likely be many high risk people in attendance (elderly and/or overweight).

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  


When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  


After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  


Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  


After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  


Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  


I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  


Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

On top of this, I know that this is not and industry that I want to go into. the job makes me unhappy and i dread coming in everyday. I am going to put my two weeks in but don’t want to see my boss when I do so as I feel she might get me to try and stay.

810,"I've had physical and mental health issues for years. I'm currently in therapy so hopefully I'll be able to overcome my mental illness which has been destroying me for years. Due my illnesses I've basically done nothing in my life. 

I don't have any friends right now, but my old friends have far surpassed me. They've done really well so far in their lives and they're on track to do well in the future. This is the same for people I meet that are my own age or a little younger than me. 

Honestly, I'm really envious of them. I'm happy for them, but at the same time I'm envious because I wish I could have achieved what they've achieved. 

It makes me feel ashamed that I'm almost in my mid 20s, but I haven't even been to university yet and that I have nothing to show for my life. I'm looking to go to university, but I'll be about 31 when I graduate. By then my old friends and people my age would have done even more. It seems like I'll never reach their level. 

I even avoid having conversations with any anybody (including my own family) because I'm ashamed that I haven't done anything with my life so far. 

I understand that people do things in their own time, but that doesn't help me. It kind of makes me feel like I'm weak. 

**Any advice, please**?

Thank you",27Jul2020,1

Last week we had sex because we havent meet since the pandemic starts.
So I got prepared and all. I wore a condom on first round and nicely done. Then we rest a while and talk for 30 min or so, then 2nd round comes in, I wore partially the condom and realized it's the wrong side, so I flipped it to the other side.
Now thinking about this happen made me nervous because I didnt wash my penis at that time before I put a condom. Now I'm thinking that some of the semen sticks on the side after I flipped over the condom. That made me nervous that ""some"" semen might comes inside of her without me knowing it, and I think I got her pregnant.

I cant think straight, I just hope theyd get dried before I put a condom on. If my girlfriend has a chance of getting pregnant, what should I prepared before she gets the results? 
Please help, I want to act and be prepared for this if this happens",27Jul2020,1
813,"Let's take it back a few months to February.

I had just moved back home after living in georgia for a few years, and somehow I ended up sitting in a recruiter's office for the Air Force. What was supposed to just a conversation turned into a practice ASVAB, which turned into the real ASVAB, which turned into MEPS. 

""How did it get that far? If it wasn't for sure what you wanted why didn't you speak up?"" That's easy, I'm a pansy. I am 98% incapable of speaking up for myself. Now, don't get me wrong, when I learned I was qualified I was excited. However, since the pandemic, ship dates were postponed and I hadn't received one. 

Until Friday, when I was told I would ship out August 4th. One week. I should be excited. I have no idea where my hesitation is coming from, but I am nowhere near certain this is what I want anymore. 

My mom is telling me I'm stupid if I don't go, which I can agree on, but I can't say positively that's what I want anymore. Especially since I finally got a date with such short notice. 

I have no idea what to do. If I back out, I can never join again. If I stay in this town, it's likely I will be less than successful. I have no clue why I'm feeling this hesitation, especially since months ago I was so ready. 

I have tonight to decide if I am going or not, and i am freaking out. It should be an easy decision, but I can't figure out what the **** to do. 

Do I sign the papers tomorrow without being completely certain, or not? 🤦

814,"Alt account just incase.
For some background, I work for a company that was hired by a hotel to fix the place up.
The manager, we will call him G, is from asia and speaks broken english. He complains that nothing is ever good enough and demands better for everything, even things that don't make sense. 

Today, G told me I need to dig out all the grass seed I planted 6 DAYS AGO because it wasn't growing fast enough. In his own broken words he said ""grass no good, its too slow, my grass at home grows 10x this!"" I couldn't help but laugh, and I made a joke to my friend that I feel like his son who can't get anything higher than a B+. 

My friend said that was insensitive and I do see where it's coming from, as stereotyping is bad, but in this case he is playing the role to a tee. Is it racist to crack a joke at someone who legitimately plays out the stereotype portayed on them?

I wouldn't think making fun of a hick stereotype would garner the same response, since that's a popular trend from my area. It just seems like a double standard.",27Jul2020,1
815,"Ok, I'm gonna start out by saying I'm not the type of person to care that much, I usually just go on with my life whatever happens but this particular thing that happened to me has been haunting me for days, when I try to go to sleep basically my brain keeps thinking about this and I can't like escape how do I say. it'll make more sense when I go in-depth but I'm basically asking what to do to forgot/get over this moment and how to move on because idk what to do.

So to give some context this happened 1-2 weeks ago and I didn't think I would be this affected by it, losing sleep, not able to think properly, and currently being reminded by it. I was playing a game with voice chat and I get into a game with a huge streamer, 40K+ viewers. We're playing the game and at the start of round 2 he asks the team a question, I answer the question, and looking back on this answer it was really cringe and I'm mad at myself for answering that way when I could've said something just... well better. Now I know what you're thinking, really? that's it? that's not that bad.. but here's the worst part, here's the part that makes me lose sleep over it every night. So he asks the question and I forgot to mute my mic after answering it so my mic is STILL ON. my mom comes into my room at that exact same moment and she starts yelling at me to quit and I yell back and we're going back and forth and basically I'm like ""give me 5 minutes ill be done ok!!!"" and she says fine and leaves the room. I check back on my game and my mic was on the whole duration of that conversation. I was in like shock because my fight/convo with my mom has been broadcasted to my team, a streamer that I love, and 40k+ people, not to mention people can clip things and save them forever. Basically, I left the voice channel and my hands were shaking for the rest of the game. I can't bring myself to go back into the VOD and watch everyone's reaction cause I feel like that'll just make it worse. Its one thing having the memory of a moment happen, but for it to be preserved forever and for you to have the ability to look back on it is what is haunting me. So yeah, that's it that's what happened. So basically I'm asking for advice on what to do/what you would do in this situation. Thanks",27Jul2020,1

Anyways, it's been 2 years and I literally never think about him anymore. My life is 100 times better without him or his drama in it at all.

My little sister ( 15 ) told me today after having a fight with my mother that I shouldn't be suprised if she killed herself. She said that she's sick of this loveless life with no physical affection and my mothers constant indecision. 

While my parents are definitely rather authoritarian, they are very loving and supportive of everything my sister and I do. Especially my sister, because she's the second child and no longer the ""prototype"" for my parents. My family would never say no to a hug or to lend a ear. It's more my sister who doesn't want to be affectionate in our family, strangely so.

Previously, my sister has approached me before about being depressed. While I do my best to take her seriously, it's hard to imagine her being depressed. She is constantly joking about how this generation is defined by being depressed and I can't tell apart when she's being serious about it or joking. I tried to sympathize and understand her, tried my best to be supportive and it seemed like she was doing alright until she dropped this bomb on me. I'm at a loss, what should I do?

I was thinking about talking it with my friends or something but soon to realise they ain't exactly 'accepting' as I thought. Not that they are against the idea or anything but it just hurts whenever they still use it as some sort of joke as if being gay is a bad thing.I was afraid of I will make things weird so I stayed quiet.

I have also tried joining some lgbta friendly communities online (like discord groups or sth) but I quit them after a week or so as i feel that those people have their own life and having to deal with their own problems.

827,"My 30 year old brother has been a on/off meth addict for the past 5 years. He is married and has two toddlers( my niece and nephew) 

When sober he is the most kind hearted, minds his own business, never ask for anything from anyone kind of guy. Loving father always having dinners making everyone laugh.  We all grew up in a rough part of town and he was in gangs,drugs, and not being at school. When he got married he flipped and went straight edge fort the sake of his family. 

He’s relapsed and voluntarily committed himself to rehabs a number of times on all my parents dime. 

Well fast forward to last night and he’s fully relapsed, he maxed out our family emergency cards( all of us have this as a extreme last life line that he’s never even touched before) for over a couple grand at a casino from an all nighter. He comes to MY place, kicks my door in, shoves me and accuses me of fathering his children with his wife. After hours of calming him down I realize I wasn’t his first stop. He went to my parents, got in their attic and threw a chair at my mom.... later after he bolts out of my place, he finally went to his house (which he is not allowed to be at because of his relapse) and verbally abused his 4 and 2 year old kids along with his wife. He is now currently living in car. I want to help him and I don’t know how. 

This isn’t his 2nd or even 3rd relapse and chances his promised all of us. We’ve tried therapy, showing him videos of him high in meth yelling at his kids when he’s sober. Going to substance abuse meetings with him, hiring to work with me. My parents are extremely forgiving of him and always give him the benefit of the doubt until now. We’ve various forms of rehab. Literally tens of thousands of dollars of rehab stints. 

Our whole family decided as whole that we will not help him anymore. We always try to talk to him when he’s sober about how serious his decisions are changing his life. And how his kids should be his priority. I seriously feel like I want to bring to my place and help yo get clean but I have a 2 year old that I can’t risk being in danger. I don’t know how to help him. 

After last night we all realized he does not care whether his wife and children suffer or my parents. They have been nothing but loving towards him his whole life, our dad never beat us but was strict when it came to important things like school and having manners, not getting into trouble.. normal dad stuff. He’s never needed for anything. 

He has a crazy addictive personality ( he watched the entirety of GOT non stop a meth binge, lost his job for it) hes been giving so many opportunities and chances most people wouldn’t get. I get we probably shouldn’t have bailed him out so many times but he’s our flesh, you know ? But we have all realized he does not want to change, for his kids, his wife, himself.
 
For context he’s a gym nut and fought for years in his gang days, so I was in no way gonna try and stop him. 


TL;DR: brother is a meth addict who has burned all his bridges from his family (wife,kids, siblings, parents)he has been on week long meth binge and maxed out the family emergency card for thousands of dollars at the casino .he attacked me last night at my home accusing me of fathering his children while I have a family of my own. Attacked my mom at her house, and went to his house and abused his kids and wife verbally. We have collectively as a family decided to not bail him out anymore.

828,"A bit of backstory. I’m about to turn 22, so therefore I haven’t really spent any quality time between myself and my grandparents without my own parents present. Like ever. To add to this, I haven’t seen this particular set of grandparents in probably 2-3 years. No real reason other than busy schedules and a couple states between us. 

Anyway, my grandad wanted me to come up and visit him so it’d just be me and him and my grandma. This was back in my freshman year of college so about three years ago. I decided against it. I was young and in a shit relationship at the time and yeah. 

So recently (pre covid) I decided I wanted to see if he would be down to revisit such a weekend. And of course he was thrilled and said yes he’d love to have me. We pushed the dates a while bc of covid and finally we landed on this weekend. And now to add a little barrier to the always present awkwardness of visit relatives that you aren’t close to, I’m bringing my brother with me. 

Anyway, to the advice part. I was wondering if anyone had advice on things to do while we’re there? Anything cheap/free that can be enjoyed by two early 20’s guys as well as two 70’s grandparents.

I finally got a call last week from an animal hospital near me. It’s part time because I’m in school, somewhat decent pay, and it’s close to where I live. I was interviewed on Friday, called on Friday evening with a job offer and started this morning. The first 2 hours I was filling out paperwork and going over hospital policies and procedures. The administrator of the hospital was the one going over everything with us. She told me and the other girl they’d just hired that they only had enough staff to cover the shifts they needed, and that if you called off you were screwing over everyone and probably wouldn’t be allowed to take the day off sick because they’d be short staffed. I think this is a big red flag. First, people get sick. So to not have the proper amount of staff for that to be covered is both negligent and selfish. Because they’re guilting people into not calling off by telling them their co workers will suffer for it. I think this is bull. Secondly, I don’t want to suffer and have to do the work of 2-3 people by myself because someone’s sick. And it’s not right to make the staff mad at eachother over this.

Around April tho I started talking regularly with this guy from school, we basically played r6 and ps4 the entire quarantine and talked abt random stuffs. Idk but for some reason he started talking with me in a jokingly flirtatious way (he's openly bi) and i just went on with the flow cuz im bored. I was getting real comfortable with him so i opened up abt questioning my sexuality and all that shit and he said it's normal thing to experience for a guy. He then casually suggested the idea of sexting with him, and it's prob cuz of my hormones or lack of sexual activity with a girl that i said yes. We did that for quite some time every day and i was really enjoying it but at the same time feeling guilty and scared bc i never had done nor showed it to another guy, plus the fear of someone finding out added to the anxiety.

I was always an ambitious student. My academics were everything to me. It was the only thing i put my worth in. I could look at myself in the mirror and hate everything i see but i could always say ""well, at least i go to a good school and am a relatively good student."". 

In my country we have to take an antrance exam for highschool as well. When i took it i did well. I was on the top 0.4%. So i went into a good school. It was the only thing i liked about myself. In my eyes it was a huge success. And i loved my school more than anything. 

This year i had to take an entrance exam for university. It was the most important thing in my life. And having anxiety and dealing with such stress was incredibly difficult. I was really suicidal throughout the last year. But i was always hopefull. I was hopefull i would be successful this time too. I was hopefull i was going to get into a good university too. 

Today i got my results. I was crushed. It was so bad i had a breakdown when i saw it. I started screaming and my legs gave up. I have been vrying this whole day and it just hurts too much. I know for most people it may seem like a dumb thing to be that depressed about. But this was my last hope. This was the last chance i gave myself to prove that my life was worth living. That i deserved happiness.

Turns out i failed at that too. All my life, all my teachers always told me i was smart, i had a broght future. Now im so ashamed. I disappointed not only myself but also my teachers, my friends and my family. I can never forget my dads face when he saw my results.

Now it feels like everything has come to and end. My life has come to an end. The only thing i hoped from life, the only thing i have lived for was taken away from me. I felt like i just watched my dreams and my hopes for the future slip away from my hands.

I feel like i can hear my blood whisper in my ear ""let me out! Do something, cut yourself, stap yourself but just let me out"". I never thought hearing my own heart beat could be so cruel. I dont want to exist anymore. I have failed at the most important thing in my life. I have failed myself.

How can i ever live with myself after this? How can i ever look in the mirror and be content. I ruined my future. I have nothing left anymore. Nothing left to hold on to.",27Jul2020,1

I know the title sounds very weird but hear me out: I am a young teen and have very low confidence, I really want to get my hair cut to shoulder length but every time I go to the hairdresser and ask them to cut my hair like I want they say things like ""your hair looks prettier  long"" or ""it won't look good"" and stuff like that. I, with my low confidence, decide against getting shoulder length hair and forget about it for a bit. 
After a while I realise I really do want shoulder length hair and go back, and it starts all over again.. 

I really need advice on how to stick with my choice and tell the hairdresser that I DO want shoulder length hair.

&amp;#x200B;

Something completely new has developed in my personality which is really really bad.

So I (m22) have one particular friend ( f19) who means a lot to me, we are really close. now very recently I started to have some kinds of daydreams about her that are incredibly bad and they can get extremely terrible.

So we worked closely together for two years, she quit recently and we promised that we keep in touch with each other because our friendship is important to both of us. now after a week of not seeing her I asked her if she wanted to do something, she declined because she had stuff to do. I asked a couple of more times and she was never able to make up time. and then my mind unconsciously started to create this fake persona of her. 

 I would start to doubt that she'd even want to do anything with me that she doesn't even like me etc.

that whole thing went on and on and got more and more extreme until I got to a point where I was sure that our friendship is over and I'd blame myself for fucking it all up. I got into a depression phase where I couldn't even get out of bed because of the self hatred I had about myself.

I then had a breaking point where I was able to think clearly for a few minutes and reminded myself that I can talk with her and ask her whats up. So I made a voice message, and asked her what was up.

She was quite surprised and she said that she didn't felt like that at all, that everything was good between us. 

We were able to meet up again and nothing has changed, she's still my good friend like before.

after that something similar happened again just not on that scale but still not nice.   
and then again. 

I don't know what's going on with my mind and how I turn it off, she means a lot to me but those thought destroy the beautiful thing we had. because as unreal as it is, it is always in my mind and I now sometimes feel uneasy when I'm with her because of those thoughts.

I don't know how I turn it off, and how I stop it from getting worse. it kind of sounds like a mental disorder of some sorts to me.",27Jul2020,1
850,"I feel terrible, sad and angry. As only support I have from my family is money

Hello! 

I need to get it off my chest. I am not sure if I am right or wrong here. Be honest with me. If I am the problem then just go ahead and tell me. 

Today I got in a fight with my mom. I was talking to her by WhatsApp and I told her that I hate my job as I am not developing at all, I am doing pure shit and my boss is a total jerk to me. She told me “just look for a new one”. I asked her that maybe my dad will finally hire me, she replied that I gotta ask him, so I said I know the answer will be “be patient”. This is when it went to shit. She replied to me: “boo hoo. Bad daddy does nothing good for his little boy, he just hurts him”. Such answers happened before, but I just shrugged it off. However today I asked her “why do you always ridicule me when I ask for such things?”. She want f-ing crazy after this. I just told her, mid her rant that maybe she does it unconsciously, but it makes me feel bad. She called me spoiled brat and said she will never support me at all again etc, and I said nothing more to her. Now I feel terrible, because how she treated me and overreacted (at least in my opinion). I feel like I want to move to other side of the world and never have contact with my family again. 


Now. Time for some stuff that lead to this point. 
I can tell that financially my parents do help me a lot, I can tell that my father is quite rich and always helped and supported me. I got an apartment when I went to college, now they got me and my fiancée a bigger one, but to be honest I never asked for any of this. He just did it without asking me. And I can tell I totally thank him for this and I totally respect this. I cannot complain about this, as for example I got a new car recently from him (but still. It was only because he got my sister brand new car, so I got her old one for me). Anyway. Money was all I ever had from my parents in my adult life. 

About working for my dad. He got a production company and my sister is working there as soon as she finished university. As I am 2 years younger and finished degree that took me WAY more work, a lot of sleepless nights I heard from him “well. At the moment there’s no proper place for you here. You gotta take experience somewhere else first, then we will think.” It was 7 years ago and I am working office job, and being treated like garbage. Whenever I ask him about this all I hear is “be patient”. 

I always had way worse connection to my dad. My sis was always daddy’s daughter. Whenever I tried to bong with my dad he was always tired and had no time. When I got adult and visited then I tried to talk to him, engage a conversation he was always tired or busy. However when my sisters husband visited my dad was always full of energy and willing to talk, but kept ignoring me. I once had an argument with him about this, and it was one of few times when my mom was on my side, as she noticed it too. My sis has a child and in 4 years of this kids life, he gave her more attention and time than I got in 30 years. Which breaks my heart. When I try to recall any teen memories about me and my dad I have few good ones, but there’s one that always pops up first. When I was 15 or 16 I went with him to do some business and I was a translator. Other guy fucked up and my dad was yelling and insulting him and told me to translate it. I was scared and I refused as I didn’t like to do stuff like this. For whole way home he didn’t speak to me. When we got home he was yelling at me, screaming at me that I didn’t insult the other guy as he wasted his time and when he got on me I simply cried because I was scared. Only reaction from my dad was: “fucking pussy”. My mom scolded him and got angry at him, and on next day he called me and apologized, because I didn’t want to stay at home so I was just wandering around the town. However in his defense as I grew older he became much calmer and easy going. But I think he still thinks very little of me, as for example my brother in law can use his atv without a problem whenever he wants, when I asked him to let me use it he said “no. It’s too dangerous. You will get hurt, it ain’t machine for you.”. Besides this bad things I cannot complain about finances. I want to make it clear that I am really thankful for this. 

About my mom. Well. She didn’t have to work. She was overprotective and controlling. For example she forced me to pick university close to our hometown, even tho it was much worse. She forced me to take second course in university because my other friend took one. I agreed without questions. However she thinks that if I get money from them I have to be happy, I cannot complain and I gotta agree to anything she asks me for. Like watching her pets when they go out for a weekend, even tho I had other plans. I just had no choice. Not like my sister couldn’t do it, as they live in same town, and I live 60 km away. And indeed. I always did what she asked me for, even tho often I had to cancel my plans or I simply didn’t want to do it. 

During COVID pandemic I had to go to work to train new hires. Like 90 people during a month. So you can imagine I was stressed as hell, especially adding whole situation around the world and I had to fill in for 2 other associates who were on home office and they didn’t want to have personal contact with new hires, so they just came on different days and left documents that new guys had to sign etc. So as I said I was really nervous and on one day, when i felt really bad and nervous I called my mom to look for support. I told her that my hands were shaking, that I had problems sleeping and so on. Her answer? “Man up and get over it. I don’t feel like listening to you whining”. On same evening I had my first panic attack, I didn’t want to tell her about this, but my fiancée did it and my mom got scared and became nicer for a week or two.  Still, since then I have huge anxiety problems and I had to start seeing a psychologist because I had problems dealing with all this shit. 

I am sorry for long post and not that perfect English, but it’s not my mother language. 

Could you please tell me. Is there a problem with me and I am 30yo spoiled brat? Or it’s my family who treats me like shit?

852,"I am an 18F and i have a temper, because of it i overreact when someone or something annoys me. Sometimes it's justified but most of time i get over annoyed and i'm not sure how to stop the cycle. For example, i have a little brother, who is 10 years old and a few days ago when my sister, 13F, and i were watching a movie, he joined us and then would not sit still. He kept laughing when nothing funny was happened, being loud the whole time and tried to keep talking to us about other things. It's annoying to have to put with this, but i tried my best to keep calm and tell him to stop firmly but gently, however he carried on. Then i exploded and yelled at him. I told him to ""get lost"" and called him a ""stupid, annoying idiot."" and i made him cry. My mother shouted at me for doing that and yes, i feel really bad for making him cry but at the same time, i told him plenty of times to stop and he didn't. The issue is, is that i didn't need to yell at him as much as i need and i did not need to call him names at all. I probably shouted at  him for a good 5 minutes which is a long time when someone is standing there shouting at you. Similar situations happen like this 5-6 times a week, like my sister knocked over my water bottle yesterday and the juice split all over the floor i has just mopped and i, again yelled at her and called her names, for no reason because it was just an accident. I don't want to get as angry as i do anymore. I don't want to be known as someone who gets angry all the time. I have tried things like breathing techniques and fiddling with your fingers and holding your breathe to calm myself down when in those situations but i seem to forget and explode instead. I have great relationships with my parents and siblings and they seem to bear in mind my temper when something happens but it's not fair on them and i hate myself every time it happens. I, also, just want to say that i apologise every time i overreact and kiss and hug my siblings and parents (usually only happens with family) or whoever i explode on to but i want the cycle to stop because i love my parents and my siblings and it's unfair them have to put with me. I feel like an awful and shitty person/sister/daughter.

853,"So my best friend lost her dad a few years ago and ever since then she hasn’t been the same. Her dads illness took a tool on her family and they never really addressed how much they actually suffered for a whole year until he passed away. Her not being able to talk about how she was feeling bc her dad got all the attention and her acting like she was okay and happy all the time, made her mental health go down to the ground. The only person she kinda could talk to was a teacher but we’re out of school now so she can’t talk to him anymore. Plus she thinks it’s inappropriate.. To make matters worse, she was in a relationship soon after her dad died and her now ex bf said to her face that she is too damaged to be loved even tho she isn’t. She goes to therapy and tries her best to be okay. But that was a fkn set back and now she is too afraid to open up again bc she feels like if she does she’ll never recover from that and will be worse off that now. 

But I don’t think ignoring her feelings and thoughts will make them go away. She needs to open up a bit especially in therapy but she just can’t. She told me today that she’s been feeling very confused and down the past weeks and is afraid to do something stupid. All I want is to take her pain away but I can’t. I’m listening to everything she says but she doesn’t really open up to me too (tho i think I know more than anybody else) I don’t know what to do.. her family is a wreck and not the support system she needs, her other friends aren’t helpful either bc they judge ppl with problems and I’m too incompetent to be of any good.. How can I make her understand that opening up isn’t a weakness but a strength and that she is strong and can make it through this..? 


TL,DR: Best friend lost her dad and didn’t get the support she needed to deal with the loss. Her family is a wreck her mental health as well and she keeps drowning in her pain and is too embarrassed to open up about her struggle but she’s getting at her limit and might do something stupid.

This is the only time I ever plan on asking reddit for help so I hope my throw away accounts lack of karma doesn’t completely fu*k my post 

Three weeks ago I met my dad for the first time in 17 years after I moved into his apartment, He was literally never there for me growing up and I didn’t even know if he knew I existed. My Mom and me grew on the edge of poverty for basically my whole life, she was a single Mom and my family ended up hating her because she always asked them all for money. (Personally didn’t think she had the recourses or commitment to have a child, but unless I go dancing on the high way an abortion is 17 years to late) I’ve lived in a crack town for 10 years and my biological fathers has never paid a dime of child support, I’ve went to sleep hungry so many times. My mom works all the time and she try’s really hard but we’ve never been super close. 

The second my dad picked me up from the airport he hasn’t once acknowledged the fact he completely abandoned me until now, and he try’s and acts like my “dad” all the time. Personally I don’t look at him that way, I barely see him as a friend. Last year I told his sister on Facebook that I exist. And for the first 6 months I was born my mom said she left him a voice mail almost every day about me. But he claims “he only recently found out I exists because he was on Facebook because of the covid” (by the way he’s very honest about how much he hates covid and thinks covid is fake) it’s been really hard living with him and let’s just say he drinks every night and isn’t a very responsible father, he also blames me when I complain about Somthing. He yells at me for keeping food in my room but I pay for my own groceries and when I leave food out he eats it constantly, I literally can not afford it. He calls his dog “son” and only calls me by name. He’s got a very short temper and is quick to anger and violence. Let’s just say he’s a 2/10 father. 
I’m only staying with him for 16 more days I already booked a plane ticket home (he said he’d pay for it but ended up not being able to) I snapped tonight after he walked in on me in the bathroom, he opened the door I immediately shut it and tried to keep it closed as he was trying to open it.

I am batsh\*t scared of people because of the coronavirus and my brain’s amplification of emotions.

My Niece’s baby is turning one and my wife is hosting her first birthday party at our house. I won’t know most of the people who are coming to the party. I keep reading about people who have gatherings and all the guests come down with coronavirus.

I’m freaking out at the thought of all of these people coming over to my house, being inside, cuddling up to the baby, hugging, and other close contact situations, and being inside my house. Especially with coronavirus numbers increasing again.

A few months ago, during a lull in new coronavirus cases, we had a party here with 20 of my friends who I treasure and love more than any blood relative. These people helped nurse me back to health after my stroke and we will all move heaven and earth to help each other.

I was freaking out that all of my people were coming over to my house. They all understood why I was freaking out and eventually calmed me down. 

I am incredibly agitated about my Niece’s party. Besides her and her baby I won’t know anyone else who will be attending besides her father (wife’s brother).

861,"Hi guys so for context I recently finished my second year at University (aka college in the USA) studying Criminology and I'm now working over the summer holiday at a hospital to get some money and I'm starting to doubt my career path. I basically really wanted to be a police officer in the UK back when I started university since I really enjoyed criminology in college (which is before University in the UK) and I decided to carry it on at higher education. 

Don't get me wrong I love Criminology and the subject is amazing but recently I have been going over if the police is for me and I'm starting to doubt it. I always wanted a job where I help people and do something useful but I don't think I'm ready to risk my wellbeing and especially my mental wellbeing since I'm already a very nervous and anxious person and I constantly worry about the danger and seeming the job comes with many mental challenges and dangerous situations I don't think I'm ready to put myself in that position anymore. 

So you may be wondering what made me go for that profession in the first place? Basically I used to think that I was tough and invincible and I really didn't care for my wellbeing and wasn't really worried about getting hurt or put in danger. 2 years down the line and I have an amazing partner who loves me loads and I love her too and now I'm starting to wonder if I really want to put myself through the risk of losing my relationship and my mental stability since the job is very demanding and you are constantly doing antisocial hours, overtime and it's very hard to maintain a relationship let alone set up a future with a family. 

Also having now studied about the police amongst other things at University I realised how underfunded and hard it is for the police to even do their job and not only are they under constant danger anf pressure to keep up stadards and maintain the law and investigate crimes ect ect. They are also having to do twice the workload and it is just a nightmare to be an officer right now and for about a year I was in denial and like 'ow its just part of the job' but now I realise it really could be better and I shouldent have to do this to myself as I could really regret it down the line and yeah the money is decent but my mental and physical wellbeing shouldent have to take a toll because of that especially when im already mentally weak as it is. I have also looked at other sectors in the police but it's also the same story..... no money, not enough people and under constant strain so the police sector in general is a no go at the moment. 

So here is the question. What do I do? I feel like all my options are gone. I was around 16 when I picked this career path and now it feels like I have nothing left. As soon as I now see the police isn't for me I feel like all the doors shut since it feels like my subject doesnet really open up for any other jobs and now I'm going to end up with a degree working a low wage high labour job and wasting my degree and three years of my life. I just want to do something that is satisfying and I dont have to give up too much of myself and my time with my loved ones to achieve that. I get all jobs are straining but i feel like at the police what you put in really isn't what you get back. You give compassion and you want to care for people and in return you get people spitting at you and fighting you and it just feels like whats the point?

I wanted to thank everyone in advance for reading this and for any advice. I hope everyone reading this is well and to tldr: I no longer want the career path I chose since I realised its no good and now im lost at what to do with my life. Also apolagies for any mistakes.",27Jul2020,1

863,"I started my internship roughly a month ago at a small government school. I teach almost 40 students two hours a day, five days a week.

My first day at the internship, I was introduced to my supervisor (Mr. Adam) and basically his No. 2 (but who wasn't directly my supervisor, aka Mr. Ben). They both teach in the same department I'm teaching in, basically. I should mention I'm a foreigner here where I live, and don't really speak the language, nor do most of the people here speak much English, but both Mr. Adam and Mr. Ben both speak English. Anyway, day one of my internship, we finished the trial class early and Mr. Ben had actually gone out and bought coffee for us and invited me to join them for lunch. I was panicking internally because I didn't want to seem rude, but I decline anyway and said thank you. 

I have pretty severe anxiety around people I'm not well familiar with -- for example when I moved to a new high school in 10 grade, for two years in that school I was only able to eat at the cafeteria less than 5 times. I either didn't eat or I ate in the guidance counselor's office. At university, I was only able to become friends with the guys from my program after we'd spent 3-4 semesters of multiple classes together, and even still, I usually don't eat lunch or hang out with them outside of classes. Eating in front of people is probably the worst for me, as I cannot eat in open restaurants (if we sit in a booth and I'm ""tucked away"" in a corner, I'm okay).

Anyway, I'm afraid I may have seemed rude to Mr. Ben in particular by declining his invitations to eat together. Frankly, he's stopped inviting me altogether and doesn't really speak much to me. And recently, I've just been going straight to my scheduled class and just greeting whoever I pass in the hallway, rather than socialising much with the rest of the school/senior teachers. I don't want it to seem like I'm disinterested in their activities or don't want to get to know them.. I just.. can't bring myself to do it. I start panicking sometimes.

I do want to tell them / explain to them (my direct bosses at least) that I didn't intend to be rude, but honestly I don't know if I should. Where I live, people don't really talk about mental health or that sort of thing to other people, much less their bosses. Plus, I don't know if they'll ""buy"" it since from what they can see, I do pretty well with handling my class of nearly 40 kids -- then again, I don't eat with them nor have I shared even my full name with them..

She went through a traumatic experience with her mother's boyfriend in 2019 and had been living with our paternal grandmother and other family members in her household. It doesn’t seem like anyone knows what they’re doing with trying to raise her. She is currently going through issues with our grandmother and is most likely going to leave her household and be placed with our Dad or her Maternal Grandmother. Also, CPS has been called multiple times. I feel like she’s still young enough to correct or erase the damage that’s been done to her. I’d like to adopt her, but I am having doubts because I know raising a child is hard to even with her being 16. 

I feel as though I’m stable enough to take care of her and give her the emotional and any other  support she may need.",27Jul2020,1

869,"To make a long and complicated story as short as possible:

I met one of my best friends during my first ever semester of college, let's call her Jane. Jane and I got along super well, and after two years of knowing her, I realized I had a bit of a crush on her (I'm bi). Along the way, she met a boy- let's call him Nick- and they started dating. I was sort of jealous, but got over it because I loved hanging out with the both of them, we were a great trio. 

Their relationship was pretty volatile (she had major depression) and he had a fuck ton of family issues as well as adhd + ptsd + schizophrenia that was exacerbated by alcohol. He wouldn't drink too often but when he did, it would end in him getting into some sort of trouble (fights+getting beat up). They're both impulsive and codependent. 

I used to think that despite Nick being a great person, he wasn't supposed to be with Jane because they were toxic for each other. I thought he had way too many issues and was possessive and making Jane's depression worse. I would tell her to dump him all the time, but she never could.

Fast forward two years into their relationship, and their relationship is as toxic as ever. By now I am as close to Nick as I am to Jane, and I now know that she is as toxic for him as he is for her, she is even more possessive than he is, and she is fairly abusive. She is diagnosed with bpd at this point, and all of her behavior starts to make more sense (though not excusable, obviously). She ODs on sleeping pills after another one of their violent fights and is then taken away back to her home country by her mother. 

Nick is left behind with me, and we are both a fucking wreck. He thinks she's cheated on him (even though she hadn't) cause she had texted her ex (implying to her ex that she wanted to fuck him) out of rage during one of their fights, and Nick is devastated. They are still technically together at this point though. 

I am a whole mess too. We were studying abroad together, and she was my only ""family"" around. We'd lived together and everything. Nick is now living with me, and we are depressed together, spiralling, drinking every other night (him losing all track of time and any motivation to do anything). 

Before she left, I'd wanted to tell her that I too was in love with her, but I never got the chance. When she is gone, she stops talking to me because she likes punishing her friends for perceived abandonment, and my metal health gets worse (I also have always had depressions). No matter how hard I try to convince her that I am there for her, she ignores me. 

One night (while sleeping on the same bed together, which we had always casually done), and after having done a few lines of coke (which we never do, this was the first time)- Nick reaches over and starts caressing my back, and things escalate from there. 

We end up fucking and it becomes a regular thing. I notice that Jane has started texting Nick again, but not me, after having punished him/ignored him for a couple of weeks. They are still technically together. 

I feel terrible (as I should) and so does Nick, but we are lonely and sad and we use each other for comfort (again, not excusable). 

Eventually he can't cope with school anymore and gets kicked out, moves back his home country (all three of use were from the same place btw) and continues dating Jane because they literally cannot not be together. They are extremely codependent. 

I am still abroad.

Nick texts me fairly regularly and sometimes sexts me when he gets too drunk. 

I should mention that Jane is also bisexual and that she would tell Nick all the time that they should fuck me together. They never have though. Jane would also call me her soulmate all the time (she said she had two, Nick was one and I the other).

Two months ago, Jane started texting me again, and I feel guiltier than ever and I know I need to do the right thing and tell her about what happened with Nick and I. I told Nick as much, and he agreed. 

Both of us want to be better people, better than who we've been in the past. 

But. Jane would be so alone. She is alone as it is, and if we tell her this, she will isolate herself and possibly try to harm or even kill herself again. 

Nick has vowed to be a faithful boyfriend from now on and I believe him, and I know him better than anyone in the world. I have to mention though, that the bpd thing drives him crazy because they still have fights over nothing all the time, and he considers leaving her all the time but says he never can because she is his soulmate and he believes in fighting to stay in a relationship and blah blah. 

Anywaaay, do we tell her or do we not? Nick says it's up to me. I do miss and love Jane a lot and this betrayal would kill her. Plus we have mutual friends that would be forced to choose sides and it would be a whole shitstorm and she would likely expose me on social media for everyone we know to see our dirty laundry. 

I know we're all horrible people, me more than anyone. I know I would deserve everything coming. I know I will atone, and so will they. I punish myself everyday as it is. 

Nick would never cheat under normal circumstances, I know this. He's loyal to a fault. She's the one always threatening him with fucking her ex boyfriend to spite him (her ex and Nick loathe each other for reasons unrelated to Jane so this hurts him especially). So Jane is no angel, but she doesn't deserve a best friend and boyfriend who have betrayed her like this. 

All three of us are now going to therapy and trying to get better, I'm already seeing results with how we communicate, but there's a ways to go. 

So do we put the past behind us, or do we come clean?",27Jul2020,1
870,"It isn’t really a big deal because I personally barely use facebook anymore, but this poor girl I use to work with had a emotionally abusive and almost physical 
husband (ex now) who is weaponizing her family’s problems which had nothing to do with her. Weaponizing in a sense he is spamming public posts and pictures if one hasn’t changed it to private yet and pretty much putting a copy pasta of some fucked up things which include spreading lies about how she’s some abusive mother and yadda. 

We all know she isn’t and she’s a wonderful mother and does the absolute awesomest things to provide for her children. She use to come in the store on her day off to treat her kids to some treats and take them to the local water park and is always sharing pictures of the other cool things she does with them. But anyways I can for 100% certainly say she isn’t abusive.

872,"I have never had a boyfriend, never been on a date, never been hit on, and always been rejected whenever I asked someone out. I also suspect nobody ever had a crush on me, besides this one boy at preschool. My friends constantly compliment each other on their looks, while the only thing they ever said about me is that I'm thin and have small eyes (which is a bad thing). I remember how in elementary school two girls teased me for being ugly and one boy told me that all his friends said I am on the uglier spectrum.

My general flaws are that I'm shy, have acne, have small eyes (as above mentioned), I have no boobs, I have crooked teeth that my dentist doesn't want to fix, a big nose that's partly covered with my glasses, and some people tell me that I often come off as angry.

Positive things are that I'm intelligent, have full lips, nice shape of eyes, nice hair, long eyelashes, long legs and a round butt. But that's it really.

I told them how hurt I was and even broke down crying in front of them, they didn’t really care and just continued on about how they just don’t want me wasting my time and money.

876,"Hey all,

This is a different account because I'm quite ashamed of this and I wouldn't be willing to open this up to friends and family. So instead, I've opted to ask strangers online on Reddit.

I'm a teenager and I'm very near the part where you start to make decisions that will shape your future. In my case, I need to choose the stepping stone onto my career path quite soon. 

I've been distressed about this even since when I was in what, 4th grade? It was always my fear that when it was time to decide, I would have no idea what I wanted to do. The adults always reassured me that I had plenty of time to get to know myself and discover what I'm good at and love doing. The ideal plan was to make a career out of whatever that was. 

Now, we're here and I still have no idea. It feels like I'm trapped and I've been obsessing over it so much the past couple of weeks. 

I've tried a lot of things. I took one of those tests that determined which career paths were compatible with you based on a variety of factors (this was an activity for all students in my grade) and what I ended up with, I could not see myself doing. 

I've tried a more hands-on experience dabbling in some law, crunching some numbers, even learning some basics of certain professions. I thought that maybe I was being a bit unfair, judging professions when I have not walked in those shoes. I still found no answer. 

I tried some hobbies. I'm far from an artist and an elementary-level pianist at best. I've considered the thought of trade schools, but my parents want me to take on a ""more ambitious"" role. I don't think it's their intention to imply that trades are less, but that they wanted me to have more than what they did. And my body and hands are not exactly cut out for trades.

It's not even that ""I'm lazy and it's too much work,"" with the loads that different professions carry, but that I've never just found what I'm passionate about.

A thing about me is that I'm quite smart. My understanding is at a rate above most of my peers (and the population). I'm not bragging. I'm sometimes frustrated by this because I know that smarts in school mean nothing in what they call ""the real world."" I can't sustain the family and even one of my own by scoring A's on tests. 

Outside of this, I feel like nothing. I feel useless and quite frankly, dead. I'm actually scared that even if I tried my hardest that I'm just doomed. 

I never had the talent to showcase at school. While the other middle schoolers were drawing themselves as doctors and lawyers and actors, I was there unsure of who I wanted to be. Right now, some of my fellow classmates are figuring out which colleges they want to go to, taking steps to improve at what they're already great at and for which they have a natural knack for.

I know in my heart I can probably master whatever I put my head at with time, enough hard work, and if I'm passionate about it. A very important thing to me is that I feel like what I do matters and I feed off this a lot. I've been lacking the drive to do something for so long.

It just feels like I'm missing *something.*

881,"I have lived in my apartment for a little over 2 years. It is an 8 unit, two floor building (4 units on each floor)  and I live on the first floor. I understand the consequences of apartment living such as mild noise and in my case, hearing the neighbors above me walk. This is no big deal to me and I have been able to deal just fine until a few months ago. 

This past April, a single mom with two kids (6yrs &amp; 2yrs) moved in the apartment across the hall from me. Her mom (the kids grandmother) is frequently there as well but does not live there. We do not share a wall. 

The oldest child is autistic and frequently has meltdowns that can be heard from my apartment (across the hall). These can be up to hours of shrieking, screaming and throwing stuff around. Along with Mom yelling herself, it gets very, very loud. Sometimes these outbursts happen in the hallway rather than inside their unit which is even louder. 

One particular episode was so bad, Grandma took the youngest to the hallway and sat on the steps clearly overwhelmed with what was going on inside their unit. She called who what I assumed to be the kids' dad to tell him ""I can deal with this anymore"" and ""He's completely trashing the place."" This conversation was over speakerphone.  While this was going on, one of the upstairs neighbors left his unit not to confront the situation but to simply leave.  Grandma immediately got defensive and said ""Did (the Mom) tell you he's autistic?""

He replied with ""No"" and she, very frustrated, said ""Of course not, she doesn't talk to anybody.""  This exchanged happened while mid-meltdown among screams and obvious sounds of stuff being destroyed and thrown around inside the apartment. 

I have not personally met either Mom or Grandma. I try to avoid them if I know they are coming or going.  I also have not complained to the main office but I have a feeling other neighbors might have already. The office is likely aware of the noise as the maintenance guys cut through my building multiple times a day to get to the other side of the property. One maintenance guy even generously drilled a hook high onto the wall near the front door inside their unit for keys since one of the kids kept starting the car alarm. 

Because of the pandemic, I am set to work from home indefinitely. These added disturbances have made working from home a nightmare for me. I lose focus and am concerned the noise can be heard when I have to make external phone calls to customers and colleagues. My lease isn't up until next June.

I sympathize with the Mom. Clearly it isn't easy to have two small children, especially one with autism and being doing it mostly on your own. But my work productivity is beginning to suffer and I'm not sure what to do about it.",27Jul2020,1

I've suffered from depression for a while and I'm seeing a psychologist. I said I felt scared of moving but I just don't know why.

886,"Hi, so I’m a competitive dancer and all my life I’ve done dance. It’s really fun, but sometimes it can be mentally exhausting. I hate having to stare at my body in the mirror for hours a day correcting myself. I’ve skipped meals countless times just so I could get a flat stomach in my leotard. And then there’s favoritism. There’s clear favoritism in my studio because some girls’ parents suck up to the studio owner, and so the studio owner obviously puts these girls in the front during routines, regardless of their skill level. Dance has been the root of my body image issues and has caused a major drop in my self esteem. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cried for hours every night just because I’m sick and tired of not being good enough. 

I only have 2 years left of dance, but I don’t know if I can handle it. I’m afraid that if I quit, I’ll regret it and I’ll just be bored all the time because then the only thing I have going on in my life is school. However, if I continue, I’m afraid that my self esteem is gonna drop even more, and I don’t know if I can handle the constant feeling of knowing i’m not good enough, not pretty enough, not the right body, etc. What would you do?

887,"So my sis and I have been playing this mobile mmorpg game for a few months now. We’re in the same guild, and everyone is quite friendly. One of the top players in our guild spends a lot of money on the game and he can craft weapons with really great stats (gamers will know that only p2p/p2w players can craft nice guns since it usually involves a lot of RNG on rolling the stats). I’ve seen him sell his weapons to some of the other guildies, and the price for his flamethrower is really cheap for those stats. 

Anyways, so I’ve been telling my sis that I was saving up for the flamethrower (neither of us have one but it’s really strong). There’s a few types of flamethrowers, but I’ll just call them basic and advanced for now. A basic one costs about 200k-300k, and an advanced cost 750k-900k. By this time I had saved up 400k, and because of a game event happening now, I really wanted to get the flamethrower ASAP so I could clear more levels in the event. I had given up on getting the advanced one since it was out of budget, and PMed the guy asking if he was selling flamethrowers. He asked which one I wanted and I said the basic one since I only had 400k now. He then asked me if I had anything I could sell (which I was totally not expecting. I had heard of guildies giving discounts by buying stuff from the buyer, but this was the first time it happened to me. I was just really surprised). But I didn’t answer that question, because I’m not the type who goes around begging in game and I didn’t want to accept his gold since he was already doing me a favor by selling the gun at a great price. Then out of curiosity I asked whether he also sells the advanced flamethrower - he did, and he was selling at 800k. Then he told me again to put a couple of rubbish guns on the market to sell, and he kept reminding me to tell him when Im done. So because he offered twice, and I guess I really wanted the advanced flamethrower, I agreed in the end. He ended up selling me the gun at half price like this. I offered to return the “borrowed” gold in a couple of weeks, but he said no need, he already profited from the transaction even with the discount. So I thanked him again.

Then I happily went to show my sis the advanced flamethrower cause I was so excited. She asked me whether I accepted his gold (I had  been updating her on our convo cause I was so nervous talking to our top guildmate), I said yes, and then she was silent... and we barely spoke for the whole night while running dungeons and stuff together. 

[b] TL;DR a guild mate sold me a flamethrower at half price (he bought some of my items so I could have enough gold to buy his flamethrower at full price), my sis asked if I accepted his gold, and i said yes and we didn’t talk for the rest of the night. [/b]

Pretty long story and it’ll probably blow over in a couple of days, but just wanted to get some opinions... Was I wrong in accepting his gold? But I don’t understand that because he offered the discount, I didn’t ask for it, and when I offered to pay him back he said no need (he’s probably so rich that he’s drowning in gold anyways). Me and him are both satisfied so what’s the issue here...? 

Sometimes the top players in the guild offer to carry us through higher level dungeons, which she doesn’t have an issue with. Imo the extra time they spend carrying us through one more round of dungeons, if you convert that to a minimum wage per hour and then to buying in game currency, is probably way more than the gold he just discounted me..",27Jul2020,1
888,"I was meeting regularly with a therapist while I was at college and found it very helpful, but since I recently graduated, I have to find a different provider. Honestly, I haven't had much luck so far, and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do differently to actually get an (online/by phone) appointment.

I started reaching out in May by using PsychologyToday to narrow down by location/insurance. I made sure to read the bios carefully and skip anyone who said that they weren't taking new clients at this time. Despite that, it takes weeks for me to hear back from anyone (if I get anything at all), and every person says they're overwhelmed by the surge of new patients. I've switched from emails to calls, and it doesn't make much difference. Everybody says they're just stretched too thin right now, or they don't call back.

After a while, I tried talking to my insurance to get a list of providers that were ""actively taking new clients,"" but each person never responded, said that they don't have openings, or aren't even licensed to practice in my home state. (Not even getting into the misspelled names or wrong phone numbers/locations, so what they gave me is pretty much useless....)

Basically, I'm sure you tell I'm getting really frustrated and discouraged. Is there another way I should be approaching this? I don't think my messages are offputting—I include my name, insurance, and contact info, since there isn't room for much else. Should I be going on a different website? Should I be calling back sooner?

Any advice you might have would be really helpful, thank you!",27Jul2020,1

This is a throw away account because her brothers frequently use reddit. 

So she lives in Utah but is currently in LA for the summer doing summer sales, we broke up about a month ago and contact has been minimal but still often enough because we wanted to stay as friends

Throughout most of her time there her car kept breaking down and the expenses were just racking up. She’s only 18 and this is her first experience “adulting” and it’s been hitting her pretty hard in the face. She’s had to spend well over 2,000 dollars on her car already and right as she got it from the auto shop today her car started breaking down again. 

Also my older sister is her manager and my older sister is kinda a brutal person when it comes to emotions, not to mention that she’s now my exe so my sister doesn’t really like her. 

She called me pretty much bawling and screaming about how frustrating everything is and how she has no one to talk to and she can’t afford to keep living like this. Then she started saying things like “I wish the car would just explode with me in it” and “I wish someone could just crash in to me and kill me” I asked her if she’s been hurting herself and she said no but if she had the chance to die she’d take it. 

That kinda scares the shit outta me but idk what to do. I tried talking to her as much as I can, she hung up with me and is one the phone with the auto shop now.

894,"Hello,

I'm 22. 

My 50 year old father has diabetes, which is sometimes affecting him in some rather negative ways. Some of his behavior is attributed to his diabetes but personally.. diabetes aside, I think he's a bit of a jerk towards people and I feel very embarrassed when going anywhere with him and also fearful of him making a scene wherever we go.

I was looking for a computer chair and we went to a furniture store 1 hour before they were supposed to close. There was no workers in the aisle so he went to find one by saying in a very rude way, ""Is someone working here?"". He found a cleaning lady and whilst he didn't insult her, he spoke in a very rude, pissy type of tone.

He went somewhere else to find another worker but the cleaning lady didn't realize me and my mom were with this ""rude man"" so she started speaking to another cleaning lady about the way she got treated by my father. Standing there, I felt really embarrassed.

I spoke to him about it and he threw a tantrum, ""am I your father or you are mine"", ""its their job to serve and wait on me"", ""am I in the wrong for asking whos going to work their job""... I told him it's just that there's no reason not to be nice to people and I'm sure they had a quite tired day, he asked me how should he approach them and I said, ""perhaps say something like, sorry, could you please help me choose a chair?"" to which he threw another tantrum because I suggested the word ""sorry"" out of politeness.

Honestly, this behavior of his has been going for years. My mom is usually just agreeing with whatever he says just to cool him off which is further adding onto the problem, reinforcing his bad habits and attitude. This sort of his behavior is really.. really making me want to see him less and less, but at the same time, I know what he has been thru and it's been rough for him and he's still my father and I love him as his child.

&amp;#x200B;

He behaves kinda shitty towards workers because ""its their job and they have to serve you"" and I really, really hate this.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am stuck in a situation where he's insulted by my reaction towards his pissy, angry attitude,  
and he's acting like he was all nice and it's all the workers fault and that he didn't do anything wrong. Meanwhile, I don't know how to proceed - it's really embarassing for me to see my father make scenes everywhere we go buy something and I feel really sick of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do, Reddit?

Talking to him isn't really an option, he's 0% likely to take in anything I have to say, he's 101% adamant about his own choices and attitude and not sorry one bit for being rude to random workers at places we go to.",27Jul2020,1

896,"Hi /r/advice, I (22F) just moved into my first apartment in May in a college town. It is on the first floor of the building, but the neighborhood I live in is quite nice so I wasn't worried. However, last Tuesday night at around 11PM I saw a man looking into my apartment windows. I have to keep the windows open 24/7 because I don't have air conditioning, but I have locks on my windows that allow me to keep them open about 6 inches but wont allow them to open any wider than that. My bed is right next to a window, and from my bedroom window I can see the bushes in front of my living room windows (which are next to the porch and door to my building). I went to bed, and saw a man walk up to the bushes in front of my living room window and then walk away. This didn't concern me at first because it kind of looked like he just walked up to the door of my building and walked away-- maybe he was going to a friends place and was checking that this was the right address or something. But then a few minutes later, he came back, walked up to my living room windows again, and clearly moved the bushes to peer in. Then, he walked towards me and was no longer in my line of sight, but I could see the bushes in front of my window move like someone was trying to see inside. 

I was paralyzed with fear for a minute, then I jumped up and turned all of my lights on, shut and double locked all my windows, and texted my friends to tell them what I saw. When my friends responded 20mins later, they told me to call the police. I didn't because I thought maybe I was imagining things, it wasn't an emergency, etc. The next day I bought pepper spray and some simple alarms for my windows, and I now sleep with my tennis racket and the pepper spray. Unfortunately I haven't been able to use the alarms yet because it's been very hot all week. If I close my windows, it'll literally become a hundred degrees in here. I've also told my neighbors who smoke on the porch frequently what happened and asked them to keep a lookout when they smoke at night.

Last night, I heard someone walk up to my bedroom window (footsteps on grass) and the bushes moved loudly again like someone was moving them to peer in. It was so loud that it even got my cat's attention, and he jumped into the window to see what was going on. I tried to look outside but I couldn't see anyone by then. I didn't call the police because I didn't get a good look at who/what is was and I didn't think they'd take me seriously. 

This entire situation has frightened me so much that I have not been able to get any sleep for the past week. I looked at the crime map for my city and there was a burglary in the apartment building (different building, same complex as mine) across the street the week before. I am a broke graduate student and I don't have any valuables besides my phone, laptop, and engagement ring. Reddit, what can I do? The only thing I can confidently say about the appearance of the man looking into my windows is that he was a white man. Should I call the non-emergency police line and tell them what happened, and ask them to send more patrol cars to my neighborhood at night? Should I save up for a more thorough security system? Should I ask my property manager to put more locks on the windows? Any advice would be appreciated.",27Jul2020,1

Me and my siblings grew up with a schizophrenic dad who didn't really show strong symptoms until we were all adults. He was paranoid our whole lives but we would sort of just joke about it. He lost it for about a year but was able to get help and is functioning now, but is still obviously paranoid. He locks up his house with bars, has alarms and cameras everywhere, is paranoid of his neighbors and people, etc. He has complete control of my brother who's always had problems. At first we thought he had mild autism and OCD for a while (which I do think he still has) but it got worse and worse. Now it's obvious he has full blown schizophrenia on a different level than my dad. He's like a completely different person now. He talks to himself in depth, rambles, spaces out, etc it's really sad. My immediate thoughts were to get him help but my dad sees him getting help as ""abandonment"" and that he can fix him himself. He takes him to a religious hospital, a whack job therapist, tries to heal him with church/religion, and doesn't make him work or do really anything for himself. He also doesn't make sure he's really taking his medication. He just ""trusts"" when he says he takes it even though he walks away behind a door to take it. We tried having my mom and step dad (both are healthy) take control of my brother to help him, but my dad refused and wants to be the one to ""help"" him (control him). We've always joked about my dad being a narcissist but we think he actually may be one. I'm not really sure because he says he loves us all the time.

What can we do? My dad pays his bills, owns a house, a business, has always taken care of us, etc but he's obviously not a good influence on my brother who gets worse and worse every year. I can't even take my brother aside to ask him what he wants because he's too out of it as if he has brain damage. I just feel so bad for him and want my old brother back.

903,"TLDR: I’m moving to an entirely new state in the middle of a big city, and I have a strong emotional attachment to my small rural town and childhood home 

My parents have finally decided to move after they’ve lived in our small town after 40+ years (I’ve only lived here for 16)
The house we own is one that my great grandfather built, and while it used to be nice, it has become outdated and almost hazardous. 

For example, we recently couldn’t find out why water was leaking out from inside our kitchen wall, and turns out it was because of a drain pipe that didn’t drain to the outside of the home, and has just been draining inside the wall and soaking the now-moldy insulation for years.
Along with a bad roof, a heating system that caught fire, a bathtub that cracked open, faulty wiring, a few broken stairs, windows having no mesh net so bugs can get in, etc. etc.
It’s a pretty banged up house, and putting money into it to fix it would be expensive, and my family didn’t want to stay put and work to repair it anyways. We put the house up, even with all its problems, and got bought almost immediately.

We’ve already selected a house 2 state’s away thats in a large city, and we have 2 weeks maximum to move out.

I don’t know how to cope with leaving my childhood home and town. It has problems, yes, but there’s a lot of attachment I have with it and the fact that I’m going to be leaving it soon makes me feel incredibly anxious.

913,"So here’s a rundown of the situation. 

My aunt has two children; (F,16) and (F,13). We’re on relatively friendly terms with both of them and we have a way of contacting them.

So my cousins told our family that they aren’t happy when they’re with their mother, that she doesn’t understand their emotions. Ever since they told us that, their mother (My aunt) has been isolating them from the rest of the family in a village away from their house (villages are common around here). We’ve tried contacting her and telling her to send our cousins to stay at their grandmas house, like they usually do, but she has been refusing. This has been going on for the past ten days.

We don’t know if our aunt is abusing them physically or mentally but we know that she’s doing something since they’re crying on every call we’ve been with them ever since this started. 

Close relatives tried convincing her to send her kids over for a while but she’s threatening suicide if we take them away, the fact that this is somewhat of an abusive relationship is pretty obvious. We have a suspicion that her suicide threat is BS. 

Her husband has been watching idly and has done nothing to prevent the situation, we think that he doesn’t support her, because in India when there is a divorce the wife is always the victim and the husband usually gets nothing, because of religious stuff.

The CPS would put them in jail but we think that is way too much. She is known for being a bit crazy because of some of the decisions she made in the past (e.g; like thinking of buying a mansion for no reason and she can’t even buy it and she is asking others to help pay for it). Other relatives are opting to wait 1 year and put the older cousin in a college and put the younger cousin in a hostel.

923,"
When moving into a carriage house (separate building from my landlord but on the same property) I verbally agreed with my landlord that the small storage space attached to my unit would remain shared, as he wanted to keep his kayaks and winter tires in it and said he didn’t have anywhere else to put them. From what I understood, he would not be coming or going unless grabbing his kayaks (which he has not used once) or changing his tires in the winter. There is a door leading from outside into this storage area, as well as a door from inside my unit. 

My landlord grossly mislead me when stating how much he would be around, using the storage space etc. He had advertised the suite as being private, it is far away from the main house. He is constantly outside my suite, in my fenced backyard, coming in and out of the storage space, outside my windows, he stores things directly outside my suite up against the walls, truck canopy, lawn mowers, tools, etc. His kids come and go from the storage space as well, with and without him, and store their toys in it, put their belongings on top of ours, move our things around, and he bangs the door shut every time. I do not feel like I have privacy in my home, and feel like my space and privacy are being invaded constantly. 

In the tenancy act in BC the renter has the right to sole use of the entire rental unit, and the landlord cannot enter without proper notice or permission. Since the storage space is attached to my unit; it is in my agreement that storage space is included in my rent; and there is no mention of the space being shared or accessible by my landlord, could I rightfully file a complaint that he is entering my unit unlawfully, and stop him from doing so going forward? We only made a verbal agreement about this, but I had texted him previously saying that we needed to discuss the use of the shared storage space, (in which discussion he quickly denied my requests for privacy, saying he will be using the storage area whenever he pleases, and will not be notifying me when he does so). So I am wondering if these verbal agreements or text messages saying that the space was considered shared, when there is nothing technically in our legal agreement about it, will affect my complaints about this issue, or attempts to reclaim the storage area as private. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",27Jul2020,1

927,"I graduated high school this year and am not going to college because I simply don’t want to. Everyone looks down on me saying how I am super smart and could have gone to a good school but they don’t understand that school just isn’t for me anymore. 

I went through something a few years ago that changed everything for me including school so I started to let myself go in school. I began to distance myself and have been a loner ever since but sometimes being lonely really gets to me. 

My parents were supportive about me not going to college at the time because they saw how school affected my mental health but now they are pressuring me to do something. I kind of thought I would take a year break and figure out what I want to do but everyone says thats the worst thing I could possibly do and I’m dumb for doing it. 

After a mental breakdown a few days ago my mom said I should at least get a part-time job and make some money and friends to go out with. The thing is I’ve been begging them to teach me to drive so I can do this but they refuse to which drives me insane. 

After talking to a friend he told me about trade school and how he thinks I should look into it. I started to look into it but honestly I don’t really want to be an electrician and the other things don’t 100% interest me. I will continue to look further into it though. 

My mom also has her own business and I told her maybe I should start one but they don’t want to help me with that either. They allowed me to work with them for a while but never even paid me so that got me even more mad. I wanted to ask them for a credit card or something but at this point I don’t even want to ask for anything. 

I want to wait until I’m 18 to get my credit card because my friend told me that then it won’t be managed by my parents. Then maybe I can start doing some online work to earn some money and start a business of my own. I’m not sure what exactly I want my business to be but I feel like it is the easiest route for me to take. I joked with my friends about starting an onlyfans but honestly it doesn’t feel like a bad thing to do at this point since I need money and that’s what everyone’s doing now. If it weren’t for my age or morals I would probably be doing that by now.

I just don’t know what I should get. I don’t want anything too edgy or colorful. It’s got to be black ink, and it has to completely cover the scar because I don’t want any of the purple to show.

934,"Hey everyone!

Due to Covid, my college hasn't released their official housing plan, but there will definitely not be triples for dorms, which is what I wanted. Most likely will just have singles. I'm not guaranteed housing, but due to my distance from my school and due to my family's financial situation, I think I'm more likely to get housing than the average student. Classes will be mostly online.

I have been following the Covid safety precaution guidelines, and I don't have problems with them. I just really wanted to move out of my house to have some normalcy this year.

I found 2 roommates months ago, and now they're both talking about moving into an apartment right next to campus. I would love to live in an apartment with them. I didn't bring up the idea myself because I assumed my dad would be against it (my mom usually lets me do whatever I like; they're also divorced if that matters). However, once my roommates brought it up, I asked my dad if he would be okay with me doing an apartment this year. He said yes, to my surprise!

So, roommates and I found a reasonably priced apartment in a great location next to my college. All of the parents are on board... except for my dad. He hasn't outright said I can't live in an apartment, but I can definitely sense it. He started by claiming an apartment would be more expensive than living on campus, but after my own research plus an email to my college's financial aid department, all signs point to an apartment (including food and utilities) being thousands of dollars cheaper. 

Now my dad has said that an apartment is a good ""backup plan"", but a dorm would be best. He also said that he doesn't want me to have a bad balance of going outside. During quarantine, I've been staying inside all day some days for obvious safety reasons, but also because I've been pretty down about the end of senior year being cancelled, freshmen orientation being online, sports being cancelled, etc. 

Anyways, I responded to him that a dorm would be more expensive, and would most likely be a single. I know I'm more likely to gain a balance of going outside with roommates than if I were by myself in a dorm. 

Lastly, he has that worry that I'm sure all parents have that I'm not ready to move out, that I can't make my own food or grocery shop. He should know better than anybody that he raised me to be self-sufficient. I know how to make food, I know how to do taxes from summer jobs, I know how to shop and stick to a budget, etc. I'm not perfect, but I'm ready.

I really need advice on what to say to my dad because I don't want to be holding my roommates back who want to move forward with signing a lease within the next month. This plan is dependent upon there being 3 people, I really want to be in on this, but I'm nervous my dad will completely back out at the last second if I move forward.

I'll be 18 in two weeks, I'll be helping with some costs of college, but my parents are paying for the majority of college. I need them to be with me for this decision, and I don't want to force my dad to do anything he doesn't want to. It just seems like all of his concerns (that I won't go outside, that it's too expensive, that I'm not ready) aren't true.",27Jul2020,1

938,"I’m half white half Hispanic. I would say I am kind of white passing, I had a medical condition that caused my skull to be stretched out and my features changed. It’s not severe and I still look like a normal human being, my features are just ambiguous. I’ve had comments ranging from half black to mixed to islander to Chinese. My skin is very pale. I know my mom is proud that Half white and essentially wants to breed the Hispanic out. 

My bf is Mexican, although a pale one. His family is considered low on my mother’s totem pole. His father makes good money with his own business but never completely elementary school and can’t really read all that well. His mom never graduated.  However, they both make very good money combined and are doing well for themselves. They are also very traditional and proud of their Mexican heritage. They have the boots, the hats, the music, the love of horses and ranch life, the whole deal. 

I’m a different type of Hispanic with a vastly different culture. My family is considered “high class” because we are pale skinned and have more European in us then others. I don’t believe in this mentality, but my mother does even though she swears she doesn’t. 

She gets mad at me for enjoying parts of his culture. She doesn’t like when I eat Mexican food or go to their quinceañeras or other celebrations. Other Mexicans look down on his family and talk to my mother about how she better keep me on a tight leash. They insist his parents want me to marry him and will pay for the wedding and have a “ghetto” Mexican wedding because that is what his father wants. They will make me stay home and be a housewife instead of continuing my studies and I will end up at home. 

His parents are not like this. Yes, I have very big suspicions they are setting aside money for our wedding. My bf did propose informally but he does want to marry me, but made it clear it’s because of me and not want his family wants. His parents want me and his son to finish our masters degrees.  His family likes me. My mom acts like she likes his family, but it always goes back to her not wanting me to stay with him and for me to find a white man instead of my bf. Really...I’m tired.

We would sit and talk in the classroom and if he was with his other friends then I wouldn't say much because they would discuss topics that I don't understand or relate to.

So school closed on Wednesday and now I've been trying to contact him but he would either respond with something like 'oof' to my message or just an 'okay'. Then I stopped sending messages and just sent a few funny links or videos that I find and the messaging app Marks it as read but no response. Earlier today I sent him a link and he hasn't even read verified that he read the message even though I could tell he got it and that they were online a few hours ago, along with that sent a message in a group chat that we are in.

I love quizzes and polls, so I often check them out, and at some point it hit me that I'm as average as they make them. If aliens ever come to earth you should throw me at them, since I am the most neutral person you can imagine. Nothing special about me.

When I took a ""political views test"" it showed me that I am a centrist...

When I took personality test my score wasn't really focused on just one personality type, rather on few of them evenly.

Recently I took a test to show me what is my preferred way to receive love, and at first I was shocked when it showed me that I am a person who likes ""gifts"" but then I noticed that it's 28%, the other (3) options were at about 25% as well...

When I posted my face on rating subreddit I've got an average of 5,5... 



I know it's just stupid polls, and that it's mostly just for fun, but goddamn it. My main problem is that I have no interests and nothing that I'm good at. I'm basically average at everything (and ready bad at math), so whenever I do a test to tell me what I should study/do for a living it shows me some bullshit that has nothing to do with me, because I simply got similar score in everything. If there is five options then I'll probably score about 20% in each, if there is 10 then I'll probably get 10% in each.

943,"I think my father-in-law is being given poor care, what can we do?

Last week my father-in-law (late 50s, 6ft, 150-ish lbs) was hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis. He was delirious for several days and it was looking very serious. He is on several medications including methadone for chronic back pain. At first they thought his DKA was so bad because he was going through alcohol withdrawal, they even suggested he may have ingested anti-freeze. Later we find out there were dangerous contradictions among the laundry list of drugs his primary doctor has been prescribing, and that was the reason behind his delirium. He was in kidney failure but once his levels started to rise, and he became lucid again, they discharged him. When they discharged him, they told him to stop taking a very long list of meds, however they said he should continue to take 100mg methadone.

On Saturday night my husband called to check in on him as he’d been home for a couple days. This was around 11pm. His dad could not complete a sentence and kept dropping his phone. He managed to tell my husband that he had fallen earlier. The man is in his late 50s but it sounded like he had dementia. Husband called his step mom (she was asleep but this woke her up) and asked her to take him to the ER.

At the ER they suspected he might have had a mini-stroke(s). Nothing came up in images of his brain and then they realized that his kidneys were hardly functioning again and he still had several medications in his system. At 6am Sunday they couldn’t wake him up and needed to use narcan.

We just got a call that they’re discharging him because his kidneys are doing better. We’re upset because we think he needs further monitoring, especially after what happened last time. They also haven’t given him any of his daily medications and said he should take them when he gets home. They advised him to reduce his methadone dose from 100mg to 60mg starting tomorrow. This seems incredibly dangerous to do without supervision. One of my best friends from grade school is a physician specializing in addiction medicine and she said anything beyond a 33% reduction is risky, as this will cause a severe onset of the pain it had been treating and be a shock to his already fragile body given his recent DKA.

She has a lot of issues that make it hard for her to get pregnant though, so it miraculous that she was going to have a baby. 

I've never had kids, I've never lost any. I do know how much this meant to her though, and as one of my best friends and as my longest friend it breaks my heart to know how much she's hurting right now. I don't know how to help, she lives too far away for me to be able to go do her chores and help in that way, and I don't know anyone besides her that has lost a child that I could ask if me making her something would feel like putting salt in the wound.

So, I'm hoping I could get some opinions on if it would be harmful or distasteful. I know they have gift baskets for this, but it feels impersonal and she's not one to like money being spent on her.

My idea was to paint something simple. Clouds, some wings. Heaven themed. I thought it would be sweet to paint a back ground with the words ""Born with angel wings"" and her son's name and birth date.

Shortly after arriving to DE we got an apartment he got a job and I became pregnant unexpectedly. My birth control failed. We were doing so great though and he seemed excited so we went through with the pregnancy. Around 20 weeks pregnant he started to become distant and just mean. I was lonely and confused and he refused to open up to me. I never ever touched his phone until one night because he had pushed me that day which was weird for him but he seemed way worse than usual...(i’m aware i was an idiot this past year please don’t judge) when he left it and i figured there probably isn’t anything but i’ll check just in case. He had been texting his ex for a month and sexting her. We had a fight and i was too scared to leave him because I was pregnant(regret that now)...shortly after it became apparent he had a porn addiction. We were rarely intimate and since i’d found him texting his ex i assumed i should keep checking..i felt guilty but i was crushed and needed to know. I caught him paying for another exes onlyfans , talking to MEN on reddit which good for him but not cool for me etc. He was talking to anyone about ANYTHING...I don’t know why i stayed but i did. It kept happening over and over hes day he’s done he’s sorry etc. About 3 weeks after i had my son i found him snap chatting people and he wasted over $500 on chaturbate and only fans and was masturbating at work so i wouldn’t catch him. He gets irrationally angry when he can’t watch porn or sext people and it’s so disturbing to me but i understand it more. I have been reading about it for a few months so i can hopefully prevent my son from having the same issue when he gets older. Anyways...We lost our apartment in DE because i was only getting half pay on my family leave and he was blowing all our money on porn without my knowledge and we were forced to move to SoCal with his family. Shortly after we arrived it kept happening so i finally broke it off and he said he didn’t love me anymore because of how i reacted to him hurting me over and over...all i did was cry and try to get him to stop and reason with him and even tried to get him help(therapist)..As soon as we got here covid happened so i stayed home to be with my son and protect him. Now months later i’m in therapy and in a coding boot camp and we live in separate rooms, co parenting our son. I’m just in shock. I didn’t even know this man and we have been together for 3 years. He’s very immature and just idk there’s a laundry list of things. I’m mostly over everything but it’s hard to completely heal when i have to see him all day everyday. I am hopefully going to be working again soon i’ve been searching but i just know he won’t be able to handle watching our son more than he does now(about 45% of the time and he’s usually playing COD and ignoring him) I am just looking for advice to stay sane i guess and to vent out my story. There’s way more to it but i’d have to write a book. Therapy and journaling are helping and i’m trying my best to better for myself and my son. I just am feeling nervous about being stuck in this house for the next year ish while i’m in school and saving up to move to a different city. I want to leave so bad but i know it’s smarter to stay in this home where my exes mother is helping me because she feels bad 😂. I’m just not excited for him to start dating or making it obvious he’s talking to people and i don’t know how to not care about that when i’m not able to detach from him completely.

951,"Let's start of by saying that we are friendly with each other and sometimes go out together. However, i don't really want to be friends with her. We are civil enough but she constantly disagrees with what I'm saying, says I'm weird for my choices, continuously mentions that I'm a picky eater and is just very loud and in your face. I never mentioned it to my brother and I'm planning to do so, cause it's his choice if he wants to stay with her and it might drive me and my brother more apart even tough we're very close. Do I say something to her? So I confront her by saying that the comments and such need to stop or do I just wait for the relationship to be over? (she is constantly saying things like 'if you do this I'm breaking up with you' in a joking manner or 'your family is so weird' bc we disagree on a movie or something) it's mostly joking but it gets under my skin.

952,"There are many situations in which I wanted to be braver, and I can't stop blaming myself for being a coward. 
For example, last night I was walking with a friend in a park where people usually run, and we were walking on a track. Then a guy behind us was running and told us to move to another track because he was running on that one. We ignored him and after 10 minutes he appeared again and while he was running past us he said : ""People, please move to another track, for god's sake!"" 
That made me furious because there were many tracks next to that one and he could have just moved beside and start running on another one, but no, he insisted on running on the track we were walking on. Then I yelled: "" Why don't you just move to another one, what's the problem?""
And he yelled back: ""Because it's easier for you to move, you're walking.""
And then we exchanged some bad words and he continued running and I was so angry at myself for not running after him, for not saying more things and for not starting a fight. 
The more I think the angrier I feel. I feel that I'm a coward for not saying the right words and because we left the park at the end. My friend thought it was best to leave and I just listened to her instead of just staying there and breaking his nose or something. I really feel bad and I don't know how to forgive myself for not being braver in this situation.",27Jul2020,1

I'm 40 this year, I'm 12 years clean of drugs, I was a hardcore meth addict, and in a way I'm the lucky one. 2 friends died, ones in prison for life. I had to move away and start over. But I did rehab and I stayed clean...

The problem is my teeth are as bad as my mental health. I have most of the upper side ones missing, a lot of the remaining teeth are crowns, root fills.. They hurt all the time and I never smile open mouthed.

955,"So me and my gf have been together for about 3 months now. She’s absolutely beautiful, both inside and out. Sweetest girl I’ve ever met and I’ve been incredibly happy since being with her. 

I knew she was with someone prior to being with me. Absolutely normal. I’ve also been in a few relationships before meeting her. We didn’t really talk much about our past relationships as there weren’t much reason to. She did mention that the reason they broke up was due to incompatibility. Simply, they just weren’t right for each other, so although they still had feelings for each other then, they decided to break up as it was the best thing to do and they knew it wouldn’t work out in the long run. This was 6 months before me meeting her. So around 9-10 months ago. 

Well about a week ago, I was over at hers. She was busy working and I was getting bored as she didn’t really have a tv in her room. She realised and told me I could use her iPad to entertain myself while she finishes her work. I completely forgot she had an iPad as she very rarely uses it. Ever since meeting her, she’s always just used her laptop for everything. Needless to say, it was completely low bat due to the limited use. Charged it up and just started watching videos. Got bored so started looking into her photo album (no malicious intent, we’ve looked at each other’s photo albums in our phones before and crack up at our stupid selfies). I was going through her photos and as usual, when I see a funny photo, I’d tell her and we’d both crack up about it and she’d tell me stories about when the pictures were taken and the memories that came along with it. Well, I guess since she hardly used her iPad, her pictures of her ex was still there. Now let me tell you now, that I’ll class myself as fairly decent looking. Nothing special but I would say I’m definitely above average on my good days. My girlfriend’s very pretty. When we got together, I remember thinking I was the luckiest man alive. So back to the story, I scrolled back on her photos and well she never mentioned how her ex looked like. The man literally resembles Matt Bomer. That’s the first thing that came into my mind as soon as I saw his picture. Seeing her next to a Matt Bomer look alike just about diminished any self esteem I had left. They looked like such a good looking couple. I pretended to be bored of using her iPad and just turned it off. But ever since then, I just can’t help but compare myself to her ex. Like how does she see me? Does she never compare me to her ex? I mean, I’m a fairly confident guy but holy cow, she was dating someone who I know is definitely on a higher league than me. It doesn’t help that I also keep thinking that technically they didn’t end it on a bad note. They still loved each other but just decided to end it as they wanted different things in life. What if he came back and wanted her back? I’m overthinking. She’s never given me a reason to doubt our relationship, but I just can’t help but feel a bit insecure from time to time since last week. 

What do I do? I don’t really want to tell her how I’m feeling as it’s embarrassing. I want her to think I’m confident in myself, not getting sad on the low about how her ex is better looking than me.",27Jul2020,1

957,"Hi

I rent in England, UK.

Recently I noticed that a gas smell can be smelt outside where the out valve of the boiler is, when the boiler boots up to heat water.

I asked the agents, they told me to visit:

[https://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/what-to-do-in-an-emergency/](https://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/what-to-do-in-an-emergency/)

and to call the number there.

And if I feel I need a plumber they'll arrange someone.

But... my monoxide detector isn't going off. The gas smell isn't head ache inducing, it isn't severe IMHO and there are no other problems that I can detect. There isn't the smell inside the house.

SO wrote it off as always being the case, but I've only noticed recently. Maybe I am just oblivious.

I'm 20 years old and a year ago my father passed away at age 50, he died of a heart attack. I'm sort of okay, still coping with it but slowly making progress, it is a very hard situation to get used to, but I'll be fine. Logically, my mother being 50 has still time to re-do her life and overall, be happy, and the rational part of me completly understand that.  
The thing is, I know for a fact that she's talking with someone and I'm having a hard time dealing with it, we used to be a very united family and I can't be comfortable with another man that's not my father being part of it, I know it is the best for my mother but it makes me uncomfortable, and I feel bad about it., I feel selfish for having those thoughts. I also feel that I need to protect her and my little sister (15), she's young and the death of our father has affected her, I know he needs good parenting and I can't let this new man take our mother away from her.

Our father’s were friends and coworkers so we would see each other fairly often while living up in New England until we moved states for my dad’s job.

I begin reading her message, where she is talking about all of this hurt and anguish I have caused her from our childhood. She states she has suffered from depression, has been abused by other men, etc. She never explicitly states what I had done, just the damage it caused to her.

I am immediately shocked and anxious, especially since I genuinely have no memory of abuse like this. I am in no way stating these accusations are false or not important, they are completely valid, I just truly have no memory of the event(s) she is talking about. I feel I may have repressed these memories cause they were probably damaging to myself as well. 

Her message ended telling me not to respond but I just couldn’t not reply. I apologized and explained the best I could without disrespecting or disregarding her words just because I couldn’t remember. 

I’m hurt and ashamed at myself and that I could cause such harm to someone. I immediately called my girlfriend and told her, she will be here in a little bit. She is very supportive and only wants to be here for me.

This happened Last night. I couldn't find my phone so I took my bf's and I saw this text messages from his ex saying ""it's nice that we can still hangout eventhough we're not together anymore""  of course I kept looking and she has been bombarding him with texts asking him not to ignore her. 

I confronted him about it and he said that she had an abortion when they were together and she was treating to tell his parents who are very traditional. He said he's meeting her just to keep her from coming to his house and get aggressive. They have been hanging out outside of her house just talking. He swore to me that they didn't sleep together because he doesn't find her sexually attractive anymore (that was the reason why they broke up). They have been seen each other every other week for two months. 

All this time I never thought he would lie to me so much. He told me he went to her house and told her that he couldn't see her anymore because it was affecting our relationship and he left before she could say anything.

I (22F) live with my partner(23M) in an relatively small apartment complex. We've lived here for at least a year, and renewed for a second year lease. We haven't had any real problems, and usually when we do have a problem, we call maintenance, and someone shows within a few days.

Recently, we've been getting a lot of torrential rain and thunderstorms. The rain has been hitting us hard, and it has started pouring into our apartment through the bottom of the windows. The first time it happened,  we stuffed every towel we could at the base of our windows. Within 10 minutes, they soaked through and started leaking and dripping down the walls and onto the carpet. We had to wring them out so much my hands were raw at the end of the day.

Obviously, we called for emergency maintenance. It was pouring rain, there was thunder and lightning, and the water was starting to collect near my pc and other electronics. Things could have gone bad quickly.

Maintenance didn't show, and called us back about a week after, saying it wasn't an emergency, and that we'd have to file a work order, which takes forever.

For context, we live on the second floor, so water damaged on the first floor because of the leaky windows would probably be on us, idk.

971,"Hello there, Kind Stranger!
I'm [23M], and I feel stuck in life.

Background story:
I'm from one of the poorest part of my Eastern European country, I lived in a relatively small village (~800ppl lives there) til I was 14. I decided, I want to have the best life I possibly could, travel with my future wife around the world, and have enough money to be able to raise 2-3 kid without any problem. So, I started studying A LOT, thanks to that I became a socially awkward nerd, got bullied a lot, had no friends at the time. I suffered a lot because of it, back then.

Then I applied to a prestigious engineering university, and got accepted. Things took a turn for the best. I started working out, had more and more friend, etc. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I got into a serious relationship with someone I thought was The One for me. I got a trainee job at one of the best company in our region. Everything was perfect.

Fast forward to this year, March. A total lockdown happened in our country, in a period of few days. On Wednesday, we were sleeping together with my gf without knowing what's coming, and on Friday, our college dorm was locked down, and we had to move out immediately. I moved back to my village, to my parents, 400km away from my gf. That's where things went downhill. We suffered from the distance. LDR can be a huge b*tch. It took exactly 2 month, and my mental state downgraded by a LOT. At the end, I didn't even talked with my gf for days, because I knew, if I heard her voice, I would break down in tears. In 2 month, I went from the confident senior student, having a great life, back to the socially awkward, anxious kid I was almost a decade ago. I knew I had to do something about it, before I get long term mental problems from the situation. I decided to break up with her, for the benefit of both of us. It was a hard breakup. She told a lot of not so nice thing about me, and most of them was right, and it stuck in my head. My confidence is totally gone.

In the next 2,5 month, I managed to get my sh*t together, move back where my university was, got a small dorm, finished my thesis, got my engineering degree, and got a full time job at the company I was a trainee. I live on my own, I get payed pretty well, and have the life I always wanted. I should be happy, right? Right!? Well, I'm not. Feels like I achieved the goals I set for myself when I was 14, except the wife-kid-travel part. I recently started looking for a new relationship, but it's harder than I thought. Not because I'm ugly or rude or a bad company, but because my confidence is broken. After we graduated, all of my friends moved to different cities, so I barely have any friend around me. It's hard to find ways to meet new peoples, and even if I get the chance, I get turned down. Understandable, noone wants to talk with a socially awkward lone person, I don't blame them. But I slowly start to give up on things. Not because I want to, but because I'm losing motivation. My daily routine became grey. I get up at 6, take a shower, go to work at 8, get back home at 5, do groceries, cook something for next day, then I go to sleep. Weekends are the worst part. I get excited that it's finally Friday, but after I get home from work, I realize nothing's waiting for me at home. I'm alone for the whole weekend  I'm slowly losing the will to live. I know if this downward spiral continues, I'll lose a lot, but I have no idea how to stop it. Life is all about ups and downs, and I need to go up as soon as possible, before it's too late.

Disclamer: English is not my first language, sorry in advance !
 
Not gonna lie, I'm not feeling so well tonight. That's maybe why I'm posting here. I'm not depressed and I'm not suicida though, I guess I just need some advices about life.

I'm currently a graphic designer, but I studied Game Art for videogames for 5 years. I found an ""amazing job"" in a big company right after my degree, I'm working on casual games, I have a pretty amazing pay, so everything good. Except I never was the best at all, I guess I can say I'm on the bottom of my ex school class.

Then, part two: drawing is my ""passion"", I am 23 and I draw since I know how to handle a pen. I studied art etc, art is now my job. But my drawings are not professional at all, I feel like a hobbyist, I don't even draw everyday, and every time someone encourage me to draw or train I just feel super anxious and don't do it. I'm in this situation since uh, some months already... And of course, if I don't draw I can't improve, and if I don't improve I won't get any future jobs or I will be frustrated. Every time I'm drawing something, it's never good enough for people. It makes me so anxious and frustrated that I don't ask for drawing advices anymore, I simply can't take any critique without feeling like crap. Some say ""just draw for yourself for now, enjoy and have fun"" while the major part just say ""This is not good, do better, do more, draw everyday, etc"". 

So uh I have 2 major problems :
1/ I feel like I don't deserve my actual place
2/ drawing gives me anxiety

Sometimes I feel good and all, but right after I have phases of just feeling like shit.

Especially during quarantine, I’ve had to physically stop myself from baking because my freezer was too full to store anything else. 

I want to go to pastry school to learn new skills and techniques, have access to a real kitchen with real kitchen materials, and expand my network of professionals. The cost of my specific program seems manageable out of pocket, and if I did have to take out another small loan, at this point it seems like a drop in the bucket 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

My work schedule is more flexible due to COVID, and I’ve already gotten the okay from my employer that my class schedule is workable. Were we not in the middle of a pandemic, I definitely couldn’t swing working full time and being in school full time. For that reason, I feel like if I don’t go to pastry school now, I never will. I’m just so disheartened by all of the comments online about how much of a waste it is and how it’s more worthwhile to work your way up (even though all the pastry jobs I see require school or some years of experience, or both). 

I hope a community of objective readers could maybe help me see some pro to my dream of going to pastry school and someday making baking my career. Or, if it really is a massive waste, help me come to my senses.",27Jul2020,1

985,"My boyfriend of nearly 2 years has confessed to enjoying gross and immoral porn as a 13/14 year old. He enjoyed reading fictional stories of incest when he was that age, i guess cos he didn't have a sister it made it easier ? He mostly read brother/sister ones. He guilty recalls thinking once or twice at that age that he wished he had a sister just so he could see someone his own age naked, which digusts me and it terrifes me he thought incest was ok at that age or something? He says he has never ever wanted to do anything like that with his brothers or mother. 

I am also troubled by the fact he had a phase of reading incest porn about The Simpsons, which saddens me because it's such a pure show. He said he liked it cos he knew the characters and it worries him in case they were the age they were in the show in some stories, but this was all easily found on Google so they were probably older? He feels reallh bad about it now. Also, he recalls twice watching beastiality, but again this was found easily and it wasn't dark web so he reckons in hindsight it was fake? He is the most vanilla dude now, it makes no sense. He even voluntarily gave up watching porn once we started dating cos it felt like cheating and I have litreally all his passwords. Help?

987," I have a group of around 7 close friends, recently one (let's call him M because anonymity duh) decided to split the group by being pretty hostile to some of them over a relationship issue. Now me and maybe two others have remained friends on both sides of this issue, kind of ignoring it but also thinking about it outside of conversation. Now M is pretty hostile at times, his language is always colourful whatever mood he's in and I don't take to that so much. He likes to judge and finds himself pretty smart when he dissects someone's entire life and personality over text which I barely tolerate as is.

About five minutes ago in a whatsapp chat with the others who are still friends with him he called me the f slur (y'know the one for gay) and I don't know if I even want to associate with him anymore. I get he's always throwing swears around because he's just that way but this one is new. I have LGBT friends and I am super considering cutting ties with him over this. To him it might have been in a jokey ""greentext haha"" kind of way but I just don't think it's ok. He literally just wanted to play Xbox and I wasn't available so he came out with this.

I responded in a kind of joking way, brushing it off for now but I thought on it and idk if I want to keep tolerating him. He's a fun guy but I feel like he just keeps escalating and I'm getting tired of ignoring things.

Should I just cut him out? I'd probably not lose more than one other friend over it but I've never done this kind of thing before and I'm super nervous about how others in the group and in my greater friend group will react. Please advise.",27Jul2020,1
988,"So... I (18m) met this man (33m) on a dating website. We hit it off and made plans to meet. I generally try to jump into things with no expectations and I let him know of that. He agreed. 

We hung out for several hours, and we ended up cuddling and kissing. At first he made me a bit uncomfortable because he was very up-in-my-face and touchy-feely, but he listened very well when I told him no, or stop, and he did ask me if I was comfortable. He opened up to me a bit and told me about his traumatic childhood and lack of a stable family situation, which I empathized with. He also told me about his struggle with autism and Aspergers.

That evening, he was showing me something on his phone, and he accidentally showed me a photo of him dressed as a baby while scrolling through his gallery. He was like, “You weren’t supposed to see that.” I didn’t really care because, well, people have their fetishes and kinks or whatever and it’s cool.

I spent the night with him a couple days later. I met his roommate (early 20s m), as well as a friend (late 30s m) of his who came over. They both seemed pretty nice, although I was a bit uncomfortable because his friend was cuddling with him while I also was cuddling with him, and his friend was kind of touching me. So, later, we go up to his bedroom and he falls asleep cuddled up to me. The next day, we chill downstairs on his couch. I asked him about where he met his roommate, and he said it was “a secret.” 

I didn’t quite understand, and I didn’t want to force it out of him, but he ended up telling me that he met him and his friend who came over through a community for his fetish. He ended up showing me his blog online, where he posts photos of himself in ABDL wear, which made me really uncomfortable. I told him I would not judge him, because he genuinely is the sweetest, most precious, caring person I’ve met. He told me he liked that because of his trauma, so I tried to be as empathetic as I could. I told him I did not really want to see photos of him partaking in that because it made me uncomfortable, and he told me it was okay.

I did not want to gossip about him, but I had to talk to my best friend of over a decade about this. I have never had an experience like this with someone. She told me it was “borderline pedophilia” and that he “needs help.” She told me to drop him. I cannot just do that though because, even though I did not meet him long ago, he is really kind and a good friend. I told him about a personal struggle I’m facing and he embraced me with open arms and kind words.

Part of me feels embarrassed about being associated with someone who does that, not just because he does it, but because he also runs a public blog about it... I feel extremely shitty about saying or even thinking that. Also though, I was going to spend the night with him again this weekend... apparently part of the reason he is into that is because he wets the bed (I feel like such a troll typing this, but I swear to god I’m not). Last time I spent the night, he wore boxer briefs... but I don’t want him to do that if it’s a risk, and I also don’t want to sleep next to a grown man in a diaper?!

He also apparently wears them at home and to work, not just at night. I’m personally repulsed by it, but it just doesn’t make sense to me because he is so clean. His home, his body. All of it is very clean. 

I just feel like a douchebag writing this, but I don’t know how to go about this. I feel bad for him and I want to be there for him because he does not have many friends but I don’t think this is normal, because I know people have fetishes, but this extends beyond a fetish because he does this in his every day life. 

If I did not care about him and his feelings, I would not type all of this out... What do I do?",27Jul2020,1

We met a few years ago and had a lot of fun, then he disappeared(we're both dudes) Ok fine I'll move on whatever, but he kept coming back into my life and vanishing saying he couldn't handle it. It got to a point where I was physically and emotionally drained, and he came back one final time and was actually really good to me. He explained he was struggling badly and couldn't be in a relationship before.

Things were awesome for a few months and then he randomly lashed out at me when I asked why he was ignoring me. We broke up and he turned into a different person and had lot's of sex with strangers. I just don't understand. As soon as he dumped me and was mean I don't even recognize who he is anymore. Somehow I was perfect but not independent. I was very independent, he vanished and kept this cycle of coming in and out of my life up until it became an actual trauma.

Ik this isn't good but I really want to drink &amp; all and I'm 19 should be able to drink esp what I bought whenever and how much I want 


So I'm going to try looking for them honestly (before anyone says anything, no I'm not going to take all my beers back cos that would be noticeable. Mostly just going to take liquor, no one will notice that hopefully lol ^^)

So they could be in either the storage room/small attic next to my mom's room (locked), some boc locked box in my moms room (she locks other stuff she doesn't want to use or take there, the beers could be there likely? But not the liquor), in some other storage room that's a bit messy (unlocked), somewhere in the big attick (unlocked), somewhere in the food pantry/storage room, my uncles room (locked), my grandads room (locked).

She was the new girl and at first we disliked each other, but over time we had some awkward conversations and eventually clicked. Since then we have been inseparable, at least until now. She has always had this need to have a boy in her life. 
First she got close with L (18M), but they stayed just friends. But she was heartbroken over the nonexistent relationship. 
Then she moved to boy M (19/20M). They were going good for a few months but then he had to go off to college in the winter. Before this he asked he parents’ permission to court her. (They are serious evangelical Christians) Parents said no, he left and she kept a secret relationship with him. He ghosted her.
Then she moved back to L junior year. She went in bc she wanted to, but knew in the end it wouldn’t work bc he wasn’t Christian. So she initiated the relationship and moved it forward with some help from him. I stayed out of it knowing that giving her advice would end badly for me. They get more and more serious, and he chooses to stay here instead of moving halfway across the country for his ex like he has been planning since freshman year. Which my friend knew about.
Now she has broken up with him and is again heartbroken bc they kissed and sent stuff and she loved him. But she hijacked his life? Knew it was coming? Set herself up? She still goes to his house to hang out and keeps tabs on what he is doing.
When they broke up she wouldn’t talk to me. I tried to reach out and she snapped. I left her alone for awhile. Next time I reached out it was like nothing ever happened for a couple golden hours. Then right back to silence. Every time I reached out she shut it down or ignored me. We met up for her birthday and it was like talking to a stranger.

About a month ago, someone used my email to register an account with a department store I've never heard of, ""La Redoute"", and left an item in their cart, presumably because they tried to purchase something with my old invalid card number. Once I checked my card histories, I didn't bother exploring it any further.

Today, according to an email I received, a purchase was successfully made using that same account tied to my email, using my name, and being shipped to an address in Great Britain (I live in the US). For the sake of my own security, here's what I checked:

*  All the purchase activity on all my cards. Nothing was purchased from that site.
* The login/device history on my email account doesn't show anything suspicious. All my logins are from my area, all from known devices.
* The email I received doesn't seem to be a phishing attempt. All the links in the email direct to the La Redoute domain with the .co.uk suffix.

they constantly drilled me about how lazy and a sack of shit i am, while i didnt even have a license, i was working on learning to drive and theyd complain im not in ""one o' da factories working!"" thing was i couldnt even get a job full time with my felonies, i finally found a temp agency job on weekends and decided to go to college, they hated that. 

""college is for the lazy! just an excuse not to work!"" theyd say, i started getting real into tech and stuff and spending money on computers to build and books about electronics, theyd get mad about me reading, (and i bought a fucking AC for that hot ass room.) ""YOU GOT TIME TO READ? GOT TIME TO STUDY! THAN YOU GOT TIME TO WORK IN THE FACTORIES!!!!"" 

I would explain with my record no place is willing to have me work full time, they kept saying i wasnt trying hard enough and was just lazy, worthless, and at this point theyd hide food i bought, and feed only my aunt and uncle and themselves, oh yeah my meth addicted aunt and my alcoholic uncle live here as well, they constantly have house meetings while im gone at school or work, if i take a shower they turn the hot water off to ""flush me out"" when i make food theyll snatch it up and say since i didnt work overtime, than i dont get to eat. 

I switched to night shift so i could get around not starving to death, (i lost over 40 pounds from pure lack of food) i was able to sneak eating a meal every night almost, but was still a temp and paid poorly, theyd also complain that im not like awake when they are? whatever the fuck that means? Like they would wake me up while im sleeping and say im ""not allowed"" to sleep during the day, this leads to days without sleep since i worked nights and went to school at the mornings, and they were only happy when i was at peak exhaustion, (like literally not even able to get up and just sleep the whole day) 

I kept going to school and working my shitty temp jobs, but than finally, here recently, I was able to get a real job, a GOOD job, I was so happy, and im currently working here now and i do make enough money to live on my own now and they even offer to pay for rest of my college, so i immediately started looking for apartments, thing is i keep getting denied because of my background.... 

I just dont get it, i have the money and am so desperate to move out, yet cant even be allowed to have my own place to live, I just want out of this hell hole im in, i just want the peace of being at my own place and being alone ive looked all over online for apartments and cant find a thing, idk how else to find them either tbh.

I like her. I really like her. Whenever I see her, I feel butterflies in my stomach, but I also feel regret and sadness. I'm a 23 year old male, and she's 21, if that context means anything.

The problem that's preventing me from taking the first step, is that I think it would be selfish and manipulative for me, who may not be a healthy model for a partner, to get into a relationship. I don't have a driver's license, and as a man my role in the relationship is to be the rock and take care of my partner.

The most important thing to a woman in a relationship is security, and if there's a problem or she just wants me to be there for her, I physically can't (let's pretend covid doesn't exist in this scenario). She's showing signs that she likes me and is entertaining my interest. It's just, I feel like I have so many problems as it is, to invite someone else to deal with those problems would be manipulative.

Not to mention, not that I'm behaving this way, but if you're relying on an external source to fix your problems, that's not a relationship, that's a dependency issue.

The one last point I would like to mention is my writing. I dump most of my free time into my book that I'm writing, and doing research for said writing. If you need context, I'm writing a book on the impact of animals in the film industry, and how we can use them as a medium for storytelling. So my ""research"" involves watching a movie and taking notes, which, depending on the complexity of the film, may take up to 4 hours. 

I love my writing and I take pride in it, and I don't want anything to get in the way of my work. I've heard from some people that I could just watch the movie with my partner while I take notes, but it just won't work. I play the movie until I see something pertinent, I pause, and take notes. On one occurence, I've spent 15 minutes with the movie paused while I brainstorm and take notes about what I just saw. 

Please, before you comment, don't talk to me about rejection. I'm not afraid of rejection. Yes, it will crush my heart, but it will also lift a huge weight off my chest, as I will no longer have to waste any more time on chasing a woman who isn't interested in me.

I posted this in a different forum but I just found this place which might be a better place for advise. 

I work in fast food, I get so stressed before and during each shift. I feel like the job just isn't worth it. It is physically and mentally draining. I've been there nearly a year but I am still not trained for most of the stations. I mainly work either on headset taking orders, drive thru till, collect or getting out heavy stock. I'm hoping to start a distance learning degree in October and I am thinking of trying to stick the job out until then. Would it really be that bad if I quit my job without a new one lined up? Although there are hardly any jobs in my area. I'd only need a part time job to cover my board and save a little bit of money whilst I'm studying. Or I thought maybe I could quit my job now, before October, but volunteer somewhere whilst I look for a new job? Then it wouldn't look so bad in an interview that I quit my job.

So I hung out with this girl a month ago, and we had sex. She said she was on the pill, and I definitely pulled out, but now she says she is pregnant and it's most certainly mine.

She seemed oddly not worried about it at first, and didn't really want to think about it. I knew something was up. She made an appointment with a clinic, but didn't have the money, so I offered to meet her there with it, which she refused and got angry with me when I offered.

She then started saying 'we need to talk about this', and 'you're such an asshole for wanting to do this so quick' and I keep telling her that I want nothing to do with her or this thing inside her on the off chance it is mine, and she doesn't seem to understand that. 

I'm in college, and neither of us are in a situation where this makes remotely any sense. 

I'm begging you Reddit, how do I handle this? I truly don't know this woman, I don't know if she's telling the truth, and I don't know why in the world she would be so adamant about keeping this baby herself. I knew her for about 2 hours, and she just starts crying and getting irrationally angry with me whenever I say we need to get rid of this thing.

The neighbour below with a protruding deck was there when I puked and he hosed it down, my friend told me to just come inside and not say anything but now it seems to be some sort of ordeal and I should have apologized right then to the neighbours.

5 years ago I started hanging out with a couple girls from work. I’ve always been really shy and they wanted to help me become more outgoing. I should have known it was to good to be true. Long story short they hung out with bad and dangerous people and they manipulated me into doing some things I will never forgive myself for. They even so kindly introduced me to a guy that they knew was abusive. We ended up dating for a year before I got the courage to leave him and the ‘friend’ group. 

This is where I get nervous 

One of the girls took racy picture of me on her phone to send to my boyfriend (face included- at the time i was young and naive and didn’t see this was a bad idea. 

We ended up getting into a huge argument and they ruined my reputation in the small city I was living in. I moved just after that ordeal to another city 45 mins away but I can’t get over the constant fear of running into all of them - there is about 6 people in total I never want to see again in my life. 

I have managed to block my feelings and I usually avoid going out in public unless it’s somewhere far. 

Anyways I kept getting missed calls by a number everyday and I didn’t think twice and just texted saying Hey you must have the wrong number stop contacting me. the person wrote back and was like ‘lol’ and i sent a question mark and they said ‘do you know what you just said’ so i said ‘what’ and they send a screen shot of our past convo but it just looked like a regular convo i would have with a former colleague so I wasn’t to worried at that point. So this number continues to call and I answer the call but don’t say anything and the person was like ‘Steph? hello Steph?’ then hung up. It was the girl who ruined my life

So now i’m nervous again because not only is she trying to contact me- she also has all our text messages on her phone from 5 years ago. which is CRAZY- which means she most likely has my nude pictures too

How can I get over this constant fear or my past being exposed? Its been 5 years already but I am to insecure to move on with my life.",27Jul2020,1

1015,"So I made a left turn down a road that was unpopulated except for oncoming traffic. I accelerated past the intersection and didn’t keep watch of my speed. I saw the first sign on the road, which was a roadwork sign and it said 35, so I checked my speedometer which was around 55. I immediately started to slow down, but it was too late. I saw a cop whip around behind me with his lights on. I stopped, he told me to turn into the next neighborhood. I did so, and stopped right in the entrance. He asked if I knew how fast I was going, and I told him that I was sorry I just wasn’t paying attention in that instance. He said he clocked me at 61 in a 35. He got my information and walked back to his police car. He wrote me a ticket, reduced my speed to 49, only 14 over and in the state of GA, that means no points on insurance or my license. I thanked him, he told me where to pay, and I went home. 

My mom asked why I was home so early, so I told her I got a ticket. She was immediately angry and I was really scared to tell her the actual speed, 61, so I flat out lied and told her I was going 49. She’s already installing life360 on my phone and I didn’t want to make the situation any worse... I just wanted to call the number, pay the fine, and that be it, throw it away. But, my mom called my uncle, who is an ex-cop, to see if he can get me out of the ticket. I’m terrified that my uncle will relay the information that I was actually going 61 instead of 49 returning to her, because if it does, my life is absolutely over until I turn 18 or at least until I move out of the house.

I've got a friend who is a bit down since yesterday
He's the kind of guy who watches anime and reads mangas. He doesn't like the other side of the coin though(hentai,manga hentai).

Happened 2 days ago,he looked a bit sad and out of character,asked him what got him so down 
He said while on his phone he got a link to a manga hentai  he thought it was time to give it a shot 

Once done reading ,according to him,he started feeling melancholic and sad.
I asked him for the manga to see what may have affected him so bad

The manga...well..it goes like this a girl(honoka)got into college along with his 2 friends(kotori and Umi). Koto banganged while honk observes in the distance,she gets turned,starts jacking it until a player comes by and gets his bone in her
 shortly after this guy hands over  honk to the ongoing banganging cause he just wanted to get honk's virginity. Honks pleads for help instead gets drugged. Long story shorty she becomes a dick craver whore.
If you wanna check it out, here's the code 308496
It's on nhentai


Now,got to mention that Ricardo(my friend) have honk as his waifu and I think that's the main reason behind his sadness

There are definitely alternatives to moving to London but I think this is my best chance and also would be a good adventure.

1037,"First, I live in Georgia if that affects any guidelines or laws that could affect this situation. 

So, my direct manager received a positive Covid test result this morning. I last saw him on Wednesday and actually took a test Wednesday afternoon for an unrelated event. I received a negative result so I didn’t get it from him directly, but I have since used my manager’s computer and desk. I’m also worried that someone else in the office could have received it from him and spread it to me since Wednesday, especially since the office doesn’t have a mask policy. I use a lot of hand sanitizer and try to be safe, but admittedly I don’t wear a mask in the office.

When my work received the news, they sent everybody home for the day and hired someone to deep clean the entire office. The only direction they gave was that everybody could come back tomorrow, and they would now check temperatures and enforce mask usage. They have no plans to let us work from home, and they didn’t even mention what would happen if we decided we didn’t feel comfortable coming to work. I don’t know if there are any rules about this in Georgia, but it would be helpful to know.

I’m not really sure how to handle this. As of Wednesday, I know that I haven’t had Covid, but I don’t know if I could have received it since then. I feel fine, but that doesn’t mean much.

1038,"Hi everyone. Glad to be a part of this group. I don't know the correct way to phrase all this so please bare with me. So my great grandparents raised me and they were without a doubt two of the kindest people to ever exist. They were full of integrity and honor. They were wise and patient. I miss them terribly. They both died last month, 17 days apart. My grandmother died and i was the only one allowed in with her and the next day from shock my grampa was admitted into the hospice. They don't even know what he died from, the closest they could come up with was the shock of losing his ""beautiful wife"" as he called her, shut down all his major organs. It has been to say the least extremely trying times. 
 
 My grandparents have a son whom I will call Bruce. He has never moved out from his parents house. I am also pretty sure he has an undiagnosed mental disorder. He often will talk to someone who isn't there and he tortured and abused these two people for years. He would constantly try to isolate them from family. When my brother would call down to see if it was a good day to come visit Bruce would tell them that it wasn't a good day and he'd tell and posion my grampas mind saying the reason gram had these fainting spells that they were some how my brothers fault because one time my brother came down and the next day my gram had an episode so my grampa started to believe the over stimulation by my brother coming caused it. When my Aunt and Uncle down the street would come to visit Bruce would stop them at the door and tell them to leave that they didn't want any visitors. There are many more instances such as this. 
  
My grandfather was very steady on his feet and he took a tumble down the stairs one evening. He was 94 years old at the time and he didn't break a bone or anything. When he was in the hospital and he was talking to us he told us that he ""dreamnt"" that someone opened up the door ( Bruce's door was at the top of the stairs ) and kicked him down. He later changed his story. He wanted to stay in the hospital but when we voiced concern about gram being left alone with Bruce he wanted to come home. He had flown headfirst over the railing of the stairs, which to me doesn't make sense of someone just losing their footing because their railing didn't go all the way up the stairs it only covered half and then the rest of the staircase had a wall. 
  
The family wanted to get caregivers in with helping clean gram up because she had dementia hence her fainting spells and grampa at first wanted this. By the time we got back the next day, gramp had said how he had changed his mind on the caregivers and said that he would rather his sister in law next door help clean her. She did a poor job and multiple times gram ended up in the hospital with bladder problems and also a major bleed caused by infection. At the last of it my other grandmother ( their daughter ) took control because she had power of attorney and said if you guys arent going to get caregivers then she needs to go to a home so we made that decision. Covid struck though and she died before that could ever happen, mind you alone because bruce didn't want anyone living in the house and seeing what he was doing.
 
 Many times we had bought them ensure and self care products and they would go ""missing"" my grampa would blame his ""stupid self"" but i went and searched in bruces room and found some evidence that he had thrown things out of theirs that was missing upstairs in his room. 
 
 There was one event that really sticks in my mind. It was right after my grandfathers quadruple bypass surgery. I had been spending the night down there to help him if he needed anything. Grampa had admitted to us that bruce had been going and turning the heat down on him after he turned the heat up and also most of the time refused to put a stick of wood in the fire until it became even too cold for bruce. ANYWAY, this part happened first I guess. I was sleeping in the extra room upstairs and I heard creaking and I heard something walk up to my door and I heard a loud bang on my door like two closed fists and something dragging their nails all the way down to the bottom of the door and stomping downstairs.
  
The next day gram and gramp were sleeping upstairs( they both were very deaf) and my mother and I were sitting quietly in the living room and bruce came roaring down the stairs and started punching the walls and kicking the walls and screaming ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST"" and he stomped all the way down the hall to the basement door and went down the stairs and slammed the door shut as hard as he could, he marched down those stairs and marched back up and ran back up into his bedroom. My mother and I didn't have much of a choice other than to leave. 

 When my grandmother was still at home her daughter ( my gram ) was out there with her when my grampa wasn't home. She was playing hymns for her and playing them not really loud but loud enough for her mother to hear and bruce comes and taps on her shoulder. she turns around and hes got a fist in her face shaking it then he took off and ran upstairs. My gram rushed to the bottom of the stairs and hollared at him to get back down there and he came down and gram said to him "" what is the meaning of this ?! she is my mother too!"" and bruce said to her "" Oh you don't ever have to worry I'd never hurt mom "" 
 
Another time right after grampa went down the stairs, he told my mother he was scared that they would investigate for elder abuse. The second to last time my grandmother came home from one of her bouts in the hospital ( which she was doing so well even with dementia ) we brought her back and sat her in her chair and  I went out to the kitchen and let bruce visit with her. I actually stood at the bottom of the stairs and eavesdropped. He kept telling her that he thought she was gonna die and that she had a stroke and that she probably wouldn't live much longer. He kept telling her that over and over again. which was a trend with him. He'd force both of them to sit in darkness in the evenings. Anyway, I stepped in the room and bruce wiggled away like a little snake and gram grabbed on to me and the absolute fear in her eyes I will never forget and she told me "" You have to get me away from him, no lets go please get me out "" I was absolutey heartbroken because there wasn't anything I could do. The next day when we went out to visit it was like a veil covered her eyes and she had completely disassociated. 
 
One night Gram couldn't settle down for the night which is normal sun downing, my grampa called their daughter out to help get gram settled. She went to go turn a light on and my gram grabbed her by the arm and said no you can't turn a light on, he doesn't like lights. 

 There's a bunch more stuff but anyway, 6 or 7 years ago there was a major change of their will. which is suspicious and grampa had signed off the house to bruce and the property. He made my grandmother ( their daughter ) executor of the estate. In my grampas final days he said he hoped the kids ( my brother and i ) could build a house on the property and we all said we don't think bruce would allow that and he just hung his head and cried. He said "" I hope he does but I don't own a damn thing anymore"" He wanted bruce to come see him before he died but he refused and he didn't even go to their funeral. 
 
 For the past few years we can see in their bank account where large lump sums of money has been withdrawn from the accounts. They never spent any more money than they had to, groceries and power bill but amounts of 5000 has been swindled out of the accounts for some reason. 
 
Bruce is going around telling everyone he is going to sell the property and making up lies about the rest of the family. The one he says about me is that i'm on drugs, which is not true. We live in a very small town and word gets around fast. 
 
I want advice, I want to know what anyone else would do in this situation. This man tortured and abused these two beautiful people in ways that probably I'd never want to know and I can't have him get off scott free from it. I'm not looking for professional advice just haven't told anyone outside my family this and want to know what someone else would do.

Just so everyone knows, while they were living we did try to intervene but they wouldn't allow us. We went to their doctor and voiced our concerns and tried to get them out of there but my grandfather refused to leave the house.",27Jul2020,1

I want to start this by saying I do know how to interview, and am not particularly bad in interviews. HOWEVER, when I get really excited about a job, my skills usually get thrown out the window.

I have an interview over the phone tomorrow afternoon for Reading Corps MN. I want to be as prepared as I can, and hopefully I won’t come off as scrambled. If any of you have had a job in AmeriCorps or Reading Corps, please weigh in.

1044,"In need of some advice at the moment.  So, I (33m) met this guy that I'm starting to really like. I randomly  met him through a couple of my friends at a dinner. My friend  mentioned to me that he was attempting to hopefully hook us up. He also  said that he wasn't sure but he thinks the guy might be talking to  someone else though. I was very attracted to this guy and asked my  friends after the first meeting to set up another dinner where we could  all hang out again. The second meeting happened and it went great. I  offered to drive the guy home after and I worked up the courage to ask  him out to hang out sometime and he said yes. I asked what his situation  was and he said that he's talking to someone out of state but that  because it is long distance, they are not mutually exclusive.

Fast  forward to the date (Saturday night) , and we went to dinner and had a great time.  Afterwards, we got drinks and then went to his place to talk more,. We  had a long conversation and everything went well. I realized he had a  long work day the next day so I said that I felt bad for keeping him up  late so I should go. When we said our goodbyes, I really wanted to kiss  him but I wasn't 100% confident it would be mutual so I decided not to  and we kind of had an awkward handshake and hug. I didn't want to be  that guy that makes an unwanted advance.  It was just really awkward and I feel stupid for the way the night ended.  

We texted briefly Sunday morning, and after I asked a question, he's left me on read ever since and hasn't responded.  I can't help but feel like I said or did something wrong and that it  might be because of that awkward situation when I was leaving last night  at the end of our date. I've only met him and hung out with him three  times but I've really enjoyed the time I've had with him so far and  really want to get to know him more. I want to text/talk to him about the situation but I don't know if that comes off too strong and crazy or not. Any  advice would be appreciated",27Jul2020,1
1045,"I can’t get this thought out of my head. I am an avid traveler/weekend warrior and do what I can as much as I can to go out and see the world. But what I really want to do is extended long term travel. When I say travel I mean dirt bagging it, sleeping in cars and trains and living on $15 a day. Not luxurious travel, I mean true backpacking.

Minor details, I graduated college 2 years ago. Just finished paying my loans and am trying to figure out my next steps as an “adult.”

I haven’t done long term travel yet for obvious reasons like needing the time and money and someone to do it with (I love a travel partner). I have now finally found someone to do it with but since have landed a great full time job that pays well.

I’m worried my parents will be unbelievably disappointed in any decision to quit a good job to travel as it will set me back in life and I’m not even sure if my job would be ok with me leaving for a month or two and coming back as I just started working for them this past February. So I might need to find a new job after... I also feel bad putting that on my employer having barely worked there. But if I give them a half a year heads up that I’m leaving for a month is it that bad? 

I feel like my desire to go on extended travel is really selfish. Even though It’s my biggest dream in life. I want to do it asap because I eventually want to start a family. I feel really limited on the time period in which I can do this. I still live at home saving money for a house or something and literally have zero monetary responsibilities which makes it ideal. I’m just in between major life events and trying to figure it all out. I’m absolutely lost and have nobody to talk to about it. Send help.

Thanks in advance.

1048,"I (31f) have a very difficult relationship with my mom. She left my dad when I was 15 and I stayed at home with him and since then I’ve had a pretty distant relationship with her, only having to deal with her maybe once or twice a month. I recently had a baby so she has inserted herself into my life more because she’s so hyped up on being a grandma. 
Dealing with her so often is quite frankly driving me insane. She is the queen of over sharing and often tells inappropriate stories seemingly at random. She talks about her sex life (past and present) candidly to me as if I’m one of her friends and I hate it. It make me feel so uncomfortable and if I’m being honest a little bit violated. I would never want her to say these things to or in front of my daughter. There are many other things she does and says that bother me, but I would say this is the biggest issue.

I feel like her and I live in two different realities, she doesn’t see anything wrong with the way she behaves. She doesn’t take criticism well at all, no matter how gently it’s delivered, so it’s very hard to tell her when I don’t like something she’s doing. How do I tell her how I feel without starting a fight?  Is it even possible?",27Jul2020,1

1050,"Title. I’m in grade 9. Out of nowhere I’m Really struggling to apply what I’ve been learning in online class (especially math). I’ve never been a genius, but I’m in an extension maths class, and have been for a while. But recently, I’ve been so confused. In math, we do the theory section where we get taught, and take notes, and it all seems fine. But then, when I have to go and answer textbook questions, I just really struggle. Either I over complicate the question, or straight up forget what I’ve been taught minutes before. Overall, I end up approaching the questions like I hadn’t been taught how to approach them. I kind of spiral from here, and now I almost go into every question expecting it to be too hard. Instead of seeing a hard question as the exception, I see it as the rule. I then decide that I’ll just do the question after class as homework, meaning that I end up staying up the night before class struggling just as much and feeling terrible about myself. I’m not sure how much of this is misunderstanding the info, and how much of it is anxiety/mentality.

I know I have the option of talking to my teacher, but I feel like so many of my questions can be so easily answered, and she’ll end up judging me for having so many problems. Also, I feel like, rather than having one or too clear bits of information that I don’t understand, I have like 10 small aspects of a chapter I’m struggling, and I won’t be able to articulate my issue. The class has recently become kinda competitive, and we had a test a month ago that we had to score 90%+ on in order to stay in extension. Somehow, I got a 92. But if I start talking about my problems, I feel like she’s gonna start thinking that I don’t deserve to be in the class anymore, and will remember that next semester when deciding class placements.

Finally, I feel kinda awkward going on a one-on-one call with my teacher to explain the problem (the teacher isn’t creepy or anything, just intimidating), and I won’t properly explain my problems.

Would really love some advice, thanks in advance for any responses. :)",27Jul2020,1
1052,"My mom was on my computer trying to renew her drivers license today, and I guess she saw that my google account was an email she didn't recognize as being mine. When she was finished she sat back in the chair and crossed her arms and said, ""So what's [that email address]?"" And I told her it was an email account, and she said ""Why do you have it?"" And I told her when I create accounts for games/stuff like YouTube, etc. that I use that email instead of my personal email so that my personal email's inbox isn't flooded. Not seeming impressed, she said ""Show me."" And then later she told me its because she thought I was ""doing something I wasn't supposed to"" or ""talking to weird people online"" and made me promise that I wasn't doing either. I'm 18 and I just feel like this kind of stuff is... I don't know, excessive?

My problem is, in the past when she's done this kind of stuff, I've told her that I want my privacy respected and she immediately says, ""That means you're hiding something from me. Sit down and show me everything on your phone right now or I'll go through it myself."" If i tell her that again, she's going to react the same way. Hell, she's so fucking paranoid that she thinks I'm doing drugs behind her back (which I'm not, one day last year I was watching my kid nephew who I swear doesn't know what soap is and his BO was so strong that I opened my bedroom window and sat by it. When my mom walked in and saw me by the open window she started screaming at me asking if I was smoking and immediately started looking for the weed/cigarettes that I didn't and have never had) and at one point for a few years she regularly went through my phone and she got mad at me when I deleted text conversations and demanded that I tell her what I was supposedly hiding. If I didn't tell her anything (because I wasn't hiding anything, i should be free to delete texts as i please ffs) she'd ground me and take my phone, saying ""I know you're lying to me.""

I'm starting driving school soon and trying to get my license as soon as I can, because until then my mom won't let me get a job, and until I have the money to pay for my own cell phone I know I'm not going to have any privacy here.

I'd be obsessed with embroidery, I watched a lot of videos and really diving into it but then after 3 weeks I was bored with it. I moved on to playing Animal Crossing for a month, and then got bored with it. My passion has been photography and it's been consistent (Thank God) enough to be my career-ish for the past two years, but now I'm kind of burnt out as a portrait photographer and I want to start photographing babies, even though I haven't even mastered portrait photographer– at least enough to be a full-time photographer. But you can't just jump into newborn photography so now I'm taking online classes on newborn photography, but I'm slowly getting bored with it and want to go back to portrait photography... and if I just keep going back and forth like this, I feel like I will never be a legit photographer with a focus!

How the hell do I stick to one thing and not get burnt out?! I'm so tired of going back and forth. Now I'm obsessed with sewing videos after learning how to use a sewing machine once.

My love life isn't stable...never learned to have one like that i'm always jumping from girl to girl without even getting a more deep connection and i am worringly  getting used to it, maybe that is because of past experiences. 
The thing is that for example, used to text a lot but memes, random videos, etc, trying to keep the conversations intresting but once we got confident they told me how they find that annoying.....so try to think about it a lot and got into the conclusion that probs taking a more relax approach from now on will be for the best.
Last friday meet with a girl (we been talking for 10 days or so via phone daily) and when we finally meet it was only for 30 minutes (had a job interview and we both wanted to meet anyways), the day after i talk to her a little bit because she was with some friends on a trip and didnt want to bother....of course she didnt like that and told me how she was expecting a better talk from my side, she felt i didnt care enough. Said some things that i could phrase better like ""you didnt even talk"", ""call her out to create a scene"" and ""that i wasn't feeling like writing 24/7 when she was out travelling for one month"".......then she asked me what i wanted and personally wasnt sure but we kind of talk things through.
Fast forward, when i get in confidence now, im used to almost not touch the phone is more healthy (i think) and today (even we texted all day about random stuff) she told like ""its so hard to keep up with you"", ""you are so stiff""....of course i take it like ""you are showing no interest"" and pisses me off a little, and now she tells me like ""you are so negative and im so horny"" told her to watch some porn because im not in the mood.

Basically, they’re a family of 7; divorced mom, my gf, her sister, her two brothers, and two little kids. My gf and her mom are illegal immigrants, so help is very limited. 

One of the kids is a 15 year old kid who deals drugs. He’s a massive wannabe gangster. He disrespects everyone in his family, and in some occasions beats my girlfriend and her mom. He does a lot of shit, sneaks out, brings strangers in their apartment, he took their car and destroyed it as an attempt of “running away”.

The problem is that my girlfriend’s mom doesn’t have any balls to leave that kid out on the street to die. Whatever he does, she forgives him and brings him back into the house, even though he beats her, even though he does his hood rat shit in front of his little brothers, even though he sneaks out anyway to go smoke weed.

I told her to move out and live with a friend, but she doesn’t listen.

The Person selling said he been having this pendant for 3 years but I felt this story was off because how does he have this pendant for this long and for some random reason he decided to put up for sale on Facebook market place a day after I lost it?

1069,"So basically the title. I did a 23 &amp; Me test about 3 years ago or so. I wanted to know more about my ancestry because I am not close with who I thought was my bio dad. So let’s start from the beginning. 

My supposed bio dad was a shitty human being, domestic violence issues tried to kill my mother and kidnap me. Just horrible all around. He messed up his relationship with me multiple times and we’re not on speaking terms. 

When I was about 12 or 13 my mother confessed to me that she wasn’t entirely sure he was my father. She told me there was a 50/50 chance between him and another guy, we’ll call him Kyle. She ended up setting up a meeting with Kyle we went out to lunch or something. It was so beyond awkward, like “Hey this sorta kinda might be your kid” I was young, and just dismissed it. He also ended up getting back together with his wife not long after we met and if I remember right that complicated things somehow. Personally I never thought I looked much like either, and I have always tried to be independent and not need a father figure. 

Anyways, fast forward to this weekend. My sister is visiting from out of state, my brother came by to see her. We’re all sitting in the kitchen talking about our ancestry for some reason. I bring up my 23&amp;Me test to show them what mine looks like. We’re all half siblings, so we’re talking about how they want to doing one and then and comparing. I go to show them the cool things on mine like the relative finder. As we’re scrolling down I see a new name listed, my heart stops. This new person, listed as a second cousin, has the same last name as Kyle. I kinda freeze to try and process this. I kinda blurt out to my sister, she’s oldest and knew about Kyle, we go stalk him on Facebook. He has an abnormal last name, the chances of it being listed are extremely small. According to google only 160 people have this last name.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hit him up out of the blue and be like “Yo I am pretty sure I’m your kid after all” I don’t want anything from him, I don’t know what I would get from reaching out to him.

I have ADHD and it’s been hard for me these days to sit down and read the drivers manual. So I’ve downloaded an app that has a bunch of practice tests, and been going over them but can’t seem to retain any info. I don’t know what to do. 

It feels like I know nothing, but I really want to pass this test, is there any where else I can learn what you learn in drivers ed classes? Or am I screwed?",27Jul2020,1
1076,"In October last year I was at a party and got blackout drunk to the point where i couldnt walk or talk and threw up lots (I know I shouldn't have done this and I promise you I did not intend to end up like this). At one point after I had done maybe 15-20 shots someone carried me into a bedroom, helped me to throw up and left me to rest on the bed. After some time (not sure how long but I think around an hour) a guy came into the room and asked if it was okay if his friend came and rested on the bed with me. I dont remember what I said. His friend was drunk but no where near as drunk as me, he could still talk and walk fine and didnt throw up at all that night. The next thing I remember is making out with this boy. I dont remember anything else but apparently someone came in after 20minutes and shouted at him to get off me and that I was too drunk for anything. The boy I made out with kept telling everyone after that he was so close to having sex with me, before he was disturbed. I only remember making out with him but I dont know if we did anything else. I only learnt the details about him wanting to have sex with me that night recently. Thinking back on the whole situation always makes me feel super uncomfortable and regretful. Is what he did wrong/kind of sexual assault seeing as I was blacked out and had been passed our for an hour before hand. Am i overthinking this idk. The next time I saw the boy a couple months later he kept trying to get with me and was kind of agressive but I kept avoidinh him. He even came up to me when i was talking to my friends and said ""I'll count down from 10 and if you don't give me a sign I'm gone"" - I said nothing and then he stormed off and apparently got really angry and broke something outside? The fact that he's so aggressive makes me even more paranoid about that night. What are your thoughts?",27Jul2020,1
1077,"I work at a winery in Oregon, and am coming up on my 1 year mark. A coworker of mine started working a month or two after me, so they are coming up on their one year as well.

I’ve always been full time and the coworker just recently went to full time.

I found out my coworker got offered a big raise + commission, and I got offered a very small raise and no commission.

I have 3x the experience in our field, our total sale numbers are about the same (mine is a little higher, but I work more). The only different is she is a little more type A, and takes everything VERY serious, where I am younger &amp; a little more laid back, although in practice, I take my job just as serious.

Should I be furious about this? How do I approach my employer and go about this?",27Jul2020,1
1078,"Warning, this is going to be a bit of a long one. I wasn't sure if this was more r/DysfunctionalFamily or r/siblingsfromhell or something. I'm just exhausted and my mental health is starting to slip some and I could really use some advice.

As background, my issue is mostly with my sister, but also her friends who became our roommates. We live in a condo our father owns, and after graduation two of her friends were in bad living situations and she asked me if it was okay for them to join us as roommates. Now I was suppose to have been gone, but thanks to COVID, I was waiting a bit longer for my job to start, but we managed to make it all work out.

At first it was a blessing. My sister is a slob. And I mean dirty dishes piled high, literally food from months ago sitting in a pan waiting to be cleaned, boxes of her crap taking up the living room. Some of the closests were dangerous to open for fear of a landslide. Her friends made her more accountable, and for a time it was nice. There was good food, laughter, conversation. 

My sister and I were on good terms for the most part. She would invite me to hang out with her friends, and I invited her to my D&amp;D group and wow guild, and stood up for her when her friends made her cry. 

Well small sister fights had broken out with us before. We did solve it. In the beginning we would talk it out and it would be quick. But it started to get a bit worse. The dishwasher was bad. For years we loaded plastic on the bottom just fine. I even remember her coming to me and telling me we could do it because it would be fine. Now she says some stuff gets damaged. I think it was my fault, as to clean some of the food encrusted plates she leaves I put it on high temp wash. So I stop that part. She gets on to me later about how she told me we weren't loading plastic anymore. There wasn't a discussion just a command. I tell her that I stopped the high temp wash and that we've always done it like this. She gets mad, it gets into an argument and I move to leave as it was just not productive. She tries following me to my room. So I pull a page from her own book. I tell her ""Don't follow me to my room to argue, you hated it when I did it to you."" And closed the door. I did try and approach her later to have a calmer discussion about the dishwasher because it was something that bothered her and it deserved to be talked about when she calmed down. But it went about as well as you would expect.

For a while things settled. Though with her increasingly using a more annoyed, short, and rude tone to address me. I try and push it off. But I have lived with her for years. I finally begin to take my advice my dad gave me two Christmases ago. He told me I can't let her play my emotions like that. And I have to stand up for myself. So I started to tell her I didn't like her tone. And sometimes she would address it, realizing she was being rude without noticing it.

Of course this isn't the part that sparked everything. This was me just setting the stage. I have a tick where I repeat things I say at times. I get excited and it happens. My sister used to rudely rip me down when I did but I spoke with her about how it was bad for my mental health, and I listen to her repeat herself and respect the things she needs for mental health and she tried better. But still sometimes lets me know in a rude tone so it does get me down. Roommate 1, my sister, and I were in the living room talking about how would the cat react if she was human sized to boxes. I remembered a fun event in our childhood where we had a fridge brought and played with the box for weeks. So I walk over and say ""Hey remember when we lived at &lt;x&gt; and had the fridge delivered and got to play with that big box! I bet she would be like we were, we loved it!"" And she turned to me and stared me down, and I do not joke about this, in the snidest tone told me: ""You know it's rude when you ask me if I remember something and I don't."" Now, she does have some problems remembering our childhood. But I phrase things like that since she always can remember to tell me I told something before, but not that she is repeating herself so I left the question like that so she could stop me and maybe not be rude and tell the story herself. So I do call her on that. Telling her that I phrased it because of how she treats me. She continues with ""I told you to just say ""Back when X"" not ""Remember back when X"" and I of course told her that no, she didn't actually ever say that to me. I got a halfhearted apology about that. And I stared her down and in the same tone she's given me I told her ""And I really do not appreciate the terrible attitude you've been giving me these last few weeks."" And went to my room.

If you're still with me we get to the part where I need advice on. I no longer feel comfortable leaving my room. It has become blatantly obvious my sister is now ignoring me. First day or so I went along with it. And the next day I try and be nice in general to everyone. I offer popsicles like I always do, I chat a little. Just acting normal. I even tried to offer an olive branch (like I realize I always do. I always have to be the one to reach out to her first when she hurts me) and ask my sister if the grass she was watering was new cat grass. Still ignoring me. Okay. Spoke with a roommate if they think everything is okay because the home seems tense and I got a ""it's fine"" from them.

Next day. Turns out it was the party for our dog leaving. I was downstairs with friends (we took all COVID precautions, I was just not feeling the tension in the home and wanted to be away for a bit with people who cared about me). I come back up and I'm friendly since I've hung out with these people before. My sister leaves to drop the dog off and I chat with them some since they are right outside my door and I was getting food. It felt... okay? But like there was a bit of gauze between us that was never there. 

Today the house was of course silent whenever I leave my room to get some food, and I can hear laughter and such. Doors that were never closed before are closed and people locking themselves up. I feel like a pariah in my own home. I have a start date and am going to move soon, but I can't till I sell 2 items that I can't take with me and am still waiting on a few documents to arrive. 

So I guess I am asking for what to do? Should I swallow my self worth and try and apologize for making her feel bad in front of her friends, even though all I was doing was defending myself? Should I ignore her and everyone more or less, just be cordial until I can leave? (I am looking to buy a house or rent so it might take time to leave). Our father is the landlord, should I reach out to him and talk with him about the hostile environment my sister has created? He knows she has been incredibly hurtful to me in the past and seen it happen. And that she has a strong need to control... and in the past she has told me she hurts me because it was easy... The only thing I can honestly think I truly did to her to hurt her, outside of standing up for myself, is I talked about how I felt with some friends online in my room. Maybe she heard me and how I felt, and how I was angry at her. It wasn't like I was screaming it. My own mental health is starting to slip some and all I want to do is sleep away. Which I can't help but find ironic because she's extorting the house for her own mental health, so I know she knows that is important. (If you say a self depreciating joke you must put a quarter in the jar. Was never talked about, just left my room one day and was strong armed into being forced to participate.)

So please... I am so tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. What is the best course for me to take because they all feel like swallowing a bitter pill. Either in self worth or in time.

**TL;DR:** My sister and I got into a fight where I told her I didn't appreciate how her attitude was to me these last few weeks. And now the home feels tense and hostile to me and I don't know what to do to solve it or handle it till I can move out for my job.",27Jul2020,1

Maybe it's just psychological. Does anybody have tips for improving your desire to eat? Little baby steps to get myself back up to speed?

1083,"This guy (I believe at the time was like 13 or 14) did this repeatedly for about 2 years. No one in my family knew about it until about 9 years ago when a bunch of stuff happened and it came out. Now at 25 he’s been constantly trying to reach out to me and my family via social media and trying to add us as a friend.

This guy now has two daughters and that’s extremely concerning to me.... granted he might not be doing anything to them (which I really hope not) but idk. My mom asked if I wanted to report it but what happened to me was so many years ago idk if anything would actually be done and I don’t want to cause issues if he isn’t doing anything to his daughters but it just the though of what if he is I feel like I should speak up about his past.

1085,"So there's this guy who has liked me for a few years. About four years ago he confessed his feelings and i rejected him and then like a month later he started talking to me and he said that he doesn't feel that way anymore. So we talked more and we became friends. We started hanging out a lot and we were really good friends. Then one year ago he asked me out again and said that he still feels the same way and he just can't get rid of these feelings. I rejected him again. For the last one year he keeps asking me out again and again and we haven't seen each other for the whole year. I thought he will give it up if he doesn't see me anymore. But he keeps texting me although i kept telling him that i don't feel that way. But he's gotten so much worse and i really started getting worried. He has bipolar disorder and i always helped him with his mental illness and he talked to me all the time but now that we were not friends anymore he's just soo much worse than ever. He has no one. His parents are divorced and his dad is a drug addict and his mom just doesn't give a shit. Last week he commited suicide but his brother found him and he survived. A few days ago he just kept texting me telling me that he wants to kill himself and that he's empty inside and that he has nothing lose anymore and these kinda things. Today he texted me again and he didn't ask me out. He just said ""lemme be your closest friend and just maybe one day we'll go on a date"" and he asked me to give him a chance. I finally said ok i let you be my closest friend and he's just way too happy rn and i'm glad he's happy but i know that he's not my closest friend and he will never be and we also will never go on a date.

I'm basically agreeing to everything he says bc i know i can't be honest with him. I told him all kinds of things before and tried everything for the past year but nothing makes him better and now with me saying that he's my closest friend he's really happy.

1086,"So here we go. After about a year of being comfortable with my sexuality, i decided to come out to a select few people, including friends and family. For the most part, it went really well, and everyone was so supportive. Except one of my best friends told a few others, who told others, and well you get the idea. The people im talking about now are my teammates I go training with for context. During training the topic of my sexuality is brought up by 2 specific teammates, and though i was aware that they knew, because i thought I was the one who originally came out to them, it was still a bit weird. 

Anyways, after a while these 2 people in question were saying things like ""imagine how funny it would be if you went to conversion therapy"", and ""why cant gay people just be normal?"". I told them how they were completely in the wrong but they denied it and said it was a few jokes. Later, I find out I never came out to them, because my best friend already told them, and every other teammate, causing me to slap him as hard as i could. (Keep in mind im holding back a whole breakdown now). 

This continued for a while (the jokes and me finding out who told who etc) until it was time to leave, which is when i started crying. Now these guys are saying they're sorry, but in reality they're just mad they were called out. (Also side note: When i told my mom she deadass said ""well maybe you shouldn't have told them..""). Anyways now I have the dilemma: Should I cut all ties with them and just let the situation go, or actually tell my coach about the jokes and people I trusted telling other people, and possibly have them kicked off the team? I'm kinda rooting for option b, mainly cause im feeling petty and i feel its the only way they'll actually learn what they did  was wrong, but i want to ask for advice from a non biased group just in case im just overwhelmed with emotions on this and wont be able to make the right call.

1087,"Hi there, I went out with a girl and it was wonderful. After she pursued me for a little bit we saw each other twice and she went on a little weekend vacation in between the two dates. On the second date, we talked for a long long time, ate dinner watched a movie, chilled. We got along so well, and slept together that night and then again in the morning. We spoke about seeing each other again and made some different plans.

Everything seemed to be great, but the the next night I texted her asking something ( Just casually to keep the connection going without putting too much pressure on her) and I still haven't heard back. That was two weeks ago. Then today I texted her again just to say what's up. I thought maybe she might have been busy or something. That was 8 hours ago, and still no response. I have no idea what went wrong. I didn't want to be too pushy. Is there anything I'm not getting? Could I have handled this better in someway?

I was really surprised not to hear back from her because everything seemed like it went great. It's strange to not hear anything from someone after you're intimate. I should also mention that this is a friend of friends who I'm certain to see again eventually in some other context, so it's not like a tinder date. Also she's really sweet and has an incredible family so I didn't expect any fishy business. I feel like I've done something bad because her friends are more distant with me on social media, and like - what would it take for a great person to just cut contact like that? I worry she felt violated when we slept together - though nothing in her behaviour suggested that she might feel that way when we were together. I hope she feels okay and wish she would let me know. Any help, observations, or advice with this situation would be wonderful! Thank you. :)",27Jul2020,1
1088,Long story short when me and my bf first started dating we were in an open/(kinda)poly relationship. I fell head over heels for him and got really attached pretty quickly and didn’t seek out other romantic or sexual partners after the first 6 months of being together whereas he was pretty polyamorous and had multiple partners. We moved in together and he kept seeing other people and started doing things I REALLY didn’t like (like having loud sex with others while I was home). He has mental health issues and ended up having a mental breakdown 2 years ago and went to the hospital. When he got out of the hospital I asked if we could close our relationship and he said yes. So now our relationship has been “closed” since but recently he’s been mentioning how he’s not sexually fulfilled bcuz he’s into some extreme kinks that I do not want to participate in (like hardcore bdsm). He said he thinks he deserves another chance in an open relationship where he can have casual hookups once or twice a month to fulfill his kinky needs. He also promised if we open up he wouldn’t try to develop a romantic relationship with anyone bcuz that’s where I start to get jealous... He wants me to research open relationships and think about it. He also said technically it wouldn’t effect my relationship to him because “nothing between us changes”. What do you guys think? I want to be open minded and find a way for both of us to be happy. He had always been poly before meeting me sooo... I dunno what to do!,27Jul2020,1

Since then I've been in foster care, I've grown a lot of attachments to people there only to never see them again, it hurts just as much as when someone dies.

There was this guy I've been friends with for a little while, a while ago he said he thinks he's getting feelings for me but it freaked me out so we didn't talk about it.

1098,"Hello, to anyone that spends their precious time reading this rant, thank you - so much. I'm a 14yo guy in the UK,
ok enough introduction let me get straight to the point.

**I'm a worthless fucking failure.**

Especially since school closed - I was quite lazy then (leaving homework to the last day, not revising for exams) but I've been going in a bad downward spiral since. _really bad._

I missed nearly all of the online classes/homework, and instead watched an endless stream of YouTube videos, even ones I wouldn't want to watch, but did so to pass the time and forget about the increasingly overwhelming amount of missed work. Also played way too fucking much video games, again - even when I didn't want to, but needed to pass time. 

Now it's actual school break I'm so anxious/worried of what the consequences will be when I'm back at school.
I now still watch YouTube videos all day, although I don't play as much games because sometimes I can't even be bothered to go to my computer. 

This spiral into the darkness that is procrastination has not only made me neglect my academic life, but also my self care - simple things like showering / brushing my teeth that I don't feel like doing most of the time - and my hobbies - I'm a pianist and I have barely touched my piano (which is very expensive, so I feel like I let my parents down by not using it, even though they don't know), I don't have an urge to learn new things like before either. 

I don't think I've done anything remotely productive recently which makes me feel so useless. I'm never truly happy, because I know all the time I'm letting myself down.

1099,"I'll give you guys some backstory: my family is from a large beach city (not at all rural), but there wasn't really big opportunities so my parents moved to the big city we live in right now, which is the biggest city in our country.

Things were fine, then covid happened and my parent's company literally lost pretty much everything. We have money to support ourselves until October, if nothing else comes up.

Question 1: my parents will only be able to retire in 4 years, maybe 5. Right now the only thing they have it's their house, which is worth a decent amount of money. We can move back to our hometown and buy an apartment and invest the other half for a living for 4 years. I'll obviously try to get a job. It might take a while, cause there are less opportunities there. Or we could stay in the big city and just hope for the best, cause there is a job situation that MIGHT happen to my parent's company and if it does succeed, we'd have jobs for another 4 years, which would be great cause that's when they'll be able to retire. So, what do you guys think?

Also....
I've been dating an awesome guy in a long distance relationship and this year we'll be together for 10 years, and he actually lives in my hometown. We see each other all the time, it's not that far away. But he normally comes to see me, the truth is that I don't really know my hometown, I'll only be there for holidays or to see him in long weekends.

Right now I'm almost 27, finished a prestigious college and worked on amazing places. It's a very crowded city, competition is insane. I'm so scared of leaving this city cause we all have been told that big opportunities only happen in big cities. In this case is kinda real, it's a messed up country and the whole population eventually tries to move to this city... Cause for real, it's easier to find jobs here. 

But now I'm confused. I suffered abuse from friends in school, and they really messed up my mind. I build up a bad coping mechanism that lead me to believe that I'd avenge myself if I'd get an amazing college degree, amazing jobs and a glamorous life. It... Turns out I don't have the ""thing"" that makes people successful here (honestly, the best opportunities are for rich, influential people and I'm absolutely a nobody, or at least for less emotional people and I'm really shy, even though I'm very professional, good at my career and people really like to work with me, I know that this isn't enough to be successful). 

Question 2: Do I really want to spend my whole life trying to get that glamorous life, working 10h a day, stuck in the traffic for 3h daily, trying to impress people that abused me 10 years ago and probably don't even remember I exist? Or, if I settle down, will I just be trashing my hella expensive college degree that my parents and I worked so hard for me to get?",27Jul2020,1
1100,"I'm a college student (21F), and this past fall going into my junior year I scored this really nice job at a law firm downtown near my university. They took a chance on me because I had never done administrative work, but somehow I got this job. I had a blast. It was great hours, really chill work, and I even got a free lunch on friday with the firm's luncheon order. Basically the best job I've had in my entire life.

Then COVID happened. 

I went on spring break and then suddenly the last day of my vacation is when the whole world shut down. I came home from my trip and hung out doing classes online at home. The law firm moved to working remotely and my supervisor emailed me and the two other college students that I worked with that our positions were on hold because we did a lot of physical work at the office and that he wasn't sure yet what we would be able to do from home. Then later, mid April, he emailed us all letting us know that our positions were ending for the time being. They were supposed to run through the end of the school year and then had a possibility of some work for the summer, but with COVID they didn't need us. I emailed end of June to check in with my supervisor explaining my availability and how I'd like to come in if they needed any help and he just thanked me for emailing him and said it was good to know and that he would stay in touch or feel free to reach out later. 

1) I'm not sure if he means that I can feel free to reach out later or that if he feel's free to reach out later he will. 

2) I want to email because I'm trying to plan my finances for the fall and would like to know if I have a shot at coming back, but I just don't know how to put it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My best job ever ended early due to covid. I emailed in June looking to see if they needed help for the summer but my old boss said that he would stay in touch or to feel free to reach out later. I want to reach out again to ask about fall but I feel kind of pushy. I really care about this job and really want to come back.",27Jul2020,1
1101,"Lots to unpack here. I have been best friends with a girl, we will call her Britney, for over 10 years now. We are both in our mid twenties. When we were both 20 years old, one day she broke down sobbing and told me that when she was around 11, her then-16 year old male cousin sexually abused her on and off for about a year. We will call him Josh. He eventually stopped this behavior on his own and they never spoke of it, and she was just coming to terms with it herself, hence why she told me. The details were heartbreaking.

Britney finally told her mother and when it came out to the rest of the family, she and her mother were basically shunned from that side for ""destroying her family"". Fucked up, right? Britney eventually confronted Josh about it; she sent him a text out of nowhere about 2-3 years ago now, saying that they ""needed to talk about something that was long overdue"". Britney told me that Josh apologized and took full accountability for everything, and did not deny anything.

Anyways, I started a new job today. One of my new coworkers looked really familiar. Looked him up on Facebook and it's Josh. At our company, we work with primarily adults but there are some minors that we work with, as well. I do not know what to do, I am horrified. This happened well over 10 years ago and Josh now has a daughter of his own, she is probably around age 5. I do not know what to do about this, or how I am supposed to react. I am going to have to regularly see and have contact with this person who sexually abused my best friend as a CHILD, not to even mention the fact that they are cousins. I do not intend on telling anyone that we work with - Britney is now an adult and can decide for herself how she wants to proceed with things. I'm just very upset by the whole situation.",27Jul2020,1
1102,"So I should start this off by saying that my orthodontist has been advising to get my wisdom teeth pulled out since around September last year, but my mum kept forgetting to go for a consultation and I got tired of constantly reminding her (I wasn't 18 at the time so I was scared of booking a consultation when my mum wasn't ready). Cut to January, I asked my mum when I'd be getting my wisdom teeth pulled out and she says 'soon'. Alright cool. I don't bring it up again until late May when my gums start to feel tender and start aching a little bit. I tell my mum and we go for the consultation with who we were referred to by my orthodontist. 

So we scheduled the appointment to this Friday. I got my x-ray done last Friday and in the x-ray my wisdom teeth are growing full-on sideways and they're just touching on the teeth that's growing normally there. My orthodontist said I should get them taken out as soon as possible so that it doesn't get overcrowded. 

So I'm meant to get covid-tested today but when I come down, my dad says that it's best to wait a few more weeks since the cases are rising in my state and the virus is 'everywhere' according to him. Would it be best to wait it out? Since I don't know how long the 'few weeks' is going to be. My dad is constantly like this, thinking he knows what's best and everything. I could've gotten it taken out much earlier if he hadn't popped up the idea to go see normal dentists to get it taken out just because he'd gotten it done before. So if there are any orthodontists out there, any advice would help a lot.",27Jul2020,2

Hopefully the is the right subreddit. I just got my wisdom teeth removed and my lower lip and chin and tounge seem to all be numb.

1104,"Well I used to be a kid who did very well in school, I had overall good grades with near perfect attendance. At thew end of 7th grade during the summer I was informed by my parents that I would start my 8th grade year a little late due to not having some of the materials that were needed for that year(That was fine with me). But as time went on, when I would ask about school I was told that I would juts start the next school year. That was discouraging but there was nothing I could do about It. When the time came for the next school year, I was told again that I would be starting late but I never did. Now it has been three years since I have been to school and I was supposed to be a JR this year but there is no way that I will be able to get out in my correct grade or graduate on time.

1114,"There's a lot to unpack here and I guess I'm just looking for outside advice on how I should handle the way I'm feeling.  I'm the middle child in my household. I recently finished an undergraduate degree and moved back home due to COVID.  I'll be starting a masters degree this coming fall but will be remaining at home as it will be taking place online.  My older and younger siblings, however, have already or will be moving away for their respective post secondary educations, leaving me the only one left at home with my parents. 

Now I love my parents and I couldn't ask for a more supportive family. We have our issues but it's a relatively functional relationship. They sacrifice a lot for my siblings and I and I could never thank them enough for it. Problem is, lately I've been feeling more overwhelmed for a few reasons:

Being the only one left in the house, I'm now getting all the attention. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but as the middle child and an introvert who grew up sorta skirting around on the sidelines, I've become quite comfortable and independent, handling my own problems and keeping to myself most of the time. Now if I come home from work feeling a bit off or sick, I get smothered in care and attention and my parents trying to find ways to make me feel better, when really I just want to be left alone because I feel like shit. I don't want to always be saying ""I'm just tired,"" because sometimes I am and sometimes I'm not but I want to be able to deal with those things on my own, like I did when I was living by myself. 

Secondly, the pressure. There's this pressure, almost guilt, that's been building somewhat deep down in me. My parents have given up a lot to put me and my siblings through expensive university programs so we can get a good education. They make okay money but I know they have a fair bit of debt. My mom is in her 50s and my dad in his 60s. I know my dad doesn't really have money for retirement and often makes jokes about how the day he retires in the day he drops dead on the factory floor. Now I know this is a whole different can of worms, but it bothers me. My mom makes little jokes here and there about how she's relying on me to keep her from living in a box someday. I know this is playful but every time she says it, it just adds a little bit to that pressure. Like there's too much invested in me to fail, like I can't not succeed because I wouldn't just be letting myself down, but I would be letting them down.  I obviously want to get a good job and make good money with my education but I'm scared that if I don't, the guilt will kill me if I'm not able to give something back to my parents as they get older. 

These things have been bothering me more lately since I've been home all the time due to the pandemic.  Maybe it's just because I don't really see anyone else or do anything but work and go biking in my free time but I've been feeling more on edge lately. I feel irritable more often. Little things start to piss me off too easily. Sounds and clattering and people moving around all the time irritate me. Always being asked about my day or what my plans are or how things are going is eating away at me. I understand that I come from a privileged home and many people would consider themselves lucky to have that kind of support, but because of the way I've grown up to this point, it just all feels like too much sometimes. 

I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for here. I'm sure some people are going to recommend therapy and that's something I've done before and could consider again. I suppose I'm just looking for little ways that could help manage my anxieties throughout the day, or some mechanisms for dealing with this stress that I'm feeling without lashing out at my family or being cold to them when really I just want to be left alone.

1117,"Hey reddit, this is gonna be a long one. It's midnight here and I just need to ramble and get advice. Not sure if this is the right sub but here goes...

Roughly 3 years ago I had a friend group of 8, and I was kinda the defacto leader. I'm not the leader kinda person, but out of everyone it just kinda ended up that way

Between then and now 3 of those people have left, 1 to move school and 2 intentionally. I don't mind they left, I'm still on good terms with both, they felt they didn't fit into the group and left. I can respect their decisions

Now the group is getting smaller, I'll make it more convenient by naming people (not their real names of course). So it's me, Jack, Liam, Lucas and Ben (I just googled baby names ok don't judge me)

I'm fairly good friends with Ben, but Ben REALLY doesn't like Liam. This isn't something that's just ""oh just talk it out"", they both hate each other, so Ben has stopped putting up with Liam's shit and now doesn't sit with us and barely interacts online

I've always had a complicated relationship with Liam, I've never really liked him, but pretend to because it's the easy thing to do. I don't HATE him, but I don't like him either. And I can't just say that he should piss off because we're at a small school and there is literally no other people Liam would like

Lucas is fine. Barely anything to talk about. He's very similar to me, so we often DM each other if something fucking idiotic happens

Jack isn't the best with people, but he's always been a nice person. He often acts in anti-social ways (not not interacting, google what anti-social means), and that's perpetuated some things...

We've all had a discord server that we don't include Liam in. I know it sounds mean, but it's the easiest way to play games and interact without him being... him. I admit in hindsight, I shouldn't have done this. This was a shitty thing to do, I was just avoiding conflict

So one day out of the blue, I'd just had a stressful day and Jack invites Liam to our discord server. Completely unannounced. I quickly banned him and just typed ""no"". as you can imagine, this escalated, quite alot...

There was a massive argument, Jack and Liam were hurling insults left and right, it was a shitty time... Eventually, me and Liam sorted it out in DMs respectfully. Afterwards I thought, why did Jack do that? He could've just asked me in DMs to invite Liam and avoided all the shittery

Over quarantine, things have been getting better with Liam. he said he would change, and he did. We're on alot better terms now, he still does things that piss me off, but pretty much everyone slightly pisses off someone. That being said, talking and interacting with Liam can definitely be exhausting. He's not very self-sufficient, rarely doing anything on his own accord

That being said, the situation with Jack is getting worse. Half the time he's really nice, next normal conversations turn into arguments for no reason, randomly spamming and leaving servers out of the blue

Recently, Jack and Liam invited some random people from the internet to our private discord server (there's alot of personal shit on there), and me and Lucas were complaining about how stupid it was

All of it is stressful. This is all stressful. I'm fucking 16, I don't want to deal with all this shit. Friends are all about giving and taking, and I can't remember the last time I ever took something. I play games with them and it's like I'm only there so they can have fun, so Liam can talk my head in with shit I don't care about, or for Jack to go in a humph and stop talking

I don't know what to do. I genuinely don't. I want new friends, but I don't know where to look. I wanna be able to have fun again, find life fun, not a chore.

Imma close this out with what lucas sent to me recently, it pretty much mirrors how I feel rn

One of her friends says she is thick. I get asked what I care about in a girl(something like that) I say that I care about both personality and body.

I say 'ok cool, where do you guys live?'
they say the county they're from and that they are 30 minutes away from the beach 
and I say I'm an hour away from the beach and we go here on weekends.

I might've fucked up here because I said that it would be a bit long distance relationship. 

I don't know what I was saying honestly.

One of the girls asked if I'm russian because she heard my accent and I tell them that my parents are Russian. She excitedly tells me she's Russian too and here friend is Polish. 
I tell them I'm from the Czech Republic.

I started to get cold cause I've been swimming for a while (bc the water was cold even though it was very hot outside) and asked for the girl's contact. 
Her friends told me her Snapchat. 

This is where I'm getting sad and think I've been pranked.

I get out of the water and add her snap and go lay in the sand to warm up.
30 min later I go back to where I, my parents and my sister are at and I notice that the girls, including the one that said I'm cute are all at their spot and on their phones.

So later i go check my phone again and see that she still hadn't accepted my request. I am about to go home so I walk up to the them and ask the two of them whether their friend has seen my request. (idk why the one that liked me wasn't there anymore) 

They ignored me....... REALLY?
All they did was mumble and say something like 'yea' or 'no'. 

Do you know what I think is weird? The fact that they were on Snapchat when I asked them the question. 
I think one of them declined the request on their friends phone while she wasn't looking and she added me on Snapchat. 
While i was still at the beach, I messaged the other girl who added me and texted 'hey, is this you?' 
And she texted 'yea' 

She didn't text anything after that",27Jul2020,1

I know legally I should ask her first if she’s okay with it but
 a.) we’ve not talked in so long I think it’s a bit weird 
b.) I don’t want to bring back old/bad memories for her
c.) I don’t think she’ll care if I’ll use it or even remember the conversation

5 years ago I started hanging out with a couple girls from work. I’ve always been really shy and they wanted to help me become more outgoing. I should have known it was to good to be true. Long story short they hung out with bad and dangerous people and they manipulated me into doing some things I will never forgive myself for. They even so kindly introduced me to a guy that they knew was abusive. We ended up dating for a year before I got the courage to leave him and the ‘friend’ group. 

This is where I get nervous 

One of the girls took racy picture of me on her phone to send to my boyfriend (face included- at the time i was young and naive and didn’t see this was a bad idea. 

We ended up getting into a huge argument and they ruined my reputation in the small city I was living in. I moved just after that ordeal to another city 45 mins away but I can’t get over the constant fear of running into all of them - there is about 6 people in total I never want to see again in my life. 

I have managed to block my feelings and I usually avoid going out in public unless it’s somewhere far. 

Anyways I kept getting missed calls by a number everyday and I didn’t think twice and just texted saying Hey you must have the wrong number stop contacting me. the person wrote back and was like ‘lol’ and i sent a question mark and they said ‘do you know what you just said’ so i said ‘what’ and they send a screen shot of our past convo but it just looked like a regular convo i would have with a former colleague so I wasn’t to worried at that point. So this number continues to call and I answer the call but don’t say anything and the person was like ‘Steph? hello Steph?’ then hung up. It was the girl who ruined my life

So now i’m nervous again because not only is she trying to contact me- she also has all our text messages on her phone from 5 years ago. which is CRAZY- which means she most likely has my nude pictures too

How can I get over this constant fear or my past being exposed? Its been 5 years already but I am to insecure to move on with my life.",27Jul2020,1
1129,"So first I should probably say that I'm using an alt account I made a while back for this because I don't want this on my main account for obvious reasons.  


This started a few moths ago, I could tell that for whatever reason I was going into a bad mental state and was getting worse fast. Now I've never really had many IRL friends because I live in the middle of nowhere so I get most social interaction online but I did have a good online friend group, said friend group could tell that something was off from a mixture of my tone and what I said apparently and they were trying to help me before I was even aware that they were.  


Fast forward to this month I've hit the worse mental state of my life, I've completely given up on everything and grown really quiet, the only thing that helped at all was talking to my friends about what was going on which I heavily regret now. Just recently 2/3 of them have completely given up on me and cut contact because I'm not in a situation where therapy is an option and I've been controlled by anxiety so I can't talk to many people about it even if I wanted to.  


I don't really know what to do at this point, the few friends I had have completely left me and I'm living most days with very little interaction with anyone, the most interaction I can get is with my parents even though they're not much help since they pretty much ignore that there's a problem. I guess they don't see anything wrong with being 19 and having nowhere to really go in life or something. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad people, they're just unaware.

1130,"So for context: My best friend (I’ll call him R) has been dating this girl for the past 9 months. She absolutely hates me because R and me gave each other hickeys in THE SEVENTH GRADE and because her mom was upset with her so her mom said he was probably cheating on her with me (this happened in December). Anytime he mentions me she gets pissed off. I have never done anything to this girl and R would say the same thing. It’s gotten to the point where she’s implied that he’ll have to choose between the two of us. 

So, now what’s happening:
She has started guilt tripping R over the smallest things. Anytime he’s out with me, she’s blowing up his phone the entire time asking if he’s cheating on me. R and me have both explained to her that our relationship is purely sibling like and the thought of us having any type of romantic attraction makes us want to gag. She’s become slightly manipulative over stuff and it’s just been getting worse. 
I’ve told him (and a lot of our friends) repeatedly that they need to fix this or they need to breakup. 

What happened today: R is trans (afab; he/him). He decided to try out a new name because the one he used before made him extremely uncomfortable. She’s told him before that if he changed his name she would continue calling him by the one that made him uncomfortable and has made fun of him for the name changes in the past. As you can probably guess, she’s not being supportive over the name change because “her mom dated someone with the same name”. 

I’m so over all of this and i don’t know how else to help him. Any advice would be appreciated. 

I told R I would be making this post so this is for the both of us.",27Jul2020,1

1132,"Early on in our friendship, I found out that my friend had depression and attempted suicide in the past. Since then, I tried to mentally prepare myself for the day I'd suddenly get a message from him right before he would attempt again.

For the the first half of our friendship, it was always in the back of my mind. Looking back at it now, I probably wouldn't be prepared no matter what I did or knew

However, he's gotten better. Heck, he even stopped cutting a long while ago. Though he still has times where his depression really hits hard but compared to back then, he has a far better support group between me, his boyfriend and our others friends.

Last night, I realized I wanted to tell him how much him surviving to this point means to me. How happy I am seeing him get better over the years.

But I don't wanna say the wrong things. I don't wanna accidentally make it about me. I really want to drill in that him being alive now has been nothing but a good thing to both me, him and the people he's met.

Stupid title I know but I started giggling about it with a friend. 

So here’s what I’m struggling with currently. I (f21) want to be a funeral director. I feel a calling to it but also intimidated by it. I worry about coming off as some uncaring sells person. I know that people say your whole life will be around your career as a funeral director and to not expect good pay or to ever have a holiday with your family. I’m truthfully very ok with all of that. Money I of course worry about because student loans but plan on never having kids so maybe that’ll help lol. 

I also feel a calling to be a paralegal because research, organization, legal stuff which I love but I also just can’t shake the feeling like hey funeral directing is what I should be doing. I want to be able to help family’s during the worst time of their lives. I’ve never felt weird about death or like it’s a taboo. I’m in school for funeral directing. I feel like it’s a much more fulfilling career and that I can do much more. I’ve taken classes that weren’t part of the curriculum or seen as very necessary because I want to be the best I can be to help and make something of my career. I want to help change the death industry. 

I guess I just need advice and maybe someone to tell me what their career is like. Like maybe I’m just being too anxious because I know that I’m getting closer and closer to deciding on what I should do. I just can’t shake the feeling like this is what I should be doing with my life but also just so anxious. Sorry if this sounds super ranty and all over the place.",27Jul2020,1

First I just blamed it on the fact we were in the car and I was uncomfortable as all hell (small car) but now we recently just tried in a normal environment and still nothing when I need it to be.

1138,"Hi, like probably thousands of you, you've had an upstairs neighbor before who was less than quiet. 

The woman above me ( I know because of the short walking stride) is loud. Like flat footed flint-stone feet loud. That doesn't really bother me because, that's how she was born and I get that. What really bothers me is every day she does a workout in the evening at 6pm. Like a jumping Richard Simmons type workout. I'm talking my ceiling vibrates, I feel the vibrations even when I put in headphones. I even try to find the heaviest music to drown out the sound. Apparently 90's Marilyn Manson isn't heavy enough.

I get it, we are in a COVID world right now and she might not wanna go to the gym, or go out running. I feel that, it's palpable. But as a courteous person I've always tried to walk quiet in my apartment.

I want to settle things on peaceful terms, I've never mentioned it to management. Like I've thought about writing a nice note and leaving it in between her door.

1140,"Hello all,

I'm stuck in a dilemma, unfortunately. Let me give you guys some background information. I'm 31F, still at home with my mother right now. I went to college out of state in 2006 and lived on my own for a while, but due to several mental health issues (many suicide attempts/hospital stints/alcoholism) I eventually ended up back at my mother's. I've been here for several years, and while it's been a long time, I'm finally in a place where I'm not drinking, not smoking anything, I'm working part-time and I receive disability (for now). I'm doing 100% better than I was.

&amp;#x200B;

I got accepted to a two year accelerated nursing program (dream job) for this Fall. My mom has agreed to let me stay for another two years, but I'm not sure I can stay here. Our relationship is awful tbh, in my opinion it is extremely toxic. I do not enjoy being around her, I would not consider her my friends, nor would I say I like her. She hasn't really done anything explicitly, and quite frankly to those on the outside she is a great mom. Unfortunately, We've had some awful experiences together because of my past poor mental health, but the kicker is that I feel she is one of my abusers. I have a memory of when I was 9 years old where I feel she did something inappropriate to me. I haven't confronted her about it, and I don't think it was \*explicitly\* inappropriate, but it's something that I think about regularly and makes me anxious and not wanting to be around her. I haven't confronted her about it because she'll most likely deny it happened (she denied the sexual abuse I suffered for two decades), and I'm afraid it will be too awkward. I've spoken to a therapist about it, who told me I need to speak to my mother about it, but I just cannot bring myself to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I thought I was all set for school this Fall, but our relationship has gotten so bad to the point where a) I don't feel she is respecting my boundaries b) I just stay in my room constantly if she is home and c) I am reconsidering going to school and moving out instead - unfortunately my job does not pay enough where I can do both, because obviously that would be my first choice.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to make a decision soon because I need to get most of my deposit for school back. I know sacrificing my mental health probably isn't worth it, but I keep saying to myself if I can stick it out for two years it will be worth it. I will make more money in the long term and be able to move out and \*stay\* out. On the other hand, I regularly feel just awful in this house. I have to grow up and realize that I'm not always going to make my parents proud. The disappointment and bullying that I experience when I tell her something she doesn't like makes me feel like shit. I know for some this would be a no-brainer, but I have no clue when I would be able to go to school again. I'd have to take some classes over if I don't go in the fall and it will take me much longer, I reckon. It will take me a while to move out as well (to my own fault, I have no savings rn and some debt).

1145,"Looking down at myself for things that happened a year ago

I’m 17 now. A year ago when I was 16 I was in this on and off relationship with a girl and I cheated on her. Like not physically, but I started talking to someone else when I was in the relationship with her and eventually dumped her for that person. I was an idiot, I was very confused that summer when this happened. It was a guy I started talking to. I was happy with her but when I started getting all this attention from this guy, I lost all self control. I was very sexually confused and I had urges, I couldn’t help but go for the opportunity! I was a dick regardless, I know I couldn’t have been easy to deal with. I was always all over the place. 
Then after being in a relationship with this guy for about two months, I started to lose interest. I don’t know why exactly, but I went back to her... maybe it’s because I was ashamed of being in that relationship and wasn’t fully okay with it at the time. But I wasn’t thinking and I kept playing around with her feelings on and off... it was always the same shit with me. 

I broke up with her again a second time and that was kind of the end for us. I think she’s disliked me for time now but I think she also recently found out about how I cheated, and she probably hates me twice as much. 

I’m looking back at this a year later, and I feel like such an idiot. I would’ve never dealt with myself if I was her. And now I just look at myself as a band person. I would never do this shit again. I mean I think it’s safe to say I have a lot more control over my urges and emotions now than I did at that point in my life. But I now she probably looks at me as a shitty person with a bunch of problems and somehow that really bothers me. Because whenever I think about who I was last year, I feel like shit... I feel like a disloyal asshole. I don’t know",27Jul2020,1
1146,"this is probably gonna get dark so at your own risk, the background: i’m a 20 year old going into my 3rd year of college pretty soon. i’m studying biomedical engineering. i was the top of my class in high school as well as my first two years at college. i was notably good at maths and sciences but i did a lot besides academics such as sports, traditional art forms, and music. i enjoy these hobbies as hobbies but couldn’t see myself being successful with them professionally so everyone pushed me to go to school for something math related. they told me my intelligence can’t be wasted so i had to find something to study. i didn’t know what else to do. i picked biomedical engineering because i think prosthetics and artificial transplants are cool and interesting but i still can’t see myself as an engineer. i can manage the academics but the past two years at college haven’t been great. i know most people don’t enjoy school but i already feel tired and worked down and stressed all of the time. now even when i don’t have work to do. it has contributed to a lot of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. lately this has been getting worse as we approach a new academic year and i’ve just signed a new wave of loan documents. 

i’ve recently found a passion for cooking and tattoos. i’ve turned these into hobbies but they make me wish i’d taken a different route with my life. the obvious answer would be to drop out and finally make decisions for myself and find something that i can be happy about doing long term and something that actually makes me want to live. but i’m already hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt and that weight falls on my parents who also can’t afford it if i don’t pay it when i graduate. but i don’t want to graduate. i was 16/17 when i was coerced into signing away my financial life to this college and i feel like i’m only digging myself further in. i’ll have to go to grad school after as well which feels impossible in so many ways. i’m only going to keep digging myself into this further if i don’t get out but i can’t pay the loans i already have without the degree. even then it’s going to be tough. i dont know how i’ll afford going to grad school and paying back my undergraduate loans when academics takes such a toll on me mentally and physically i can’t really work much during the school year. i do tutor a few hours a week but it’s not nearly enough. 

it feels too late to start over but i’m living with so much sadness and regret i don’t think i can go on with it. i know i can’t keep doing this two more years just to graduate with my BA then to have to keep doing more?! i don’t want to live the next 40 years or so working 40+ hours a week hoping for a retirement i’ll probably not even get to (my body isn’t doing so hot medically at 20. my friends and i don’t particularly expect me to have a very long life) but even if i do make it to retirement what’s there to enjoy if i’m broken down and tired. i’m grasping for straws. my options feel like stay miserable and make things worse for myself or just end it all.
