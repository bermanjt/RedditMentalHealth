I'm 18, graduated from high school, and full time community college student (all online, and at break until our spring semester which is Febuary).

2,"Well, to start off. I smoke myself. And quite a bit might I add. I’m not gonna lie, I know I’m a fucken fool. 
I’ve been smoking weed now for two years. Started in college, even have a nicotine habit. I feel that shit biting at my health and appearance, I know this shit fucks you. Weed especially, keeps you cloudy. I know its the popular consensus now that weed is a harmless plant. But this has abuse potentials. It plays with your dopamine levels, your reward centers. Irregardless of that, if you have something that alters your perception of reality, rooted into your very routine, as a permanent habit that follows you each day, you are bound to alter your path in life.
These are chemicals bombarding your brain every single day, in the form of heated smoke grating at your alveoli and staining your teeth on the way in. 
I don’t care how you can call that “good for you”

Which is exactly what my younger brother did.
Now, I won’t lie, I wasn’t exactly a good brother for this kid. 3 years younger than me, and we just couldn’t get along as kids. So in my late teens, I decided I didn’t want to have that type of relationship in adulthood. By this point though, he no longer respected me (if he did at all really). 

We started getting along once we started giving each other space (I got to have my own room. We shared a room up until 18...)
And once I got to college (20), I wanted to deepen that bond by making sure nothing stays hidden between us. I told him I was suicidal at points and had a joint with him and my friends. I thought that way he would get to understand me better, and maybe we could see eye to eye.

fast forward, I’m 22.

THIS GUY JUST ADMIT TO ME THAT HE GOT HIGH EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS.

Holy shit dude. I know I have a smoking issue. I know its an issue. Its a “don’t throw rocks when you live in a glass house” kind of situation.

We were sharing a joint just now. He gets super ecstatic and hyper when we get high, the “if he gets anymore loud, they’ll probably kick us out” kind.

Man, I’m terrified. What have I done.
Should I fess up to our parents ?

Man, this shit can’t continue.
I’m a total hypocrite, I know but , he ..... he doesn’t see this as a problem !

He’s doubling down. We live with our mom. Christ. I’m paranoid.

5,"I’m in the USA. 

So I work for a small business who recently has encouraged me to sign up for an IRA. Basically 3% of my check gets put into a little retirement fund and the business actually matches that 3%. Pretty tight. 

Well it’s a fuck ton of paper work. And I just haven’t gotten around to it because I work like a dog and naturally when I get home I wanna be a lazy POS. Sue me. 

Keep in mind, I did not ask for this. It was offered and they handed me papers. Said I’d get to it eventually because honestly I could care less about retirement. Probably gonna die before I’m able anyways. 

Back on topic, I get a text from my boss saying “No paper work no check!”
I thought she was joking and thought nothing of it. 

Welp, normally our checks are left in our lockers each Monday. Mine wasn’t there. Okay. Must’ve forgot. Come back today for my shift, I get told that I need to hand that paper work in before I get my check. Even the owners son, who has a key to the office, I asked him “can I just get my check?” And he’s like “You’re putting me in a tough spot here.”

So in short my check is being held hostage over some IRA papers. 

My best guess as to why they’re being so aggressive about it is because it’s tax deductible for them. But what the fuck. I’m making 12 bucks an hour barely scraping by and they’re acting like that?

I’m fuming but I’d like to make sure I’m justified.",18Dec2020,1
6,"Hi Reddit, I need help with this one...

My husband (M24) and I (F24) got married last year. We had a wedding registry with lots of options and asked people to buy off the registry, but just like most weddings that doesn't always happen. But here's the issue: my husband's grandparents bought us a painting. They've always been into art and have many, very expensive pieces of art in their home. I think maybe they assumed that we're young and must be into modern art... but this painting is.... truly unique... in the nicest way possible. To give a descriptor, it's black, white, rainbow, and glitter on foam-core, and has Lisa Frank vibes but with hearts and flowers instead of kitties and puppies. It is **bold** to say the least, and our style is more minimalist. The only artwork we have is things that are sentimental to us - that we bought together on travels I'm not here to be an art critic - everyone has their own tastes and preferences - that's what is beautiful about art! But unfortunately, this art is just not our taste at all. Not only is it visually quite loud, this thing is *massive*. We live in a small apartment, and it would take up half of our living room wall if we hung it up. 

(If you need a link for examples, here's the artist [here](https://www.parkwestgallery.com/artist/romero-britto/) )

But the thing is... it's *really* expensive. Apparently it's by one of those artists that mainly sells on cruise ships, and I know it cost several thousand dollars (USD). What's more - my husband's grandparents are wonderful people, and even though this painting is far from our tastes, I know they intended this gift as truly heartfelt and generous. But what are we supposed to do with this??

Last year, we lived abroad, so we had an excuse to not take it with us. It's been hanging up at my in-law's house since the wedding (they have a large house with lots of wall space). But now we're back in the States and finally have our own place. My husband innocently sent them pictures of our apartment, and I think they realized that the painting isn't hanging up, and now they're really upset.

Reddit, my question for you is - what do we do?? We have a tiny apartment and no space for any massive painting, let alone hanging up something that is just the exact opposite of our taste. We love his grandparents and want to make them happy, but how can we do that? Do we just hang it up once, and send them a picture? This artwork won't even fit in our closet if we took it down. I don't think we can tell them we don't like it, because what good can come of that - but I also don't want to lie to them? It's not like they can return it. And I don't think we could sell it, because they wanted us to have *collectible* art. I just... please help. Any advice is appreciated, we have no idea what to do with this thing.",18Dec2020,13
7,"An old childhood friend came over to get a kitten my dad was giving away. Her and her friend were wearing masks but I didn’t even notice until half way through the interaction. 

My dads house was also trashed to the max with car parts and recycling, my sisters room was disgusting because she never cleans it. I think they thought that it was my place because they both looked super uncomfortable, were really quiet, and seemed to try and get out of there as quick as possible. I want to apologize to her for the mess and let her know i dont live there and hope they didn’t feel grossed out (because her friend really looked like he wanted to puke while looking around).

17,"So. I live in a houseshare. A new housemate has moved in. We've bonded well already. Particularly because she opened up to me really quickly about how she's transitioning and the affects on her now ex wife, children etc. I found her story really compelling and this prompted me to open up to. There is a significant age difference between us (I'm early 20's and she's late 50's). We've bonded over me teaching her about makeup etc and her discovery that she's also bisexual. 

She's suggested we go in her car tomorrow to buy snacks, drinks etc for a get together in the lounge with the house but I'm nervous about being alone with her..

I am very untrusting of people, particularly men though as I've been sexually assaulted on more then one occasion.

18,"So this all happened 7 months ago now. I’m 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that’s only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I’m home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says “Concussion”. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It’s post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the “Normal” concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I’m still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn’t resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn’t. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn’t the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn’t help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it’s almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high.


Symptoms Include :

Face gets all tight 
Neck gets really stiff 
 Temples get tight 
Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. 
Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. 
Itchy around eyes 
Things get worse when I sit down 
Itching inside head. 
Middle of back moving as I lay against anything 

My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

24,"I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for 3 months. Early in our relationship, yes, but the feeling I have for her is indescribable. I’m not saying that “she’s the one” but that based on my previous experience with woman, the feeling I have with her cannot be quantified. CONTEXT: I’m 23 and she’s 20. We both go to university together, she’s an international and I’m a native. Her family is, let’s just say, are political and economic leaders of earth (sounds fake I know I really couldn’t comprehend it at first too but please just go with it) We are intertwined in a way that excites and scares me at the same time. Part of me wants to continue down my path and the other part wants to follow this girl and never look back (I could go on but hopefully you understand my feelings) 

The issues: firstly, I can’t see a future with her. No I don’t mean I don’t dream about it. I mean that she will either 1) realise how much better than me she &amp; 2) decide to move away 
, she can literally do anything ranging from Harvard MBA, internship in Too tier IB or even just take over her families conglomerate (yes a conglomerate) and she just won’t want to be in a long distance relationship. 3) her parents would not be comfortable with me. They would help arrange better suitors with far better offers.

This all scares me. 

Part of me thinks that I should end it sooner rather than later. I can’t compete at this level. I am a no one. She’s mad to like me I mean I don’t even like me, how could she??

They were never married so they never felt the need to take legal action for custody and all that. I lived with my mom and spent the weekends with my dad and when I was 8 it switched. Except as time went by i really only saw my mom every other weekend and stopped spending nights at her house. 

Since the pandemic started my dad basically cut all of our family off from coming to our house, our us going to theirs. The only time we see our family is through the window when they drop stuff off for my grandma on our porch. When things started to look better (at least where I live) around the summer and going into fall. My dad let me go places every once in a while with masks and social distancing of course. But since the cases are rising again I can't go anywhere. Not even my mom's house. My mom is constantly calling my dad dramatic, and that she wants to see her kids. My dad won't let us go to her house.

My mother and sister insisted on throwing me a baby shower even though I felt like it was a little much since my children are close together. A couple of months ago we compromised to a “sprinkle” so it would just be the necessities.

I haven’t let the fear of COVID completely run my life, but my husband and I are very cautious. Last week when I went to the doctor to check on the baby, the doctor spoke with me about COVID. She said that the numbers in our area are increasing and that they are seeing more pregnant women being admitted into ICU.

My mother works for a large chain store, so she says she doesn’t see the point in worrying. My sister isn’t very cautious either. My husband and I pretty much just work and come home. Our child goes to daycare. I mentioned to my mother today about how we were going to have to be extra cautious over the holidays and she acted like it was ridiculous.

Since talking to the doctor my anxiety about it is skyrocketing. I honestly kind of want to just call off the sprinkle even though it’s next month.

32,"I (F, 28) really struggle with setting limits in relationships. I frequently end up in situations where people I just met or am not that close to are telling me about their problems in detail, involving me in parts of their life i DON’T want to be involved with, and projecting feelings of extreme , inappropriate closeness onto me, when I’m really just being myself. Or, they think we are very very very close friends after a conversation, when we are absolutely not that close. I just interacted with them the way i interact with anyone, and they made assumptions and were hurt later on.  


I am an extrovert and I like to talk about deep topics and i think that is part of the problem, but I have those conversations with everyone. It doesn’t mean I’m super close to someone or have signed up to become their confidant long term.  I think it’s good to talk about things, but i don’t want peoples baggage and I don’t want to keep hurting people by giving them the false impression that I am something to them that I’m not, and have no intention of being. I NEED to get a handle on the mannerisms I have that invite this kind of thing. But I don’t know what to do, practically, to prevent these situations. It’s not intuitive for me to be cold or to turn down the warmth in a situation. It is very hard for me to not respond when somebody signals that they need help (i know).   


How do I be less inviting and a little colder, in a practical, step by step sense? I’m really not sure how to do it. I need ways to end conversations, create distance from people I don’t want to be close with, and send general “I’m not your friend and definitely your therapist” vibes?

My city is heavily ridden with COVID. We are NOT a large city at all, but our rising case numbers hit the #1 chart last week. It’s pretty ridiculous so I haven’t been able to see my family much because they’ve been having to quarantine - same with friends and all of my friends kind of suck. My best friend moved 11 hours away. 

I have a job - I’m a newly tattoo artist and whole business boomed months ago, it’s slowed down due to Christmas savings and the pandemic. I feel bad that I can’t really “work” much due to COVID and keeping myself and the baby safe at all times. 

We have a cat and a kitten, and my large dog. It’s so cold to go out and even then, I’m afraid to catch a cold as I was sick with a stomach virus a few weeks ago. I’m (non-highly) allergic to our cats and along with seasonal allergies, I’m sometimes dieing all day, even after taking Benadryl. 

My boyfriend really sucks at keeping the cat litter box clean and even then, I can’t touch it. Sometimes it gets bad that our new kitten will track her waste throughout the house because there’s no room in the litter box for her to potty. I don’t yell at him much, because I know my boyfriend is tired and he works on his feet all day to provide for us, when I can barely help. He even provided giving me money to go buy our family some Christmas presents (which I used my own to buy them as well). 

So when I’m done cleaning, I have no artistic ideas, or just nothing. I don’t know what to do with myself. His family lives 13 hours away and I get sad because I don’t get to see them that much anymore but they call every other week to check on me since we’ll all be technically family soon next year.

No, I don’t fucking care if there’s run on sentences, I’m just trying to get this shit off my chest and get help. Yes, I know I’m a whiny little annoying ass bitch, you don’t have to remind me.)
 
I don’t want to go into details or tell my whole life story because we will be here all god damn day and I don’t want that, you don’t want that, no one fucking wants that. 

Just a short background information. My parents are split up (something wild, right?), I’ve been through mental and emotional abuse my entire life (not like “mY pArEnTs tOlD mE nO wAhhHh, I mean they took their anger out on me, the anger they had for each other. They would use me to get at each other because I was the youngest and the only they had to do child support for.), my parents are 20 years apart, I’m the youngest out of 5 children (only one of them is my full sister, who is 9 years older than me. The rest are 20-30+ plus years older than me), and I live with my single mother who literally does have a job because I don’t fucking know.

I’ve always had depression really bad, so bad in fact I started having suicidal thoughts at the age 11. Before I would use the quote “I’ll be 18 soon and this will all be over! I’ll never see anyone of them again! I just have x amount of days/months/years and it will all be over!” But now, I can’t seem to even be excited to be 18 in coming up August of next year. I would normally be like “I’ve come this far through all this bullshit, I just have x amount of days, I can get through it” but I don’t know if I can. I’m literally losing my god damn mind. I stay in my room 22 hours a day in the dark to stay away from my mom. Anytime I’m around my mom we fight, we fight about the stupidest shit. Oh! Forgot to fucking empty the dishwasher the moment you woke up? Guess you’re about to be screamed at for the next twenty minutes about everything you’ve done wrong in your entire life and I’m gonna guilt trip you by saying “where did I go wrong” or my personal favorite “am I a horrible mother? Tell me, tell me where I went wrong as a horrible mother.” My mom use to be my rock because of how horrible my dad treated me when I was alone with him but now she’s just as bad as him.

Recently since the two weeks before thanksgiving my mental health has hit the lowest it has been in a long time. I’ve been getting so stressed and upset to the point I have developed tourettes like symptoms. (My family has running problem with tourettes, my own full sister has it.) It started with my head randomly jerking to my arms being thrown in the air to my body literally randomly curling into itself violently. I only do it though when I’m very stressed, depressed, or frustrated. Thankfully my mom has took me to the hospital to get help but She hasn’t been a help to me personally. (If that makes sense?). She still yells at me random giving times, anytime I do something she doesn’t like she screams “something is wrong with you, something is mentally wrong with you, what the fuck is wrong with you.” But here’s the real kicker guys, you’re gonna fucking love it. She knows something is wrong with me! I’ve told her many times that I need professional help, that I randomly cry at random giving times, that I go into panic mode when people yell at me, that I avoid any mirrors in my house like the black plegue because I hate myself, that I literally can’t take care of myself. Know what she’s says? You got five seconds to guess- did you guess she tells me that if I get out of my room that I would feel better? That no one in the family knows depression like her/ no one has depression like her and that all I need is a job and I’ll feel better? If you guess that then you’re tonight’s lucky winner ding ding ding! You’re prize you ask? You get to read this shitstory! 

Anytime I ask my mom for professional help it turns into a full on argument and leads me to have an depressive episode. I’m losing my beautiful curls because of how I don’t take care of myself, I’ve gained weight, I don’t fucking shave, I don’t even leave my room because I can’t get myself to care enough about myself. I want to care but something inside me just... stops me from caring. Why care if no one else cares about me? Speaking of job, I can’t get a job from my now health problems and I also can’t get a job because I don’t have a car! (All of my siblings got a car from my dad but me because I don’t “come around” and the only reason I don’t come around anymore because he literally won’t let me. It’s another story for another time. Long story short, he never wanted me in life but for some reason now he wants me to be around him and gets mad because I won’t drop everything in my life to be with a man who use to scream in my face and tell me he doesn’t want to be my dad anymore because my mom got a new bf) I live in a tiny town that doesn’t have jobs anywhere near my home so it’s hard to find a job that I can get to WITHOUT A CAR. I also don’t even know how I’ll do it because she doesn’t let me walk around town for some reason. 

Just right fucking now in the middle of this post my mom was pressuring me to clean my room. (My room isn’t ever truly dirty- it’s just I might have a few things on my floor like a few paint brushes, makeup, or I don’t fucking know, air. She has ocd and if things are right and perfect she flips tf out on me.) She would keep saying “you have an hour, you have 30 minutes, you got 10 minutes” and she will go through EVERYTHING. Even my underwear drawer to see if I am hiding shit from her. She pulls shit out of my drawers and shelves and tell me where MY STUFF should go In MY ROOM. (If it’s not obvious I’m biracial with a white mom, I have of course a lot of biracial product for my hair and skin in my room because it’s a little reminder and idk motivation to take care of myself) she pulled Beauty products out of my drawers to put them in the bathroom or her room saying “you shouldn’t even do your hair, makeup, etc in your room you should do it in the bathroom like everyone else (everyone is literally her, it’s only me and her in this house. Of course beside her bf) God my hands are shaking just from my tics wanting to come back. I keep crying frustration tears to the point I’ll make myself sick.

Speaking of frustrated tears this message is brought to you by my frustration/ stress tears and wack ass emotions, thank-you. (Im super fucking annoying, you don’t have to tell me I already know.)

I cry so much from stress and frustration I give myself intense headaches. Just this week about my whole health thing I’ve been crying for hours straight from all of this. I don’t feel happy anymore. I can’t even tell you the last time I truly felt happy. I don’t have a desire to even talk to my friends, friends that would have my back to the day I die. I’ve lost the desire to do things I love like art or just listening to music. 

I’ve had a passion for art since I could fucking write. No literally, I really have. It has always been a go-to thing to do when I’m upset or stressed but now. I literally can’t have any motivation to do a simple thing like draw a dumbass character from a show I watched at 3 am when I was five and have no clue what the name of it is, and that scares me. It scares me I have no motivation to do the things I truly truly love. Even when I started to not care for myself and stopped taking care of myself I always loved drawing. Now, it seems like a chore to just pick up a pen or pencil. I can’t even get myself to sing the musicals I’ve come to love. Acting was another thing I truly loved. It was a moment I didn’t have to worry about anyone yelling at me, I didn’t have to worry about being a disappointment, I didn’t have to worry about if I’m pretty enough, or I didn’t have to worry about who cares what they think about me. I’m playing a character, whatever the audience thinks of me isn’t me, it’s a character. That I don’t have to be me, that I can step out of my body and step into a new body, a new personality that people love. Yet I have no love for it anymore. I don’t have love for it no more because it’s boring or I have lost interest but I just can’t love it. I don’t have the desire to love it and I’m so scared. I’m scared I’ll truly lose to these feeling, these mind crushing feelings. That I’ll give into the things my mind wants me to do. I use to be addicted to nicotine at one point of time. It was a way to lose weight, a way to forget about problems, and it didn’t help that the flavors it came it tasted good! Luckily I was able to drop the liking to it very quickly because I did acting, the use of nicotine effected my acting abilities so I stopped but now.. I have nothing holding me back to start back up.

Fucking hell, I feel like some spoiled brat crying about mommy and daddy issues. People are fucking DYING in this world and I am crying about fucking nothing. That all of this could be solved by- “shut the fuck up cry baby, grow up. Life sucks” I know life sucks, life sucks fat sweaty ass cheeks and it always will. If life didn’t fucking suck people wouldn’t complain on the internet like me to complete strangers. 

God I feel awful, I have never felt this awful. I don’t have anyone to even express my feelings to because they tell me “oh you’re just a teen, it will stop when you’re not a teen” or “you’re just a crybaby, suck it up” or even “oh so you’re a doctor, you know what’s good for you. You think you need help, really?”. My family doesn’t take mental health serious at all. (more background information, out of 28 people of my close family -which is all girls expect 4 of them- 17 of them have depression. Most of them take medicine for it bUT NOT MY MOM. guess it’s some iM nOt lIkE oThER gIRls type shit. My mom has depression as well but refuses to get help or medication, and since she doesn’t need it, neither do I! Of course, in her eyes she thinks that.) I just don’t know how to get help. I don’t know how to get myself out of this, I feel so fucking stuck. I don’t want to feel this way for the rest of my life. I don’t want to cry in the middle of a fucking deli because her wack ass emotions decides to take over and make her cry. I have to put up this stupid ass annoying personality that I fucking hate so much because if I acted like myself, act the way I truly feel people would think I’m a smart ass. 

I don’t know what to do. Is there I don’t know anyway I could start taking steps in the right directions to get help? Or even steps in the right directions to get my mental health better? I don’t even think anyone would ever see this but hey, if it means I might get help then I’m willing to try almost anything.",18Dec2020,2
42,"Long story short, I work with an ex's family member.

This is worsening my depression and anxiety, especially because he is brought up often. I also need to work more as currently I only work 10 hours a week due to covid precautions. (I could talk to the owner about this, but this is a small company and honestly I really don't want to work there any more than I currently do because being there triggers the heck out of my depression. I've cried at work more times than I can count.)

My only issue is that they have been so nice to me. When my family and I got covid they gave us some food and $450 in gift cards so that we could buy more food as well, and this was a month ago. I made some goodies after I came to work, and gave them a collective thank you note. I know how to quit, resignation letter, two week's notice, etc.

But... How do I tell them? I don't want them to think that I am ungrateful for everything they have done. I want to be out of there by February.",18Dec2020,1
45,"So me (21F) and a “friend” (26M) met studying abroad a couple of years ago and have been friends since. We’ve been hooking up since we met and stopped for awhile when he got a gf. He just recently got out of that relationship so has been hitting me up more, and usually it’s fine but recently I feel like he’s just completely using me, and i’m not even really a friend anymore. He never makes an effort to hang out with me or see me outside of sex. And when we meet to hook up he’ll flake without even saying anything. The other day he texted me about being in town and wanting to meet up and I said yeah, then he texted me the night of and didn’t bring up us meeting at all.

I help others with their work (not considered helping, answering it for them). They don't even try to understand the subject. I do not want to be a cocky, but I consider myself smart.

50,"She was my best friend for over 5 years and I have been there for her at her lowest points and she has been there for me. Then my former friend came along. He was an absolute asshole to me and just treated me like a doormat and I stupidly defended him. I had enough and during 8th grade, I just said “Fuck this,” and stopped being friends with him. Ever since then, she would almost always take his side on everything but would do it really discreetly. She was different, which really hurt because after I stopped being friends with that guy, I lost a lot of “friends” and I was pretty lonely, I started out 8th grade with over 20+ friends to only 2 great friends, which I still keep in contact with. We went to high school, I found more great friends, she started smoking weed and vaping, which I gotta stay away from due to my shitty asthma, she is friends with benefits with a gangbanger, she stopped talking to me and literally only contacts me out of the blue and even so, we can’t hold a conversation anymore. Did I forget to mention that she dropped one of my good friends because my good friend was concerned that my best friend would get hurt for being with that gangbanger, and she flipped out and told her to fuck off and they never spoke again. She hasn’t outrightly done anything to hurt me, but I just can’t deal with this anymore. 

TL:DR: Best friend changed pretty badly and I don’t know what to do because I can’t do anything.

51,"Hi, I’m (30F) having trouble having healthy relationships with men. This really affects me on an emotional level, so I’m looking for advice, please.

So, I’m scared of men. I’m scared of being brutally raped and murdered by one. I’m scared of talking to men because I think they might harm me.Sometimes I get mad at them in the view of the potential for them to be abusive, so I lash out at them, unfortunately.And of course I know that not all men are like this.

So I guess it all started when I was sexually abused as a child by my uncle but I won’t go into detail here.

Then when I was a kid, a boy put his arm around me and I instinctively yanked it off.Later, when I became older, I realized that he didn’t mean any harm. I still see him out and about to this day. And he’s kind to me, which I appreciate.

And then there’s my conservative upbringing.

I wasn’t even allowed to play with boys in the playground, and when I was caught doing that, I was scolded and beaten.I wasn’t allowed to associate with males. Not even to have them as friends. I wasn’t allowed to have a boyfriend, because it was against Islam.When I told my mom I had a crush on a boy when I was a young girl, she totally freaked out on me, so I learned to never tell her about boys again.And then with my dad, he’s super conservative. He told me that he would kick me out of his home if I was caught talking to a man, even at my big age.I never dated, because I wasn’t allowed to.And I deeply resent my parents for raising me like this, because that really shaped my worldview.

One time as a young girl I talked to this young boy online in secret. And my mom got suspicious, thinking I was talking to a boy. And I lied saying it was a girl. Thankfully that lie worked. I told him about my situation, about how I’m not allowed to associate with males, and he said that’s not right, which I agreed.But eventually we had our differences so I stopped talking to him.

So moving on from that, I had a crush on this other boy when I was in middle school and then again with the same boy in high school.But unfortunately, I was mean to him. I was mean to him because I was lashing out again from my own hurt, so that drew a wedge between us.And we’re still in contact via facebook, but we don’t talk.

I grew up feeling really ugly as a teen, so I could not attract guys even if I wanted to.

Then another time a guy was interested in me and I was too but not 100% (just basic lack of attraction issues towards him).He kinda stroked my back while we hung out a bit and I got scared. I got scared that he was interested in me. I was scared that a man was attracted to me, and that made me feel vulnerable. So I cut him off due to fear. Fear of being intimate, not just sexually but intimacy in general, with a man. Fear of being touched like that. But anyways, I still wasn’t 100% attracted to him either, so there’s that element too.

Then some time passed, and I stopped paying attention to men to focus on other things.

And then I started getting angrier and angrier at men because I heard so many horror stories from girls and women about their experience with men, so that really solidified my negative beliefs towards men.I told myself for a long time that I will never have a relationship with a man because of the potential abuse.But I realized later that, I still truly and deeply crave male companionship.

Then later on I became very feminine and girly, and I had a glo up, which caught the attention of the men around me.So, as time went on, I gained a new mindset as a result from my glo up, so I tried to put myself out there.

So, I took a liking to this other guy and he asked me if I wanted to go and get bubble tea with him, but I said no because I was scared at it being so late at night that I would have to go home late in the dark and I don’t feel comfortable being out late at night. And then I was sacred about what people would think if I went with a guy from work. I liked him but that was another missed chance with a guy, yet again.

Then I became a very sexual person. Maybe that was because I was taught to repress my sexuality by religion. But being sexual gave me confidence with men.

Then I tried dating apps and I met this other guy on a dating app, but in secret from my family.Long story short, we had sex. It was such an amazing experience. It was the first time I was with a man intimately. He was my first kiss.But if my family ever found out that I sexted with him and had sex with him and lost my virginity to him, then I’d probably be dead, literally and figuratively. I would be disowned. I would be kicked out of the home. I would be ostracized. I would have been shamed. I would have my character ruined. I would be all these things from my family at my big age of 30. What the fuck is wrong with these people?? This is not normal behaviour. I’m a 30 year old woman. I can have sex if I want to.But anyway, I thought that this is the first time I could have a boyfriend with this guy, but unfortunately, that didn’t work out, to my dismay.

So, I am such a mess with men. I want to be in a normal, healthy relationship with a man, but all of my experiences keep messing with my head.

I realized that this is partially my fault and that I need to work on myself.

I used to love being single. I used to take pride in that. But after my experience with that guy on the dating app, I realized that I don’t want to be single anymore.

(And I did think long and hard about that maybe I was a lesbian, but that wasn’t the case either. I did try to be a lesbian but it turns out I am bisexual.)

Sorry if this is all confusing. I’m confused myself lol.

How can I be less on edge with men? How can I be a normal person without all of this baggage? Do I scare men away? Do I self-sabotage myself with men? Is there something deeper going on here?? Am I having any unaddressed issues???

I’d appreciate any comments. Thanks.",18Dec2020,1
52,"Let me just start by saying my parents are pretty toxic. My mom loves to argue and my dad has a hair pin temper. Made for lots of yelling in my childhood. I started to drift away from them and it was not easy. I tried to have a conversation with them about their control and guilt but it did not go well. 

My mom took it hard but we worked through it. My dad has never gotten over it and it was 2 years ago. He constantly asks me what he did to make me hate him and why I think he’s always horrible. I tell him that I don’t think he’s horrible and that I love him. Every time I hung out with him one on one this would come up. 

He tells me that my boyfriend hates him (which he didn’t until my dad started acting like this). He’s taken it to the extreme of not even speaking sometimes because he thinks “whatever he says will be turned into him being a horrible person.” Seriously he’s just silent. It’s fucking weird. I honestly don’t even know where he got this from because NO ONE has EVER called him a horrible person except himself. He told me that he’s been called racist, homophobic, and a bigot. But WEVE NEVER SAID THAT ABOUT HIM. The closest thing was he made a racist joke and I was like “hey that’s racist” 

When my boyfriend and I are over at my parents house I always think everything is going great and then when we leave I hear about what my boyfriend or I did to offend my dad. Like one time my dad was pissed bc my boyfriend told my grandparents “bye love you!” As they were leaving and then didn’t look at my dad in the eyes once they left (even though we sat with him for a full hour after and talked! With eye contact!) Or another time he “disturbed” because my boyfriend had a good conversation with my dad after my dad gave him his Christmas present. 

Yesterday he told me the sacrifices he made in my childhood didn’t matter because he did all those things to have a close family but he doesn’t even have that. He said that he obviously messed up as a dad and that he regrets not taking more hours at work because time spent with me he could’ve been making money at work. 

After 2 years of this I’m pretty over it. I’ve gone from trying to convince him that I love him to just not caring anymore. I don’t want to plan lunches or hang outs anymore because I know it’ll just go back to that. I tell him it’s all in his head which just pisses him off and he just talks in circles and it never goes anywhere. My mom thinks I’m horrible because I won’t do anything.",18Dec2020,1

54,"Currently live in CT, we just got about 10 inches of snow up (not so bad) and I was able to get home from work safely last night even with the storm coming down hard around me- I drive a 2002 Ford Ranger XLT with 4wd so no problem. There was some clicking coming from the vehicle when jumping into four wheel but nothing major.

This morning after cleaning up snow around my apartment and driveway I went to head out for a cup of coffee and to grab a few necessary groceries to keep cooking but was cut short when I started to leave and heard a terribly loud clicking noise coming from the driver-side wheel. I think it might be the ball joint as it's happening even with 4wd off. 

Problem is, this thing has a few issues and paying for a new ball joint could be a bit out of my price range- I only have about $500 at the moment after dealing with the Holidays, and my original plan was to work overtime to quickly save up for a new vehicle ( I can work unlimited overtime in my current position). Now though, I had to miss the day of work because of this, and can't afford to let it drag into next week.

I've looked into a few different loan options but have terrible credit from some past economic mishaps (unpaid student loans), I have read a little about ""Buy now, pay here"" car dealerships and among other things was wondering about if this is a good option, or even possible with such terrible credit?

My other questions are all also related on how to survive this ordeal, as I need to at least get back to work for Monday to avoid this seriously impacting my career.

Anyone know if this issue might be something other than the joint and I could possibly fix it myself?

Any advice on gaining access to a car loan? (I have no co-sign available)

Are there options I could be looking at besides this?

Any advice is welcome, I also have a video of the nasty sound on request, Im on desktop and it's on my phone. Throwaway account because of identifiable details in post, and not risking discovery of my real account.",18Dec2020,1

My dream is to be a forensic pathologists or a medical examiner doing autopsies. I'm not exactly sure if I'm on the right track, especially since I recently found the forensic specialty I wanted to work in. 

Originally, I decided I wanted to do forensics but upon further inspection and a few joking conversations, I realized pathology and doing autopsies was my dream. 
I also realized with this new found dream that I have to go to medical school, which made me hesitant to take on this career path. 

I wanted to know if I need to change my major or take on more classes outside of forensics or maybe dual major? Right now I'm taking some higher level sciences and forensic courses.

I’ve been seeing this guy (19M) for about 7 months now and we’ve been dating for almost 2 months. I noticed in the past month he hasn’t been treating me the same as he used to, he only sees me once a week or when it’s convenient for him, he starting hanging out with his boys more often, stopped being intimate with me, stopped replying to my stories/posts. He said he was going through something on the weekend and asked for space, I had given him the space he needed and when he was ready to talk to me again I asked what was wrong and he told me it had nothing to do with me. He pretty much switched up completely on me and I’m honestly confused. Whenever I try communicate with him my feelings he makes himself the victim and I can never get my point across without feeling bad. My birthday party is tomorrow and majority of the people coming are his friends I’m not sure what to do cause I don’t wanna make a scene before my birthday and ruin the night for myself either, It’s just taken a lot of mental frustration on me and I don’t know how to relax.

My (20f) younger sister (17f) came home from school yesterday on the verge of tears. She, myself, and our mother all have these rings that we got from Colombia a few years ago, which is where our mom was born. It was a super important trip for us and we decided to commemorate it by getting emerald rings, because Colombia is famous for them. My sister told us that she had taken the ring off in the bathroom to wash her hands, and in a rush to get back to class before the bell rang; she mistakenly left it on the counter next to the sink. When she realized during her next class, she went back and it was gone. She has reported it as lost to the office, posted about it on her Instagram, and at the moment we are all just waiting to see if it’s turned in (she won’t know until Friday because her school does partial remote learning). She mentioned that there was another person in the restroom with her, and that she left before they left the stall.

My sister’s high school has cameras outside the bathrooms as well as monitored QR code sign in/sign outs for all bathrooms (for contact tracing), so the school has a documented timeline and video evidence for who was in the bathroom after she left and before she returned. There are also two different cohorts that do in person learning on different days to reduce the number of students in the building. That coupled with the fact that this particular bathroom isn’t all that busy unless it’s between classes, means that there were probably only a few other girls who went into the restroom when the ring was there. 

Finally, the ring isn’t worth all that much (monetarily speaking); jewelry rarely has a high resale value and the emeralds aren’t super high clarity and color like you would see if you googled “emerald ring”. We wanted closer to natural emeralds, and it was more about what they represented from our mother’s home, and that we each had one. It is priceless to my sister, and it’s not something that can just be replaced. 

My dad suggested setting a reward, and there’s obviously more incentive to give it back, but idk it feels gross to give money to someone for giving you your own shit back after they decided that their want was more important than the owners loss. And the school has a lost and found policy (and there’s also just common sense and decency), so they know that they should have turned it in. 

I suggested that she go to the office and bring up the security records to the school, and ask that they ask the students who went in if they saw it (read: took it). And also possibly have the school mention to them that there’s a reward (if she chooses to set one). If that doesn’t work then maybe try posting the reward on her Instagram but there’s no guarantee that the person who took it would even see the reward posting (her original post yesterday asking for it to be returned got over 400 views, most of which came from other people at her high school because she declines follow requests from strangers, but no one has reached out). She’s been anxious since yesterday, and I know how much it means to her to get it back. So, what should she do?",18Dec2020,1
60,"So me (21F) and a “friend” (26M) met studying abroad a couple of years ago and have been friends since. We’ve been hooking up since we met and stopped for awhile when he got a gf. He just recently got out of that relationship so has been hitting me up more, and usually it’s fine but recently I feel like he’s just completely using me, and i’m not even really a friend anymore. He never makes an effort to hang out with me or see me outside of sex. And when we meet to hook up he’ll flake without even saying anything. The other day he texted me about being in town and wanting to meet up and I said yeah, then he texted me the night of and didn’t bring up us meeting at all. So I asked him what happened and he just said “I was out lol”. And this isn’t even the first weird shitty thing he’s done. Honestly, I just really need advice. This might sound like a stupid situation or something but I don’t have anyone to talk to about this and I’m just starting to feel kind of crazy with this situation since he’s always hot and cold. What does he consider me at this point? Any advice on how to handle this???",18Dec2020,2

I always liked history, philosophy, psychology.. My parents were never supportive and always made me doubt it, they kept reinforcing the idea that these things aren’t real jobs and that I need to get a stable life, good income.. etc. and that humanities are boring and eventually I’ll get bored of them and will fail myself eventually. 

I almost done with dental school, but I feel lost, I keep blaming myself for not following my dreams and being courageous enough to pursue what I wanted,everytime I talk to my parents or the ppl around me about how much I hate my life and how unhappy I am, they look at me as some child who will grow out of his childish thoughts!!! It’s conflicting me, I don’t know who’s right and who’s wrong. 

I’m not happy. And I don’t know if pursing what I want is gonna make me happy!! I mean aren’t we supposed to “ follow our hearts” Or it’s just quote  said by many that doesn’t apply in real life

I am looking for advice on how to help my brother who is struggling with past heavy cocaine use &amp; recent heavy meth use; he is also bipolar (type 1 I think) &amp; we have not completely gotten that under control. He is getting out of rehab on the 22nd! I want to know some advice on how to check on him, make him feel worthy, make him feel valued, &amp; make him feel loved. I know that he is going to be fragile at first, &amp; I want to check up on him without triggering him or making him feel like I am assuming that he isn't doing okay/not trying hard enough/etc.

For any past/current addicts, what did/what do you wish someone had said to you during this time that really helps/helped? What did/what do you wish someone did for you that helped you?

Can you help me understand relapse &amp; how to deal with that if it happens? Am I allowed to be frustrated? Is there a way I can mentally prepare for this in case it happens? How should I react to relapse?

Any advice is appreciated.

Thank you so, so much.

And he payed for my college. I am really scared on how to tell him or when he finds out and how to deal and cope with whatever he yells at me.

83,Some background info: I dated a girl for nearly two years but we were friends for a bit before that. I met her through a mutual group of friends. Within that group we shared a best friend. I have always had small feelings for this friend but nothing insane. After our breakup (I ended things with her) a year ago I found my feelings growing even stronger. I’ve talked to this friend and found that she at least (previously) had feelings for me too. I tried to suggest that we could do our own thing and shouldn’t have to worry about other people but she’s too afraid of losing her friend (my ex) and other friends that her and my ex share.

84,"My daughter(8) is a great kid, very sweet, can be kind of a brat because she is an only child and I admittedly spoil her. Never to others though, only the people she can “get away with it” with- me, my mom, her favorite aunt. My dad (M) was extremely abusive to me and my mom when I was growing up and they divorced when I was young, he is a “better man” now but can still have a temper. He has a good relationship with my daughter and has never even yelled at her, although I’ve told him too sometimes, he is worried because I’ve told him that if he ever hits her or hits someone in front of her, he won’t be allowed to see her. 
My mother has been married to a man (J) for almost 20 years now and he has never laid a hand on her. He’s a “good guy” in the way that he doesn’t cheat, goes to work, doesn’t drink, gamble but he can be a baby and throw tantrums. 
About 2 years ago, my daughter told me that my dad argued with his longtime girlfriend in front of her and that she didn’t like it but wasn’t “too scared”. I gave him an earful and it was about 10 months until he was allowed to see her without me being there as well. Nothing has happened since while he has been in her care. 
Tonight, me and my daughter are spending the night at my mother’s and her and J started getting into a disagreement during dinner (eating on trays while watching tv) in the living room. It was a stupid argument about the way my mom put up the Christmas tree but J felt that she wasn’t “respecting” him and his feelings by not taking it more seriously. They get into little tiffs but it’s never that serious so em and my daughter didn’t react at all and continued with dinner. Then J threw down his tray across the floor, spilling his food everywhere and yelling at my mom about her “fucking attitude”. I immediately got upset and asked “Why would you do that? And with my daughter here? Over a tree? You feel good about that?” He stopped yelling at my mom and turned to me and said “Yes, I feel fucking great about it. I’m tired of her attitude.” I said something along the lines of “Thats ridiculous”, my mother told him to “Stop the stupid shit” and I could see tears in my daughters eyes who was very purposefully avoiding eye contact with everything but her plate. He stormed out to his computer room where he spends most of his time. I turned to my daughter and said “I’m sorry, he shouldn’t have done that. He’s being a baby and that wasn’t fair.” She calmed down pretty quickly and commented on how the loud noise made her ears popped and I cleaned up the mess. 

I grew up seeing my parents and other people in relationships argue, fight and throw things a lot and I know it really messed me up and I’m worried that it could affect my daughter even though it’s only been a couple of instances.

My (33M) wife (32F) on Friday went to go see her friend who is a hairdresser. I got a text from my wife that she was going to have her friend shave her head. I just texted back with ""Alright"" since I thought she was joking. My wife did have healthy, gorgeous, silky brown hair that she took amazing care of.

When I went to pick her up a few hours later, I did a double take when she came up to my car. When she got in, she asked me what I thought of her new look. I was so speechless I just smiled and chuckled. Her head was completely shaved smooth.

The whole way home she was talking about how she has wanted to do this for years, how the baby (we have a 14 month old daughter) won't pull on her hair, how much money she will save on hair products, etc.

I'm glad she loves it and I support her but I honestly secretly hate it. I don't think it suits her at all. When we were cuddling in bed, I felt like I was cuddling with a man (I hope that didn't sound homophobic, I'm not at all, I'm just not attracted to men)  

I don't feel attracted to her like I did before Friday.

I feel so guilty about it. Of course I would never ever say anything to her about it, if I ever made a drastic change like that she wouldn't say anything mean. I've seen bald women before and never felt attracted to them. Not saying other people wouldn't be but that's just my own personal preference.

My mom has always sheltered my older sister and I. She found out two years ago my sister whom is now 19 in college was a party animal and slept around her senior year. I guess she doesn’t care what my sister does anymore. 

But that is definitely not the case for me. Since quarantine started my mom thinks i’m not normal. Since all I do is lay around in my room in the dark. Like what else am i suppose to do. She won’t even let me do one thing by myself. I can’t drive alone anymore,I can’t go to the grocery store by myself,I can’t sit in peace and quiet, I can’t even eat cookies by myself. She controls everything i do. She’s made my relationship with food turn into shit. And now I don’t even eat much anymore. 

At least 3x a day she comes into my room and tries to have the same deep talk. Why am I so sad? and how she can make me happy. I literally have told her how I’m fine but I hate how she’s on my ass all the time. (not those exact words lol). She’s literally the root of this sadness she keeps seeing. I can’t take this anymore. I don’t think she understands this is how my sister rebelled. By having this over protective mother that gives no privacy. They cherry on top is she thinks i’m this innocent daughter that could never turn out to be my sister.  When the truth is I’m on par with what my sister has done.

95,"Alright, so a little context is that his parents live with us in a sort of roommate styled situation for almost a year. We are at the end of our lease and just ready to be done with everything. Though, in reality, it's not because we pay 90% of the rent, utilities, bills, etc, yet she dictates what we can and can't do in the house and sometimes even out of the house. She made us have a weekly cleaning day (Thursday because that is my day off and so I have to help her every time) and she makes it so that once we clean we are NOT allowed to use the kitchen for a full 24 hours (one day I was baking for an order someone place and she yelled and belittled me for it because she had just cleaned even though she watched me do it and watched me clean as I went. I ended up not finishing them until the next week and she didn't talk to either of us for 3 days and kept her door closed that whole time). She does not work and relies on her S/O's as being the sole provider for their portion of everything (another thing, at the last apartment we were at they almost got us evicted because of their dogs screaming and they didn't pay a single penny for rent, utilities, etc). She'll spend $80-$150 on making dog food from scratch that the dogs sometimes don't even eat or buying things off Amazon and then claim that they don't have enough to pay for internet or electricity. She would complain as we're cooking about the clean up to the point where we spent this past summer either eating out or eating TV dinners. Side note, don't do that it will just ruin your body and we ended up feeling terrible after it.

She'll demand that my BF drops whatever he's doing and takes her where she needs to go in his car because she doesn't want to add on her mileage. She takes little jabs at him about his pain (he works really hard during this pandemic as a meat butcher), his weight, our relationship, our room, our cat (whom she keeps saying that we should get rid of and then pretends to love her), etc. 90% of the time we spend in our room with our door closed because their dogs don't like our cat even though we pay the majority of the rent. We get used all the time and we hate it. I'll never forget how she told my BF that I should ask my family to change my grandmother's memorial (we had to fly out of state for it) because she would be on vacation and needed me to take a week and a half off to watch her dogs for which she paid less than I would have made at work because the dogs are co-dependent on her being home all of the time (she cooks their meals from scratch, feeds them 3-4 times a day, etc). Whenever there is a situation where he doesn't treat her like she wants, she'll tell me ""Oh, he was always so supportive and helpful before you got here."" ""He used to spend with me before you got here.""

I'm a timid kind of person, so I don't say how I'm feeling and put on a brave face, but my BF and his mom will go at it sometimes. He will try and explain what's making him upset and she will downplay and make it about her and her needs. By the end of it, there's yelling, cussing, she'll slam her bedroom door, and give us the silent treatment for a minimum of 3 days. Then we have to go and apologize. She called my BF a scrooge because we have a lot of things packed up and he wanted to move some of the boxes out of our room and into the living room. She wanted to keep it Christmas themed even though she didn't do any of the decorating and when he took some of the decorations I had put up that were nailed in, she flipped out on him and we had to tape them back up. It's all building up in him and me at this point and all I told him was that if he has to speak his mind that he can. The one time I finally stood up for myself and my BF, she yelled so loud and slammed their door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want him to have a terrible relationship with his mom, but I have been compromising every time they argue and I have to go back and talk to him and get him to apologize and make amends even when it's not his fault in order to keep the peace. It is to the point that when my family asks about how he is doing that he's shocked since his mom makes everything about her and doesn't care about the physical or emotional pain that he's in. I hate saying bad things about people, but I am just drained. It has gotten to the point where I have gotten sick just because of the energy she leaves in the house. After this year, we are going our separate ways (her and her S/O and my BF and I) and she is expecting/demanding us to call her four times a week. We just don't know what to do and are at our wit's end. I think I've said everything I needed to.

98,"So I've dealt with a few creepy customers in different workplaces here and there. And this new one is really bugging me.
For some setting, I work in an extremely tiny bank as a teller.

This customer came up to my counter the other day and needed some assistance. He small chatted and wiggled out of me that I'm a gamer (he asked how I met my husband, which was on the ps3) Then he started acting really weird and a little too enthusiastic. I finished the transaction quickly to try to get out of the conversation as he was eyeballing me and was trying really hard to NOT end the conversation.

He's been back every single day since then. The next time I made sure to steer clear of him as I had such creepy vibes the last time, and I could see he was eyeballing me from a distance as my coworker took care of him. I then heard him say ""I'm gonna sit and make a phone call"" (mind you I am sitting at my desk and the chairs are all around me) He sits in front of me with a desk between us. I ignored him but could see in my peripheral he was staring at me. Then he goes ""OH KATIE! maybe you could help me"" and walks around to sit directly at my desk. He continued to try to bring up games and tell me how lucky my husband is-once again.  I got away ASAP by acting like someone needed me.

Okay fast forward to today. He comes in so I immediately hide behind my computer, luckily my coworker is beside me so I tell her how he's making me so uncomfortable the past few days. With my bad luck someone else came up the counter and needed me so I was forced to get up and go over there. I could literally hear this guy say ""in a second I need to ask Katie for some help"" he said this to my coworker whose ALREADY HELPING HIM. The coworker helping him said ""well I'm right here so what do you need help with?"" And he started asking me very loudly with my back turned about assassin's creed helix credits.....
Seriously.
I finished my transaction and pulled my female coworker in the back with me to escape and she informs me he was staring at my ass the entire time I was helping my customer. To which he saw she noticed what he was doing and death glared him. I watched the cameras to wait for his transaction to be done and for him to leave, BUT I watched him go to my desk.... Sit down... And wait for me.

I can see the line forming so I go back out there and help a few ladies. In the middle of my transaction he gets up and interrupts me working to say ""I wanna ask you a question but I see you're with someone"" which is odd considering he's been watching me this entire time. And this is extremely rude to interrupt me helping this lady with her account questions.

Once everyone is gone my male coworker tried to get this guy away from me and finally got him to go. He was sticking around to ask me about assassin's creed. Idk what the hell is happening honestly. You barely mention you game and then this guy won't stop coming in and basically harassing me in my workplace and finding reasons to show up everyday. I don't know how to really explain it. Even typing it out it sounds so weird, but the whole situation is just so uncomfortable and I don't really know how to professionally tell him to leave me alone as I'm legally required to be nice to you. 😞

So what do I do?",18Dec2020,2

She’s not doing too well because she keeps telling me she’s a waste of space because she’s getting turned down everything she wants to do in life by her parents which are not supporting her dreams. For example, I’m in flight school and she really wants to be a pilot as well, but her parents 1. can’t afford the school, and 2. Turns down her ideas about it without any talk. It hurts me to live my life knowing that my girlfriend wants to do what I’m doing, but can’t. She’s undecided and she keeps telling herself there’s nothing she’ll want to do in life and she’s afraid of living at her parents house for the rest of her life. Borderline depression, her thoughts scare me sometime. I try to tell her to open up to knew stuff but she just doesn’t seem to have an interest in finding motivation.

Hello all, 

I was recently hired as a part time position for a local cable company. I saw an ad on tv for the job, applied wednesday, had an interview thursday, and this past monday was the first day of 2 weeks of training. (looks like they needed this position filled urgently)

My gf owns a medical card for weed, and i had some dispensary edibles about a week and a half before the test. I didnt think much of it since i have a fast metabolism, but today i got the call that it showed positive for THC and they were sending the results to my employer... (I dont do any other drugs)

I am kinda freaking out. I sent an email to HR lady who hired me to ask to speak to her about ""the hiring process."" My plan is to be up front with her about the results, and why it turned out that way. I am just praying theyll somehow let me slide, but im just not sure. I live in a state where its still illegal.

My question is, is it the right play to be up front and honest? Any advice, insight, or experience would be much appreciated.",18Dec2020,2
106,"well this is going to make me sound like a terrible person, but please understand that I am still a teenager, and I have no idea how to handle this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been friends with this girl (lets call her Jane) since I was 11. She lived right near me, and we would get together almost every day to hang out and have fun. She is 2 years younger than me, and was homeschooled, so I only saw her after school and on weekends, but we would spend A LOT of time together, and we would always have a blast.

Time went on, and I was in HS, and we were still hanging out almost every day, and we were super close, and then she started school, and stuff was awesome, cuz now our schedules were more similar, so we would do homework together and all that stuff.

She graduated and came to my HS when I was in 11th grade (this year). We spoke a lot, during breaks and lunch and stuff, and she would tell me how she is struggling with her class because she felt like they are really immature and rude and she just wants to learn and they make it so hard for her to be able to focus etc. Her class is annoying, and so I went along with it, being supportive and whatever, and when I felt she was going to far I would say something about how she doesn't need to be so stressed about school work, and how her classes behavior isn't her responsibility.

Anyways, earlier this year she approached me and told me that she researched OCD on the internet and she thinks that she has it. Heres where stuff gets complicated.

Basically, early in quarantine I got tested for ADHD, found out I had it (which explained soooo much) and went on medication, considered different types of therapy/treatment plans, all that fun stuff. It was the right decision, but it was a hard one, and I spoke to a lot of people about what I should do. 

I am also kinda the ""therapist"" for my friends, though I have no idea why. A couple days before she told me about her ""OCD"", friend b came over and told me that she had depression, and eating disorder, and suicidal thoughts (she has a therapist, don't worry) and that she is currently not living with her parents because of all of the fights they have. Friend C came and told me that she has depression and an eating disorder, and her mom was remarrying some random dude and taking custody of her younger sister. MEANWHILE friend D came crying because her sister was dating someone her family wasn't comfortable with, and her other sister is out of state for college, and her anxiety is out of control and on top of that she cant stand being around sister 1 cuz she feels betrayed by her. All of these convos happened in one week. yayy.

so then Jane comes over and tells me that the internet thinks she has OCD, she has violent intrusive thoughts, and she wants to get diagnosed, but her parents dont  want her to, because they think that she will use it as an excuse instead of moving past the label. the are 100% right btw. she wont consider therapy or medication, she just wants an explanation. I encouraged her to talk to the school counselor, and she did, soo yay? (the counselor thinks she is fine, she just has a tendency to overstress and overanalyze small things)

here is my issue:

being around Jane is hard and emotionally draining. I love her to pieces, and she is one of my closest friends, but talking to her makes me so tired and stressed. I keep waiting for it to pass and get easier, but it doesn't. I cannot lost this friendship. How do I make being around her easy again?  also how do I avoid taking on other peoples stress when they confide in me?",18Dec2020,4
107,"I have nerve pain/misfires and muscle spasms on any part of my body except the head for ~8 years now. Last year, it became debilitating that I became bedridden. I've consulted a lot of doctors, done all the tests, ruled out psychosomatic causes. No proper diagnosis. I'm no longer bedridden, only sometimes when the pain gets worse. I suspect it has to do with my neck and spine because I get muscle spasms when I receive a back massage. And the pain goes away when the spasms occur.

Neurologists told me it's stress, so I relaxed for months. It did nothing. Rehab / physical therapy told me I should get back to my daily life, that I have to strengthen the muscles on my spine so I won't get misfires.

I've been having a difficult time because I'm bad at moderation. Idk my limit. How much should I rest? How much should I push myself? People tell me to listen to my body. I'm listening as best I can. It's a never-ending cycle of getting better and then getting worse again. (side note: I have ADHD. I can only understand 0 and 100, yes or no, no maybes, no in-between) 

There have been advices lately that I should ignore the pains and live life normally, that once the mind accepts that the work load doesn't change or nothing changes even when the pain sets on, the body wouldn't get sick so often. And idk if I should follow it. The pain physically tires me out. And my natural reaction to pain is drowsiness. I pushed myself before and I started to feel a portion of my back going static / numb. I'm honestly scared of being paralyzed. But I can't keep going like this where this condition controls my life.

I know I can heal myself. I just don't know how at the moment. I've been doing everything I can, vitamins, eastern medicine, deep relaxation meditation, heat pack, massages, removing mental tensions such as guilt, spine strengthening exercises, etc. How did you recover from yours?

109,"I'm living with somebody new, and I'm really trying my hardest to not panic about their presence in my home. I know most of my thoughts and fears are irrational, and I'm trying to keep a lid on it for their sake, and mine. It looks like we're developing a civil dynamic now, and will see each other rarely. Even if we definitely won't be besties.

We've not had any conflict beyond small arguments, when they've damaged my stuff or the apartment, and I've tried to remind them about the terms of their lease. (They respond with slammed doors, the silent treatment, or shouting.) I am not good with conflict, and my anxiety is making this into a bigger thing than it needs to be. Even when something's settled, my brain keeps looping back to arguments we had, and replaying it as though I could've done it ""better"".

What would you advise for somebody with clinical anxiety, who is living a messy individual?

I don't want to be a control freak. My main issues are that they've damaged my stuff and the apartment, which are (in my opinion) rational worries to have. My friends tell me that I have to let them damage their bedroom as much as they like, and only start a discussion if communal areas/more of my stuff sustains damage. I suppose this makes sense. Their bedroom is their space, and I can hardly *stop* them from damaging the walls/floor. I just hope the landlord charges them for repairs, and not all tenants jointly.

How do you quiet your repeating thoughts? Have you ever lived with a roommate who you disliked, but had a calm household nonetheless? How do you ignore damage that is being done to your rented home?

Thank you.",18Dec2020,1
112,"I (15M) have a few issues, as anybody else. I've suffered through depression for multiple years now, and I've survived 1 suicide attempt. I found porn at a young age (about 2nd grade) and watched it since. I only started masturbation about a year and a half ago. I am currently in a relationship (15F) that I've been in for about a year.  I have a foot fetish, and I masturbate only to that kind of pornography. Ever since I've started, I've also masturbated to pictures of girls and their feet that I know in real life. This hasn't stopped since I got into this relationship and I feel horribly guilty. I have stopped self harming due to my girlfriend but it's been so hard and I really don't want to be doing this anymore.. I hate doing it. I don't choose to do it, it's almost out of my control. I masturbate multiple times a day, sometimes even being late for certain things. I sometimes do it even in between virtual classes. The guilt got to me and I told my girlfriend and it obviously didn't go well and I really wish I hadn't but I really, really want to quit. I don't want to have a foot fetish anymore. I don't want to watch porn anymore. I don't want to masturbate anymore. I know that on their own, none of those things are unhealthy but I can safely say that my fetish has ruined my life and I wish nothing more than to be rid of it.  How can I stop? How can I be ""normal"" as I've always dreamed of being?

She, in turn, has had severe depression and anxiety since her mother passed from cancer in 2016. 

For the last year or two, pretty much all we do after work/on the weekends is watch TV or Netflix while she plays Xbox or reads on her phone and I scroll Reddit or Facebook. 

My inability to come up with gift ideas for myself is causing my wife to have a literal panic attack because she feels worthless as a wife if I get her something (which I already have) and she doesn’t get me something. I just don’t know how to reassure her that not getting me a gift will in no way diminish my love and appreciation for her (yes I’ve tried directly saying exactly that). 

When I was younger, I always had my nose in a book. I haven’t read a book in more than three years because I just don’t have the attention span any more. 

More recently, I’ve enjoyed console gaming. Replaying my old favorite games is boring now, and the thought of learning new games is exhausting. I’ve even stopped playing the couple of mobile games I previously enjoyed. 

In past years , she used to get me a couple of funny t-shirts for Christmas or my birthday. I already have so many of these from past years though, that I neither want nor need any more.

She enjoys the work, and for the most part, gets along with her co-workers. When she began, management seemed nice and helpful. For whatever reason, over the last couple of months, the main supervisor has become more and more aggressive toward ALL the employees in my wife’s crew.

Management has been complaining about work not being done correctly, despite said work being checked MULTIPLE TIMES by the same MANAGERS, and the managers not correcting the issue.

He’s finessed me out of money, emotionally abused me, and when I was at my worst because I was taking drugs to cope with the anxiety he was causing me because he wasn’t paying rent, he basically didn’t care and left me to overdose. Obviously a terrible person and that is what I have perceived him as and for the sake of this post consider him as just that please. And I want nothing to do with him as a person. 

The place we share together is lovely, it’s right next to my university, it has a closed backyard for my dog, my neighbours are lenient and we have the best rent for the house we have. With the rent we pay, we cannot get the same house somewhere else. Or anything even close to it.

Last three months he’s been out of the country and caused me enormous amounts of stress for various reasons and has said he wants to move out.

However, I know if he stayed we could get along as “roommates” and nothing more. I made him a video of our friendship that could potentially get him to stay but that is me putting myself down to get him to stay❌. I could keep the house at the cost of my integrity (not sanity).

123,"This really isn't too much of a big deal to me, but I'm kinda worried how this might become worse. So a few months ago, my friends introduced me to a friend they had met somehow, mostly likely through our favorite Minecraft server Hypixel. They were a frequent player on that server and he kind became part of our friend group. Note to make, he lived out of state. We used Discord just to talk and text, and also take note that WE KNEW WHAT HE SOUNDED LIKE AND LOOKED LIKE, AND HE BOTH SOUNDED AND LOOKED OUR AGE. My mom asked who he was once when I was playing with him and my friends, and I told her he was in 8th grade and lived out of state. I used to know what state he was in but I since forgot. She asked where he lived and I said out of state (my parents are usually pretty chill about who I'm friends with so I thought there would be no need to lie about this one). 

So one day I'm playing video games by myself and my dad sits me down and says, ""Hey, that kid you've been talking to, he lives out of state?"" in that judging voice we all know. I say yea, because I thought he was just clarifying. And he goes on to guild trip me about why I should be making better friends because he MIGHT NOT BE WHO WE THINK HE IS. He brought up things like stock photos and voice changers, but I knew for sure that he used neither. When he was on camera he was moving and his mouth was moving appropriately for what he was saying. His voice didn't have that ""voice changer"" kinda sound we all know. In short, we all could confirm his identity. But no, even through all this, my dad STILL wasn't convinced. And, in his own words, said this: ""I don't care if I'm wrong and I'm probably wrong, but its my job to keep you safe and that so-called ""kid"" you've been talking to is not who he says he is, I guarantee it. And I don't know what kind of kid makes friends outside of state only, because that's kinda creepy (note that we already knew he HAD friends in-state but we just met over a video game)."" 

No matter what I told him about how I could confirm who my friend was, my dad didn't change his mind. That usually happens in my house, especially the words ""I don't care if I'm wrong."" And they hide behind ""keeping me safe"" when it's just to hover over me and control every aspect of my life, at least in my eyes. If you guys think I'm being unreasonable I would really like you to set me straight because I don't see anything wrong with what I'm doing.

I know you're supposed to be careful online and make sure you know the person you are talking to doesn't have malicious intentions, but as I said before I already can confirm that. So now, I can't talk to one of my friends and have been forced to just ghost him. I don't feel bad about myself I feel bad that I stopped talking to my friend with absolutely no context.

There is one thing though that I’ve noticed. While I don’t mind him being assertive/dominant with her and I enjoy watching her give him head, I can’t help but get a lingering feeling of jealousy when he’s active on her, i.e. when he goes down on her or when he fingers her.
An example that comes to mind is when we were spit roasting her with oral. She was lying on the bed, while I was kneeling next to it, eating her out. He was on the opposite side getting a blowjob until he came on her tits. It was hot. But when we swapped positions for me to get the blowjob and for him to eat her out, I couldn’t fully enjoy it because I suddenly got a bit possessive over her pussy in my head.

Another time I was watching porn with him with our dicks in hand while she was showering. When she was done and came into the room in her bra and panties and said “hot” when she saw us, he said “be a good girl and show me your pussy”. She sat down, pulled her panties to her the side and flashed it. Then he told her to spread it open for him and she did. This triggered my jealousy, but when he got up, walked over to her and shoved his dick down her throat I didn’t have a problem with it.

127,"I have a family member who doesn't interact with others in the healthiest way. To be as objective as possible, she yells at others in the household for probably three to four extended periods each day (2-90 minutes, probably averaging 8?), including longer dispositional chastisements. This can be (and often is) prompted by something small like someone's indecision or accidental mistake.  She can be agitated easily and will shut others down (tell them to stop talking or that their behavior is ""completely unacceptable/inappropriate/out-of-line"") if they ever question her, including if she honestly misperceived a situation or if they're defending themselves after she personally attacked them. She does have one stressful situation in her life, which probably contributes to her interactions with others, but that doesn't prevent the negative influence it can be on people around her. I'm hesitant to call this person toxic as I know other people do far worse things, and I am grateful for the positive things that she has done for our family. I don't think she intentionally is an unhealthy influence. I've tried to talk to her respectfully about one of the issues (phrasing it as ""this may possibly seem to certain other people like..."" and be as unprovoking as possible), but each time she'll call me hypocritical for bringing up her flaws when I have flaws, too (which I definitely acknowledge) and that I'm being judgmental.

134,"Several years ago I messed up, and it feels so weird to look back at it.

I hurt two of my best and closest friends. They were like sisters to me, I could talk to them about anything, and they gave  me to the best years of my life.

Today is one of their birthdays and I nearly forgot to wish her a happy birthday. So I did and she told me that she was watching a movie with her friends through zoom. We don't talk much anymore, but she did reach out to write to me. I wrote back but I guess she got busy and replied months later. I wrote again and it's been months.

I get scared to reach out because I hurt her, and I don't want to do that again. But when I do reach out, most times I feel like she doesn't really want to talk because she'll be busy doing something while we're talking.

Anyways, I realized that she might be watching the movie with my other ex-friend. In fact, it's probably very likely. I told her to have fun and enjoy her night.

Then I started listening to music and the song that started playing happened to be about someone who got a letter from someone they loved. It hurt them because the letter was supposed to represent closure, but the person receiving the letter has already moved on. I really related to the song because in six years, I haven't received closure from the other friend. She reached out to me in December a year ago and I tried to open up but she suddenly had to go. It's so hard for me to confront people about my feelings, but it seems like she's moved on a lot better than I have. She has a boyfriend and a great job, and lives far away.

So, right now I'm just feeling broken and just think that.. it could of been me watching the movie with her.. I could still be talking with them everyday. But I pushed them out and hurt them. Now I'm alone all the time.

I don't know what I want anymore. I just cry at the possibility of what could have been and what was. I just don't think I'm ever going to be okay again. I feel like I'm in a parallel universe where we didn't live happily ever after, and that I'm going to become a hobo on the streets and die in the cold.

I'm so sad for myself but feel weird because I think they're very happy. I was just a stone that got kicked up while they were driving to someplace better.

I don't know what to do.

I feel like death , but really don't want to die.

The only thing keeping me going most days is the flame inside of me that yells: ""I want to live a good life for the sake of my younger self!"".

I think I could reach out slowly, but I feel like I could be broken again. I know them reaching out to me a sign they want to keep the candle burning, but I have such a hard time talking about how I feel because I'm either fine or I break down.

I just want to tell them I'm sorry so get it out.",18Dec2020,1

138,"My parents dont like to listen to this stuff. Because I complain everyday about it. And it makes my life miserable. As much as my first job has helped it has been so bad lately. I started working at a daycare a few months ago and it was not in a room. I get paid close to minimum wage and do all of the laundry and dishes and help out around. But lately because of covid I work inside of a room almost everyday. Honestly I'm not mad at my boss, just the fact that I have to work in there. It is pure chaos. 20 kids, myself and most of the time another person from morning shifts who are either inexperienced or lazy. The lazy ones are the worst. About a week ago this kid got poop out of his diaper and spread it everywhere. I was desperately trying to clean it up, and get the kids to stop touching it, stomping it and getting all over toys. A nightmare. The lady I was in with was busy too. I've had a few times where I just want to cry. A kid wailing out and there is nothing I know how to do. And I still get paid minimum wage. The people who usually work in there get 10 or 11 dollars. I asked my boss one ""Since I am working in the room so much does that mean i would also get paid for that time in there?"" She said ""No I'm afraid not"" I know she can't help it, but I've been working in those rooms for weeks now. And on top of that I have to keep up with  my studies.",18Dec2020,1
140,"So.. I’m in my first year of university. It’s online so I have a fair amount of spare time. And most people I know are essential workers (cashiers etc).

I almost had a job. I got training and stuff but I didn’t get hired. It was harder than I thought and I haven’t had the confidence to get back out there. I’ve wanted time to mentally prepare myself to try again. I also don’t have a clear future right now so I’m sort of just... cruising if you will. I did have a clear future pre pandemic but now I have no idea how long things will be online, when I’ll have a more solid friend group, etc. The pandemic has changed everything. I have no idea what I should be working towards besides my degree. Though I have some idea of what people are doing, I don’t really know how they’re doing. And I’ve never even met people from my university in person so I’m really confused about where I “should” be going in life, if you will. I have no one to surround myself with or compare myself to. Which should be good, but it feels strange. I always thought of myself as such an independent person but maybe I built it up in my head because it’s been really weird not having anyone tell me what I “should” be doing, so’s to get something to at least base my judgement off of. 

I keep wondering if I’m wasting my time because I’m basically doing nothing besides school right now. There was a point in my life where I’d never let myself just sit around at home, I’d always freak out over what to do over the summer break and such. The insane amounts of FOMO I used to run on are slowly fading away as I remain in this pandemic realizing how out of control I am anyways, so why should I care so much? No one fully knows what they’re doing, and the sad truth is that life isn’t fair. Why should I even care? Life’s not a race and you really don’t know where you’re going to be. But I’m also afraid to fully let go and just do nothing without a second thought because... I guess there are little bits of the FOMO left that I don’t know who I am without. 

I don’t really know what I should be doing, if I should be doing anything at all. I’m feeling less driven than I used to be and covid is really messing with my head.",18Dec2020,2

142,"~posting on behalf of friend~

I’m a 16 year old girl and I’m about to turn 17. I live with my mom and my sister. My mom has a brain tumor which leads to her constantly having migraines and seizures, this is important to keep in mind. 

She has been very mentally and emotionally manipulative my whole life, when I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at around 13 she never sympathized with me or showed that she cared, in fact she gets mad at me and when we get into fights she tells me that I just want attention, she also constantly tells me that I have nothing to be sad about. Along with this she constantly tells me that my 9 year old sister who throws insane tantrums and is insanely rude is depressed and that we should sympathize with her. She has also told me that it’s mostly my fault because I don’t spend enough time with her. 

She also constantly randomly gets mad and calls me ungrateful when I am the one who does most if not all of the cleaning around the house. She also constantly contradicts herself. One example of this was the other day when she came to my room and thanked me and told me that I was a great daughter for cleaning so much and feeding/ taking care of my sister so often. She even admitted that she wasn’t cleaning enough. Then a week later she got mad at me and while she was calling me ungrateful told me that those are just things I have to do because she’s sick and I have to help her. 

Every time we have a disagreement she says her peace and as soon as I try to speak it’s “oh I have a headache I can’t talk about this right now”. I honestly don’t know what to anymore i can’t deal with this anymore everyday I try to do everything I can to avoid arguments but that doesn’t stop my mom from making problems out of nothing.",18Dec2020,2

149,"I am hesitant to write this for many reasons, but mainly because I hate to think that someone reading this would be put in a bad place mentally or would trigger unhealthy behaviors. With that said, if discussion of eating disorders and numbers is triggering for you, please please please do not read. 
I (17f) have been dealing with this for some time now. Weight has always been a thing for me. Never have I been overweight or even close, I’ve always been on the smaller side. I was also a gymnast and as many may know, weight and body size is a frequent topic of discussion and comparison. I even remember being as young as kindergarten and feeling self conscious about the size of my body. I wouldn’t put my feet flat on the floor when I sat in chairs because I didn’t want my thighs to flatten out and look fat. I also remember comparing my own weight to my friends’ (for some reason in grade school everyone seemed very vocal about their weight) and I always wanted to be smaller. But even with all this, I had a fairly normal relationship with food and wouldn’t restrict. I was always at a healthy weight. I was always obsessed with my weight though, I never really thought it was abnormal that the first thing I did when I got home from school everyday was sneak to my parents bathroom and weigh myself.
Things started to change when I was 15/16. I went on the pill and started gaining a bit of weight. Seven pounds, nothing crazy, but I felt like absolute shit.   I would always analyze my body and feel so disgusted. I knew it was wrong. It’s always wrong to feel that way about yourself, but I was far from being overweight (5’4 117lbs). I wasn’t restricting to an extreme amount, I was actively trying to lose weight but I wouldn’t have called it eating disorder behavior. 
But then it became that. I went on vacation and told myself that I would just eat what I wanted and not feel bad about it because it was vacation. For some reason, being on vacation made me want to restrict a lot. I would not eat much in the day because I wanted to drink at night and felt I had to leave room for the alcohol calories. So I would drink on an empty stomach and get to an out of control state. I had people around me to look out for me so luckily nothing bad happened. 
And from then on, all throughout summer and up until now, I’ve been restricting. It depends on the day, sometimes I eat a small, but basically normal amount. Other times it’s not nearly enough. I’ve lost a pretty significant amount of weight. About 17 pounds. Sometimes that makes me happy and proud even though I know it’s not good. Sometimes I look at my body and feel beautiful, sometimes I’m disgusted. Not because I think I’m fat, but because I’ve damaged myself and I know it. I’m not necessarily trying to lose weight right now, although it is tempting. I’m satisfied just maintaining. I am so incredibly stressed that when I go to the doctor for a yearly visit they will accuse me of having an ed. I don’t want it to be a thing my family has to worry about, they have so much already. And I’m fine, I know what I’m doing is unhealthy, but I have it under control. I guess I’m not even sure what advice I’m seeking. I just wanted to vent. If you’ve read all this, thank you. Genuinely thank you so much. I don’t like to share it with people, but this is a thing I deal with every day, constantly. I don’t know when it ends because I really never thought I would get to this point.",18Dec2020,1
150,"I (F18) recently made friends with a coworker (M22) whom I actually have *a lot* in common with. We texted, called, and spoke at work about life and some of our hobbies and how odd it was that we did have so much in common (he didn't lie about anything to get closer to me as I've asked acquaintances about him and everything checks out.) Then, I made the bold decision to accept his invitation to hangout. Now, I think I should preface this by stating that I'm still trying to figure out my sexuality and whether I like women more than men. And because of this, I've never kissed anyone or done anything risqué, even with myself. That being said, I thought we were forming a nice friendship, so I really did believe we were just going to hangout at his place. Looking back, I should've seen the red flags. When I got there, we started watching a movie and cracking jokes to rid the air of any uncomfortable energy. Midway through the movie; however, he put his arm around me. I brushed it off. A little while later, he pulled me closer and asked if we could snuggle. I was hesitant, but obliged. Then, he brought his face closer to mine and asked if he could kiss me. I told him that I'd never kissed anyone before, so he asked if he could be my first. (NOTE: I want to make it *very* clear that I gave my consent for all of this even if I did end up having self-doubts by the end of it all.) We kissed. I didn't know how I felt about it, I still don't. But at the time, my mine was screaming and I felt like crying, so it probably wasn't a good thing. We stopped and continued watching the movie for a while until I felt him start to touch my butt. (I don't know how many guys do this, but he kept asking me if what he was doing was okay, which I think was pretty smart on his part because it also made me feel a little guilty.) Anyway, I'll spare you the nitty gritty details and cut to the chase: we didn't have sex, but somehow ended up doing a lot of things over the clothes that I didn't even know you could do. (Example: I had my first kiss and gave my first handjob within the same hour.) Did I verbally agree to all this? Yes. Am I mentally, and for lack of a better term, traumatized? Absolutely. Now onto the advice I'm hoping someone could give me . . . During this ""hookup"" of ours, I told him that I wasn't sure if I liked girls or not, which he understood, admitting that he'd dated a few guys before. And throughout what we were doing, not only did he mention it a few times, making me feel a little awkward, but when we were finished, suggested that he become my **""experiment buddy.""** Let me reiterate, ""experiment buddy."" I'm still flustered by this idea. What does an ""experiment buddy"" really entail? Does he just want to use me as sexual gratification during a global pandemic when one night stands would be risky, or does he genuinely want to ""help"" me? Was I guilt-tripped into participating because I felt awkward and guilty? I really do like him as a *friend* because we mesh well together and have so many common interests. But I'm afraid of cutting him off completely since we're coworkers and live in the same general area. My mind's a mess, and I still don't even know if I even enjoyed anything we did (I'm not physically attracted to him, if any of you were going to ask). He is a nice guy, and we had a fun time when we saw each other again a few days later, acting like nothing had happened. I don't have any hate towards him. I'm just a little unsure if he used me/my innocence to his advantage. I know I'm young and naïve, so I'd really like some guidance. Thanks! :)",18Dec2020,1
151,"M 17.  My mom drives everyone in my house mental but me the most.  She does so many things that if I start letting myself type it out this will end up being an essay.  She gaslights me and my dad all the time.  She calls me crazy, narcissist, loser, fuckface, hopeless and many more names.  I feel she is trying to make me question and feel bad about myself.  I told her this and she tells me I am being a victim, and I need to get a grip.  When I was 15-16 I used to try to have conversations with her about how she makes me feel bad but it always ended up with an argument, and since shes the parent it means I was “acting up” and then she calls my dad sometimes and he beats me.  So I gave up talking to her a long time ago and I could never accept her for who she is, so me giving up talking to her, was me giving up on her, and now I hate her.  I even let her vent to me all the time, and she admitted to me that I get it the worst.  And she admitted to me that her “defense mechanism” (what she called it) is to put people down, and she said I probably get it the worst from her out of everyone in my family.  WHY!!!!  I SHOULDVE TOLD HER IN THAT MOMENT LIKE WTF!!  YOU JUST ADMITTED THAT YOU DO THAT TO ME, YET THIS WHOLE TIME YOU HAVE BEEN CALLING ME DELUSIONAL AND A VICTIM MAKING ME QUESTION IF IT WAS ME!!  I HATE HER WITH ALL OF MY GUTS.  and btw she also calls my dad and exaggerates stories to him about me and tells him to come home from work to beat me.  Which makes him mad because he gets in trouble for leaving work so when my mom makes him leave work he comes home enraged at me.  Which I think is so fucked up because he should be mad at my mom not me.  but he takes it out on me when my mom calls him and tells him to come home.  for example if i had a small disagreement with my mom, she will call or text my dad saying “blane is doing it again”, and then my dad wont ask what i did he just comes home mad at me and sometimes gets physical.  If i try to tell him what happened, that has not ever happened once lol, he doesnt care what actually happened, every single time ive gotten in trouble with him because of my mom, he DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!  yeah i hate my mom.

152,"Hello,

So the title makes it very clear. I don‘t want to have a partner that speaks in my native tongue. The main reason is that I prefer English. I live in Germany and I really like my cultural heritage but I just can‘t identify with it fully because i have grown up with so much influence from the internet and other cultures. All that time I felt like I have never really only spoken one language. With that I do not mean that my partner has to have english as his/her native language but rather that we mainly communicate in that language. I even would prefer it if someone speaks another language than English, but that is more of a preference than a real problem. Moreover it just feels so much more natural to me to speak English, even though I might not be perfect at it. Does anyone ever had the same problem? 
What would you do in my situation, knowing that you probably have to live in your country for 3 more years because of Uni? And yes, I know that this might seem ignorant or stupid in the first place but it really does trouble me a lot and it is really not a thing that goes away (really I tried).

Thanks for any advice or input. Even if it might seem useless, please write what is on your mind.

Thank you and have a pleasant day

I then contacted my mother via text about what I found and she called me two hours later to admit to opening the cards in my name. She claimed she made a mistake and that she just acquired the debt so quickly due to reckless spending. I'm at a loss of what to do. I know I have two choices, either report the fraud and file a police report or just let it go and make her pay off the cards. Any advice?",18Dec2020,1

I have a question to ask.  Does your perception of your face change?  Does your perception change when you’ve received a compliment? 
For my entire life, my perception of my own face has changed drastically.  It is entirely relative to approval from other people. 
Yesterday a friend of mine, who models, complimented my “beautiful eyes” repeatedly.  Suddenly, I was beautiful.  When I looked in the mirror, I was beautiful.  Today, I reminisced about my recent breakup—my face seemed unattractive again.",18Dec2020,1

164,"I’m 23.
I’m from Ireland, our college system is different.
We pick a ‘major’ (just called a degree), and if you want to change out of that you either change into something similar and start over with some exemptions or you just start over with nothing. 

I’m leaving a business degree to start over.
Business is not for me, it bores me to death.
I just have no clue what to study.

Here’s what I’m thinking.

1  - In school my best subject was Geography, followed closely by Biology.

2 - I’m far better suited to those type subjects compared to the maths ones.
I’m not terrible at maths, basic maths is fine.
I’m better at essays than equations.

3 - I don’t know what type of work environment I want.. I guess I’d like variety.

4 - I’ve tried (to some extent) :Software Development - that wasn’t for me and Business Information Systems - zero interest. 
English (my third best subject), I like it but I can’t see myself doing a degree in it.

5 - Design, I appreciate good design but I don’t think a design/art degree/career is for me.


Here’s a couple degrees in considering.
Biomedical science 
Earth &amp; Ocean Science (Geography + Biology)
Geography and Geosystems (more so Geography than Biology).

A cousin of mine studied Earth and Ocean science and he now works as a Marine Geoscientist making great money but he’s only in the country for a month out of the year (he doesn’t pay tax and he can travel).
I like the idea of doing that but I don’t know if I’d get tired of being away from home and he’s said there’s not much on offer in the career living on land.

So I don’t know.

I wanted to be a doctor growing up, I don’t anymore.
I asked my parents what I loved to do as a kid and they said collect rocks.
I signed up for magazines as a kid, I’ve got boxes with Rubies, Fools Gold, Rose Quartz, Amethyst and god knows what else in them.
So I like Geography and Biology that’s all I know.",18Dec2020,1

The female was the princess, and the male was a knight. The male and female were able to transform in some way, that parts a bit fuzzy. They also went to a high school.

174,"A few months ago an old friend from high school hit me on Snapchat to hang out. I said yes because he doesn't seem like the time of guy to have bad intentions. In high school he was funny and shy. When I saw him he was more mature and charming to say the least. We planned a date and stood me up. He then told me that it was because of work. I was understanding about that. The first time we hung out we made out, he was very *passionate.* Once every week we would hang out very late at night. That's when we were both available. But something that really stood out to me is that he was really bad at messaging me. Leave one read constantly, should have been a red flag but he said he was working. Something that I should point out is that I was a virgin when I met him. He really *really* pressured me to have sex with him, but yet said he would wait for me. I told him I needed some time. One of the time that we were hanging out I asked him ""what are your intentions? Is this just a hook up?"" he says ""No, I want a relationship thing. I want to be your boyfriend."" I believed him, again, he's very charming. Then he was explaining to me the moment he started to like me in high school; ""I noticed you were waiting on the bus with two our friends (said specific names). You were wearing a white blouse, jeans, and a scarf. You know how in movies you see someone every day and then suddenly they are glowing. It's like you can't see anyone else but them?"" When he told me that I got butterflies because I remember that day too. That was the day that I got my American passport. He would tell me that he really liked me. In person, he was very sweet but through text it was like I did not exist. When I would confront him on why he was like that, he would make and excuse or get really quiet. There was this one time I told him I was scared of going to the doctor by myself and he offered to go with me. I thought he was being very sweet and *charming.* I guess the need for him to pay attention to me and the pressure to have sex accumulated. I lost my virginity to him.  (it wasn't good btw.) After that he never messaged me only when he was horny. I told him that I did not want to be used like this. His response was ""so, no?"". I did some digging, and found out he already replaced me with some other girl. Did some more digging, and turns out he had a girlfriend the WHOLE TIME. They were dating for six months. Her social media post are like love letters to him. Always saying that she loves him. That she is so lucky to have a guy that treats her well. She is head over heels for her boyfriend. Something that I should point out is that she has the same name as me, even same nickname. Same occupation, certain physical features are the same, she is very *very* similar to me. The thing is that, I don't have proof that he cheated because it was snap so all the messages deleted. I want to tell her, but I don't think she will believe me.

I'm hoping for advice on this:

My husband's family is **extremely catholic.** Mine baptized me, but didn't force opinions on me. My husband has never fit in with his family since growing to have a mind of his own that didn't fit their indoctrination.

MIL has to preach her religion whenever and wherever she goes - you are never allowed to be right unless it agrees with her unique perspective of the Bible. She has insulted my tattoos, my thoughts on religion (I've always tried to be civil - but agree to disagree) - and will never admit when she has crossed a line. FIL is worse - and has no issue telling us what we've done wrong (she tells him to tell us off - ""don't make me get your father"" deal)

I haven't spoken to MIL for a year, but she still attempts to contact my husband. He replies to them on occasion to keep the peace - but doesn't tell them details about our lives, or anything specific (how's the weather, etc.) 

They want us to talk to them over Christmas, and I have nothing in common with them - but I'm also still hurt by them.

My dad was an entrepreneur and he was successful (turns out he was a mini legend) but his lifestyle meant taking risks and with him gone (I haven't grieved yet because I find it too hard to deal with) we have virtually no way of paying things off.

I have always been a night owl but with my family falling I need to step up and help, I've been trying to change and be around during the day but I have trouble with sleep, it scares me for many reasons, with one right now being that I have terrible vivid nightmares. I also have been struggling with life and what it means to die, this started roughly when my father was diagnosed with cancer. Then my cat dies and we find out she had cancer on her nose? Oh and my sister has cancer and has had a biopsy on her throat, I don't know what god we offended but I think that all this cancer shit has been too much (this is a joke, I personally follow christianity but am relaxed). 

My problem is that I feel like I'm failing at everything, I cant support my family because... well I can't, I have no work experience and so on.
I can't take care of myself
I can't sleep
I can't relax anymore
I feel like I have failed.

I should also say that I am neglecting my duties somewhat, like I sometimes ignore my responsibilities and just escape to my room. In my dads last two weeks of life, I told him this and he said that I shouldn't do it. I'm sorry dad but I want to escape even if it's for a little while. But I've been doing this since he started to decline, so roughly three months.

Here's the part where I fucked up this morning, it's 4am and I need to be up by 8am... I am incredibly tired but too afraid to sleep because of my nightmares. Now I couldn't remember if alcohol helps you sleep without nightmares or if it brings on nightmares.. so I had a few swigs of tequila.... my mom caught me and we spoke, she sounded disappointed, I googled and it turns out alcohol brings on nightmares so fuck me right. I'm disappointed in myself because I told my dad that I am trustworthy when it comes to things like this, especially alcohol but I found an ""excuse"" to drink, our family is plagued by alcoholism and I thought I'd be the one to break the cycle but here I am feeling like I could go down that road and not even realize it, I'm scared. This is the first time I've fucked up in this regard... and I'm only 21. I'm disgusted with myself but I cant lie and say ""I'll never drink again"" because I like alcohol, I love the taste of tequila and the occasional rum and coke. Booze is in my family but I made the choice to only drink on special occasions, like my household chose, in my country the legal drinking age is 18, but honestly I started having proper drinks at 15/16, 

If this is life now, I cant imagine what it's gonna be like at 25, or 30 and beyond.
If anyone is like r/thathappened, I will just blow you off but I'm not afraid of saying who I am so you can even somehow find me and ask me.

If it helps, I do have antidepressants and antianxiety medications, I usually have therapy every Friday but my therapist is on leave for the holidays and will be back in January or February I think. I am a South African and my father was actively involved in my life from fishing as a child to my firearm training in out last years together.

Tl;dr I'm 21(M) grieving the loss of my father, worried about what life is gonna do to me and I'm afraid I'm gonna go down the wrong path. I'm sorry for my family.

194,"My mother is a real-life Karen who has been infuriating me on every level for the last four years. Her biggest crime is falsely accusing my dad of cheating even though she has absolutely no evidence for it.

I've asked her on several occasions **why** she thinks he's cheating on her.  Did she have texts?  Underwear that isn't hers?  She's replied that his ""his taxes are fishy"" and absolutely refuses to believe that he might not be cheating on her.   I told her that fishy tax returns might mean fraud, but that she'd need to visit an accountant or some sort of IRS specialist to figure that out.  But she refused to believe this, claiming she had already talked to a tax return specialist but ""was a stupid bitch who knew less about tax returns"" than she did.  I asked her how his taxes might be connected with cheating and she replied that there were unknown payments and therefore he's been spending money on strip clubs.  Does she have evidence for this? No.

My dad is a really good guy.  He loves and respects my mother so much.  Even though he would be absolutely justified to shout her down after four years of false accusations, he hasn't raised a finger on her.  He asks her to talk to him about how she's feeling and she treats him like a piece of garbage.  And it's just so fucking tiring.

But even aside from these accusations, I've come home to see that my mom has used a red marker to draw devil horns on photos of my paternal grandfather and placed those photos around the house like she's doing some kind of satanic ritual.  My dad recently sold one of the houses he owned and when the notary came to my house ask for her signature of approval, she drove around outside for hours just to screw over my dad.  She is a hard-core capital T Trumpie who has called *me* an extremist for having views that aren't Trumpie.  She is an anti-masker who has been kicked out of several stores for not wearing a mask and picks fights with those who tell her to put it back on.  When I ask her to wear a mask she claims she's ""suffocating"".  I asked her if she thinks she has asthma, since I've had it, but she completely avoided the question.  She is also a conspiracy theorist who thinks that the reason astronauts have not gone back to the moon was because they experienced some kind of mental trauma in space and the government isn't telling anyone about it.  Her entire personality is getting a manicure and doing beach-body workouts.

I have not told her anything about my own life, including the fact that I've been dating someone for over ten months (I am a full grown college student but she's told me she strictly prohibits me from dating).  I am a philosophy major but on several occasions she has threatened to remove all my college tuition if I take a single philosophy course.  I have been photoshopping my transcript and lying about the courses I'm taking so I can major in philosophy.  When I was sexually assaulted over a year ago, I hid it from her for months and was planning to do so forever until she found out on accident.

I (25M) don't know if I am overworked or I'm just not being able to finish my work in an efficient matter. I have to juggle work in our family business as well as taking care of my brother's 3 kids, so I'm going to split the story below into two parts.

For work, I work in management for a medium-size company, but due to the pandemic, we have had to severely cut down activity and personally in the office (we have not re-trenched not am planning to. We are setting our employees on a rotation basis so they can at least earn wages since finding a job in my country is impossible in this pandemic). Part of this (in part because a lot of upper and mid management are 60+ years of age), I have to take a lot of their load. I do everything from Marketing to Finance, and from decision-making to grunt work.

At home (or on the home side of things because we are WFH), I also teach all 3 of my nephew and nieces. Their dad lives with us, but is not contributing much (I have to scold him for him to act on anything for his kids and even still will dona half-baked job and my parents would make me redo things with them). I also do the cooking at home on top of my schedule.

This is on top of minor activities I have to do such as preparing for grad school (still reviewing for GMAT), and helping out local organizations (because my parents were a big part of them before and I am expected to help them).

I have tried to shift some of my responsibilities to my other family members, but even after trying to train them for 3 months, they complain about not being able to do it. For context, I recently graduated uni last year and was thrusted all responsibility since then. They have had 5 years to learn everything when I had 5 months.

However, to top all it off, they tell me about how much they are working and have worked before. I'm at ends because the stories they are saying and their current habits do not match. If true, however, that would mean that they would have been working as hard as me in their 40s, and are expecting me to work as hard in my 20s.

Currently, it has reached a point that I am waking up at 7, and go straight to my computer to work until 5, in which I teach the kids, then go back to work until 1 am. Everyone is still awake then as well doing other things (watching YouTube mostly)

They are telling me I am not doing enough, but I don't know anymore what I can give. I haven't had a rest day since the start of pandemic (this includes Sundays) except for 2 when I was bedridden for the whole day. Am I just not working efficiently?",18Dec2020,2
196,"Idk how many more days I can take cooped up in the house with no future in sight, stuck in isolation. This is the first time in my life I’ve genuinely considered killing myself as my best option. When I wake up every morning I get overwhelming feeling of frustration, angst, disappointment it’s hard to describe but it makes me feel like I’m drowning if that makes any sense. The way I cope with this feeling is excessively smoking marijuana and drinking which is a good way to temporarily make me feel better but everyday I choose to smoke and drink instead of working my way out of this situation is only making things worse. 

The problem is I honestly don’t see a way out of this situation. I’m 23 and still live with my parents. I’ve been going to school off and on throughout the years but was only going because I had a GI Bill. So school was free and I got a monthly amount of money while I was enrolled. I had no idea what I wanted to do, grew up in an enlisted military family, so that’s what I knew... and the majority of the careers I considered growing up were in the military. Exiting high school I had absolutely no idea about what college I wanted to go to or what to major in, all I knew is I should probably go because I have it for free. All other plans up until this point involved enlisting after high school which my parents strongly discouraged me from doing since I have the GI Bill. 

So here goes life mistake #1- I have the ability to go to any state school for free in the country and decide to go to a school 30 minutes away so I can bunk with my high school best friend who is also from a low income environment. Surprise surprise he drops out within the first month. No big deal, I can always transfer. Right?

Mistake #2 Then that same semester I meet this girl who also has the GI Bill. She’s in a similar situation of not knowing what she wants to go to school for. We enter a long term relationship which now gives me access to 2x the monthly payments of the gi Bill. 

Mistake #3 what happens when you have two kids who have no idea what they want to do thousands of dollars a month whether they show up to class or not? Quite a few semesters of full time enrollment without showing up to any class besides day 1 to remain on the roster. Now my transcript has a good 4 full semesters of literal all F’s and WF’s. Somehow I still have a gpa of 2.2

Inevitably we both fail out of school and I move back in with my parents. Me and the girlfriend broke up and I’m a 20 YO at his parents house extremely frustrated with my life. Moving back home separated me from all the friends I made at college and pretty much all my friends from high school enlisted because that was our best option. Now I’m at the lowest point of my life with no friends, no future, and no education... que the waking up every morning with an overwhelming feeling of drowning. 

Fast forward until now I’m 23, I went to a local community college to get my grades up enough to get reinstated back into university but have the same problem I did when I was 19! I’m knee deep in an accounting degree but don’t really have a desire to be an accountant. I want to commission into the military to become a pilot. Which you can do with any degree and I actually found a way to do it though something called the PLC Program with the marines. Honestly idk if it’s even possible with all these failed classes on my transcript. It would depend on if they calculate GPA on their own terms or just take it straight off the official transcript (because my transcript replaces failed grades with repeated courses but still leaves the failing grade visible on the transcript. The grade replacement is just for GPA calculation). But I would need to raise my GPA above a 2.2 before I even go try to talk to an officer selection officer so I don’t seem like a joke to him.

Doing the PLC program is the only way I can see myself finishing school because I now only have 1 semester of GI Bill remaining but have a good 5 semesters of school left. Which at 23 fucking hurts to think about 5 more semesters. 

The thing is if I can’t make this PLC program work I really don’t know what else I can do to get out of this situation. I’ve worked so many retail and food service jobs in my life and fucking hate them so much. Plus the pay is so minuscule I don’t see how I’d ever be able to get out of my parents house. They refuse to co-sign for me and my credit is in the dumpster so I can’t even get approved to live anywhere besides on campus housing. When places started to shut down because of covid the restaurant I was closed and I started getting unemployment. The unemployment had a $600 a week boost and was way more than I have ever made at a job which is sad. 

For all of 2020 I haven’t been enrolled in school. I’ve been Getting unemployment for the past like 5-6 months and pretty much completely stuck in isolation. This has made me the saddest I have ever been in my life. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and am scared to go to a therapist due to being disqualified for the military (A.K.A my only known route out of poverty). Smoking helps me cope with all of this but I know that’s doing nothing but causing a temporary solution for a permanent issue. I’m trying to not rely on any substances but waking up everyday and just trying to kill time until I’m tired enough to fall back asleep again is driving me insane. I’m in a pretty nice house but sometimes can feel like a prisoner in here. 

Idk if there is something wrong with me or what. I live in a filthy room with clothes all over the place but the house in general is super clean, and even has a cleaning lady that comes every week I just can’t bring myself to maintain cleanliness. My hygiene is out the window I often wear the same clothes everyday until I notice they start to smell and have pretty much the same mentality about showering. I live in isolation and can go weeks without calling, texting, or talking to anyone besides my parents whom I just run into around the house from time to time. I’ve had substance abuse problems for the last couple of years. I wasn’t always like this, going into college I would workout everyday, often shower twice a day, cared dramatically about how I looked (often referred to as metrosexual) and was known as outgoing. 

I don’t even understand myself how I got quite this deep down the rabbit hole but I recognized all these behavioral issues and know that they aren’t normal, are the root of my problems, and need to be changed. So I don’t think I’m autistic or anything. But sometimes comments by my parents make me feel like I have a disability. Recently my dad told me “you should go to the doctor and see if you have anything wrong with you” another distinguished memory I have is once when I refused to cover my microwaved food with a paper plate because I claim they are a carcinogen my mother said in front of me “see I think he has something wrong with him, like mentally” what hurt the most is that statement implied they have had this conversation before. The worst of them all was when I overheard my mother say “I wish Robert was our son...well maybe I shouldn’t say that”. Robert is a family friend who’d similar in age and recently commissioned in the Air Force as a pilot. It drove me crazy hearing that. That one definitely made me feel expendable and fucked me up for a few months until I Drunkly addressed it to them, which they acted like she never said that... I at least appreciate the effort to not let me find out. She couldn’t even look me in the eyes for quite a few days after I told them I heard that. 

So yeah I’m pretty fuck in the head I guess n I have no one to sort this out with. Typing this out alone has slightly helped, I feel like a burden to the only 2 people left in my life. Like my existence at this point is selfish, I can only imagine having sex one day only to have a chronically depressed grown man in your house 23 years later with no way of getting rid of him on the foreseeable future. I know everything that has happened it completely my fault and I’m not even completely sure what the goal of posting this is. Does anyone have any sort of ideas on how to get out of his situation? I’ve recently looked into truck driving as an alternative to going back to university if the PLC program didn’t seem to work out for one reason or another. There is a company called Rohel that will pay for you to get your CDL the problem with that is the trucking life seems to lead to further isolation. I want a job where I can form a friend group and be happy again not be alone for the next 10 years. I’ve already lived a good year of it and can’t stand it. Nobody even told me happy birthday when I turned 23 which is not a big deal but it just goes to show nobody gives a fuck about me and I want to change that.",18Dec2020,3
197,"My (42 yo woman) sister (47 yo), who is still suffering from and was diagnosed with Covid only 3 weeks ago (and had a scary close call with hospitalization), just sent an ""oh, so you know"" email that she and her family are flying across the country to the beach for Christmas. To me this is highly irresponsible and an absolute slap in the face of every person who has lost someone, is a frontline worker, has had their life turned upside down, is terrified for the life of someone at this moment, has made the tough socially distanced decision each and every time this whole fucking year. 

Contrast this with the fact my husband IS a frontline  worker, literally, as an urgent care PA at one of a handful of clinics in our small city. We have a hugely at-risk 6 yo at home (asthma, was hospitalized at 16 days old for a week with RSV, suffers from resp infections). I also have asthma and get lung infections easily. Covid, quarantining, distancing, sacrifices, no school, 50% less income, and the fact I am also like a frontline worker as a mental health therapist, supporting people through tough moments and feeling this all deeply when I'm not homeschooling our 2 confused and pissed off elementary aged kids. I'm burned to a crisp. And so is my husband. In 10 years of marriage I've never seen him have such deep moments of distress and hopelessness. He's terrified of bringing it home and killing our child, me, someone we happen to come in contact with. It keeps him up at night. He has hands-on suspected and often proven Covid-positive  patients all day at work, and its aging him...all of us.

Then my sister...She says.""Well, we don't want to live in fear, or teach that to our kids."" In my opinion, she's teaching them an awful lesson flying across the country for fun right now. WTF?",18Dec2020,1
198,"Hey so I got a new job back in October after being furloughed for a while. The job has been going fairly well and the work is easy enough but the hours are lacking, I reorganize grocery shelves at 5am (not stocking). About a month ago I was complaining about a coworker on the phone to my boss and accidentally spit out the fact that I'm looking for another job already because my parents don't want me working a part time job anymore, but since that point he's done everything he can to ramp up my hours. This is fine and the intention is there but it really sucks, the way I've been picking up hours is by going to a store and just stocking for 8 hours. It's way more work and I'm pretty miserable. These next two weeks is going to be that without a break because I'm working the weekend, the schedule has already been posted and my boss said it's out of his power to change things around.

200,"I ( 29F) was sexually assualted by my father when I was small. There isn't a time i can remember him not being that. First memories i have is him touching me, when i was 6 or 7. I didn't know it was bad and i didn't mind. But it got rough I still have scars on my thighs from his nails. In grade 6 our teacher told us a atory and that's when I realized that it's bad. My mother was then pregnant with my 2nd brother. But I told her next time he tried to do it. I screamed and I told her that he tried to touch me. She was devastated. She didn't ask me about past and I didn't have the courage to. She told her mother and mother in law both. Their advice was to not tell anyone else. At the time our house was still building and we had no doors so my mother asked me to wear this tight bell bottom at night everyday. 

But he was caugjt by mother trying to peek through the curtain when im dressing for schooland mother asked me to go in the corner and dress and asked me how i dressed. The order when i undressed and dressed for school which made me uncomfortable and lied about it saying i way that i was not fully undressed. It made me feel like it's my fault. Yet she fought with him every time i told her and not told her, basically every time. But it wouldn't stop. He couldn't do more than touching because i would scream but he wouldn't stop that either

We would visit my grandma, mother's MIL twice a year and my mom would say this happened everytime because it didn't stop and they would ask me to come and she would advice her son infront of me and mom. He was silent at that time but he didn't stop it. He even offered me money when i was in ALs. I didn't say that to my mother. She actually dis nothing except fight with him and every time she fought for something else she brought it up and it felt like being used all over again. When my grandma's family  found out they accused mom that it was her inability to keep her husband satisfied. We cut off ties with them, me and mother not the brothers. She would then tell to his friends and everyone and all they asked was am i really my father's biological daughter.  She got more hurt. It shouldn't matter anyway but people are jerks sometimes. 

What I can't bear is that she still thinks that women should not divorce even things get hard. Women go astray and men take advantage and things like that. I'm not married and had hard time keeping relationships. I know she stayed because she was pressured and she didn't know how to do a job nor had the skill, Also we want a dad to get married. But even if i know that it isn't good enough excuse for me. She didn't know i was actually sexually assaulted. She never talked to me about it nor let me talk, she said not to think about it whenever i started to talk about what happened. 

I now have a good job and an engineer but this attitude from her, i want to tell her but I'm scared evrything will break down. My brother 2 yrs youger is going to get married soon. I don't want him in my wedding if i ever had one but its huge now. 
All my mother knows is that my father tpuched me inappropriately and after i started telling her he had no chance doing anything else. I don't know what to do? Should i tell her?",18Dec2020,1
201,"I work in a field where you are very much in a vulnerable position as an employee. Basically, you must keep the same job for 4 years and you have no option for other employment if you ever want to use your degree. The employer can discipline you and fire you leaving you without options if they choose to for whatever reason.

I was recently given a less than stellar performance review (we get them monthly) my other ones have always been great. It was really scathing, and basically said that I was deficient and messed around all day vs. focusing on work. I hope that you take my word for it, but the review felt largely political and unfair because there was someone who openly disliked me and was very close with my supervisor apparently. I noticed my supervisor acted distant during that time. (We get a new one every month) There's no way to rebut it, and that's not why I am making this post. I try to hard at work and when I got it I felt like the wind got knocked out of me and I just felt my heart break you know?

After ranting to my family and SO about it for 2 weeks they're really tired of hearing about it, but my confidence is just shot. I find myself doing socially anxious stuff at work now all the time afraid that I will do stuff that will make someone else not like me and buy me another bad report-- something I feel like I can't afford to have. I find myself doing creepy stuff like over apologizing or being constantly concerned I've offended someone. I noticed without thinking about it that my body language is really closed off and I catch myself crossing my arms a lot and sitting with bad posture etc. I told myself after the review that I'd ask for feedback more often to make sure that I don't get another surprise, but still I am acting weird.

My work is so consuming that I don't have a lot of ways to feel good about myself that I am proud of otherwise. I think the only thing that is going to heal this is time and hopefully future good comments. I don't know how to make myself better.

Lately I have been noticing that in time a person that I considered my best friend suddenly now I hate them (kind off). So I have been very dramatic and getting angry at my friends, some examples: the last thing was that I wanted to play with them and they said yes but later so I was waiting for the one that would have the game. But no one said anything, so I thought we weren't playing that night. I was wrong I said with a meme that we didn't play, but they said they were waiting for me but they never said anything, but they supposedly said it (only one of them apologized for it and I know for a fact I had no way of knowing they were in a call). You can read this and say woow that is childish and yes my reader i think you would be right so I need help because that is the way I feel i can't control it, so how can I be less temperamental and be less angry at my friends for simple reasons?

207,"Hey guys, really would like some insight here in how to gracefully handle this situation. TLDR at the bottom. 
 
I currently work in an industry that’s heavily involved in COVID-19 vaccine. My team has been working to the point of total burn out. 7am-10pm, 7 days a week. To put it bluntly: it’s a shitshow. There have been many tears. 

Background on my current role. I make about $43k a year (before taxes lol) and have a team of less than 7. Our team is understaffed. Since the pandemic started and we went WFH, it finally occurred to me just how awful my manager is. They pawn all their work onto me and my coworker (we two directly report to them), they are extremely checked out, and they don’t support our director at all. They give us work with no context and we regularly have to figure issues out with little to no support from them at all. Any support we get is literally “email x person.” To be honest, I resent them for how little they give a fuck about us. This job is my first one out of college so I knew I’d move on eventually. I’ve been in the role for 2 years, and have been applying to jobs within the company for the past year. 

I recently applied for a role that is directly related to my masters degree in which I would be making $60k a year, and I would be working with people that I already indirectly work with (they’re wonderful). To be honest, I get more recognition for my hard work by their team than I do from my own manager. They told me that they will be extending an offer before Christmas.

I feel conflicted. The timing of this could not be worse with the pandemic and how much stress is on the team. 

On one hand this would absolutely be the next step in my career that makes sense. I also would like to be able to actually save a portion of my paycheck. 

On the other hand, while our team leadership is garbage, my close coworkers (non management level) always have my back and are going to be the most fucked over by me leaving the team because I know our managers won’t rise up and help. I feel A LOT of guilt. 

Realistically, because I’m switching teams within the company I’m sure my transition will be slow while we deal with the pandemic — but what would you do? How would you gracefully handle this situation? 

TLDR; my team is burn out and understaffed during pandemic, our management sucks and leaving the team would only further strain my coworkers that I care about. But taking this job is the right next step for my career. How do I gracefully handle this situation?",18Dec2020,2
208,"Okay, where do I begin?

Brief intro, I'm an eighteen-year-old male a few months away from finishing Highschool. I wasn't the best student, (I.E I didn't do any of the work, and pretty much slacked off for a very long time.) however, I got my act together towards the end and pulled through. I made more than a few social mistakes, some worse than others, which made me stand out as outlandishly strange, weird, and awkward for the majority of my high school career. Think the cringy anime kid thing you'd see online, that was me and when I tell you I gave up, I really mean it.

It was during my last year I got my act together after meeting a teacher who drastically saved my life, and while that may sound melodramatic it's entirely true. This amazing teacher of mine was the reason I got my three girlfriends, two of which were extravagantly out of my league. He's the reason why I even planned on going to college for aerospace engineering, why I chose to take care of my appearance, socialize and so much more. It's through him I got the idea to become a basic EMT/Firefighter to pay for college, not just run off to the military or take in unscrupulously large amounts of student debt through loans, not to mention the scholarships I have because of him.

Well, the thing is quite recently, my mother requested that I'd go to Texas to take care of her Dad, my Grandpa to make things clear. He's old, not at the age where he's always bedridden but not too far from it. He lives in a medium-sized house in a rather poor condition, and the neighbors whilst family, did at one point in time steal from him when they should have been caring for him. There's also the problem of him smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, despite his age, which is undoubtedly going to lead to rather poor health in the near future. 

I've talked to my Teacher about this, although I didn't go into depth on the condition of the house, and I'm not sure if I should here either. To my surprise, he told me to go through with it and move to Texas! This took me entirely by surprise but he explained how much easier it was to live there since everything was so affordable compared to California, that the people are good and it'd be like starting a whole new life! He made it sound like a spectacle, and I understand that this is quite literally, a once in a lifetime opportunity!  My teacher guided me to where I am now, on the verge of college with a plan to actually survive, maybe even escape the monotony of life through investments, business creation, and connections! 

My Teacher's never, ever been wrong. He's done what he could for every student he could find, and while he couldn't save them all, he saved me, including most of my small circle of friends, which isn't many, unfortunately. The thing is, all this planning we've done, all this scheduling and setting time frames for life, all of it was designed to be in California. Yet, while he keeps his composure as a teacher, I can tell he's adamite about me going, and as I said before, he's never been wrong. 

I'm not close to my mother, not as much as my brothers and sisters are, my Grandpa even less so. Apparently, he was there in my youth, took care of me for years but the only memory I have of him was a brief three day stay two summers ago. He's not a bad guy, his house is recoverable and I have the knowledge to fix or repair most of the issues. I've checked a few days ago and there's a job at a chicken factory I could work, you know, cutting off chicken heads for a living. Manual labor isn't really my specialty, but I'm getting off track. I just want to know what to do here.

The last thing before the TLDR, I call my Grandpa, Uncle so I've probably made the mistake in here somewhere, it's weird, I know but it's a habit

Tl:DR, My mother wants me to move to Texas and take care of my Grandpa, my Teacher does too but I'm not sure if it's better than staying in California. Advice?",18Dec2020,2

I’ve worked so many retail and food service jobs in my life and fucking hate them so much. Plus the pay is so minuscule I don’t see how I’d ever be able to get out of my parents house. They refuse to co-sign for me and my credit is in the dumpster so I can’t even get approved to live anywhere besides on campus housing. When places started to shut down because of covid the restaurant I was closed and I started getting unemployment. The unemployment had a $600 a week boost and was way more than I have ever made at a job which is sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all of 2020 I haven’t been enrolled in school. I’ve been Getting unemployment for the past like 5-6 months and pretty much completely stuck in isolation. This has made me the saddest I have ever been in my life. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and am scared to go to a therapist due to being disqualified for the military (A.K.A my only known route out of poverty). Smoking helps me cope with all of this but I know that’s doing nothing but causing a temporary solution for a permanent issue. I’m trying to not rely on any substances but waking up everyday and just trying to kill time until I’m tired enough to fall back asleep again is driving me insane. I’m in a pretty nice house but sometimes can feel like a prisoner in here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if there is something wrong with me or what. I live in a filthy room with clothes all over the place but the house in general is super clean, and even has a cleaning lady that comes every week I just can’t bring myself to maintain cleanliness. My hygiene is out the window I often wear the same clothes everyday until I notice they start to smell and have pretty much the same mentality about showering. I live in isolation and can go weeks without calling, texting, or talking to anyone besides my parents whom I just run into around the house from time to time. I’ve had substance abuse problems for the last couple of years. I wasn’t always like this, going into college I would workout everyday, often shower twice a day, cared dramatically about how I looked (often referred to as metrosexual) and was known as outgoing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t even understand myself how I got quite this deep down the rabbit hole but I recognized all these behavioral issues and know that they aren’t normal, are the root of my problems, and need to be changed. So I don’t think I’m autistic or anything. But sometimes comments by my parents make me feel like I have a disability. Recently my dad told me “you should go to the doctor and see if you have anything wrong with you” another distinguished memory I have is once when I refused to cover my microwaved food with a paper plate because I claim they are a carcinogen my mother said in front of me “see I think he has something wrong with him, like mentally” what hurt the most is that statement implied they have had this conversation before. The worst of them all was when I overheard my mother say “I wish Robert was our son...well maybe I shouldn’t say that”. Robert is a family friend who’d similar in age and recently commissioned in the Air Force as a pilot. It drove me crazy hearing that. That one definitely made me feel expendable and fucked me up for a few months until I Drunkly addressed it to them, which they acted like she never said that... I at least appreciate the effort to not let me find out. She couldn’t even look me in the eyes for quite a few days after I told them I heard that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I’m pretty fuck in the head I guess n I have no one to sort this out with. Typing this out alone has slightly helped, I feel like a burden to the only 2 people left in my life. Like my existence at this point is selfish, I can only imagine having sex one day only to have a chronically depressed grown man in your house 23 years later with no way of getting rid of him on the foreseeable future. I know everything that has happened it completely my fault and I’m not even completely sure what the goal of posting this is. Does anyone have any sort of ideas on how to get out of his situation? I’ve recently looked into truck driving as an alternative to going back to university if the PLC program didn’t seem to work out for one reason or another. There is a company called Rohel that will pay for you to get your CDL the problem with that is the trucking life seems to lead to further isolation. I want a job where I can form a friend group and be happy again not be alone for the next 10 years. I’ve already lived a good year of it and can’t stand it. Nobody even told me happy birthday when I turned 23 which is not a big deal but it just goes to show nobody gives a fuck about me and I want to change that.",18Dec2020,1

212,"My mom uses apps like Tik-Tok and Instagram to inform herself about things like COVID or political stuff. I wouldn’t mind this if she wasn’t only following accounts and reading articles that only support what she thinks. All she ever talks about is how Trump didn’t lose the election and how Coronavirus isn’t bad. Today she asked if I wanted to go to a restaurant tomorrow even though COVID cases are rising and how she isn’t going to get the vaccine because it’s dangerous. Now I’m concerned for her life because of all of this misinformation she is feeding herself. I want to delete those apps and make her a reddit account and have her follow the coronavirus and the politics subreddits.

216,"Yesterday, my cat usually roaming in streets, she was a very friendly and a nice cat, she loved little walks in parks, but in my locality, there are bunch of stray dogs, people feed them and take care of them too, they are usually nice, very peaceful dogs but they can be lethal sometimes (It is very common in my country for stary dogs to roam outside, authorities ignore them).
So, she was just sitting outside without distrubing or challenging them, and she was very far away from dogs too, but a dog attacked her, grabbed her, bit her by the powerful canines, thrashed her into ground several times and two other dogs were also beating and thrashing her, before we could  take her for medical treatment, she died in pain, her legs were broken, half of the tail was hanging, blood rushing out of stomach.

217,"Background: I am decently overweight (stomach, love handles, not the leanest jawline). but with a shirt on i look decently buff and barely fat bcz i have a strong chest.

I work at my fathers retail store and over the summer he hired this girl my age. Well this is in the middle of the pandemic so we both r always wearing masks, but regardless we ended up always chatting and flirting A LOT at work. I genuinely believe this girl started crushing on me like i’m crushing on her. I knew that after the summer she was going back to college and would return to work for my fathers store during winter break. so i delayed making a move until winter break so i could achieve my dream body and then make a move, because honestly in my head i was afraid that without the mask and shirt she might not find me as attractive, as she is very very attractive and in shape contradictory to me (i’ve seen her without a mask, not vice versa) however now it’s winter break and she’s back. but instead of getting my dream body i fucking gained around 20 pounds. ik it’s terribly unhealthy but online school + all my friends being at college rlly took a toll on me this semester (i’m trying to lose it). Now the clock is running out bcz i’m not going to wait all the way to the summer to make a move so i can achieve my dream body first (out of fear she gets a BF), but i’m terribly scared that if i ask her out and she sees me without a mask and eventually without a shirt she would be very disappointed in my physique and it would not go past the first date or whatever.  

Listen. ik this is outrageously insecure, ik this sounds like stupid teen drama, and ik this holistically is all overblown. but i’m crushing for this girl real bad, i can’t stop thinking about her, and every time i think about her i get overwhelmed with a wave of anxiety of how fat i got and disappointed she may be. ik ppl will say “if she is that shallow than u dodged a bullet” but like most ppl my age are shallow when initially judging someone, especially when they expect better. i just want it to work out, i just want to stop being so anxious, i just wish i didn’t let myself go these couple of months and i had some confidence. idek what answers i’m looking for on this sub man, i just want to be happy with this chick. i hate these feeling so much, i’m confused by my insecurities mixed with my crush on this girl. hopefully i don’t sound like a shallow asshole myself but this is just the reality of what’s going on in my head. like hypothetically speaking if i have sex with her (ya ik big assumption) one time and then she realizes i’m gross and never talks to me again idk how i could cope with that. fuck me, ik im being a bitch but fuck i can’t get over myself.",18Dec2020,3
218,"Hey this is my first post... I'm [M/18] and well, I'm really chaotic, so here's a really unorganized post (sorry, the english isn't really on point, I'm from Germany)


A few things about me:

1. I'm single, and I've always been. And yes, I'm a virgin too.

2. Everyone of my friends thinks I'm like the most extroverted guy ever, but that is only partly true. I am very good with a lot of people and I do get around with everyone really well. I am always just DOING the stuff I feel like doing, like randomly dancing or singing in public, jumping around and doing all kinds of fun stuff and I'm totally comfortable doing all that. However, I'm really shy when it comes to emotions and talking about those. I basically don't have anyone I tell about all my emotions, although a lot of my friends/family are so close and so nice I totally could and I would totally trust them with that, but I somehow just can't do it. 

3. Well and I'm probably the shyest guy ever when it comes to approaching girls. Never had any success with that. Like, never. Although I gotta admit that it mostly never got as far as me making an approach at all. That maybe only happened twice, ever. Both times failed miserably. When I talk to girls I can easily make friends with them, almost alway. However as soon as there's a romantic interest or something of that sort, I can still mostly make friends with them, but as far as romantic approaches go, I'm the worst. EVER.

Basically, I overthink everything related to romance.






Well, let's come to the actual topic of this post: I think I'm in love. I'm not entirely sure, but like 85%. It's a girl I know for about three years now, and we've gotten really close friends over that time. Let's just call her Sarah (not the real name).
Over the last month or so I realized I might love her. She is like the nicest girl I know, I always have a lot of fun with her and she has a lot of similar interests as me, and she is just the kind of girl which I could imagine having at my side for the rest of my life.

We both went to the same school and came from the same school and lived in the same city. Now I moved somewhere else with a friend (let's just call him John) because we both wanted to study there. We both share an apartment now.
Me and Sarah are calling each other every once in a while and almost always end up talking for hours. But that doesn't mean she has any feelings towards me, I know she is doing that with other close friends of her to, like John.
About a year ago, John told Sarah that he loves her, but she rejected him because she didn't love him and she had a boyfriend. They also were close friends and they still are today. 
By now, Sarah is single for about half a year, she left her boyfriend because he wasn't really caring enough about her. John has a girlfriend since about half a year now and he really really loves her and he got over that little thing with Sarah.



Well, now Sarah is here, at our apartment, visiting for a few nights (because, hey we're all good friends, why shouldn't we meet?) Well and it's a really weird situation for me because John and Sarah get along really well, he always kind of teases her, they have little fights here and there (like when he tries to tickle her, she fights back etc.)

And I end up feeling like I'm third-wheeling... Which again, is a really weird feeling since I know John hasn't got any romantic interest in her. But like, because they do those things all the time, I can't really join in because it would just be weird, if you know what I mean? Plus, it would feel kind of like a romantic approach for me which prevents my mind from doing it. And aaaaaaaaaaarghkhhj, I din't know what to do, I don't know if she loves me or if she just sees me as a friend... I'm just overthinking everything way too much but I can't stop. 



Plus, I'm in a very bad state mentally since I'm also struggling a lot with attention in my University courses, I've become very lazy and uninterested in my studies (which I actually was enthusiastic about before), I'm procrastinating everything and I'm failing all of my classes because of that. It's not like I don't try, but I always end up with the same result: me doing nothing but thinking about still having to do it all the time. My life just kind of sucks and losing hope of my love loving me back doesn't make it better.

So sorry, this was really messy, but I just wanted to get it out there. I'd like to talk to some random people here about stuff like that because I don't have the courage to do it in real life.

221,"Since I was about 15, I’d been on a pretty desperate search for answers on why I’m so weird. I never fit in, and definitely was never able to hang out or something, even in elementary school. Having an extroverted personality that requires people to at least know you exist on earth never helped either. I’d seen people claim online for years that people who are really smart or really dumb have tough times socializing, and I’d always felt like I was a lot smarter than most people (but note that I never came off as some sort of know it all). I decided to get a psychological evaluation for my IQ, turns out it’s 143.

When I went back to the psychologist for the 2 hour appointment where he’d the give the result and explain everything, I asked him how that could’ve affected my ability to socialize. He asked a bunch of questions that I answered honestly (even though I felt every shred of self esteem left in me get ripped out during that). He said that based off what I was telling him, it’s likely that my intelligence prevented me from relating to the other kids when I first began school. That created a vicious cycle throughout the years where I fell behind socially, thus withdrew more from social situations, thus falling further behind socially, etc.

These past few years I’ve had absolutely no hope for the future. Getting out of bed is just as hard as knowing that I woke up. I have literally no motivation to do anything, and I’ve become a complete shut-in. The closest I can get to seeing someone who I might recognize is if I see an old classmate or something from high school or something like that, and there’s no a chance they’d recognize me.

When I started my junior year of high school, I dropped out. After my parents forced me to get a GED, I went to college. I dropped out of that too after I finished a semester. The severe depression combined with the stress of typing essay after essay, with no motivation to do so, destroyed me. After that I got a job selling expensive new cars, but I got fired after 6 days of being on the job because I couldn’t sell a single car. To put in perspective how big of a failure that was... I worked 72 hours in those 6 days. None of the humiliation I faced in school topped that... for the first time I felt like I was literally not even human, like something must be so severely wrong in my brain. I’ve felt like nobody would ever understand for years but that took it to a whole new level. I went home and tried to kill myself with a very... painful method. I chose the method because I thought there would be no chance at survival, but here I am.

I’ve been in therapy for years, I’ve also been being medicated for years. None of it helped.

If I don’t register for the spring semester full time and then pass all of the classes, my parents are going to kick me out. I’m gonna have no money, no resources, nothing. I’m gonna be homeless. Either way, it’s going to get a lot worse.

*I guess this post is another part of a desperate search for a solution. A big part of me knows that’s it’s either gonna be a miracle or a suicide. However, a small part of me still hopes that there could possibly be somebody to give some sort of comment that could eventually lead to a solution, that kind of thing. Like a shred of hope, I guess.*

224,"Tw: suicide, mental health 

Hi everyone, I really need some advice here.
This story is not about me, but I would like to give some context as to why I might be more “paranoid” -
Since middle school, it has seemed that everyone close to me wants to die. My best friends, both in middle school and college, OD’d in a suicide attempt (neither one of them were harmed), my older and younger sister both self-harmed when they were in high school and had to be put in suicide watch. There have been a few others.

My husband was suicidal right before we met as a result of both a disastrous break up and losing a friend to suicide. Over the years I’ve known him, he has had a few bouts of depression, and sometimes off-handedly mentions the guilt he feels over the loss of his friend, but he has never sought help. Lately, with Covid and everything else going on, I can tell his mental health is suffering but he just shrugs it off. He has been constantly mentioning his friend who passed, and how it was his fault. We even looked at support groups together, but now he says he doesn’t want to go. He has not been himself lately, and I can tell he is really struggling. It really worries me. How can I convince him to get help without over stepping my bounds?",18Dec2020,2

226,"Edit: I forgot to add that I'm a 23F. My brother is 22M, my best friend is 24M and my husband is 25M. Other super close friend is 20M

So I have a half brother, we have the same dad but different moms. We were raised apart our whole lives but I met him once in 5th or 6th grade since we went to the same school together but then I moved and went to another city when I was 10. I lost all contact with him since then. I met and found him again around the same time I met my now-husband. I married my husband 34 days after meeting him lol. I saw my brother day of my wedding is the first time we saw each other in years. This was back in very early 2019. I'm actually super excited right now because a few days ago was the anniversary of us meeting each other and we had a very cute date, and in exactly 31 days is our wedding anniversary which I'm all giddy about. Sorry got off-topic. Since the wedding, my brother and I didn't talk for a long time again until this October.

He really likes a girl and wanted my advice. So, he came over to my place and we talked for a few hours. During that, he had a hard time explaining how he was teaching a girl he liked how to bowl. He walked over to me and pressed up against me from behind. He had one hand on the side of me and the other on y arm as he explained what he was doing. This lasted about 10 seconds but during it, mid-way through a sentence he suddenly paused and I actually felt his body flinch for a second and he right away let me go and sat down immediately at the table near me. Beforehand he was standing while talking to me and he even said he generally doesn’t like sitting and will stand and talk with people.

He then continued talking like nothing happened but stayed sitting for like 30 minutes. After that, he began calling and texting every day, sometimes multiple times a day always wanting to hang out with me. He literally has no problem driving every day 20 miles to see me. My best friend can't stand it. He says my brother is weird and this isn’t normal at all. He even got my husband involved and now my husband is suddenly using the excuse that because of the virus, my brother can’t come over anymore for the rest of the year.

I do understand why as things to way more deeper than my brother just him seeing me and talking to me all the time. My husband has no say in it as he stands firm with his word of my brother not allowed to see me for a while. My best friend points out every single thing of how it's so wrong. He will get absolutely angry over it and stuff. And here’s why. They went from saying it's awkward to absolute no about him about 2 weeks ago. And here’s why.

The texts suddenly changed about 2 weeks ago.I noticed when I would tell him something and he would tell it to someone else, he would refer it as ""My ex said this"" instead of ""My sister said this"" He shortly later started using a lot of love emojis when texting me. Like kissing heart emoji, emojis with hearts in the eyes, or just pure heart emojis towards me. It’s not just that but also texts he will say to me too. Like for instance my brother just found out the school I go to. He right away decided to transfer to my school. He even decided to take the exact same class as me despite him already taking the same class in the past and already knowing everything related to the teachings. I’m currently in Japanese business classes. Which is business but it’s taught in Japanese due to there being an internship attached to it that will take to me Japan in August. Thus I have to take a specific amount of Japanese classes as well despite me actually knowing Japanese already. Well… My brother actually also had a huge fascination with Japanese and finished all his Japanese courses last year so he’s fluent in it as well.

My brother often offers to help me with my Japanese homework even though I actually don’t need it, and also my best friend is Japanese, and he is generally always there to pretty much answer any questions I have anyways and I only need practice with things like not pausing so much when I speak in it. My pronunciation is perfect my best friend says, but we both noticed my brother has an accent or doesn’t pronounce certain words correctly and he talks like… in an anime type of way instead of like an actual normal conversation type. Also, my brother has issues with Kanji which both my husband and best friend know fully as they will help with that as they knew how to read in Kanji their whole life due to being raised in eastern Asia before coming to America, and I know how to read and write in Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji as well, but don’t know as many Kanji as a typical person compared to someone who is from Japan. Despite this my brother wants me to go to him instead of those 2.

Now for the stuff that my best friend and husband think is beyond okay. Some things my brother has said is very… IDK how to put it. He is very attentive to what he says. He will automatically correct himself if he notices something wrong in something he says. When he asked when we can meet up I said soon basically and he said “Sweet!!!” With blowing kiss emoji. I showed my husband instantly asking if it's normal for siblings to send emojis like that and he stared at it and read a bit of our messages and then said as a joke ""Does he realize we're not in Alabama?"" and dropped it at that for a while.

Another time I was talking about our dad's funeral. Our grandma from Dad's side out of the blue during it at the end of the day ran to my hotel in barely anything while naked. I told that to my brother and he replied with “I can imagine grandma let alone you naked in public sis” Which sort of led to him saying he would run naked if it was allowed. Then when I commented that the main reason I never show my body too much or wear fit tight clothing is because of the attention I get too much from men.

I have a body type that is sorta extremely noticeable. As I have very large breasts and a butt that’s large too, but my waist is small. I’m also like 5’2 so just small in general which does gain too much attention than I’d like. My brother mentioned that my body probably makes me pick up side-guys all the time even if I’m married with some side smile smirk whatever its called emoji and wink face emoji. The thing that bothers my best friend the most is when my brother and I were going to see each other and then as he was getting ready to go, my brother texted, “You wanna bang”. Which I just fully froze not knowing what to respond. My best friend asked what’s wrong and why I looked so pale and he looked at the text and got pretty angry and said “What the fuck?! What type of sibling says that shit?!” Another super close friend of mine also said pretty much the same thing.

I thought my brother meant to say hang but I noticed he didn’t correct himself. I asked what? With an lol because I didn’t wanna lose my mind. He then said it will wake me up. Then suddenly said “Wait you’re not a fan of energy drinks” which I never actually told him if I drink energy drinks or not, I only told him I don’t drink coffee. He then actually asked what flavor I wanted and which I chose Unicorn and then he actually brought an energy drink with the name Bang on it. My best friend left before my brother came. The next day my best friend kept pointing out how my brother purposely worded it the way he did. And that He’s testing me. And when it doesn’t go right he uses actual things as a backup plan to make it look like he was joking. And then said if my brother wanted to give me a bang energy drink he would have said “Do you want a bang?” or “Want a bang energy drink?” and not “You wanna bang?”

The second time something similar happened was when my brother asked for Christmas presents what I wanted. I said I really don’t know and he said something like “I just got an idea or am idea hehe” with that wide eye smirk again. I asked what Idea and he asked what I do for art. Then asked if I wanna procreate. I was like What again and my super close friend was with me in a Skype call when that happeend he Was so unhappy. He said he doesnt like my brother and he's a complete creep and I need to stop talking to him. Then my brother said it was a digital programing app and that it’s a monthly subscription thing. And said he can get it for me and I can mess around with it if I wanted to and that we can get started on it whenever I have time. Which I later told my best friend in the morning when he came over and he said why did my brother word it like that again and is like “See!!!! Do you see Sweet\_Lillylove!!! He sounds like he wants to bone you for fucks sake!!!” And that’s when he got my husband involved.

I showed my husband the texts already from previous things my brother said but this time I showed him the “Wanna bang” one too and the extra heart emojis and stuff and how my brother says he wouldn’t trade me for the world and that I’m everything to him. And my husband actually paused and made an expression I never seen him have before. And he put down my phone and said my brother isn’t allowed over anymore for the rest of the year. He pointed out that the day he came over my brother seemed too close to me too. As my brother sat facing towards me but we were so close that I was sort of between his legs as he man spread like normal guys do. But we didn’t have anything touching aside from my knees a bit on his lower thighs and when my husband saw that he didn’t know if that’s normal for siblings or not but felt like my brother was getting too close to me.

Last thing that happened was my brother a few days ago texted me about topics like porn and sex for like 2 hours. Asked about sensitive spots and I sorta had to explain a lot. And then he asked my personal like where I’m sensitive or if I watch porn and what categories or whatever like that. And I sorta just haven’t really talked to him since and barely reply but will answer the phone if he calls but I make it really short as I’m generally busy anyways.

But what should I do about this. My husband and best friend absolutely don’t like him. They are paranoid to even have me in the same room as my brother alone. They noticed within sentences back to back my brother said he fucks when he’s drunk, then the next literal sentence he said he had 2 different types of alcohol and asked if I wanted to drink it with him. But he can’t come over and my best friend will refuse to let me go see my brother. He made a comment also the other day of saying our dad would say something, but like… He’s only seen our dad like 5 times since being 8. But he said “If dad as alive he would say ‘hey kids! Nothing beats great porn, unless you got a chick with big titties’ I can just imagine dad saying that if he heard us talking” I tried to brush it off and said maybe who knows. While I know he’s made hints at my tits being big before.

I just want a normal sibling relationship but not this weird stuff. I don’t really know what to do at all. Does anyone have advice of what to do with my brother? Also my brother and I are 6 months apart in age. We are like a copy of each other in all interests and activities. So we get along super well. So I don’t wanna lose him, but I want things to go back to normal like it was a month ago.

TL:DR, Brother is being low key Alabama game of thrones with me and my 2 best friends and husband are not okay with it and IDK how to deal with it and want my brother to be normal again.

Edit 2: When my husband said my brother can't come over due to the virus and stuff he got himself tested a few days later and showed the results were negative right away so that he can see me again.

228,"Hey guys, I need some advice because I’m literally so sad right now and I don’t even know if my sadness is reasonable... It was my birthday this week and no one seemed to have remembered my birthday even some close friends forgot, my parents were the only ones who actually remembered. I thought that maybe they’re all busy and all but I really didn’t expect my best friend who I’ve known for 7+ years since middle school (we’re now in our 20s) to forget my birthday. And here’s the thing, I texted him giving him a hint the next day and nothing. He still hasn’t replied back to my texts which is weird because he always replies back fast within the same day but it’s been a couple of days now.  During our last conversation before I texted him, I was checking up on him like I always do to my friends at the beginning of each month just to see if they okay and he said that he’s okay and that he’s excited for his Christmas break soon. I understand that maybe he’s busy with work and maybe I’m just being stupid here but I’ve also given a few hints to 2 of my close friends about my birthday and how they kinda missed it and they replied back almost immediately... It just hurts a lot more since it’s my best friend who forgot about me... I’m actually always that one friend who remembers everyone’s birthdays (without the help of Facebook) and actually gets all excited as soon as the clock strikes 12am to wish them all a Happy Birthday. Maybe my expectations are just high or stupid but I can’t shake off this sadness that I’m feeling right now... any advice? ugh... it’s probably my fault and I’m just overthinking here. I’m sorry for wasting your time everyone...

229,"I read something today that talked about how teenage years are the best years of your life and that you can do whatever you want at this age. I'm 15, I have no IRL friends, I don't have any passions, I never get out of my comfort zone, and my life is pretty monotonous because I never do anything new. I only really watch youtube and daydream these days. I can't even read books anymore. Am I wasting away the best years of my life? Are these really the best years? How do I change myself?",18Dec2020,1
230,"My solution through the years has been to just take them for a walk around a park and talk (not as easy in the winter during covid). And that fear pops up later in a relationship. I don't like the idea of joint accounts (many people loose money if things don't work out), and so I like splitting most things. My last girlfriend would put me in positions where she would point at something on vacation or on some random days and hint at wanting me to buy it for her. I have at times, but it makes me feel angry and resent her the times I do, and the times I don't, she's angry. I keep wondering if other men feel this way, or if it's a weird thing I have. I typically make the same or less than the people I've dated, not that that should always matter, but it's just so annoying. When I feel happy, I may want to buy her something, but the expectance of me doing it at times just kills me inside for some reason.

But I HATE the feeling of being used monetarily because of my sex. For a long time I didn't have a job, and then I got a good one, lost it, then got a better one a year later. So... it's like I can afford it now, but I still harbor a sense of fear and hate for those moments during a dinner or just being out and about... and I feel expected to put in all the effort and money. Yes, even planning, I've had to plan everything all of the time.

Do other men feel this way?

Are most women this way? I just want things to be equal.",18Dec2020,1
231,"Should I respond to him or let him go (read below)? LONG READ

So I (21F) met a guy (30M) early last month and he paid for my birthday dinner (gave me $100)... long story short ... our initial encounter was great...he was a gentleman and respectful and overall just appeared to be everything I wanted (no sex, no sex mentioned) I did later find out when I told him over FaceTime that he missed out on the food that he wasn’t coming to eat he was coming for a hug and kiss. But overall we did have a really good time with lots of laughs. 

I will mention that I later found out he has three kids instead of two while he told me he had two kids and he was 29.

It was a coincidence we even met because he lives in California and I live in Texas. We continued to talk after he flew back home. He was reaching out pretty much every day or every other day at least...this occurred for the first two weeks. He would let me know he made it home safely and he would actually call not just text.

I will also mention that he is a handsome and financially more than stable man so that’s something to keep in mind. He owns his own construction business. I’ve seen him have $20,000 cash and just blow the money on Gucci or LV in which he said he will take me shopping when he comes back in town.

Then that started to change and I would hear from him every 4-5 days. Sometimes when we would FaceTime his phone would die randomly (he has two phones and he used to/still might be doing street activity) and he would never even acknowledge it. The last time I reached out to him about it and he never responded. He just texted me four days letter that he had been thinking about me????? 

This continuous behavior was more of a wake up call to me as I’m clearly naive. I’ve never had a boyfriend before and am a Virgin still as I intend to save myself for the right man and give my gift to him. 

I talked to some close friends and I realized that he has to be talking to other girls or dealing with other women in some form or fashion. In which he has the complete right to, we are not in a committed relationship. He does not owe me any kind of response.

Our first FaceTime call when he got back home he told me how we can just talk every now and then....just basically be friends and that he’ll need to see where I am in five years. Which obviously this is  because we are in two totally different phases of life. I completely understood this and somewhat agreed......but deep down I really liked him just based off our first encounter but it’s not like I had feelings for him. So therefore I stupidly continued to deal with him in any form I could I guess.

The part that bothers me is when he sends me texts saying he can’t wait to see what time does for us or how he loves me and the woman I am and he can’t imagine how stuck he’ll be to me in a few years. He always would call me babe or his lady...and text me randomly that he’s been thinking about me. 

This is obviously not being friendly and after a continuation of this I did develop feelings. But clearly they aren’t reciprocated because he can go almost a week without even talking to me. I think all kinds of things that he probably sends these messages to like 10 girls at a time. If you get the notion he is married, trust me he is not. I just saw him post a video of himself at a strip club.

Now to my question... he texted me over the weekend just saying he had been thinking about me.....I did not respond. Now today (five days later) he texts:

“Hey you ok”

I just feel like if he REALLY cared about me in any kind of regard he would’ve reached out to me sooner than five days later after ignoring his other message. When a man really wants a woman he will do whatever it takes to keep her and obviously his actions show me I’m not that woman for him.

At this point I don’t think I can just be “friends” with him because honestly I’m not sure if it’s possible for male and female to be friends if they are attracted to each other even in the slightest bit. 

His actions make me feel as if he could give two shits about me but for some reason I feel I should reply to his texts but I don’t even know what I would say back at this point to “Hey you ok”??!!!!??!?

I’ve been forcing myself to just let him go and allow him to be a thought of the past but when he comes back around or I see him on FaceTime my brain just goes dumb naive girl again.

***Would you reply to him or just ignore it?

***I know its easy to just tell someone yes, block him but when there are feelings involved it’s not that easy to just say f him and block him. So what would you do if it were your feelings involved.",18Dec2020,2

238,"Can anyone relate to chasing friendships? I (F25) became very close with 3 coworkers (F23,24) around September and we all just clicked and got along super well. Kinda felt like I found my people.

We planned a birthday party for one of the girls and it seemed like I was the only one actually interested in what she wanted to do. I felt I was always advocating for her interests, actually asked what her favorite colors were/what she likes/her favorite flavor cake.

I felt very let down by the lack of coordination and effort on the other two girls behalf. When the birthday girl showed up she later told me she felt let down as well because we had been planning this for a month and it should have just been... better. 

I’m not looking for applause- I just want to know what the heck I’m missing. I want a good friend. I want to be a good friend to someone. I thought I met people who clicked with me and it just seemed like they didn’t know how to be considerate adults.

More background:
In high school my best friend (now F26) was sort of disappointing too. I always had to make the effort (we were super close- and even tho we went to diff schools we were nominated most likely to remain friends in my yearbook.) She’s never answered a single one of my phone calls- ever. We’ve been friends for 11 years now, best friends for probably 6. I’m not sure that she ever did anything for me, I’m being totally serious. I just love/loved her company. We always vibed well and I didn’t need anything from her- just her companionship and even tho it wasn’t always easy she was always worth the time and effort because of our connection. I also have a soft spot for people with difficult backgrounds, she’s one of those people.

This probably sounds ridiculous but the other day I saw she started an Instagram for her gaming/streaming hobby. We talked about it for an hour the day before because she started playing with a celebrity we both are a fan of. I posted her Instagram on my story and encouraged people to follow her. She didn’t say anything to me. Which is honestly fine but if she saw it I thought she’d say something? Then I saw her repost someone else’s post of her Instagram on their story, and I’m like wtf? Why am I not good enough? I don’t need you to repost it for everyone to see- I just maybe would’ve thought a “thanks for supporting me!” Would come after.

More history: When I was young I had a friend from pre-k-3rd grade, and she always slightly bullied me. Would give me the silent treatment for no reason, always had to compete with me, told her mom on me when I touched her chocolate chip cookie one time... I still remember it because I felt so bad. Luckily her mom was just like ... it’s okay eat the cookie. (Bringing this up because this is something I’ve dealt with since childhood.)

Am I too sensitive? Do I read into all this too much? What is going on? I’m not perfect- but I just want to have a mature, mutual considerate and supportive friendship with a girl. I don’t even think my standards are that high. My boyfriend is the least disappointing person I know. He never disappoints me- literally ever. I just want to have a girl I could rely on. 

Maybe I look for too much external validation. But even compliments make me weird- I just want someone to be so excited they have someone who would be thoughtful enough to do something for them. I really do enjoy going out of my way for people. It’s fun for me to put time and effort into gifts and showing someone how special they are to me. I just want someone to care the same way I do.

Sigh. Can anyone relate? How do I get over myself? I don’t want to keep myself in a cycle of disappointing friendships. I know the key to not being disappointed is not expecting anything- but I don’t even think I’m expecting a lot. I’m just missing consideration from those I build bonds with. I don’t want to discredit myself for being enthusiastic- I love the person I am and I think I could give the right person who is receiving and also considerate the best friendship! I just don’t know how to get rid of this sadness that makes me feel unappreciated.

Thanks in advance. Thank you for reading if you got here. It felt good to just vent it even. Lots of love.



Sincerely, this little engine is out of steam.

TL;DR I have a hard time with disappointments in friendships. I don’t think I’m asking for/require much. Am I too sensitive? I can’t tell if I want a pat on the back or if I’m just asking for too much. Just tired of being bummed out by inconsiderate friends.",18Dec2020,2

254,"Hello users of r/Advice, I am 18 years old and currently a college student staying with my parents. I am asking for an escape from my current reality.

I have been planning to stay with some friends the week after Christmas to hang out, make gingerbread houses and stuff like that. The five of us were planning on staying together at one of their houses. My mother came in today to ask about the details and so I told her. She proceeded to tell me that a week was too long and that it is unacceptable. I told her this would be good thing because I would be moving out soon and I that have an internship coming up during the summer out of state that I will be at for a few months. She told me that I was not going to do that. She said that I’m going to stay with her until I can graduate from college. She told me that it is disgraceful to do that to her and the family. She said that other people would look at her like a failure if I did so. 

At this point I don’t care what she thinks, feels, or does. She is not my mother anymore. My home is the prison, I am the prisoner and she is the guard. 

She constantly controls and manipulates me into feeling bad to her to the point where I don’t know what to think. I don’t feel like my own person anymore. I don’t feel free to make my own decisions without consulting her first. 

The problem is, I have a lot of money saved up in a joint bank account with her. She also has most of my cash (well into the four figures) stashed in a safe somewhere in the house. I don’t know how to get that money without her stopping me. My biggest fear is that she will pull all my money out my account and I just wont have access to it anymore.

I would like to know if it is possible to take the money out of the account and placing it into my own bank account  without her finding out. Also if anyone can think of a way to get the money from the safe without being suspicious that would be great. 

However, before I secure the money I need to find a place to stay. I have been looking into house hacking a multifamily home and living there. Any advice on how to find a multifamily home and what to look for would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice on my to purchase one and who to contact. 

I plan on cutting all contact with them after I leave. Please do not ask me to reconsider leaving. The years of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and manipulation is quickly becoming too much for me.

Is there any hope at all? I love him but I am just so hurt. I don’t want to end it but I’m hoping for some ideas just incase there are any.

258,"This was the only place I could think to ask this.

I'm a 19 year-old male (FtM, not rly passing), and I was taking my final for my business math class, and idly talking to keep myself at a low level of stress. I'll admit that, over time, my filter started to disappear, and I started talking vaguely about some very personal trauma I'd experienced; I just...forgot I was being recorded for review, to be honest. It just felt like I was talking to someone, rather than just to myself, and while I didn't go into detail, it began to upset me to think back on it. I started crying just as I was finishing the exam, not sobbing, but tearing up.

One of my professors (not this one) watches the entirety of our exam recordings to prevent academic dishonesty, I don't know if this professor will do that, but I'm scared he'll be concerned for me, and I really don't want to talk about it, especially since I wasn't upset over the test, but personal matters. I'm very uncomfortable talking to authority figures, and teachers have never been trustworthy figures in my life.

Should I email him asking for his discretion and not to be concerned? Or just hope he doesn't see it and try to forget what happened? I really don't know what to do. I'm already gripped with anxiety over being accused of cheating during these stupid recorded exams, I just really don't want any trouble, or anything else that'll stress me out.",18Dec2020,1
260,"You see, I was upset.

I'm supposed to get my roster every Sunday for the next three weeks. I didn't get anything in my email, and I got their last email. I sent a message to my manager who didn't reply...I was very upset because this would be the second time I would have to call the store to ask them to send me a roster.

So I didn't call and also thought the manager was ignoring me. I sent the message on Monday.

Tuesday comes along then Wednesday, and I was angry and thought I lost my job and sent a message to the company that if they did want to let me go, the leat they could have done was contact me.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly when I check my email the same day, the head of our store was upset and told me to call her. I called and she was so very angry that I wrote the mail to the company. I said I was sorry that she was upset, but I was angry too that I never got the roster and had no idea even Monday morning when and what time I had work. (My shifts were getting to only 2 days a week, so of course I assumed I just got nothing aswell).

The manager and head said they both tried calling me and messaging me but it went straight to voice mail. I said I'm sorry that that has happened, I didn't receive any messages or phone calls but that it was also on them that I always have to call to ask about my roster. She was going to talk to the manager and that was that.

This is where I fucked up, I didn't know, but when you restart your phone it can reset it, so I did that and lo and behold, I got all the missed calls and messages, even a reply from my message on Monday.

I am so upset at myself that I fucked up this way. I don't think they will believe me at all if I tell them this because I suddenly got all these messages.

On the other side, I am still upset that they never sent me that roster...

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on how to handle this situation; I found out from the missed message that I'm working on Sunday, and rather by message, I want to talk to the manager in person and apologize...

I feel like a complete idiot, I should have just called the store and have no idea what came over me but being upset my shifts were being cut, new people being hired and that I never got the roster and having to keep calling them in store to get the info...I'm going crazy thius weekend and can't sleep because of what is to come...",18Dec2020,1
261,"Yeah, perhaps you guessed it. It's one of those teenage self-deprecation posts.
I was 15, practicing for a poetry reading competition with 3 other friends. My teacher/coach one day looks at me and goes :""You're actually deeply insecure, aren't you?""

Since then, this has permeated my life. Everything I do or say, I quickly realise that I did it out of insecurity. I tend to one up people around me.I compare myself to people around me. My self validation comes from the opposite sex, teachers,adults and my peers.My sentences start with ""I"". 

I know I'm not that bad. I know I'm not ugly, I also know I'm not pretty. I don't have fantastic grades but I don't have shameful grades either. I'm not shy, I'm just not confident. Contrary to most people, I'm not afraid of public speaking, but I doubt myself and pick apart everything I do. 

I just don't believe in myself. I feel like I don't have good judgement and I am unreliable. I feel like I can't say anything without making myself sound like a fool. I lack that kind of self assurance that I can't even order food for myself as a restaurant without someone's opinion on what to eat.

I cry a lot. It's like I can't control my tear ducts. Adults don't understand that I'm trying not to cry but I can't help it. I make a fool of myself by crying when I'm not supposed to. I make myself look vulnerable and somebody that is easily bullied.

I'm terribly scared. That I won't live the life I want to live or live a life thinking I would be happy if I lived someone else's life.

My family knows I have this issue but they assume I'll get over it. I'm afraid to show it because it hurts them too. That's the scariest part of my insecurity, it doesn't only bring myself down, it bring people around me down.

I want to be able to be somebody happy and self confident. But at this point, I have no one to turn to. I hope you,kind stranger,would tell me something that can help clear my fog.",18Dec2020,1

Okay so I'm (20f) frienda with this girl (we'll call her A) on Facebook. We've reacted to and commented on a few of each other's posts here and there and based off her posts we have a bit in common, but have never actually met or dm. I shared a post about wanting someone to bake cookies and watch holiday movies with, saying that t I just wanted to get into the spirit (was lowkey indirecting a guy I've been talking to and really like) and surprisingly got a comment from A on it saying that she needed female friends and that she'd take care of part of it if I took care of the other part. My first thought was ""hell yeah! I'm down. I'm in need of friends too so why not""

I went to reply back to her and ask if she was being serious bc I would definitely be down when I realized something..idk who she is(obviously). Like i know we have mutuals but idk who. I know she lives in the town I do but I've never seen her (granted I never go out lol)  i went to her profile and found out I actually KNOW know our mutuals but we haven't met before bc she isn't someone I recognize. I also found out she was born in early 2004 making her 16.

My question is: would it be viewed as weird if I were to start up a friendship with a 16 yo? I initially see no issue. But when you break it down to ""oh a 20 y/o is friends w a 16 y/o"" it sounds a little strange",18Dec2020,1

267," 

What's up yall, im having a bit of trouble trying to plan my job for summer 2021.

For some background, I'm a junior physics major with 2 summers spent as a civil engineer working on a hotel (the Hyatt regency in portland) and 1 as a mechanical engineer in a machine shop. Seeing that this is the last ""experience window"" before I graduate and join the ""real world"", I have been trying to look for something a little more social that will help me make connections in areas outside of STEM (ideally, I would want to work on the business side of engineering). I have decent grades and a solid resume/references, but I am concerned that my lack of experience in other fields will keep me on a track I don't necessarily want to continue down.

Where and how would I even go about looking for summer jobs related to politics, history, finance, marketing, business, advertising, investing, or anything in that realm? Or hell, even something where I can go outside like being a lifeguard?

My university was forced to stop hosting most of their traditional career fair stuff due to COVID, so that ended up being a bit of a dead-end, and shotgun-applying to everything on Glassdoor seems like a waste of time. Does anyone have any experience of their own, or could point me in the right direction?

Any advice is appreciated!",18Dec2020,1
268,"My (22F) ex best friend wrote a piece from life 10 years ago and I want to confront her.


I (22F) have an ex best friend. I was friends with her from kindergarten to 7th grade. At 13 I realized she was weird and told her I didn’t want to be friends with her. i want to add i was an angry child. i went through child abuse and definitely did not have a filter. Over the years as time naturally does, I have changed and even talked to old friends here and there and have apologized if I ever said anything hurtful. This included racist/descriminative comments (I had a stepdad who was racist, and he was influence.) They’ve all been forgiving and understand and for that I am grateful. Except this girl. (Also she is a caucasian female.) 
here’s the kicker: 
Every few years or so, she pops back up. And she has this weird grudge. 
We had some mutual friends in high school. At my other friends sweet 16 she came up to me, hugged me, and said “lets be friends again.” And at the end of the night said “bye, have a nice life.” 
I saw her around the neighborhood and she would wave hi. 

Fast forward she is an english major im pretty sure, I am married and living across the country. I found a writing page on instagram and found a piece she wrote. 

This piece was essentially super obssessive about the popular girls hair from middle school. She included me and two other girls, changing our names with names that started with the same letters. And it talked about how she, and my other best friend both had thick, coarse hair because she was italian, and the other girl was black. And somehow managed to quote something she remembers from 10 years ago, that I dont remember saying. The quote was racist. Essentially narrating that I compared my black friends hair, to her hair calling both of their hair ugly. Which was not the case. She also stated neither of them are friends with me. Which is not true, as i had literally talked to the other girl two days ago. 

This girl also has me blocked on all social media. So it would be hard to reach out. I am torn between messaging her to ask her what her problem is because she has this weird grudge, or just letting it go. My friends are saying shell probably just deny it. But i sort of dont care. Im just not sure the best way to go about it.

Do i ignore it and keep letting her do weird shit like this. 
Or
Do i confront her respectfully and try to bury a 10 year grudge she has. 

Im upset because a decent number of people saw this and can assume shes referring to me and that makes me look bad. Ive literally tried to reconcile before. But at this point im just frustrated.",18Dec2020,1

272,"My dad is a shitty dad and sometimes or most of the time I (20 F) feel like I don’t really have a dad, just my mom who is equally two parents in one. My mom and dad were on and off my whole life up until I was around 14 when they finally divorced and he moved to another province with his (now ex) wife. He is now remarried once again to a great woman with three children. 

He was never good at being a caring father, he had an awful upbringing but I guess you could say that he “tried” in his own way in terms of giving us basic necessities... But he was never the emotional type. Once my older brother grew up, they were able to laugh but my dad ALWAYS treated us like friends. When he had us on the weekends, he would have house parties with people 10 years younger than him, drinking alcohol around little me, 6/7 years old. I lost all respect for him when my mom politely invited him to breakfast one day (I was around 10, my brother 14) and he argued with her in front of the entire diner, insulting her about politics. He saw my brother and I growing up as an opportunity to not do fatherly things because we were “big enough” even though my mom did everything since we were born, which is one of the many reasons why they divorced. My dad is a proud, egotistical man who lives in his own little world. My brother is unfortunately turning into him, even though he’s very aware of my fathers actions. In addition to my fathers obliviousness, he asks my brother and I to come out to see him every now and then and tells us we need to pay for our own tickets while he makes 6 figures. I’ve told him repeatedly that I am a full time student working a part time job, I cannot give up that kind of money on a whim and that he should see us, but he never seems to retain knowledge when it comes to us struggling. 

It’s just my mom and I now (brother moved out) and we’ve been having some money troubles for a while for different reasons and when I try to look for comfort in my dad, he will answer me a couple of times, and then completely ignore me and continue to post on Facebook about his 3rd wife and her 3 young kids. I’ve asked him twice in my life for a little support with money in the beginning of the year and he told me he has nothing to give because money is “tight” for him, as he proceeds to flaunt all the new gadgets he buys for himself, cosmetic surgeries he’s bought for his wife and a brand new diamond ring that he bought for her last week for her birthday. Why would I, his child, ever be a priority for him? I’m 20, I’m a big girl! 

Anyways, yes, I sound bitter, but I always fall under his trap of thinking he wants to talk to me about me and continues on about himself, or stops talking all together. My father is just really bad at being a dad and as I get older, I see it more and more. I don’t want to resent him for the rest of my life (as I’m starting to feel about my brother too but he’s way easier to talk to). My mom had suggested talking to him about these things but I feel like he is just too defensive of a person or it’ll just end awfully because he’s emotionally closed off towards everyone. In all, I want to learn to finally cope with the thought that this is who he is and move on.",18Dec2020,1
273,"Background: Dad is semi-independent but I have been his caregiver since his TBI two years ago to help him maybe one day get back to being fully independent. I have moved back in with him and follow him to all of his doctor appointments. We do not leave the house. I leave once every 3 weeks for grocery restock but remain home again until the next run. Rinse repeat. The day of this incident would be my first day leaving the home after 14 days inside.

We were turned away after the front receptionist pointed the forehead scanner at my dad's mouth/mask. The way they built the plexiglass at the front desk makes it so they have to reach outward, then upward, and with dad's height she just couldn't reach him so she settled with mid-face region. Scan read 99 degrees. She gave us a second chance five minutes later but did the same. This time I told her that it's a forehead scanner and will read a higher temp if you catch him mid-breath and reminded her that she is pointing at his mouth. She got loud and was curt ""I scanned his face and he will not be seen today!"". I waited for a new appointment and we were on our way. I noticed the office next door had a station set up outside so I asked them if they can confirm if dad is running a fever. They scanned him, correctly this time on the forehead, five times. The nurse there was super compassionate and more than happy to continue checking (I think she was bored just being out there all day). Dad came up 97.7, 97.7, 97.6, 97.8, 97.7. She then proceeded to ask if the office staff even scanned dad on the forehead, and I told her no. Once we got home we both used our tongue thermometers and confirm that he is still 97 and I am 98 degrees. 

Writing this out makes me feel so ""Karen"". I usually never complain about anything having worked retail throughout my youth but this experience bothers me for multiple reasons. First, she may be turning away a bunch of other disabled patients whom take extra effort to get themselves to the office. Second, she shouldn't speak to anyone like that, especially since many of the patients are not cognitively able to defend themselves. 

I am hesitant to report this to the office manager/doctor as I am afraid (yes this is projection but I worked 5 years in the IT department where call center service representatives would maliciously abuse/leak a ""problematic"" customer's address, personal info, etc outside of work) the receptionist can do the same knowing my father's address and his SS number. Also, she was just doing her job, albeit in a very sh*tty way. Should I let the office manager/doctor know? Lets say I change doctors, should I even bother leaving this feedback if we are never coming back anyway?",18Dec2020,2

I would drive two hours at least once a week to go see him because I knew he was more comfortable at his own house. He would tell me he was going to marry me one day. We had plans to move halfway between our parents' houses. I loved his cat and his parents were so nice and chill. But now all that's gone. He just ""stopped having feelings"". He said he doesn't know why he's feeling like that, but I know it's because of his new friends. It's not even the fact that they're all girls. It's the fact that they're new and interesting and I'm old news. 

I know he liked me, but I don't think he ever truly loved me even though he said it first. How can you just stop having feelings for someone that you wanted to marry? Someone that constantly bought you gifts, was by your side during your health crisis, took the time to learn all about your rare syndrome &amp; helped you manage it? Someone that literally hand made you a blanket and bought you new sheets because yours were ripped and dirty?

He was everything I wanted in a man. Everything I wanted to spend my life with. His looks, his attitude, his kindness, his personality. I really looked forward to meeting the rest of his family. I hand-made all 6 of his nieces and nephews stuffed animals for Christmas. Even picked out special wrapping paper for them.

The last like 4 days of our relationship I knew he was going to break up with me. He stopped using emojis, stopped saying I love you, stopped calling me baby. It really upset me but I still ended up driving 2 hours to go get broken up with.

I tried, I really did. I was on discord with his friends and made the new girls little crocheted jellyfish for Christmas.

A big issue for him was our lack of texting during the day. It's understandable, I know he missed me because I missed him. I work a shift that takes up my entire day. I was trying so hard to make money so we could get an apartment together because he always told me he wanted to live together. All of it was for nothing though. I lost him and I don't know why.

My very own mother has been trying to undermine and sabotage my life. She decided that in order to live the rest of her life lavishly and in luxury. My life was to be ruined if necessary.

She has been trying to make me look like I'm crazy to make me lose credibility (I believe I'm on the spectrum so that doesn't help). And has been trying hard to send me to jail because I'm the only obstacle between her and my father's inheritance.

I have a video of her menacing to call the cops on me. Just because I asked what happened to a missing part of the property. It was missing a chunk

She say has said stuff like I should kill myself in the past and denied when I bring it up. Only to have her say that I'm making it up and that I'm crazy and hearing things. That's her usual modus operandi, she has yelled at me for insignificant stuff and then denies it. This stopped when I started recording her

There are some gang members in the neighborhood, she is a friend of the mother of one of them. So she has been using them to ""extort"" me. I'm literally afraid of going outside.

Legal options are out of the table, as the gold-digger my mother is. She frequents lawyers, military officers (they rule my country), businessmen, drug lords. You get the idea

I'm desperate, she can easily stage a car accident and ""witnesses"" will come to screw me over legally

Has anyone been in a similar situation??

I'm making enough savings to flee the country, but she will never allow it. I'm sure she would try something before I reach the goal. I'm already halfway in terms of money. She is desperate in making me lose those savings. If I have no money, I won't have a change legally speaking. And she keeps all the inheritance for herself

Do you think this is enough evidence to apply for a refugee status?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I needed money to study abroad. I was already under some kind of ""soft"" harrasment from someone who belongs to the local elite (no way to prove this unfortunately) So to leave the country its a must

I have been working since I graduated in 2015. I was fired from this company where I was for a year, no reason, just because. 

I got another job after some weeks, I had numbers during training that proved me to be the best of all the trainees. And yet I got fired the day before reaching production. This was related to this person from the elite. I was going to make good money with those numbers

I had a mental breakdown, I realized this person would not let me live in peace. I tried to kill myself

My mother took me to some clinic and forcefully injected me. I woke up in a room that resembled a cell. I was told by the doctor that it was necessary because I was doing scandals and was menacing the previous company with a bomb of some kind. So ""they were doing me a favour keeping me in there, otherwise it would be jail"" 

They were referring to a helium tank that I purchased but never got out of my trunk. The scandal was just that  I was trying to speak to the manager about why exactly the fired me. They believed that by injecting me all kinds of drugs I was gonna forget what happened and believe their made up story. They even had a letter from the company filling a demand for ""altering the public order and bomb menace"" me signed by the Public Ministry (The equivalent of the FBI in my shitty country).

289,"Somehow. I went to the optometrist at the end of November. I needed to renew my prescription for my contacts and glasses at the same time. Was given a copy of the prescription, went home. My plan was to order the glasses first, wait a bit then order my contacts bc I had one pair for the month. Well, long story short, I ripped a contact. So I went online and ordered my prescription from 1-800 contacts. Order came in today. I was excited. I put in a fresh pair: I knew immediately it was wrong. Double checked what I had ordered. The company sent me *exactly* what I ordered, and I ordered *exactly* what my prescription was. Now I have no wearable contacts and spent $130 on two boxes of unwearable contacts. I called the optometrist but they put me through to their contact lens dept and I had to leave a message. I have not been called back yet.

What is the best way to handle this? Do I raise a stink with the Dr? He did not change my right eye prescription and only tweaked the left lens a little but I put in my old pair and confirmed to myself that is not the right prescription. It doesn't 'see' the same. Now I'm frustrated, worried I'm going to be out money I could have used for something else, and also worried they won't fix this before christmas.",18Dec2020,1

293,"So my situation is as the title says. To elaborate more I’m a 27yo male and I have the opportunity to learn and manage the finances of a family business and ones in the future. The job is remote so I would be working from home and is offering a little more money but with more room to grow than my current job.

My current job I am a software engineer at a startup. I work in an office for 40 hours a week and is a very old school way of running a business. It’s what I studied and went to school for but long term I just don’t know if I would be happy being behind a desk and in that environment all my life.

The pros I see for taking this new remote job is flexibility, more pay, being able to easily move if my girlfriend gets a better job somewhere, no traveling to and from work and get to see my girlfriend more since she works evening shifts. Cons I see are not using my degree (I know that really doesn’t matter) and not having the social interactions that an office gives.

If given the choice what would you do? I know it sounds pretty clear cut what I have written and what I would do, however a big thing for me is the social interaction I get at work. I know the others outweigh that but strangely enough that’s what would be holding me back. Thanks for the help",18Dec2020,1

297,"okay so I had some uncomfortable experiences with someone who I am no longer friends with and it just occurred to me that it might have been some type of sexual harassment. 

so first of all, we are both females and were 17 years old. My friend is someone that is very open about their sexuality and watching porn and masturbating and things of that sort, but I just really am not. I am very introverted and shy and tend to keep most things to myself.

I was fine with her talking about her feelings/experiences because I was her friend and friends listened. However, since I am more shy and reserved, she would always call me asexual, which is just not true... she even told her mom that I was asexual, which really pissed me off. She has no right to choose my sexuality for me.

But one day we were talking, and she said “I think you’re asexual because you lack stimulation. I’m going to come spend the night at your house soon and I am forcing you to watch porn with me”

I flat out said no, that I did not want to and I was uncomfortable doing that. She said that she didn’t care and that I had no choice and that we were going to watch a video from every genre (idk if that’s the correct term lmao) of porn. 

Once again I said no. But over several weeks, she kept insisting that we were going to do this. I kept refusing and she would get mad and tell me that it wasn’t weird because her old best friend watched porn with her, so I should too. 

Eventually she gave up. A few months passed and I forgot about the whole thing. We ended up planning a night where she would come over and spend the night at my house. I thought it would be just a normal sleepover, but when she got to my house she reminded me that we would be watching porn.. I freaked out on her and said no. She kept insisting so I decided to invite another friend over, and this friend was younger so I knew that the other girl would not play porn if she was there.

We never watched porn, thank god. But while the younger friend was out of the room, I was sitting on my bed and the other girl literally jumped on top of me and straddled me and pretended to hump me. I was screaming and yelling at her to get off but she wouldn’t and thought that it was hilarious.
 
Do y’all think that all of this was sexual harassment? 
She knew I didn’t want to and kept pressuring me... we never watched it because I cut her off for other reasons... but I was extremely uncomfortable and felt incredibly violated.

i know it seems strange that i wouldn't know if it happened or not, but it was strange circumstances. tonight, i was asleep with him and we had just been laying together. i wake up because i feel him trying to take my clothes off, but i don't make it obvious that i'm awake. i know i should have stopped him here, but i was too afraid to. he then started to have sex with me thinking that i was still asleep. i then made it clear that i was awake, and told him i didn't remember saying that he could do that. he told me i had, and continued to explain that i had asked him to do that to me while i was sleeping. i honestly have no memory of that ever happening, and am unsure if it was because i was half-asleep or because he had made it up.

this isn't the first time this has happened, either.

every time it's the same. whenever i stop him or ask what he's doing, he tells me i consented but i must not remember.

i really don't know what to do. if he is lying, how do i talk to him about it? we're young and i don't want him to get in trouble so i really don't know who to go to. i know that this could end up in me leaving him, but in that situation i wouldn't know what to tell my parents who adore him.

I'm in the  Mid-West and attending a community college because I didn't know what I wanted to do but I wanted to start somewhere so,  I'm getting my A.A in Liberal Arts so I have my gen eds done when I transfer. My goal in life is to travel in my career before settling down (having a good work-life balance and a decent livable/saveable wage is high on my list too). 

At first, I was thinking of going for a TESOL B. A ( teaching english as a second language ) and M.A to be able to teach abroad ( JET, EPIK, etc ) and then work at some community colleges and schools when I come back.

But, recently someone told me about international teaching and I've been looking into that too. I'm wondering which subjects are in demand both abroad and in the U.S.A. Right now I'm thinking of going for Science Teaching or English Teaching B. A with a TESOL M.A but I don't know how that would be viewed by an employer. Another field I'm looking at is Speech-Language Pathology but I'm still researching that field.

With COVID and everything that's happening I really don't want to have to worry about my employment if something like this happens again.

My issues are that I live in a very conservative household, he is basically the antithesis of what my parents would approve of. They don’t know about him (he knows this) and I don’t see any way I could sneak out of the house to be with him. 

And I’m so young and inexperienced compared to him so I’m a little apprehensive.. I know I’m not as emotionally mature as he is.

We’ve had several deep conversations about these issues and he’s been the perfect gentleman about it, but I know it hurts him and he wants to see me in person as soon as he can (which I totally understand, and I want to as well) 

I suggested waiting until I graduate college in 2 years to see where we’re at in life, and we tentatively agreed on that, but it’s so hard to not be lovey dovey with each other and it always ends with us being upset because of our situation.

310,"Tldr: need help deciding on advancing career or helping brother with college

I currently work a gig in higher education where I get paid and have my housing covered by my employer. However, in terms of job responsibilities, it's a demotion in comparison to my past roles and experiences so when I think about job growth, it's a step back for me. I've been actively looking and applying but currently put a pause on it because a family situation popped up. I've only been in this role for 6 months but I know if I stick in this role any longer, I'll get pigeonholed into finding opportunities to only be viable within the institution that I'm at.

 So, my brother currently is attending a community college and a situation happened where he won't be able to stay where he's at. We're in California so finding somewhere to stay is uber expensive. I've been fortunate enough to be able to offer him a place and he'll only need to commute 30 minutes to the college.

Now it brings me to my dilemma. Should I continue job searching in hopes of finding a new role? All of my searches so far have led me to apply for positions where I won't be able to help my brother out due to the location and cost (no more free housing and actual bills accrued due to rent, etc.).

She will ask them questions, look them in the eye when they’re talking, and give them so many compliments. She never asks me anything about my life or work, I feel like I can’t even get her attention, and when I try to talk she doesn’t even look at me it’s like she’s not paying attention. She came over to my house today, and when I answer the door she just goes “hi” in a very monotone voice and came right in, didn’t look at me.

314,"And I'm really not okay with it. My relationship with my ex ended pretty badly and he and I haven't officially forgiven each other or spoken in over 3 years. I tried to reach out in March after his sister died, but he didn't get my email for whatever reason. He knows that I tried to reach out, but I haven't heard a peep from him. Whether he doesn't want to or isn't ready to, whatever, that's his prerogative and I'm not going to push anything. I don't even know if I'm completely ready or want to, which is why I havent bothered to reach out again. But I know it's not just my responsibility.

She posts about him all the time on Instagram and didn't even bother to ask how I felt about it or let me know that they were becoming better friends. I knew they would be seeing each other more because he moved back home and joined AA, but fucking posting pictures all the time feels like a slap in the face. Every time I see a post it makes me want to throw my phone. Especially since they fucking hated each other while we were dating and neither of them let me forget it.
 
I haven't been hanging out with her very much the past couple years because I was away at school, and when I moved home a few months ago, I moved back in with my parents who are both at risk for covid. I'm not interested in killing my parents and she hangs out with a bunch of people without masks on, so that's why I'm not around her. All the shit shes doing with him is shit WE would be doing of there weren't a pandemic. I feel replaced.

I'm really not okay with her being friends with my ex. I tried to be, but I'm not. It feels like she's broken some sort of code which sounds petty and dumb, but I've also had 4 people reach out to me, asking wtf is going on. Even my therapist was like wtf. I can't tell her who she can and can't be friends with, but I also can't act like everything is okay. I don't know if I want him back in my life at ANY capacity. But as of right now, seeing him on the feed of the person who is supposed to be my best pal, is driving me insane.

I understand that I probably haven't been the friend she's needed lately as I've been dealing with extreme anxiety, bouts of depression and haven't been as connected with her as I have been in the past, but we're in a fucking pandemic and I refuse to feel bad about taking the precautions I need to in order to keep myself and those around me safe. Maybe he's the friend she needs I don't know. I'm not expecting her to drop him as a friend, but I'm also not going to push myself to be okay with it. And I don't think I have to be okay with it. She could have befriended anyone else and I would have understood. But this feels like a stab in the back. I know she would be upset if I befriended one of her ex's without a word and posted a bunch about it. I've written 3 different versions of basically the same letter to send, but haven't yet.

323,"Throwaway so this can’t be tied back to my main account. Also apologies, this is a long one.

I met my partner, William, at university in the U.S. 4 years ago - he was originally from New Zealand and went home after he completed his degree, and once I finished my degree I moved over to join him. My partner’s twin brother, Jacob, was also dating someone from the states (Stacy) at the same time, and she did the same thing. William and Jacob’s parents inherited a house and thought that it would be a good idea for the four of us to live together there, they could give us a good deal and we could help garden and fix up the place.

I flew over a month before Stacy and lived with William, Jacob, and their parents for a few months while we helped to renovate the house. We all moved in around late November last year.

Even before we moved in, William and I had discussed with each other that this may not be a good idea because Stacy rubbed us both the wrong way. My parents had also brought this up - they met her briefly at my graduation and told me that she seemed to make the entire day about herself (she was trying to get into med school and is very much the type of person who needs to feel she’s the smartest person in the room). I had met her a year prior when we first visited New Zealand, where she spread lies about me and put me down in front of others to make herself look better - nothing major at that point, but small things that made hanging out with her mildly unpleasant. For example, we had a get together with some friends and William and I left to get some air. When I came back, everyone was asking if I was ok because apparently Stacy had told everyone I had left because I got ‘embarrassingly drunk and had to go throw up’. Nevertheless, William and I decided that the deal we were getting on the rent for the newly renovated house with a huge backyard was too good to pass up, and that we would make it work.

The first night we moved in, William and I bought a nonstick pan and put it, fully packaged, in a kitchen drawer. We came home later to her cooking with it, using metal tongs and scratching up the bottom. William very politely asked if she could not use metal tongs on a non-stick pan and maybe grab a plastic spatula instead. She immediately snapped back that she wasn’t doing anything wrong because her recipe said to use tongs. A few days later, we can’t find the cooking knife. William asks Jacob where it went, he says Stacy hid it in her room because we had incorrectly dried it. “She did it because she didn’t want to come off passive aggressive”. We had to go out and buy knives and couldn’t make dinner that day because there was not another cooking knife in the house.

It all went downhill from there.

Everyday living in that place we were belittled, put down, bullied, and it was quite frankly very taxing on us. We both felt we shouldn’t say anything because this person was ‘family’. William didn’t want to cause a fight with his brother, who had been his best friend his entire life. So besides getting out of the house to rant about what new thing she came at us for that day, we kept our mouth shut. We apologized when she said we did something wrong; we bit our tongue when we saw her lying about us, we continued to invite her to things and tried our best to get on with her. She kept at it, every day bringing up something that we were doing wrong. For example, I mistakenly left out our two plates from dinner once, and the next morning when I came home she was sitting there, ready for me, to tell me that it was absolutely unacceptable and that I needed to put more ‘effort’ into the house. I came home another time and was ridiculed for leaving the fan in William and my room for 2 hours - she must’ve opened our bedroom door to see it was on, but I still just apologized. During Christmas with the entire family, she picked at us and ridiculed us constantly. She accused my mother of being a liar because I had casually mentioned at the dinner table that Tylenol doesn’t work for my mom, etc. She only ever piped up to tell us that we were wrong and stared us down and judged us (it really feels like she judges your happiness) constantly to the point where we left on New Year’s Eve and spent that evening just the two of us rather than celebrate with William’s family because we just needed to get away from it.

We both inevitably got pretty depressed. We wanted to move out and never see her again, we wanted to yell at her, we wanted to tell Jacob, or Jacob and William’s parents. And eventually, we did all those things.

William broke down eventually and sat his parents down to ask for advice. They had noticed to some extent and acknowledged it (our friends had also acknowledged it but weren’t really living with it - Jacob wasn’t even living with it because his work makes him travel a lot). William’s parents were very understanding and helped him realize that he/we needed to start speaking up. William and I had a long conversation after and agreed that we would start speaking up for ourselves. At this point, we didn’t think we had anything to lose, our self-esteem and confidence were gone, our happiness was gone, we were completely defeated.

If tension in the house was high before this, it skyrocketed after. She completely victimized herself and changed every story to favor her and make us look like monsters. Jacob was never there and only heard what she would tell him, which was just complete nonsense.

She had a big habit of knocking on our bedroom door and coming in to tell us that we had done something wrong. I eventually had it and when she came in once to berate William on his tupperware-putting-away tactics (she wanted to keep all the lids secured at all times, he didn’t as the tupperware would get moldy - we had no idea this was an issue until she came in yelling at us), I was fuming at her for yelling at William and I walked out to her and said that if she had an issue with anybody, she couldn’t just come into our room whenever she felt like it and tell us off anymore. Discuss it in a house meeting. She responded by completely victimizing herself, saying William was attacking her and she was just trying her best blah blah. So she had a big house meeting, sat everyone down and told her she was spoken to unfairly and she just wants to keep the kitchen organized so we must all put away tupperware her way. It was absolutely ridiculous.

At some point during the ‘speaking up’ phase, William and I got a dog. I overheard her on the phone to who I assume was Jacob once, telling him about how we were mistreating her and how William wouldn’t let her pet the puppy, play with the puppy, or even look at the puppy. Jacob’s attitude to us changed and we knew whenever she had said something about us as he would come home and give us the cold shoulder.

Once after about 2 weeks of constant rain which made the backyard super muddy (also was muddy because we were putting in a fence for the puppy), Stacy came storming in yelling at me that she had stepped in dog shit and that I need to be better about cleaning it up and I’m rude and whatever. I apologized immediately, asked where she had stepped in the shit and that I would clean it up. She said it was right on the path all the way at the far side of the backyard - my dog had never been down there before as at that point he was always leashed in the backyard, and I told her it must be mud because he had never pooped there. She accused me of lying, her shoes are ruined, she could smell the shit, it’s all my fault, how dare I, and stormed off. She did the same thing with the shower drain: if it clogged, she would storm out post-shower to yell at ME that it was my fault it had clogged during HER shower. Every time after these situations happened, Jacob wouldn’t speak to us for weeks, so we assumed he had heard some sort of skewed story.

She dragged herself into every fight, made herself the victim, and blamed it all on William. She won every little tense moment, every time anything happened, William and Jacob grew further apart, and she smirked her way through it all. Any time William and I would say anything (not anything bad! even just something as simple as saying excuse me in the kitchen) it would be turned against us and used as a weapon. She slowly destroyed us, telling us both on multiple occasions that it must be so hard for us that William and Jacob’s parents clearly love Jacob more, etc. So we decided that we would stop saying anything altogether. We were then accused of ignoring her (besides a good morning and hello, we didn’t speak to her to I guess that is partially true, but only because we didn’t want anything we said to be taken the wrong way and turned into some sort of awful lie about us).

William eventually sat down with his brother over a beer to talk about how the house situation needed fixing - he agreed. He even admitted that Stacy was hard to deal with and had an ‘attitude’. After their conversation, they came home and mentioned to each of us separately that we would all be sitting down over pizza and beer to try and ‘fix’ the tension. William and I heard Stacy screaming in the next room about how she wouldn’t sit down with us because WE are the awful ones etc. but eventually she came out and we all talked. It was a fine conversation, but all it really was William once again apologizing for everything because she turned it all into being his fault. (She felt she HAD TO defend herself because William is so mean to her!)

Things were mildly fine for a while, but it quickly went back to tension and her judging us and staring at us. I started getting really bad panic attacks - I have struggled with anxiety my whole life and had worked incredibly hard for many years to work through and hadn’t had panic attacks in years. They were all back. I could no longer speak to people, I was afraid to leave my room, my bed, I wouldn’t leave it when she was home because I was afraid of her. I was so scared that I stopped drinking water so I wouldn’t have to leave the room to pee. It’s a really awful feeling knowing something you’ve worked so hard to get over for years was all back because of someone who might be your SIL one day. We started a chore chart because although she bossed us around to clean, she never did herself (she would leave all her dishes out all day so we couldn’t use them unless we cleaned them until the minute before Jacob came home). Week 1, Stacy is on vacuum duty and decides to vacuum one room a day. The day the chores switched, she vacuumed ONLY the fireplace area and when Jacob comes home, he makes a point of saying how beautiful the floors are. William and I look at each other because we thought she would do another quick sweep as the dining room was filthy - she doesn’t take her shoes off and treks dirt all through the house. We decided that we should set a precedent for cleaning the house - if it’s week 1, she will do less and less each coming week (I had spent 4-5 hours cleaning the shower 2 days before trying to get all the hard water stains off). William casually mentions to Jacob that he was going to quickly wipe down the kitchen counters again before we switched chores and asks Jacob if he thinks that’s a good idea and maybe she could quickly vacuum the shoe dirt up. He AGREES that the floor needs a quick redo but goes to do it himself. Stacy comes out to the sound of the vacuum and starts yelling at him. He’s hurting her feelings! Does he think she didn’t do a good enough! How could he do this to her! He’s awful, he’s treating her so badly! Does he think she didn’t do a good job! He says ‘well I think you did a WONDERFUL job bubba, but some OTHER people don’t’ (lovely). They go to their room and she comes out 5 minutes later and walks up to William and says it’s not ok how he attacked her, she tried her gosh darn best, he’s SOOO mean, typical victim stuff. It took Jacob 2 minutes to vacuum, it really wasn’t a big deal.

William said he didn’t want it to be taken the wrong way, he just thought it could use a quick redo before switching chores (she responded with ‘I cleaned that area last week’ as if things don’t get dirty again). He refused to apologize and a few days later, Jacob comes into the living room while William and I are watching tv and essentially says “things are tense, William do you have anything to say for yourself”. William said look dude, you even admitted it needed redoing. It took 2 minutes, it’s not a big deal. The chore needs to be done when you switch so the next person isn’t screwed over.

Things blow up, Jacob says he didn’t want to say anything but I did a very bad job cleaning the bathroom and it was unacceptable but he didn’t say anything. I reminded him getting a year’s worth of hard water stains off the glass is a lot harder to do then a 2 minute vacuum. Things escalate more and Jacob yells at William, saying he is (quote) “belittling, awful to live with, and a terrible person”. I just yelled at Jacob and said he needed to get out NOW. (nobody speaks to my boyfriend like that!) He storms off and we hear Jacob and Stacy packing their bags – they ended up leaving for the parent’s house in a big huff for the week.

William and I started looking at places to move into, and things were so tense that one day Jacob and William and their parents sat down and flipped a coin to decide who would move out - we lost and had to find a new place. They would get to keep the beautiful, newly renovated house, a huge backyard and mature fruit trees, a garage, a huge room, a new fence, all for a great price, and we had to find somewhere as soon as possible that would accept a dog.

William and I discussed what we hoped to keep (the parents had kept all the furniture that originally belonged in the house and we wanted to keep half of it). I guess Stacy overheard, and decided the only mature thing to do would be to hide all her personal items in the room. Cups, glasses, pizza cutters, water bottles, other kitchen utensils all suddenly disappeared. Honestly, I cracked. I thought it was hilarious - we would finally catch her in the act, mention this in front of everyone so she had to admit that she had hidden things. She couldn’t possibly win this and turn this against us as she had been doing for over a year. But that’s exactly what I did - I walked up to her when everyone was there and asked where the pizza cutter had gone. She smirked and said she was so sad to take it out of the kitchen, but she felt she had to take it and hide it to keep it safe from William and I because she said she had overheard our conversation and she was ‘afraid’ of losing her own personal things. Jacob jumps in to defend his poor girlfriend. Things turned into an all-out war in the kitchen. Stacy is, of course, crying, telling me she has never said a mean thing to me in her life, she’s only ever nice. I tell her to stop bullshitting and that I can’t believe she can’t even recognize that she’s been mean. She says give me an example of one time I’ve been mean, I start firing off examples (I have so many and I have wanted nothing more than to tell her for a year that she is an awful person). She denies EVERY SINGLE ONE. She tells Jacob that William and I are lying. We mention the metal tongs thing and we get: “I never did that! How would you even remember, it was so long ago!” I mention how she said I need to “put some effort into the house” after leaving dishes out. Apparently I made that up. It’s all about how WE’VE been mistreating poor Stacy. After the fight ends, Jacob and Stacy leave and William and I walk into the kitchen and see a note that says she’s returned the stuff she took and that she’s sorry she had ‘one moment of weakness.’ Pretty funny though, because although looked like such a nice little apology, she had only returned the things I had specifically mentioned before. Half the stuff was still missing from the kitchen. So to Jacob and our friend who was there, it looks like she’s the mature one, but it’s only to make her look good while she still is hiding things.

Anyways, a few weeks later we’re accepted to a great little townhouse. Best. Day. Ever. No more Stacy. I set a timer on my phone counting down. Days left until I’m not bullied by her anymore. William won’t be blamed for everything anymore! We move into the parent’s house for 2 weeks because we just can’t be there anymore. William and Jacob plan a time for the 4 of us to sit down and discuss who gets to keep what from the house. Against every bone in my body telling me not to go, I make it.

Stacy isn’t there, Jacob has planned for the exact couple hours that entire weekend that she wouldn’t be there. The three of us actually end up having a great time, we’re cracking jokes, we amicably agree how to split things. The place we’re moving into is not only about 10x more expensive but also 10x smaller so we can’t take much. There’s an entire house of stuff – kitchen things, furniture, tables, chairs, desks, foyer things, rugs, etc. We only could take a few items – we asked for the couch, the only furniture item in the house the 4 of us paid for. We said we would pay them back their part. Jacob says it’s ok as they get to keep so much more. They got the tv, the laser printer, everything else. We split kitchen stuff halfway and ask if we can keep the outdoor table and chairs – our new place has a patio just big enough for them. Jacob says that’s fine (they had never even used them). We write everything down and agree that this is all ok. Jacob says Stacy will be fine with it all, after all, they’re keeping about 80% or more of all this stuff.

The next day William and I spend driving 3 hours one way to go pick up a washing machine because they got to keep theirs. On the way down, we get a text from Jacob: Stacy wants to keep the outdoor table and chairs, it’s very unfair we get to keep that. William just texted back saying we will stick to what we agreed. We get to William’s parents 4 hours later and William’s dad immediately starts by saying that we need to give the table and chairs to Jacob and Stacy – Stacy is very disappointed and sad that she can’t keep them. William blows up. William and Jacob had agreed to not involve the parents because their sons fighting had really done a number on them. Doesn’t matter to Stacy, though, she needs her way. During all this fighting, I get so upset (we’re so close to just being done with it all!) that I just go and buy another set on New Zealand eBay. William texts Jacob that he hopes Stacy is happy that she gets to keep literally every piece of furniture that we have gotten from the parents.

We finally move out. We are paying ridiculous rent but it’s worth it because we won’t have to see Stacy again. I started going to therapy a few weeks prior for the panic attacks and things start looking up in therapy. I no longer want to kill myself.

But I guess not. Stacy is kind of a genius in that she knows exactly how to play people and how to be believable. She tells them exactly what they want to hear. For example, on my birthday that year pre-moving out and fighting, William sees Stacy leave right before my birthday breakfast/brunch (it was the only thing planned that day because it was a busy weekend for everyone). She says she’s way too busy and she can’t make it, 30 minutes before we go. She gets home at about the same time as we do later on, proceeds to watch tv for 3-4 hours, goes grocery shopping, and then that night comes out dressed all fancy and stands there until someone says something and she says ‘oh! I’m so excited, I’m going to my med school friends birthday party!!!’. Clearly a ridiculous and petty thing to do, right? When it gets brought up later, she blames it on WILLIAM and says that she would have loved to go but William never invited her to it, so she made different plans. It’s not HER fault, it’s all Williams. Everyone believes her and blames William.

This exact same thing has happened now that we’ve moved out. We make a point of not bringing her up. We don’t want her in our life, and we’re happier when she doesn’t come up ever. The other day a distant relative of William’s passed away and his family wanted William to come to the funeral. I said I would go with him. The thought that Stacy may be there crossed my mind, but I sort of convinced myself she wouldn’t be there.

Of course, we get there and there she is. I see her and immediately have a panic attack. William feels sick himself but helps me back to the car. That day I realized how much therapy has helped because I am actually able to walk right back up after the panic attack and although we didn’t sit with William’s family because Stacy was with them, I actually managed to be there and be present for the funeral. The next few days, William’s parents are calling him saying they are going to the doctor, are sick and might not be here that much longer if William doesn’t change what he’s doing and help fix the family. They hadn’t been listening to him recently because they don’t want to be in the middle of it, understandably. But William breaks down hearing this about his parents and just spills everything. How hard this has been for him, how she’s been bullying us, how she’s told us multiple times that it must be so hard for us that Jacob is ‘clearly’ the favorite child, etc. They finally realize. Stacy tells them all the time how she would do ‘anything’ to help the family, to be friends with Stacy and I. In their eyes, we’re the ones who are the assholes.

And we’ve just recently learned now too that our friend(s) feel the same way that the parents felt – that it’s all William’s fault and he needs to do something to fix his family. Drunk words came out the other night. William and I haven’t been present in his family or our friends’ lives - Stacy makes a point of being there for literally everything I think because she knows if she is there, we won’t be.

She has told me multiple times that she doesn’t like William and Jacob’s parents. She has told me that she doesn’t like some of their friends – on my birthday, she told me it wasn’t ok that I was inviting over a particular friend, she has told me she doesn’t like him. This friend is now the one who drunkenly berated William about how he’s handling the situation - we’re guessing he’s heard from Stacy (he somehow knows we didn’t sit with the family at the funeral. He hasn’t heard it from us or William’s parents, so I guess Jacob or Stacy have been telling everyone what awful people we are. Still.) Everyone just seems to be so far up her ass and not dare to say anything about how she mistreats people, including her own boyfriend.

I guess we’re at a loss for what to do, to be honest. We’ve told the parents what we need is time away from her to heal and to help our mental health because frankly it’s in the bin. But we’re losing friends over this too because we don’t want to gossip about it. We want to get better and be happy, but Stacy isn’t done trying to convince people we’re the ones who are awful, splitting families apart, lying, who knows what (although she constantly tells people she will do ‘anything she can’ to help). We just want to be done with this. We happily moved out to get away from it. William wants to move back to the U.S. and get a fresh start. He’s lost his life-long best friends and his brother now because he doesn’t want to see people who speak to him the way they do. He’s over it and he’s tired. We both are. We don’t have fight left in us. People don’t even want to hear our side of the story because they’re disgusted with him from what they’re heard from her, which is all lies. It feels as if she’s literally poisoning their minds – these people were my friends too for a year and I feel I can’t trust them anymore.

Do we move countries? Do we cut everyone off? Do we let ourselves lose all these people in our lives? What do we even say to them? We've tried explaining our mental health issues. We just want to be over with this all, no more fighting, no more justifying not wanting to see her. We say we don’t want to see her or talk about her and that’s it, and suddenly we’re making a big deal about this and we can’t do that because it hurts the family and its hard on the friend group. I’m really starting to see why William wants to move. It just feels like there’s nothing left for us here. Maybe this is what she wants. But I don’t care if she wins this or whatever she thinks this is. I just want to never see or hear or think about her ever again.",18Dec2020,1
324,"Hi there, to make a quick clarification, I've been around dogs from birth and haven't known any of my prior pooches to toilet inside after completing house training.  
So following the passing of my father in January, my mother's dog was given free run of the house. I exercise at night so he's often my friend while I'm exercising. So during the night time, after I've gone to bed, the little muppet has taken to pooing by the front door or in the doorway of the snake room. Let me point out that he doesn't do it during the day and that he lives with three other house trained dogs, none of which will toilet in the  house if they can help it. 
I noticed that he was getting a little antsy last night while I was doing my sets, so I grabbed a lead and took him outside, obviously thinking that he needs to relieve himself. No such luck, he wants to go back in cause its dark and starting to rain. No biggie, I take him back inside and go back to my sets. By this point, it's 11pm. He starts dancing again just as I finish my last set. I grab his lead and some poo bags and take him out for a quick walk around the co-de-sac, he pees, I think great. We loop around and he decides he wants a full walk, not a potty break. Thinking I read him wrong and he just wanted a pee, I took him home and went to bed. I get up at 6:15 and find his poop in the snake room. I know its his because he does little poops, he's like a cat. He does have a crate of his own, but he hasn't slept in it since my dad died and refuses to sleep through the night in it. He screams if he's not let out. I have a dog as well and I've never had this trouble with him (my dog and my mum's dog have a rough 3 months of age between them, mine is 3 years, hers is 2 years and 3 months. He's also a rescue dog.) I really don't know how to combat him on it.",18Dec2020,1

It generates a random credit card that obviously doesn't work, so it can't charge the renewing of the trial when it ends. My question is, can I do this? Are fake cards illegal?

328,"I'm a 20m

Where to start. I live a home with my family. I have only a handful of college credit from my local community college. I haven't gone back to school because for the past 2.5 years I've been trying to join the Air Force. I have hearing loss in my right ear which is why it is taking so long. Why that long though I'm unsure, it feels like I've wasted so much precious time being these early years of adulthood just waiting around for the military to accept me. I have a job, but I haven't saved hardly anything. I have hovered at about a grand in my savings since I graduated high school. I work at Best Buy which I do enjoy but currently I'm a seasonal employee with no promise of being hired on to part time. Also, I'm only getting about 2 or 3 days a week. Well, I'm on truck team which means my shifts are often 7pm - 2am twice a week. It kills my sleep schedule and I sleep most of the day. 

I'm very afraid of the future. I am uncertain if I should still hold out on the military. Its what all of my family keeps telling me and I know its my best bet, but I have wasted so much time waiting. I feel like a failure already and I haven't even started anything.

My best friend, also 20m, just figured out he is going to move in with some of his friends from college. I have always been the harder worker out of the two of us, but he did running start and gained his associates degree and is one year away from a bachelors. I have no degrees and am afraid. I just read a post that said would you rather be a 25yo with a degree or without and that made me feel better though. I want to move out of my family's home so bad but I have no way of making that happen I guess? Honestly, not really sure what advice I'm asking for.. I just feel alone and falling behind, its scary and shameful.

I wish I could skip these next few years out of this time of uncertainty and fear. Covid also has tripped up me joining the military but that is out of my control. I think my next steps are to be to get another job? Not sure. Any advice is welcome advice",18Dec2020,1

332,"So my situation is basically the title. I have had this girl who I’ll call Jez in my life since I was 4 and we became  the best of friends. I’m talking going on vacations with each other to different states, spending holidays with each other, going to events and even family funerals to support each other. All in all, we did everything together and we were inseparable for years. We would always play together, and we played with toys a lot longer than the average could would have gone. (I’m talking like till freshman year of highschool.) it was an outlet for us because we weren’t very social people and it was just me and her for a very long time. Throughout these times we honestly never talked about our feelings much, and we had what I could as a comfortable silence. Not saying much but enjoying each other’s company. Well, we got older and she stopped wanted to play. That was our huge bonding time and she would invite me over and just ignore me and watch movies, then get upset when I’d leave. This happened so many times and it hurt but I just dealt with it. She’s a very sensitive person and kind of spoiled so things always had to be her way or she’d freak out and have a panic attack. I know she has anxiety and OCD pretty bad, so I just let it go. But it got worse. 2 summers ago we went to the beach and she just started acting like a complete asshole to me and her family. Her mom is the sweetest person alive and she just walks all over her and it angered me so much. I couldn’t deal with her attitude and she became the worse complainer In the world. That’s all she would talk about and never ask how I was. I felt like I wasn’t being appreciated so I stopped talking to her as much and distanced myself. I ended up going further and making excuses to just not see her. I was so upset because I knew she was hurting and wanting to see me and I felt like such a horrible person lying to her but I just couldn’t tell her the truth. My bf tried helping me cope but it just wasn’t the same. I felt horrible treating her like she didn’t exist anymore. I didn’t invite her to my 18th birthday party and that was the last straw for me because she had been with me for every single party of most of my life. I also didn’t go to hers, because she just didn’t have one. I eventually came clean and told her how I felt and why I wasn’t talking to her. We made up and things were better for a bit, but now it’s the same thing. We just have nothing in common anymore and no matter what I try to do to get us to do something she just doesn’t want to. I don’t want to just sit around and watch movies I want to do something. I’ve told her this, but she just doesn’t listen. I’m so confused because when people ask about her it’s just a bunch of mixed feelings and I love her, but she has just treated our friendship like shit and I know that I deserve better. I even made an amazing friend during the time she and I took a break and I know jez is jealous of her, but this other friend treats me so well and is conscious about My feelings.

Getting a new therapist tomorrow and sort of nervous. 
I noticed with my last one a few years ago I tend to sugar coat what I tell her. I’m scared if I tell her my thought process she’ll think i’m a disgusting person. For example I’m aware sometimes i’m extremely selfish and a bad person. But I want to change my mindset at the same time. This may be the stupidest post because she’s obviously there to help me but I hear a lot of people lie to their therapist.

Also, I have social anxiety and depression which are also a huge factor in my situation. Making conversation with others can be difficult for me, especially when they are someone new.

my relationship was exclusive,  I have never been with other guy or anybody since 21.

As   usual my best friend and I got together and drank alot. All these  years  I have never had any idea to be with him sexually. He is good  looking  and all but he is my friend. tonight he started touching me and  started  jerking in front of me, and wanted to have sex with me (he  cannot even  imagine what would that entail)  I gave best of me to keep  it platonic  no mather that I just had to touch his dick and he tried to  jerk me off  but I was so shocked that I couldnt even...just no.

We kissed and it felt nice. He said that nobody will ever know, it will be just our thing.

I   really love him as friend but after that kissing (and dicks and  drunken  crazyness) our relatinship broke some barrier that I never even   imagined existed.

He tried to  fish  while I was back to him on my computer, I just turned around and   said...please dont. and he blacked out after  and woke up and went home.  I  dont want to have sex  with him but that kissing made me feel good, I   told him this is most intimacy that I had with anybody for long time.

Please tell me what should I do? Should I just follow his lead?

The   truth is we have so much in common, I didnt had that with my ex, we  had  crazy love that lasted far too long, we broke up in OK terms, I  will  never stop loving him, but he cheated and it was over. we agreed  about  that ( he still sends me some texts like, can we just forget and  go on,  but NO.

its over. just is.

He was jelous on my friend always, but without reson, untill tonght.

Im so confused.

I know that honesty is best course, but we broke that barrier and I will kiss him again. I know myself.

I dont want to loose him. (english is not my first language so grammar, and Im drunk)

345,"So I(19F) somehow managed to get a boyfriend(19M) in September. My sister (17F) has been really jealous of my lately. Just to be clear it definitely isn’t because she wants to date him because she is lesbian. I would also like to add that I am completely accepting of this and that I am also bisexual. I apologize for any formatting issues as I am also on mobile. 

Anyway, on to the situation. I’m currently in college and my boyfriend is taking some time for military service. It’s a distance relationship already so we have prepared quite a bit for being distant with the military. We are both very satisfied in our relationship and are very good at communicating our needs and feelings to one another. Neither of us are perfect by any means and we don’t expect each other to be. The thing is that my sister will hyper-fixate on any small flaw my boyfriend has and will try to make me feel bad about it or try to make me question if he is a good fit for me. I know that the person I date at 19 isn’t likely the person who I will marry but I am trying to at least enjoy what I have as any relationship is an opportunity to learn what you enjoy and don’t enjoy. For example, if I say talk about how he wants to go into the military before schooling she will try to make it appear as though he is too unintelligent for school by drilling me with extremely biased questions and inserting her own opinions when I try to explain our point of view. He was accepted into multiple colleges but just didn’t feel it was right at the time and I told her she this and that she needed to respect it. I don’t defend him endlessly and I know he has flaws but her hyper fixation on those flaws is unnecessary and repetitive as it’s always the same things she complains about even though they never affect her. She has also been very condescending and rude towards me for other reasons but I think it boils down to her disliking that I have a boyfriend since her rudeness never occurred at this volume until I started dating. I have done the obvious to show that having a boyfriend will not affect out relationship as sisters. I have never and will never cancel plans with her to spend time with him and I have flat out told her that I still want to spend time with her. I have been making sure to dedicate the same amount of time to talk with her and call her while I’m at school as I did before I started dating. I have also asked her if she has problems with him I may not be seeing but she has said she’s fine. I have also asked her if there’s anything I or my boyfriend should be doing differently to make her feel more comfortable but she says there’s nothing. When I hang out with her or talk to her I never talk about my boyfriend because I know it upsets her but she will bring it up anyway. I’m at a loss for what to do as she has been increasingly belittling to me and I dislike spending time with her now knowing she’ll somehow steer the conversation towards how I’m “dating down” or giving her unsolicited opinions on things that don’t affect her. I will be spending the holiday season with her and am worried I will snap at her. Is there anything more I should be saying to her or that I should be doing? This has been happening for months. Thanks for reading!

And if I even politely say that I'm not comfortable sharing that sensitive info my grandma is gonna cry, because she does it ALL THE TIME, and try to guilt me into telling her.

Because she cries all the time I really don't feel bad for making her cry, but if I do the rest of the family will literally cut me out for X amount of time. Its usually a week they are mad at me and exclude me and then they bounce back.

Sidenote, I've told some people that my family is like a cult and my grandma is the leader. They literally do anything to keep her happy and sacrifice their own well being, time, and money just to please her. I dont do that so I'm a blacksheep.

349," Okay so before I even get started, ive gone to the police about this before and they literally did nothing about it. Anyway, I used to be best friends with this girl who i had been friends with since i was in kindergarten. She started dating a 23 year old man when she was only 14, disgusting i know. A 23 year old man whos literally addicted to drugs. Every five minutes he stops to do a line, its SCARY!!! Now when they first started dating I knew it was wrong, I didn't like it, but I let it happen because she was my best friend. Its been 2 years. She's now 16, and hes 25. Horrible. She and i stopped being friends because of him being so controlling. He doesnt like me, he thinks I'm a bad friend and he hates me because my mom won't let him come over and sleep in the bed with my friend who is 16 YEARS OLD!! So now she and I aren't friends anymore, and because of that, ive finally decided to do something about there illegal ass relationship. Ive personally spoke to policeman in my town about there relationship and all they said was ""we can only do something about it if we proof that they've been having sex"" so of course I didn't have proof of that i mean how would I? So thats where I am now.. i don't know what to do about this. Ive tried going to the police, nothing. Ive tried going to her mother, and she somehow convinced her mother that hes only 17 (he does not at all look 17 because he's 25 and has a serious drug addiction) 
Hes controlling, hes physically, mentally and verbally abusive to her, but shes so convinced that she loves him that she doesnt care. She doesn't care when she sees that hes cheating on her with people his own age, she doesn't care that he spends $600 a day on hydros and lives in his car, she doesnt csre that hes 25 because she LoVes HiM.

350,"so this guy and i were dating and very serious about each other although we weren’t specifically girlfriend boyfriend because at first i said no and then he did. he  didn’t live in the same city as me so that was an issue and he used to only visit during summer breaks. after HE decided we are not going to go anywhere, he started dating some other girl without ending things with me and i didn’t say anything i was young and i tried to act cool and mature. 

then again during his break surprisingly he was single again and he came back in my life, i had decided that i would treat him like a friend and that new years he went to celebrate with my best friend and other friends without me which was weird. after that we got close again and then when he went back to his city, i went to visit him then also we were close then again after i was gone after a month or so he dated someone else but this time i got a message from him saying how he feels she was the one then he broke up  with that girl again and came to my city and this time i decided to just actually be friends but then we got close again and this time when he came, after getting close, i asked him to celebrate new years with me and he stayed at his house rather than going out with me but last year he went out with MY friends WITHOUT ME 

 then later on for other plans when i asked him to come out with me or my sister asked him to come out with us, he didn’t and he used to go out to places with my bestfriend although they weren’t close but it still felt bad and i can’t blame my best friend but i feel like she’s also to certain extent accountable because she knew how i felt about him and i must feel bad because once when i spoke to her boyfriend in a very friendly way she got mad at me because i was giving him so much of importance but then she did the same by taking my ex or whatever he was out. so sometimes i feel he just used me",18Dec2020,1

TLDR: my roommates drink often and I do as well even though I’m currently working. I still fulfill my responsibilities but I feel like what I’m doing is wrong/inappropriate.

I’m honestly unsure which subreddit this is most suited for but here goes nothing. I’m currently drunk in my bed typing this because I’m in a huge dilemma. I currently go to uni however I’m working this term because I’m on co-op. My roommates are all studying at the moment however since everything is online they tend to drink often (even on weekdays) and sometimes include other ‘stuff’ to liven up the night. I’ve found myself drinking way more often and doing what they do even on weekdays when I have work the next day. Regardless, I still always go to work, fulfill my responsibilities and have a generally healthy lifestyle (good diet and working out consistently) however I feel like what I’m doing is inappropriate and wrong the only way I reassure myself is by telling myself that I’m in university and that I won’t be able to act like this after I graduate.

353,"First things first, thank you to everyone who will read and answer to this. It's something I care about deeply and I'd like to know what you think about this whole situation I'm going to describe here.

So, I have talked with a guy for a whole month and it's been a super nice and happy month. During this period he told me multiple times he liked me, sometimes we even talked about long-term plans and about stuff we wanted to do together. He even talked about me with his friends and his family so I thought that things could get kinda serious (and I liked that idea). Because of the pandemic, we were able to meet just at the beginning of the week and I don't even know how to describe what happened. Thing is he suffers from OCD but I don't know much about it precisely because he didn't really open up about the subject and I didn't want to pressure him (I just know that he started to worry that he might end up hurting me somehow). We spent the whole day together but, after getting intimate, he started to be sad and upset all of a sudden.

We started talking about it and then we just cried the whole time. First, he told me that he was scared he'd end up hurting me and also that he wasn't feeling ready for a real relationship, that a serious relationship was different than something ""chill"". Then, he told me it was really because he didn't like part of my body (but he had also made positive comments about it during the day). However, we kept talking about everything and he was also pretty insecure about the fact that we should stop talking. We decided to call it quits because he thought that if we kept talking, we'd just get closer and closer to each other and get even more hurt with time. First he told me that he'd need to sleep on it, then he decided it'd be better to avoid talking the next day. He also said that stopping to talk would be wiser because if we stayed friends he would only feel guilty knowing I have feelings for him.

Now, I don't know what to do. I want to respect his decision of course but I also saw how deeply emotive he was in that moment - and so was I, because we were both heartbroken while we were saying all of those things. I'm afraid he just felt overwhelmed by everything since he (we) hadn't felt such things in a long time. If I think about this past month, I feel like what happened doesn't make any sense after all the nice things we have told each other during this past month. Should I text him? I know that meeting would be better but we're still in a pandemic and we live quite far, so it would be more complicated than anything else. Do you have any other suggestion?

I've always had confidence issues and stage fright, but I've been working really hard on them.

And this job is very mentally draining, but I really want it. So I'm putting myself under a lot of pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting more comfortable on the Zoom calls and doing pretty well.

And then last Friday happened.

The host was late.

I was way too tired, hadn't eaten all day and hadn't slept well the night before...

We didn't get started till about 9 and by the time the host got to talking to me it was like 10-10:30pm

I was struggling to stay awake the whole call.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was asked a basic question, I froze.

I had the answer and then when they asked, I forgot it...I forgot all words. I forgot what I was working on...I just couldn't think.

It was very embarrassing and really knocked my confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Monday didn't go well either.

When we met again on Monday I was asked another question. The person talking and explaining the stuff though kept breaking up so I couldn't keep track of what was going on.

They asked other people first and they were able to give an answer (wrong answer, but an answer).

I was sitting there like...I don't know what we're talking about!

But I didn't want to appear like I hadn't been paying attention...

So when I was asked I just had no answer, I sat there and continued trying to figure it out in silence. 

Thankfully someone else jumped in and tried to answer for me..but they didn't know either it turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

So not been a great time recently...

I just go blank and freeze up. I'm so afraid of saying the WRONG answer, I say nothing...

It REALLY doesn't help that the calls are like 8-10pm at night, but that's because of timezone differences. (and unfortunately, caffeine has no effect on me) 

And I'm trying to move my sleep pattern so I wake up later and I'm not as tired at that time of night but I have another day job (for now) so I can only move it a little.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone got any advice for how to get my brain re-engaged when I freeze up?

Is it better to say the wrong thing than nothing at all?

365,"Here's the story. As factual and to the point as I can make it.

In the beginning of Nov I applied for an entry level job at a locally owned plumbing company. When I went into the first interview I was told that I was WAY over qualified for the position but that they believe they could be of use else where in the company and that I should come back for a second interview with someone in management.

For the second interview I meet with someone in management and he reviews with me the entrance personally test I took along with my resume. This guy may as well have had a hard on he was so excited to meet me. He told me that my personality and experience was exactly what they were looking for and that they have 2 management positions open and I could LITERALLY pick the one I'd like. He talks to me about the pay and how I'd be an amazing fit and all this stuff that the company offers. At the end of it I tell him the position I'd like and he tells me cool, my next interview will be with the company owner. Mind you these interviews are taking place over 1 week.

My final interview was with the owner on Friday. The interview went great, we found that we had somethings in common and the conversation never had a dull moment. by the end of the interview they had asked me for my social security card and driver's license so they could go ahead and start the background check process. Awesome right? I have nothing in my background that should deter me from getting this job so at this point I'm feeling pretty confident.

Here's where shit gets weird. The next week, Monday passes Tuesday Wednesday Thursday passes and I hear nothing back from anybody. I call late Thursday afternoon and get told that human resources (one person) had a family emergency and they have not been in all week. Okay, understandable. on Friday I get an email from human resources telling me that they have my background information and they will be giving it to the appropriate persons on Monday. 

Week #3 since my interview. Monday passes Tuesday passes Wednesday passes. Wednesday late afternoon I give them a call and I am stopped as far as the receptionist. She tells me that not one person I interviewed with is available and HR is also out of the office. Tell her okay and again I'm left waiting. Thursday passes Friday passes.... Late Friday afternoon I give them a call and again she tells me no one I have interviewed with is available and HR is also not available for me to speak with.. At this point it's clear that they are blowing me off.... So I explain to the receptionist how long I've been waiting and that I'm kind of getting a little Fed up because Im just want to know where I'm at in the process but every time I call no one is available... Hearing my frustration she puts me on hold. after a few minutes she comes back on the phone and tells me that she was able to speak with the person who conducted my second interview and that they said they were still weighing out their options... Im extremely frustrated at this point because this individual still did not have the ability to come on the phone themselves to answer any questions I had. 

Not even 2 minutes after getting off of the phone I go back to indeed.com to look through jobs and I see that that company that morning posted the job that they had offered me!!! They  posted the job that they specifically offered me for the public to apply to!! All while giving me no kind of update or any kind of communication AT ALL. 

By this time I am infuriated at the lack of communication, I call back and specifically tell the receptionist who I want to speak to. Again she stops me and tells me that no one is available for me to speak to. at this point I specifically tell her that she can relay a message that I'm no longer interested in the job position and I would not like to work for a company that lacks that level of communication with their potential hires. 

After that phone call I also take it upon myself to email the owner and let her know every detail of the chain of events. How no one has contacted me how I was specifically offered a job and how it's been three weeks since I've heard from anybody.

After that email I still get no reply. NOTHING, Nothing at all from anyone, even the owner!!

 Fast forward to today.

I JUST got an email from the second interviewer telling me this... I just wanted to reach out and apologize for any confusion regarding the position that you and I discussed. I wanted to get you hyped up about the position to see how you would react and whether or not you are interested. Our hiring process dictates that you do go through several extensive interviews and a background check as well prior to officially being on-boarded. Despite all of this, I would like to formally apologize to you for any confusion that I may have caused on my end and would love to meet with you again regarding the position. I look forward to speaking with you.

I (32F) made a pretty drastic decision this week to drop everything in my life and move across the state with my two young children and our dog.

The people I am closest to, my whole department at work, was incredibly supportive. That probably speaks to how very transparent my breakdown has been over the last six months. I decided to go back to school online to get my dream job (teaching, mostly because I am passionate about it, a lot because my current retail job is never going to pay enough to support us, but also to better facilitate time for my own kids, especially in the summer and during breaks). I have been working 30 hours, taking 12 credits, and I have my 2- and 4-year-old kids 100% of the time they're not in day care. I am prone to seasonal depression, which I have never been able to find professional help for. I also have untreated ADHD. Oh, and I hate our apartment with my whole being-- 170sqft studio with no kitchen, no bathtub, unreliable internet, in a dangerous neighborhood.

I've done the math, and between the cost of living in our current city and the number of hours I can feasibly work, versus moving to the cheaper university town and living on my student loans (which I already accepted) is about $300/month. I have to move there next year if I get into the program I want to be in, anyway. Our new apartment would be 3x the size, half the price, with a real kitchen, a bedroom, closets, and a tub! I can afford it, I just won't be able to save that $300 to pay back the loan when I graduate.

But another coworker (not in my department) already immediately told me when I mentioned I was anxious about my plan that it was a “terrible idea.” That I couldn't move by myself, I couldn't be alone in a town where I didn't know anyone, I couldn't just quit my job.

What I haven't told anyone but my kids' dad is that the biggest reason I made this choice so quickly is that I was having suicidal thoughts. My apartment's internet shut down completely on the first day of my finals week and I couldn't even find my phone charger in the piles of toys and clothes in our tiny, awful apartment to use my hot spot. I went into a complete panic and thought that if my life was going to be like this forever, I would kill myself. It wasn't until that moment that I realized how deeply unhappy that I am. How much I have hit a wall. When I was younger, it felt like I could always just push though, I could keep tapping reservoirs of energy to make sure I got everything done. Now I feel like I'm not even running on fumes, there's just literally nothing left in me.

Moving feels like the only change I can make that will eventually lead us to a better future, but I'm steeling myself that other people in my life are going to look from the outside and see a crazy half-baked plan, and not a dedicated effort to prioritize my own mental health. I don't want to sound dramatic or hysterical, and I don't want people to worry, but I do want to quickly shut down conversations about what I “can” and “can't” do. Any advice?",18Dec2020,1
370,"For background, I (20f) have an emotionally abusive mom. She has a problem overreacting and screaming at me and has huge boundary/control issues. If I tell her I'm uncomfortable and don't want to do something she starts to scream and tell me I'm ungrateful etc. I have an older sister who hasn't spoken to her since 2015 because of how she abused her as a kid. l have not fully forgiven her for what she's done to me and my sister, but for the past two years, I've mostly moved on as I was in college.

My mom begged me to move in with her and her new husband because of the pandemic. I reluctantly agreed because I was worried about getting the virus. Every few weeks she picks a fight with me until I cry. She very clearly has control issues and my stepdad has noticed it too because he often references how the most minor things cause her to freak out.

I recently decided it would be best for my mental health if I just went back to college. When I told her I planned moving in with my friends, at first she was super against it but then started to get excited for me after I asked her to co-sign for me. She offers for her and my stepdad to drive me to my new apartment (across the country) so i don't have to go on a plane. I thought this was a nice gesture but told her i was reluctant and would think about it. She brings it up the next day. I tell her no thank you but she wont let it go. she demands to know why, so I tell her to stop and that she's being too overbearing and I already said no. she always does this-- demands to know why i dont want to do something and then doesn't respect my boundaries when i tell her why. she then threatens to get rid of the 2 storage boxes of my stuff that i keep at her house. a few days later they get mad at me for not feeling comfortable going out to eat at a restaurant with them (because COVID) and told me that i was being unreasonable which made my stepdad dislike me more. My stepdad has always been a bit hostile and always complains about something I do, but doesn't confront me about it and will just tell my mom I bothered him. When I started staying with them, I usually did the dishes once a day, and he would complain to my mom that I still wasn't doing them enough despite the fact that I did them every day. If we all ate dinner together and I walked away after eating to do homework or because I had a zoom meeting, he would say ""so she just leaves after dinner?"" even though I fully intended to do the dishes later.

My mom and I get into another argument a few days ago and she starts screaming at me again. For context: I have a chronic illness and when something gets me VERY stressed, my medicine stops working for some reason. this has happened once before and I had to go to the hospital. the next day during Hannukah with my grandmother, I realize that i was so stressed about her that my medicine stopped working so i told my mom very respectfully that i would be too sick to eat dinner with them. after i tell her this she keeps asking me questions until my grandma comes in and tells me i dont look well. I dont want to explain everything, so i tell my grandma its because of my period. my mom interjects: ""that's not what she told me. She's just pissed at me"" she then tries to argue with me again. I become furious and storm away. she follows me and I tell her that she needs to go to a therapist, that she is bipolar and it's not fair to me when she takes out her anger on me. I say that im leaving the house to go on a walk and she won't let me leave. I tell her that she is stressing me out to the point that she is ""literally killing me"" and leave. the next day she comes to me to apologize. we makeup and everything is fine.

2 days later my stepdad asks me if I'm going to apologize to her. Hes done this before. I say ""no she already apologized to me"". He says ""So you think she's bipolar, needs to see a therapist and is trying to kill you?"" I do think it was wrong of me to call her bipolar but she refuses to get help and shows signs of it. So i tell him ""UH.. yeah."" he dismissively says ""ok"" and shuts the door. He has always made little digs at me but after this, he is more obvious about how much he hates me and completely ignores me. He's just always passive agressive towards me

I understand he feels protective but he really doesnt see that her behavior isnt normal. Now, I dont know what to do the next few weeks until I leave. He's off work for the next three weeks until I go back to school so i'm always home with him. Before the pandemic, I thought he was cool and now because of this, I'm never going to feel comfortable coming home for the holidays to see my mom when he's around. what should i do?

This is reallly long, but i would love to hear your suggestions. thanks for reading :) ",18Dec2020,1
371,"My brother (29) and I (32F) both live on the same property as my parents. 

Even before we were all living together, my parents have been trying really hard to block my brother and I from doing things together. For example, if I feel like going hiking, and I ask my brother to join me, my parents will make a big thing about ""your brother is so busy, how can you ask him to spend time doing that"". Even if I go to his section of the house, my mom especially will come and tell me to leave him alone because he's working (most times he's watching stuff on his laptop). My brother isn't afraid to tell me to leave him alone if he genuinely is busy or doesn't want to be disturbed (if his door is closed, I don't just barge in. I won't even knock because I know that means to leave him alone). 

It goes beyond this though. My parents are constantly nagging me to ""help out"" in their house saying they can't do everything. But my mom will go in and clean my brother's section and do his laundry, cook his food etc. I do all my own housework, I cook for myself except on family dinner night once a week, I do my own laundry, bath my dog (and my brother's dog), clean the car I use etc. I'm not allowed to dare ask why my brother doesn't have to do chores, because I just get told he is ""busy"". 

Likewise, my parents are constantly ragging on at me because of money. I have been desperately trying to get a job, and they both pester me saying I should have done a better job of saving money (I lived off my savings for over a year before the money ran out and I had to move in with them). My brother spends money like crazy, he gets something delivered every single day to the house, but apparently I'm the one with a spending problem. 

I don't get it. Why are my parents trying so hard to keep my brother and I apart? What could their motivation be?",18Dec2020,1
372,"So I'm about to move across the country. I did it once before and it was hellacious. Stressful and long. I would much, much prefer to fly myself there, but I can't afford to pay movers to drive the van because as far as I know, that's 3k+. So, ideally, I would like to fly and ditch most of my belongings. It's needed in some ways anyways, as I have tons of stuff that I have literally never touched or haven't in years but I hold onto ""just in case"". 

 I currently live in an apartment with someone who was already living here when I moved in, therefore it was already pretty furnished. I own some stuff. When I bought it all at Ikea, it was around 700 dollars. Obviously, some of that is stuff I cannot resell, like tupperware, but the big pieces of furniture I believe I could sell for around 400-500 dollars total, plus I have a new queen mattress and stainless steel frame that I could probably sell for 300 or so total. I also intend to donate most all of my clothes. I have a ton of clothes that I have literally never worn or never will wear, due to just style changes I guess. I think I can reasonably get my clothing down to just a duffel bag. I would put a few things in a carry on, like electronics, my Xbox. Seems like a very easy and doable thing, however I few things that are making me think no:

I would need to ship a few boxes still, I think, as I have other stuff that is not replaceable. I imagine this might cost me a few hundred since the boxes will likely be heavy. So in total, I suspect between the plane ticket, shipping boxes, getting my cat a ticket, and checking a bag, I'm probably in for 600-700 dollars. Factor in that I need to replace A LOT of stuff, which cost me in total about 1,200 dollars when I moved here, and I'm in for 1,900 dollars. Minus the hopefully 600ish dollars I can get for my furniture, and I think it'll be about 1,300 dollars. 

If I were to rent a moving van and drive, I think it would be very, very similar in costs. I have not been able to get a quote without giving out way too much personal info (paranoia), but I've heard from around that a cross country uhaul is at least 1,000 dollars, plus gas, and then plus hotels for about 3-4 nights. I feel like selling everything is possibly going to be my best bet right now, and I would even be willing to drop a couple extra hundred on that just to make my life much easier. But, I'm not sure if this is insane and I just need to suck it up and move my stuff. What do you think?",18Dec2020,1

375,"We're both females, early-mid twenties.

We have lived with each other for two years. I have absolutely no idea how I could've lasted this long. Maybe because I love the area I live in and the stores/places I frequent are close by.

My roommate is obsessed with me, but she also hates my guts. She's made my life a living hell. Everyone in my family and friend circle and my therapist is urging me to move out. It's taken a huge toll on me trying to reason with her. She constantly belittles me. She gives me the silent treatment for asking her to please do her chores. She makes fun of me often. She blames me for problems in her personal life. For example, I'm somehow the reason her BF broke up with her. Even though I've never seen or met the dude. There's an older woman who's the owner of the place, but isn't home most of the time and doesn't get involved in what my roommate does.

There's much more, but that would require a longer post. I'm sick of this nonsense. I just want out. But I also feel like a failure because I feel like I'm letting her win. Like I'm letting her bully me out of my own home. But some family recently offered for me to live with them in the next town over. They're not the best, but they seem pretty excited for me to live with them. And refuse to charge me rent (they tell me they'd feel bad for asking for rent, but of course I want to help them out either way). I'm just worried because it's further away from my job and school and transportation around there is unreliable (I have no car atm)

379,"I literally treat everyone the same.

But I'm sometimes surprised when someone considers me their best friend. If they like me. Or if they say they love me.

One of my buds proclaimed me as one of their best-friends... but they don't feel like that to me. To me a best-friend is someone you can be vulnerable with and who is willing to back you up whenever. This guy usually just hangs out with me... but we hardly ever get into deep discussions. It makes him uncomfortable.

My current GF tells me she loves me... but I had an insane amount of difficulties accepting it and still do. I still over analyze the little things everyday and expect her to find someone new, which I will totally accept.

I actually had to dump another chick who said she liked me because I just couldn't chill the fuck out and accept it.

I always assume they stick around for the money, the superficial looks, or the attention. But everyone tells me they love the way I treat them and accept their flaws, which I kinda do since I'm so harsh on myself and am aware of my own flaws to not judge others.

Is this a normal occurrence? Or should I seek therapy. I think most of this stems from a lack of self-love.",18Dec2020,1

383,"I may not be the least lucky person around but I feel like I'm heading nowhere. I got my bachelor's and masters degree in mechanical engineering from a university in Canada. I returned home after that and I've been working for my father's firm for about 1.5 years. Work we're doing is not really a good investment to my future. I'm unable to find a job elsewhere here. We tried pulling strings but even that is not a guarantee because I'm not the only one that can do that. I've read dozens of technical books, taken several technical courses and still nothing. Everyone is crazy about experience. The reason why I'm looking for a different job is because I need the experience to become a valuable asset to immigrate somewhere else. Jobs exist but I'm unable to find a promising job just makes me hopeless and upset. There's just too many people applying to job posts and the experienced applicants will be favored. So, to make something out of this life I need to work for myself. I need to design products to get somewhat rich (I've got some ideas but they are definitely not novel ideas. But I still feel somewhat hopeless about this route. But I don't have any other choice.) and get the hell out of here and (hopefully) live free and happy, meet people that I find interesting and just enjoy life. Just thinking about the outcome is so refreshing. I never experienced these things. I don't know. I think to be able to allow myself to these possibilities I need to feel financially secure etc. 

But things aren't this simple. My personality is somewhat like Julius Caesar's where I don't like being the 2nd man. I feel secure when I feel I'm better than others and they require my help. But knowing that I'm not the smartest, bravest, or perseverent ever. There are people that are just better than me in terms of brains, wealth etc. This creates an internal struggle within me that just makes me feel inferior. I want to be better than them. I need to be better than them to feel peace. This creates an internal struggle within me that just makes me unhappy with myself and without feeling this peace I can't proceed to other bridges in life where they lead to relationships. Even if I'm around women I can't pursue relationships because, like I said, I haven't secured the peace I need that'll come with being better than others. 

But this isn't the only thing that keeps me away from trying to form emotional connection with others spontaneously. I've tried many times (trust me on this) in person and online in dating sites but never once I was accepted and loved by a stranger. I'm on the verge of accepting that I can never be loved. Just like Francis Dolarhyde and Jean Baptiste Grenouille. I'm 28 years old and have never FELT loved by a stranger. The love that I see in TV. Is it all an act I wonder? Maybe that is the norm? We've seen so many relationships, romanticism in TV that you begin to take it as the norm but maybe we're wrong. Maybe it's just constant struggle and occasional peace? Whatever it may be my accumulated negative experiences in this failed endeavor has conditioned me to hardly ever look for a girlfriend, a wife and to shy away from engaging in behavior that could result in a romantic relationship. 

I mean I'm not a bad person. I'm kind, caring, thoughtful and I even has some traits of Batman :P, albeit I'm not the best looking guy ever. People in mid school used to make fun of my face. And there is just so much competition. Maybe my cure is to just accept things as they are. You win some, you lose some. I have to drill this into my head I think.

So, that's all I can think of right now. What are your thoughts? Am I too weak? Am I just too naive about life? I swear to god if I ever have children I won't let them watch shows and movies in TV until they mature... Do I have unrealistic expectations from life? Am I being unnecessarily negative? Should I expect less, worry less and believe in myself to get through? I'm really not sure.",18Dec2020,2

390,"I actually posted this some time ago in relationshipadvice but deleted it because thinking of it made me sad but because it still weighs on my mind I've decided to discuss it again and with some difference

So basically there's this program where college students temporarily teach in schools and this one teacher taught in mine. He was really charismatic and actually got along with a lot of the other students from the classes that he taught in. He seemed really cool and I had this urge of really wanting to talk to him or get to know him but he only taught my class twice and I don't have the social skills to suddenly strike up a conversation with someone I don't know or who doesn't know me. It was just a normal attraction to his charisma back at the time and I wasn't alone, he was the only teacher that I hear my friends openly respect and talk about fondly. So then lots of time passes, he never taught in my class anymore, and I never got to know him or talked to him, and he just left. I felt really sad about this and I remember when he was surrounded by some people I know and other students saying their farewells when I was just looking from afar.... jealous(?) This is where it gets out of hand. The urge that I was talking about, it didn't disappear. It grew into something weird.. and embarassing. He was constantly on my mind when I didn't have any way of interacting with him. It was an unrealistic illogical fantasy and it kills me with shame just by existing. And the worst part is, that I suddenly sexualized it for some reason. This feels like a mistake, like I got accidentally turned gay. I don't know how it got to this point. And it makes me feel really guilty and shameful. Now, if I somehow got the chance to talk to him I feel like I shouldn't because its weird and creepy, and wrong. But I thought I'd never get that chance anyway so I didn't think much of it. This whole feeling is confusing, and it lasts for 2 years until now.

But after all that, I decided that it was just an unrealistic fantasy. I have lots of those, so this was just an addition to the collection. But since the urges wouldn't go away, I decided that I needed to talk to someone about it, and I did. I confessed to my friend, but only the attraction part in the beginning, because of course. He was actually one of the students that I saw getting along with the teacher I talked about. Then in our conversation, he said that he actually has the teacher's number. This was a game changer. My mind then put the previously said urges out of the unrealistic fantasies list and I was really hopeful even if the problems still exist. And this is what I asked in my previous post, should I go for it? And if so, how?

I put too much emphasis on the gay part in my previous post though and I got responds thinking that I wanted a relationship with him, which isn't the case.... unless I'm lying at myself?? To clarify, what I want to do is mostly just to clear my burden, maybe make the urges go away, and clear the regret that I feel for not talking to him back when he was in my school, to see what if I was in a different class back then. I think I can pretend that I don't have any feelings for him, like how it was in the beginning. The obstacle is what if it makes it wrong for me to talk to him because of those feelings, or that these feelings will somehow make it go wrong. Best case scenario for me is that we can continue to talk without it being weird, but I think I would be satisfied with having one simple conversation. But so I ask once again, what should I do?",18Dec2020,0

393,"Hello, after reading the posts on this subreddit I’ve realized that my problems are absolutely minimal in comparison. However this situation is driving me crazy.

I recently was on Omegle chatting with random people paired with the same interest of college. I wasn’t expecting to really meet anyone interesting until I met with his person tonight. Usually the first message is “M” or “F.” You’re typical shenanigans. However this person immediately asked me outright what my name was. I told her my first name and nothing else. Then the long conversation went off. Then she wanted to move to another app so that we could at least see what each other looked like. She’s not an instagram model and she’s not the most ugly girl I’ve ever talked to. She’s just pretty.

Whenever she showed me I denied that it was her and she basically tried to say bye. I was confused and questioned what was wrong before she actually left. The conversation continued and eventually got flirty and more personal with questions.

Towards the end of the night I asked her to just send a picture of her as she was. Nothing explicit. Just a natural selfie in bed. She ended up sending me another picture that looked like something someone would post on Instagram or something.

After that happened the red flags started popping up in my head. So I asked her if we could FaceTime or call. However, I had forgot at the beginning of our conversation she said that her phone was old and kind of beaten down because of her current living situation with college.

This is a lot so I’m gonna put it flat. She doesn’t have social media, she wouldn’t send a picture because her phone was broke, and she didn’t want to call because she didn’t want to share her number or email.

The question I’m posing for advice is split into two different frames of thought. The first being if I’m crazy for thinking this is a real girl? Is it dumb that I’m even considering this as a real person or do you think that I’m just being paranoid? The next is if there’s any question or anyway that I could get her to comfortably prove to me that it is truly her? This very dumb I know, but before I go on developing some form of relationship with this person( if that happens as a friendship or more) I want to make sure I’m not getting catfishedor something. Part of me is screaming in paranoia and the other is saying that it could all be valid. She’s 19 and living in California as a college student so she could be protective over her information and broke for good reason.

However, for me, I was a super unpopular white girl that always kept to myself. Anyways, after being good friends for a few years he asks me out on a date. Shocked, I said yes. Long story short we only dated a few months. He broke it off claiming we were too good of friends and it didn't seem right. It hurt me deeply and we parted ways. Oddly, we didn't keep in touch for years which also hurt me.
Within the past few years we have reconnected. I'm currently engaged, working towards my Bachelors. Hes just one class from finishing his associates, owns his own home, doing great. 
Now we're at our current setting. Recently his messages have been short and off putting. Even one of our mutual friends finished boot camp and he invited us to hang out at a celebration. My old buddy insisted that I didn't go. Seemed mad that I was invited. I respected it and didn't attend. Then, soon after we ran into eachother on campus. He smiled alot, gave me a long hug and seemed genuinely happy to see me. I suggested that we have lunch together periodically while on campus. He happily agreed. Once that second lunch approached he bailed and acted weird about it.
He's polite, never insults me, always replies when I message him. Even opened up to me about being a demisexual. I just want my old friend back, but he always seems to have a wall up and never wants to see me. What should I do? If there isn't anything I can do, help me understand why he's being distant. If he didn't want to be friends he wouldn't message me all the time. I'll purposely go MIA to see if he truly wants to be friends, and he always hits me up.",18Dec2020,0

396,"One year ago I was raped. I had hard time proccesing this, my mental health was really bad. Ever since then I keep shaking. And with that I mean like visibly, whole body shaking. Most of the time is when I’m nervous (like meeting new people - and I’m actually very talkative person, but idk why now i have problem meeting new people), stressful (before test) or when I’m under really strong negative emotions (when I’m mad/sad/i don’t feel comfortable I will just start shaking before I even show any other emotions). I even shake when I’m cold - again, we are not talking about normal “uf im freezing” - I shake when I don’t even feel actually cold yet and some people came to help me because they thought I was on some kind of weird drugs (sounds funny but it’s not...). And all od those shakings can just turn into panic attack - even when it’s just because it’s winter and I feel little cold. 
I don’t really understand how to help myself. I was always very confident person and I feel like I can’t even recognize myself now because I can’t take anything without shaking. Any advice?",18Dec2020,1

399,"First of, I am going to use publisher and editor in this text, as the german word that I came across can be used as either of those and I am not talking about the publishing company or ""Verlag"" but the publisher, which is a single name or a few names which is the ""Herausgeber""

I am currently in the process of publishing a book for someone and came across the section editor/publisher on the platform where I should publish it. I've asked the author whether I would need to write my name there and he said that it's my decision to make.

The reason I now don't know if I should do it is that I read up on what a publisher or editor is supposed to do and I don't feel like I meet the conditions especially since I saw someone claiming a novel doesn't need a publisher, because the publisher (at least in Germany) is more of a quality control. I don't feel like I meet this description, as although we plan on maybe founding a publishing company in the future, for which the before mentioned quality control would be useful, I am only an unknown year old 17 right now, so my name would do nothing next to an author who has already published several books and has been interviewed on television etc.

For a bit more of context, I slightly edited the book (not changing the words, only making sure everything is spaced right etc. as he wants me to keep errors he makes, which will explain itself later) I made suggestions how we could market it, most of which were accepted, I added important things like the imprint etc., made the cover for the book and added all the important informations which are needed for printing.

Now for context on the thing with the possible publishing company, He proposed founding a publishing company, which would be especially for mentally and bodily disabled people (he is bodily and I am slightly mentaly disabled) to publish their books and/or write about their lifes and I would in theory ""inherit"" the company (he is already in his 80s)

So now the question is: Should I write myself as the publisher/editor in hopes of building up some kind of quality control to my name (or at the very least have something for my cv), or shouldn't I write anything into publisher/editor as this is mostly just needed for scientific publications?

p.s. I would need an awnser pretty soon, as the first book should be published tomorrow at the latest as I just recieved the go to accept the contracts.

edit: title should be more like ""should I write myself as editor/publisher in  a novel"" sorry, I just began writing and didn't look back at my title.",18Dec2020,1
402,"On another social media site, I posted a politically themed image. I was surprised to know that a good friend I have on the site revealed a whole new, and frankly confusing side of them I never expected regarding the image topic. My post was also the first time they really expressed this opinion. (Mind you, they weren't being rude or aggressive, and they're not saying they're pro-Nazi or anything, don't worry).

Though, I totally respect that they have their own opinions and perspectives, which is why I'm asking for advice. I don't want to neither have a debate with them to avoid uncomfortable tension with someone I do respect, nor do I want to totally ignore them, since I feel that's just as awkward. When it comes to friends, I wind up acting like I suddenly agree with their views when I actually don't just out of intimidation, even if they are already being quite civilized about it (which this particular friend is).

I rather joke in some way that doesn't come across as making fun of them, or say something very simple and of course polite that wouldn't allow the conversation to go further.

Every now and then I like to share such posts for a lot of the family/friends that do share the same political perspectives as me. I'm really bad at this stuff, and this one just caught me off guard after years of having no problem with the odd political post every now and then. Hence why I'm here, so please don't be harsh. (I mean it can't hurt to learn how to deal with this kind of issue for future reference and other people).

Thanks!

[Edit]
For the record, I'm not in any way saying that it be okay to be disrespectful and aggressive to someone who disagrees with your opinions online if they happen to not already be a good friend of yours.

403,"No I don't have imposter syndrome. I just know for a fact that i've cheated on numerous exams and quizzes this school year and I frankly don't deserve to be here.

A little backstory, i'm a high school student. I've always been an honor student since kindergarten, and  I graduated at the top of my class in elementary school. I've competed in various competitions so a couple people knew me when I entered highschool. Needless to say, it was rough to be put on such a high pedestal only to fall down twice as hard. I was still an honor student, but never really made it to the top 10. I kind of thought I wasn't as smart as people made me out to be. I eventually became comfortable with that fact because I was able to focus on things I wanted to do out of school.

This school year was great in a way, I got to stay at home. But that also meant there's a shit ton of resources these days. I could just look up answers in an instant. At first, I was able to keep myself out of it. I tried to learn and answer questions by myself, but that eventually became a little harder to do. Online classes sucked because the teachers don't really get to explain everything well, and our online modules are a little too \*rough\* in a way. Nobody really understood what and I know there's a lot of people who did the same thing I did. I cheated one time, it was fine. The second time, it was fine. The fifth time, it felt wrong. And then it became a daily companion. I'd open the module on another window and look for answers during quizzes. I would open modules or retake quizzes (our eL lets us do that so we could just know the answer on previous questions) during exams. For the meantime it felt wrong but all I wanted was survive these lessons. 

I never really gave a fuck about rankings anymore because I figured they were unhealthy anyway, and told myself that if I don't make it to the ranks or anything, it's absolutely fine. Cheaters don't deserve that anyway.

Then I woke up at the top of my class with an A+.

I told my family, they were stoked, my friends were stoked, but I wasn't. This feels wrong. I don't deserve to be here. I know there's better people who should have been here that didn't cheat and actually used their IQ to solve hard math equations. All I did was pull up Mathway on exams and get 90 or something and I don't even fucking know how to solve using the quadratic formula. I don't think I ever even used my brain to the fullest potential. It's not right, I shouldn't be here.

I feel so wrong and I know this will backfire. I don't know what to do. My friends told me to just suck it up and enjoy myself, but I can't. I know this will raise people's expectations of me again, only to come back a year later with a B- or something. I'd take no honors at all than be this. I hate it. I don't know what to do next. I feel like such a pretentious crap.",18Dec2020,3
406,"My sister has been having a rough time recently, I won't go into detail, but she was away from home for a bit. I'd like to clarify my sister is an adult, so she could leave if she wanted to, but she's only 19 and right now is looking for a job.

Earlier today I went up stairs to find her... just kind of standing in the kitchen. When she showed me that she had found a bottle of sunflower lecithin. The bottle was in our walk in pantry, and was buried in the very back, so you wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it specifically.

She then went on to explain she thinks our mom might be putting it in our food. I asked her why, and she explained that the lecithin can give stomach pains if taken too much.  My sister stated that she has been dealing with stomach pains for the past few months, and the only time she didn't have them was when she was away and not at the house.

So she think our mom is putting lecithin in her food, saying that he lasagna was spicy, even though when I had the lasagna it tasted great. Also, I'm not having stomach pains!

So I don't know what or who to believe, I don't want to tell my sister she's a liar, but it does seem far fetched, how should I handle this?

I don't know why and I've talked about it to him. We've established that there's nothing to be jealous about, and he's never done anything to even prove slightly otherwise.

It's just engrained into my mind and i can't get it out.

 He'd just be talking about doing a project with a girl and the thought would pop up in my head that they're so much prettier or smarter or overall better.

It probably stems from my low self esteem and past relationship getting-cheated-on issue.

She wanted full PayPal payment in advance before we even set an appointment time and I told her that I wouldn't pay before meeting her. That I'd pay upfront in person but not online.

416,"Hi, I’m a maths major at university and love studying maths. And for the past 2 years I’ve also been learning Japanese and have gotten to the point where I can understand a lot of media. 

I think I was romanticising the idea of becoming fluent when I started out though, because the closer I get, the more I realise that (for me personally), being able to understand Japanese isn’t as fulfilling as I thought it would be. 

At the same time, it’s also quite time consuming (2-3 hours/day), which is time I’d rather spend now thinking about/studying maths, or even doing something more relaxing like meditating.

I’ve been thinking/stressing about giving it up for the past 3 months, to the point where I’ve lost sleep (I know it’s ridiculous). And I think I want to give it up. 

As it’s almost Christmas, my Dad had been asking me what I wanted for Christmas. I said I didn’t really want anything but he insists on getting me something. So I (stupidly) said he could get me a manga volume in Japanese or something. 

It’s been a few weeks since then and I’m pretty sure he’s bought something now and I’m extremely regretting asking for something.

So, my question is should I tell him I plan to give up Japanese and apologise for asking for the present, or continue learning Japanese so I can accept the present but probably end up dropping it later?

Recently my mom and i have been more open with eachother and she has been opening up about the struggles she faced when i asked questions about my dad. But now everytime i think of myself as a child or my mom my heart just sinks.

Even the lonely times when my dad was gone, i didnt feel lonely even when alone. But now thinking back to when i was away from my mom at a relatives how lonely it was. I was alone but it wasnt traumatic but thinking back now i feel lonely.

Whenever im in a similarly lit room to those in my childhood, where happy memories took place it feels empty. These memories evoked no emotion before, and these rooms didnt make me feel this emptiness. But it does now.

When i come across baby toys which light up and make noise i just am frozen in sadness, cause it reminds me of that bright happy child who lost everything and was so innocent and didnt understand death too properly.

When i see my mom alone or with a baby, i see the look in her face, seeing kids interacting with their dad and how she is distraught that we never had that. The look in her eyes break me everytime.

The feeling is odd, i feel anxious and alone. I want to find my mom and hug her. I have felt it a few times as a child too after my dad passed but these times i was actually lonely and alone so i wanted fo cry. This feelings make me want to cry but like my brain, my tears are stuck.

The thing is, Jessica treats her like crap. She has my gran buying her all sorts, she gets an allowance from her (although she's almost 18) and she just doesn't engage in conversation with her. When my gran talks to her she just stares at her phone and grunts back. I'm more mad at my gran for allowing that kind of behaviour, if i did the same to her in my teens i would've received a clip around the ear.

It's starting to bother me even more that literally anything i say, she says ""oh jessica does that"" and most of the time it's a lie.

426,"Yeah so I’ll try not to drag this out as it’s still a sensitive subject. I also didn’t know if this was the right Reddit to post on but let’s hope so.

Hi, so I’m a 20 year old male living in Wales (AKA not England) and I really think I fucked up bad and I’m just looking for some reassurance on the matter. 

When I was in later primary school, I was between 8-10 years old, my dad, who I already knew was a complete prick by this point (I’m not going to go on at this point but let’s just say he was abusive) made me do things that I still recall to this day. I bottled this in until October this year, as my parents split up in September and my dad moved out (that’s the pandemic for you).

My mum obviously completely kicked off, and now there’s a court case against my dad, and right now I have a date where I have to record my testimony. He caught wind of the allegations and has now refused to pay any child maintenance since he left (upwards of £1000 total), has cancelled every billing company so now my mum has to be threefold what she was paying before, and due to this we are going to lose the house around Easter and have all our belongings repossessed, and be made legally homeless.

I also know before I made the allegations, that my dads mum (or rather my Nain, it’s a Welsh thing), is one of the highest regarded social workers in the country, and I’m convinced there’s some foul play with the court case, and no action is being taken currently and I’ve had no information. I knew she wouldn’t take my side and just brandish me a liar so I can’t help for feeling to blame that I should’ve seen this coming?

It’s not as if there’s only me, my mum, and my dad either, they both had eight kids and my older sister has her own place, so he is making 7 of his kids homeless (from the age of 8) and again I feel like if I hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t be constantly concerned that these actual kids are going to be living on the street because of me. I am currently on antidepressants, while he’s living with another woman (that he’s secretly been with for two years).

Not only am I wondering if this is truly my fault, but any advice would also be greatly appreciated.

427,"I apologize for the wall of text...

I was dating my ex-bf (29) for 7 months (Jan-July) who secretly had another girlfriend the entire time. He moved in with me while still in a relationship with her and lied to her about why he and I were always together- that we ran a drug business (I would never sell drugs).  I found out about the secret girlfriend in August when she approached me during a doctors appointment (she worked there)- I had no clue she existed until then.

Our relationship ended when I found out he was cheating on me with another girl, (not the secret girlfriend)  kicked him out of our apartment. 

Unbeknownst to me, one of my roommates (30f) was also sleeping with him while he and I were living together. After I kicked him out for cheating on me, she privately convinced the other roommates (30s) to let him spend the night every night and to not tell me. I found out obviously and tried to tell the man (40s) who ran the apartment about the situation (we rented by room). He completely denied it and even told me I was the one harassing my ex (I should mention my ex would follow me around town and beg for forgiveness/take him back after I kicked him out to the point where I had to threatened to get a restraining order) and to drop it or he would kick me out. 

The gaslighting got so bad that I fell into a manic episode and almost checked myself into a mental hospital. My roommates then used said manic episode to drive me to react and used it all to get me fired from work. My roommates also used my manic episode to goad me into acting frantic and then manipulated that and sound bites, which they sent to people I know and social media. 

After denying my ex-bf was spending the night in the apartment every night, one roommate (37m) cracked and admitted to all of it. I wasn’t actually imagining it; my reality was real! it was a shock to the system that the people I spent my life with, my friends, would do something like this.

I made plans to move to another place and checked into a hotel until I moved. I value my mental health and couldn’t stay in that environment. 

I applied for unemployment the day I was fired, was approved and received benefits. However, the day I moved, I was mysteriously reported for UI fraud. Im suspecting my roommates/ex-bf didn’t want me to I have an income because of my ex-bf, and wanted me to suffer ( I didn't commit fraud). They had spoken on doing this as a joke when I lived with them as retribution for my ex-bf lying about running a drug business with me.. I have savings thankfully so I was ok for a couple of months- the identity issue is still going on though.

I have PTSD after all of this- I cannot interact with anyone without suspecting nefarious ulterior motives. I often wake up from nightmares about it all crying. So I guess the reason I want to talk is to ask how to move past this? How do I get back to myself?
I moved to start over but it followed me and is continuing to interrupt my life. I know therapy is the main answer but I can’t afford it at present moment.

TL;DR: My ex boyfriend cheated on me, I kicked him out of my apartment, my roommates allowed him to spend nights there secretly and gaslit me. They tried to ruin my reputation when I found out. How do I move past this?",18Dec2020,1

429,"About 7 years ago, My sister started acting extremely off, we didn’t notice it at the time but after a long night at a best friends house with cops everywhere, our sister was apparently being molested by our brother. Shit went too hell. But after countless months of therapy, my brother was able too be welcomed back into the family, and in that time, And over the years, it kinda fell on to me that I am her big brother, the guardian so too speak.

A couple of ours ago, I found a camera hidden in the bathroom recording, my brothers phone. He wouldn’t admit it at first, but I interrogated him and found he was recording my sister using the bathroom and using it too masturbate.

He’s looking into moving out now, and is probably going to leave for good. I said I wouldn’t tell our parents but i don’t know if thats something I can keep

I dont know what to do, hes my brother and my dad would most definitely kill him if he found out, but its my sister, and i promised my mother I would protect her. Our financial situation is on him and i just cant see a way out of this that doesn’t destroy us

431,"Hi everyone! This is a throwaway account and details have been slightly altered. I am so sorry in advance for the length and bad writing, I'm so exhausted, sad, and have reached my breaking point. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

**The Relationship:** So my younger brother (19M) got into his first real relationship with a girl (20F) he met at school this year and their relationship is unhealthy to say the least. She demands around the clock communication, issues ultimatums, gaslights him, guilts him by saying things like his love is the only reason she's still alive, distanced him from his friends, and starts constant fights for literally no reason. Right now they're separated because of winter break but all of this behavior has somehow gotten even worse long distance. She's been in multiple long term relationships before, so it's not like she's navigating dating for the first time (as if that's a valid excuse for her behavior). There's honestly a lot more I could say about the way she's treated him but I really don't want to reveal any identifiable details. The cherry on top for all of this is that they've only been dating for TWO MONTHS.

**Why I'm Worried:** We didn't grow up with any positive relationship examples as our father was/is extremely abusive to all three of us. We grew up witnessing my mom swear she was leaving my dad only to get cold feet at the last minute, which is exactly what my brother does every time his girlfriend gets mad at him. My brother himself has admitted that their situation has a very similar dynamic to my parents and that his girlfriend reminds him of our dad. On top of that, our beloved mother passed away from an illness this past summer, and everything related to that was extremely traumatic for us both. He's back in our shitty family home, and using the relationship as an escape to cope. He also barely stands up for himself in the relationship even when she's completely in the wrong.

Even though he's ten feet away it's like he doesn't exist. If he isn't communicating with her at his every waking moment, he's afraid she'll be upset and take it out on him. His personality has done a complete 180 in the past two months; he's sullen, angry, irritated, and looks physically ill. He failed his most important finals because he keeps staying up till 6am every night to talk to her because she's in a different time zone. I do my best to explain why the way she treats him is wrong, two of his friends from his hometown have expressed concern for him as well. He understands the many ways in which she's toxic and admits that he hates the way he feels with her and keeps saying things are going to change but nothing has. It genuinely hurts so much seeing him like this, I'm constantly worrying about him and I have a deep rooted fear that he's never going to leave this relationship and end up miserable the rest of his life just like my mom. I've talked about this with my therapist but none of her suggestions were helpful.

I'm ashamed to say that there's also a part of me that's furious with him. I hate to say this, but he's putting ten times more effort into this relationship than he ever did with our mother even when she was dying, and thinking about that fills me up with rage. I also feel like I've been there for him in so many different ways, yet he completely prioritizes someone he's known for a few months over me. I ran out of toilet paper the other day and he refused to leave his 8 hour call to grab me some, yet later that night expected me to hang up a call with my own boyfriend to hear about his drama. It makes me feel like he doesn't actually care about me. We used to be so close, and he knows this might be the last time him and I will ever get to spend a significant amount of time together, but I guess he just doesn't care about me anymore unless he needs to vent.

What should I do? Is there anything I can do?

**TLDR: My brother is in an extremely unhealthy relationship and I don't know what to do.**",18Dec2020,2

I deactivated my twitter, I couldn’t stay there when some of my friends were mad at me. I just feel so terrible right now, I hate myself.

Cutting has been my best coping mechanism for a while until I started drinking, but like my antidepressants, two at a time is better than waiting to do the other.

435,"I know this may sound stupid or whatever but my mom is white and my dad is Latino. I never met my dad and so I grew up with my mom's side of the family so I never learned Spanish/the culture. My mother got married to another white man across the country and he was always there since I can remember, I knew he wasn't my dad but I never questioned who my dad was, I never really even thought about it until my step-sister told me about my Mexican dad. But I wasn't 100% sure because it was just her word. Growing up though I look like a normal white guy so no one even questioned either. It wasn't until I got older when I started filling out my own paperwork. My mother always tried to hide info about my biological dad so she always put white on the paper. I don't really care and for the most part, I think it is easier to tell people I am white since I don't want to make it awkward if someone asked if I am Latino and then if they asked me if I speak Spanish or something then I would have to explain to them that my father left at a young age and I feel like that might make some people unconfrontable since some people might consider it a deep topic. Another part I don't get is that there is an option for 2 or more races but then it says not Latino or Hispanics so I am generally confused why do they exclude Latino and Hispanics?

I flew home for his death, so I’m not sure if going back to school will help me with this problem, but every day I’ve been waking up in my childhood bedroom and for about 3 seconds I get peace and then this automatic thought just rips through my head “dad is dead” and it hurt so much.

It’s like I’m so off guard and the pain becomes so raw I instantly cry. I can hold it together through most days, but now I’m genuinely terrified to go to bed every night to have to go through this over and over and over again.

I used to be able to wake up and think about what I was going to do that day, day dream, or just be peaceful so I could go back to sleep. But this just comes so automatic and it’s just destroying me. I miss being able to sleep in peace and I want to do so. It’s not going to make my dad undead.

I'm the first born and she's always been very exigeante? idk the word in english. 

At one point I realized that she would never be able to be there for me emotionally because maybe she didn't know how to guide me. 

So I gave up trying to come to her for comfort because I only brought her and myself pain everytime I asked for advice and only got I don't knows or we didn't see eye-to-eye...and she didnt listen to me. 

There's no conflict resolution because she gets frustrated and doesn't understand my point of view. 
 

I have a pretty big decision to make right now and after 2 years of not asking for advice to do anything. I asked her and again it was a mistake. 

She got pretty frustrated and didn't listen... and she wants me to choose things based on what she sees but my logic tells me differently and now I need to ask a lawyer because I'd rather feel
safe than sorry. 

So yeah... I wish she'd be a little bit less frustrating or tried to comfort me and understand me but all I get is ""own up to your own mistakes""

This problem is also reflecting on my relationships (I think). Because I keep choosing men that were abandoned by their dad.

445,"Growing up, both my parents were alcoholics. This included multiple rehab admissions, regular child services visits, my mother attempting to overdose, both parents losing their licenses for drunk driving and generally made my home life unstable. They have both been sober for over a year.

Due to this I've never been into drinking myself - when I turned 18 (I'm Australian - legal drinking age is 18) I decided I just wouldn't drink. I'd like to emphasise that I in no way judge others for drinking and totally understand that most people see it as a fun way to de-stress, but personally I just can't enjoy it. I have no problem attending parties/going to bars/etc where people are drinking, and no one has ever really bothered me about not drinking.

However, I am not comfortable in heavily alcohol-fuelled environments (ie when everyone is completely drunk and throwing up). I just know that I wouldn't be able to cope as it would remind me of a lot of memories I would rather forget about.

This was never an issue until recently. Basically, in Australia, once you finish your final year of high school (which I did this year) most students will go on what is called 'Schoolies'. It’s pretty similar to Spring Break in America - you travel to somewhere with a beach and spend a week partying and getting drunk with your friends. Again, absolutely no judgement from me here, I understand why everyone has a good time but its just not for me and I really don’t feel comfortable in this type of environment at this point in my life.

Anyway, at the start of the year my friend group started making plans about our own schoolies trip. At the time, only a couple of them actually knew about my parents being the reason I don't drink (I never knew how to explain it and didn’t want to deal with all their questions) and seemed pretty surprised when I said I wasn't sure if I wanted to attend. However the topic was soon brushed aside though because at the time it was assumed no one would be able to travel due to covid.

However, cases in Australia are so low that most restrictions were lifted a few months ago. My friends kept including me in their plans and so I reminded them that I didn't want attend. This time I ended up breaking down and explaining to everyone the actual reason why I didn’t want to go. I added that it was definitely not anything to do with them, that I wanted to remain friends and hoped they would had a great time. They were all very supportive and I assumed everything would go back to normal.

However, since my final exam 3 weeks ago NONE of my friends have made an effort to speak to me. Every conversation I've had has been initiated by me. They've all been posting on social media of their schoolies trip pretty frequently and seem to have bonded over the trip, whereas whenever I reach out to any of them I get one sentence replies and get told that they're busy whenever I ask if they want to catch up.

So, I need some advice. Do I need to apologise and make it up to them?  I’m currently feeling pretty lonely and am starting to think I’ve been a bad friend.",18Dec2020,1

451,"My (29F) older sister (37F) started talking to this guy (45M) like a week ago and he is a complete lunatic. My sister has been staying at my place for the past few months and she told me about this guy she had met. She brought him over the other day while she grabbed some clothes. He seemed pretty normal, just a bit awkward. She had broken her phone and had called me from his phone so he has my number (important for later). 

Anyway, the next day he was driving her to work due to snow and she ends up calling me (from a strangers phone) asking me to pick her up from a Dublin donuts about 20 minutes away. I was thankfully on lunch (working from home) and was able to get her. She said this dude was acting crazy and she felt scared to be alone with him so she got out of his car at a red light and the person behind them let her in. She explained this dude was being crazy. He proceeded to follow them, honking, yelling, trying to get in front of them. They pull over and he rips my sister out of the car. A bunch of other shit happened and the cops were involved. This guy has apparently been to jail so my sister told the cops she just wanted to go home as to not get him arrested. 

He starts texting my phone looking for her and says he’s going to the hospital (for the psych unit). He has been calling my phone from the hospital for the past few days. I’ve been ignoring it but she did call him back the first day. He said he’s been off whatever meds he takes and that’s why he’s all messed up. 

I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years and this is giving me extreme flashbacks. This guy reminds me of my ex so much. I am absolutely terrified.

457,"I am 19/F. I was raised and adopted by my grandparents because my bio parents are both addicts and I think that is important to note here, because I keep saying I've never had anyone to cover my back and this is exactly what I mean. 

Let me start by explaining why I decided to let my friend drive in the first place. Yesterday, my coworkers and everyone were discussing our shifts and trading days to better fit our schedules. One of my coworkers said they'd take my shift for today, and so I thought I was off. 

Later, manager calls asking me why I'm not at work. I explain the situation but he is confused and doesn't understand. He tells me that I'm supposed to be there and can't have today, tomorrow, and Sunday off. I try to explain again but he's still stuck on what the schedule says and not the fact that we had traded shifts. I give up, and tell him that I'll be there as soon as I am able to find a ride and he says OK and to let him know. Because, you know. They're probably going to be short a person and it felt like the right thing to do. 

Now, I just got a car, like 2 or 3 weeks ago. I haven't driven too much, and the only way to get to my work is to drive across the interstate. Let me tell you, I am NOT ready to make that drive yet. My grandparents are usually the ones who drive me, but they were at work and they weren't answering the phone, so I called my friend instead. 

My friend just sold his truck to somebody else, and so he doesn't have a vehicle. So we agreed that if I drove to his house, he'd drive me to work because it was safer. And note, my friend is a 33 year old WHITE man who has worked with cars in car dealerships for half his life. And I've seen him drive before, he's a really good driver. It wasn't like I let just anybody drive, because me and this guy have become really close friends over the past year. If it were under normal circumstances, I wouldn't have let him drive. But he's somebody I really trust and I didn't have anyone else to go too. 

I ended up staying over at his house for the night, after calling my grandma and explaining what happened. It was mainly to just chill and talk about shit, but it got too late so i decided to wait until morning before i drive back home. She acted like everything was cool and dandy before when I explained over the phone, and then she called me at 5 in the morning to inform me she was taking me off her insurance because I'm letting my friends drive me places. 

She mentioned something about me hanging around a black guy, (which I have NO IDEA what that has to do with anything), and when I tried to explain to her it was only a one time thing she kept saying over and over that I wasn't listening to her, and that I needed to listen because she was taking me off the insurance. 

I'm just extremely ""what the fuck"" right now, because I didn't think I did anything wrong. I thought I was being responsible and safe by not getting onto the interstate when I wasn't ready, and possibly wrecking my brand new fucking car, that I PAID FOR. 

Like, I'm so mad. And I don't know if I'm ever going to talk to them again after this, because they are always pulling crap like this. I live with them still, because like I said, where the fuck else am I gonna live? I'm trying to go to college and build a decent life for myself, I am working. I'm not sitting around most days, playing video games, and smoking weed. I mean, I do those things, but only when I have time and I have other priorities. She offered to put me on insurance to help, and I get it, its her insurance, but what the fuck?

Last time I stayed at this same friends house, she pulled me aside, and told me that because I'm crashing at a guy friends house people will think I'm a whore or a prostitute. And honestly, I still can't get over it because it was completely out of nowhere. And this friend and I ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING. We're just FRIENDS.

I've had a strong desire to receive tantric or erotic massages by male massage therapists who are also nonconformists and LGBT allies (not one or the other - if so, I won't work with them).

I'm also understanding of some who may be attracted to me and want to get to know me first.

As a 7 time dating abuse survivor, Munchausen's by proxy survivor, and time domestic violence survivor, LGBT abuse survivor and countless-times-over domestic violence survivor, I wanted to figure out how I could use my love of sexual privacy, alternative lifestyles &amp; nonconformity to lead me toward a safe and positive bond &amp; experience.

Is this something I should do?  
If not, what are some other methods of healing I could try?  
I am well aware that it is America's second lock down, and I need to socially distance - and my living situation is not ideal to host anybody - whether they're friends, lovers, or even online pen pals I want to invite to my house.

I'm also in the later stages of moving out, and am on a budget if $680 per month and have to stretch every cent out for 30 days - except for all my annual bills (which are paid for 1-3 years, in various capacities); food, which I receive separate income for; and health insurance, which is also paid for by one of my abusers.

I've spent my entire life being told how I wouldn't amount to anything because I'm a YouTuber; being told by every race in the book (who I either flirted with or swapped photos with) that I can't date them because I'm ugly and was sometimes subjected to sexual racism because of it (I'm a black, 24 year old man).  
As I write this, I've written a list of all the people who ""committed domestic violence &amp; LGBT abuse toward me"" - and have 35 people documented in my notes, who are all former friends, family members, exes, ""almost relationships (people who were attracted to me and when I brought up dating, they cut me out their lives and never spoke to me again)"".

I just want to find a way to meet free thinkers who hate toxic masculinity and antifeminism as well, who are open to being my friend and seeing where it goes - and also a way to always be able to reach out to them if I need help with my family - almost like needing an ally or liberator against my own family.

I've always wanted to create a round table web series where I'm the host and I interview free thinkers and people who used to be set in their ways (who are young, like the free thinkers) and are now open to exploring neutrality, due to some type of circumstance that led them to knowing me personally, and doing my show.

I am also a major supporter of astrology, tarot, psychics and numerology, and am someone who rebelled against my family and religion at an early age - I've been an atheist since age 13 (I'm 24 now).

I dated 4 addicts in the past + having 2 addicts hide their romantic feelings for me, and then all that be taken (without my knowledge) the moment I join their Facebook Live show &amp; their whole focus be toward me, so I refuse to date an addict who isn't in rehab or hasn't been vulnerable with themselves about their addiction - so if they can't be vulnerable enough to admit they're an addict, then they'll never break any barriers with me.",18Dec2020,0

462,"Throwaway because my sister most likely wouldn't appreciate me sharing this.

My elder sister (27F) and I (22F), share a very close bond. 10 years ago, when I was about 10 or 11, my sister shared a very painful piece of information with me. From the ages 4-6, my older sister was raped repeatedly by my uncles. I will spare you the details as just writing about this is extremely harrowing for me.

I have always tried to be there for my sister, I love her more than anything in the world and hearing about this violation, and the destruction of her childhood has been such a heavy burden for me to carry. I don't blame her for sharing it with me, rather, I'm glad she opened up to me, and I hope it was somewhat cathartic. I would do anything for her.

And while my sister struggles with her the trauma of such abuse, a struggle that I could never begin to understand and I most certainly don't want to minimise her pain - just THINKING about what she went through has taken such a toll on me.

10 years later, I find that the pain I feel for her on her *behalf* is getting out of control. She didn't ask me to feel sorry for her, and yet I do. The pain literally eats away at me, and I don't know how to toughen myself up against it. I want to be there for her; instead, whenever I see a baby photo of her, I just burst into tears. On the days that I see her in person, the knowledge of her childhood gnaws away at me to the point I can't converse with her properly. I usually end up spending those nights sobbing in bed.

It's really starting to affect my everyday life, seeing my sister brings up flashbacks to me of HER trauma. She doesn't need me reminding her of something she's trying to overcome. I don't understand how I can be this sensitive. Why can't I get over it? It didn't even happen to me.

I am very interested in computers (more code than electronics however both are interesting to me). I first started to code when I was 9 and I’ve been doing it ever since. I’ve done my GCSE computer science exams. Also I love making games however I am aware it’s not a profitable job being a game developer most of the time.

473,"Ever since I was 4 years old (now 20 years old) I had a thing for wedgies and as I got older the feelings have gotten stronger. My first memory was my sister lifting me by the underwear and I remember constantly asking her to do it again.  From that point on I would constantly give siblings,cousins and friends wedgies until I was about 15. I also used to let my underwear hang out on purpose to try and tempt people to give me one including teachers and bosses. For about 12 years I would lock myself in my room and hang by my underwear (if I felt risky I would hang myself at the park) or pull it so hard I would bleed or rip them off. This caused me to get Peyronie’s disease and also led to erectile dysfunction. Everyday since I got a phone in around 2010 I’ve been searching up “wedgie” on multiple sites so I can see most content and if I had to estimate how much time I spent looking at those videos a day id say 10 hours. The past couple years I have been paying women to give me wedgies, talk about one on video or let me give them some and it’s depressing. I added it up and it’s been over $8000 spent on paying them plus buying underwear for it. It makes me feel like garbage because I can’t find anyone willing to just do it for free. It does not feel fair that I have to pay so much for the thing I love. I can’t go an hour without thinking about them which has led to me quitting 6 jobs and having 3 major break ups because I hate going that long without getting one. My friends are getting mad at me because I don’t hang out with them anymore so I can do these. I am also lashing out on almost everybody who talks to me and doesn’t bring up wedgies. I feel genuine hate for them because they don’t share my likes. The other day after selling my PlayStation and Nintendo switch for wedgies my friend called me out and said I’m showing signs of addiction. That hurt but I think she’s right. I’ve tried so hard over the years to stop liking them but I’m actually obsessed. I can’t go 5 minutes without bringing it up and it scares friends away and makes it hard to find a girlfriend.

477,"I had no idea what I wanted to do with myself in high school. So little, in fact, that it was never a question made. My sole interest in life at the time was video games. So, wanting the best for me, my parents signed me up for marching band, and I would play in that band for the next nine semesters, right until my first semester of college, where I would drop it and not pick it back up since.

The words “Marching” and “Band” put together bring up such horrendous memories of frustration, anxiety and loathing that the very instrument I used to participate in it with reminds me of that gargantuan waste of time, money and energy that I was repeatedly gaslit into continuing with all the way to the end. It was not until I dropped the class manually and in secret, registered for a private boxing club, lost 40 pounds and dumped all my lame aimless band friends that I truly began to change and grow as a human being, thus making me hate it more.

However, I come here for advice because people sometimes tell me it is a shame I dropped the saxophone. Not everybody owns such a beautiful instrument, which is true, but I couldn’t read sheet music to save my life. I spent 4.5 years reading as much as I needed to to get by, and no more. When somebody asked me to play a saxophone song, I would scoff at them: I wasn’t a one-trick pony, so I would never learn the song. Carrying that tenor sax through the practice fields and football stadium felt like the One Ring of Sauron was chained to my neck, and the few times I tried to pick up the instrument again after all of that, I’m reminded of the shouting and teasing; the band director scorning me for something I didn’t do, or overhearing curse words made from intense anxiety because I’ve lost my hat and nobody is helping me.

This is turning into a rant, but I do feel as though the saxophone had nothing to do with any of that, and I doesn’t deserve the association, but I don’t think I can ever use that piece of brass ever again, which is saddening. Frankly, I don’t believe I was ever meant to play music at all. What do you guys think about this?",18Dec2020,3

This move has been very very hard on me, and I’ve done my best to cope. I have a long past of being severely abused throughout my life ever since young childhood, and he is aware of this. First off I wanna say, he’s been acting very strange lately... a lot more easily agitated and distant. For example, he got mad at my dog a few days ago and he picked him up by his neck and slammed him on the ground and continued to bang his head on the ground. I smacked him and yelled at him to stop. I was in hysterical tears bc my dog is literally my baby and the only thing keeping me sane. So, we currently only have 1 car and that’s my car, we have been struggling financially for some time now. When we got married, he insisted we keep our finances separate so I can’t even see what he spends his money on. He has a SEVERE video game addiction so I just figured he spent it on that. Anyways, I dropped him off at work this morning, and on my way back to the house he called me from a co workers phone to tell me he had left his phone on the counter and asked me to bring it. Of course, I did. So, he goes through my phone FREQUENTLY. He’s never found anything of course bc I am 100% devoted to this man, but I’ve never looked through his, and something just told me I should. So, as soon as I opened it up only fans pops up first thing. I look and he has close to $200 in only fans subscriptions, one of them being MY COUSIN, and one of them being my ex best friend. (We stopped being friends because she screwed the guy that molested me, stole hundreds of dollars from me, and stole literally almost everything I owned) and he knows all of this. I know some may not consider this cheating, but sometimes we haven’t even been able to afford food bc of these subscriptions... hes claimed it’s because of “overdraft fees” ??? Anyways, I feel completely betrayed. I am absolutely repulsed that he subscribed to my ex best friend, and my COUSIN🤢🤢🤢 i love him so so very much, but how the hell can I get past this?

489,"I live near by a dude in my age range (early-mid 20s) who is (electric) wheelchair bound and severely speech impaired; he has a care taker and I have never once seen him with a friend or family member in 5 years time. I see him anywhere from once or twice per week to once or twice every few months. It varies, and I always try to interact with him like any other guy, but as you can imagine it is difficult and I want to improve our communication and show him a genuine friend with some compassion that I know he isn't getting in his daily life. He has similar interests to those of myself (his clothing/accessories and such - sports/athletics) and I can just fucking tell the guy was a normal bro before this shit onset. He's gone through a handful of care takers in a handful of years, and I've interacted with a few of them who *really* rubbed me the wrong way as POS human beings (this is coming from an asshole himself - he's definitely not getting a cream of the crop selection, and that is putting it nicely).

&amp;nbsp;

 I am also unsure of whether he has MS or ALS, but here are some things to note:

-He appears completely immobilized, however, manages to function his echair despite the fact that his neck is typically sideways and his body very atrophied.

-His speech is both delayed and near impossible to comprehend. Like, if I were to say hey man he would just blurt out a ""hurr"" kind of sound 5 seconds later. I have noticed that this may be getting worse, and some days strangely appear to be worse than others but that could just be my perception due to limited interaction. 

-He appears to be ""all there"" cognitively. Seems to understand every single thing that I say and has no (apparent) problem visually either. He goes out by himself and can even ride on the streets and sidewalks alongside cars or people without a visible difficulty. This leads me to believe that he's basically just paralyzed and mute (in simple terms, I realize that's not actually what he is). 

-He has not been visibly declining in condition/health

&amp;nbsp;

My questions for y'all are:

1. Is there any better way for me to communicate with him? Since he can function an echair is he likely capable of using any other sort of communication device - that he may use at home even? I want to hear his story and talk like normal fucking guys, but we can't get past basically a hey what's up, how are you, need any help (he's approached me asking for help before, and he's had me call his care taker too) followed by me kind of being the sole one talking (to him) about something related to one of the sports teams he's into for a minute or two before parting ways. I want him to have a voice when we engage too, but truthfully I can't understand him beyond one or two word replies with the most basic of words like yes/no and even those can be difficult.

2. Are there any changes that I should be making to how I go about interacting with him? (this is for anybody with a similar disease or a family member with it) or am I doing anything wrong in how I handle my interactions with him?  like, I just don't know if there is a right or wrong way to talk to somebody with his conditions, what his capabilities are, etc.. I try to avoid like, pity talk/behavior and I try to treat him like a normal dude who just can't speak or move. Obviously it is somewhat difficult due to it just being so foreign for me. 

3. Would it be weird if I got him a gift? I always see him wearing things like hats, jackets, pins, lanyards, etc. of certain sports teams or his interests. I want to get him something cool on that spectrum and I feel confident that he'd like it, but I just don't know if that's appropriate or seen as a pity gift considering I wouldn't just get some random dude I see out n about those things. I would (and do) get them for my friends though, and I do want a friendship with this dude (I just don't know...how lol).

4. Any random advice/input overall? This is so foreign to me and I've always wanted to ask for help but never actually reached out and did it; now is the time and my ears are open.

She did it for other people but the fact is with this person bothers me. I don't feel secure enough in our relationship and I am trying to find a healthy coping mechanism or even a way to reignite the spark, to make us grow closer.

Now I’m working part time at a super laid back mom and pop place and I love the environment and the owners but one girl (whom I have no person problems with) kind of took charge of our position at this place and does scheduling and bosses people around, but lately when I work with her she’s minimum 20 minutes late, and she keeps disappearing or doing duty’s that are other people’s responsibilities leaving the other people to do her job, and then when she does the scheduling she refuses to work on Saturday so she’ll either manipulate someone into working a shift they don’t usually work or leave us short staffed. 

I know for a fact the owner is unaware this is happening because no one is speaking up about it and I know I’m not the only one that is fed up, like last night she literally left the building/ premise twice for 30 minutes each and didn’t clock out. 

She’s a massive kiss ass so I don’t want to tattle and then have her come after me or cause workplace tension because I don’t think she’ll get fired, especially since it’s the holidays and we’re busy and already short staffed.

502,"Okay this sounds weird but this has been happening once every so often. And it comes with some strange dreams too. This morning for example, I dreamed that I coughed up something that looked like a tumour. Still in the dream, I was very confused and started walking towards a bathroom. I then started feeling this tension in my throat, both in real life and in my dream. I was in that weird purgatory area between unconsciousness and consciousness. So as I’m still asleep yet abit awake, I had this reflex to massage my throat to get whatever muscle or what I think is my tongue, back to where it should be. 

When my throat is tense like that, I can’t breathe, and it feels almost like something is dislocated. It’s becoming more frequent, and I’m scared that one day I’m just not going to be awoken by the discomfort, and I’m just going to die in my sleep. If I go to the doctor, I’m scared that I’ll sound stupid, and they probably won’t know what to do anyway without being able to see it happen, so now I’m not really sure what to do except tell reddit.",18Dec2020,2

522,"(Its currently 6:20 am , writing this in a pitch black kitchen with my laptop light)

Yes, the title is confusing as it is. Let me break it down. I live in a somewhat of a traditional mexican household which heavily pushes my brother and I to do THE BEST for our future in school ,work and just in general. Almost too much in most cases and unaware of boundaries to be set for ourselves. It's my dad saying , ""Nothing is impossible!"" or ""Ponte las pilas"" ( Get Ourselves together or use our head) to keep pushing.

I barely was taught the idea of boundaries last year through a rough dating experience. I am sidetracking here but this leads into this question. This year was a rough hit on my family as well as other ppl in the world. My mother tragically passed away 2 months after I graduated a 4 yr college, and my brother graduated highschool. I lost my job earlier to the pandemic and still no job after graduating in June.

My brother just dropped the bomb so subtly he is dropping out after his 1st semester of college and taking a break to focus on getting a job, strengthen his poor mental health , and get back to a better place with himself. He plans to do community college in the future  ,then transfer back to finish his bachelors. My dad knows nothing of this because he barely understands english so it was easy to hide it. I was shocked at the news so I was becoming my mom in worrying what would happen to him. I then collected myself and know he needs this. 

We are living in a pandemic where no matter if  a prestige ivy league is being taught through a screen just like every other school in the country.  So it be a wise financial decision, but my dad who constantly repeats the same anecdote of how he worked so hard in this country to get where he is to give us everything , etc . Would see community college as NOT A REAL UNIVERSITY , a slacker's option , or  the last option because one didn't apply to enough scholarships to afford school. My brother is so burnt out but my dad just sees him playing some video games, to discredit any work he did pulling an all nighter to study or finish his essays.  

I cant fend for my brother because he is old enough to do so. I just always defended him because we only had each other to protect ourselves from any harm or punishment from our parents... Idk what to do ..

I’m 18, my life is a bit tumultuous right now, I just quit college for mental health reasons.

530,"Having some issues with family and looking for advice. I’m currently not on speaking terms with my two brothers, and I cannot get them to talk to me.

Some background-I was living with my roommate and two brothers. (An arrangement I wasn’t insanely fond of but my middle brother has a lot of money problems and addiction issues so it was easy for him to live with me) when Covid started, I asked everyone if it was okay for my partner to crash at our house indefinitely and he ended up moving in eventually. Everyone said they were ok with it and my partner contributed financially from the beginning with rent, bills etc. our house was also fairly large and we had a lot of extra space, so it seemed to work out ok (plus cheaper rent for everyone else). We have now moved out into our own place. 

The issues began when our roommate voiced she didn’t believe in Covid and was traveling back and forth from NYC to chill with her friends. Me, my youngest brother and my partner expressed our desire for a stricter quarantine and to try to work together on getting group grocery orders, etc. She had major issues with that and kept threatening to drink if we didn’t let her do what she wanted (she is an alcoholic and sober for 1 year) she also kept threatening to move out so eventually I suggested that she do that if she really wanted to. After that happened, I ended up getting blamed for “kicking her out” and my brothers started acting super weird around me. 

For months they stopped talking to me and my partner. Literally, I would give my youngest brother rides to work every day because he doesn’t drive and id try to say stuff to him and he wouldn’t even respond to me. He had initially been very anxious about Covid but I suspect he changed his viewpoints. My other brother (the one with addiction struggles) said that he didn’t believe in Covid either and suggested I was crazy for being anxious about it. 

My parents literally got Covid and my dad was in poor condition for a month and they both laughed at me when I asked them if they had any contact with them. 
I’ve reached out to them and expressed how much I value our relationship and asked if we could talk and they refuse. I don’t know what to do. My family is getting together in person for Xmas and I’m the only one who isn’t (my choice bc of Covid) and I had to ask my mom if it was even ok for me to FaceTime because idk if my brothers want to see me.

534,"Hello I'm Willow and I'm 24 years old. I've been a heavy cannabis user for a little over a year, and I've used heavily for about 3 years before that, the reason for the break was probation. That probation was from a marijauna DUI. I started using it for chronic pain and insomnia but eventually it became purely recreational. I also believe living in a weed legal state enabled my behavior. I'm in a bad financial situation and my usage is a part of it. I prioritize buying pot over everything else. When I was in college I skipped class to get high with friends. I can't say no to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the first time I realized pot is very bad for me since I can't control myself or moderate myself at a reasonable level.  I just never succeed in quitting. The only time I successfully quit was for probation like I mentioned I ended up picking up some other habits with it. I stopped weed but I started smoking cigarettes, started using illegal drugs that wouldn't show up on my UA's, drank when I knew I didn't have a test coming up. When I got off probation I immediately started smoking weed again but quit the other habits I made. I'm really concerned based on my past if I quit weed I'll replace it with an equally bad or worse vice.

Recently I was over at her house and I don’t know how it started but the topic of autism came up. I’ve always known that she has a prejudice against autistic people. She claims she can sense them and that she would never be friends with them and brags about how she has gone out of her way to talk to undiagnosed autistic people about why she thinks they have autism. I think this is terrible and I do not support her in these actions but she typically doesn’t do it around me. For once I decided to bite and asked why she didn’t like autistic people, just out of curiosity. A lot of symptoms she described were things I also did because of my adhd that I just managed to mask around her. For example she spoke about how annoying people her hyper fixations were which was hard to hear considering I also have hyperfixations, I’m just careful to mask them around her. There were other behaviors to that I regularly did, but I know I can’t do around her like stimming. I also have a tendency to stutter in high stress social situations which I previously knew upset her but it’s hard not to. 

In all honesty she’s my closest friend and I like having her in my life. I just can’t help but feel hurt by her words. This happened several days ago so I feel like it’s too late to bring it up, and I really don’t want to argue with her. These things happen quite a bit though.

One week ago, he broke up with me he said either you convert to Islam or we can't be together. He said he wants to live in a religious way now, wants to pray, he said from that day he will quit alcohol, he will not meet any girls anymore, because he will always love me and stuff, I mean hooking up with girls is not something that is accepted in his religion. He even involved his mom in it, called her in front of me, she wanted to talk to me, she says maybe I should try blah, blah, so she knows and she probably thinks that her son is perfect and so religious that's why he's breaking up with me. Well...

He said to me that I'm perfect, but it's just Islam that bothers him. Yesterday I couldn't hold it, with my friend's help I created a fake account on one site and started messaging him, asked if he wants to drink etc, he said sure, but he doesn't want any relationships, just someone to fuck and that's it. He said he broke up with me, because we didn't have any similar interests, even the music we liked was different... He wants to meet her on new year to basically drink and have sex, even though to me he said he will never drink any alcohol again. We just broke up and he wants to hook up with other girls straight away...

547,"Hi.  

So for obvious reasons this is my throwaway account. Never thought I would use it for this but here we go...

My wife and me have been married for 8 years but together for 9. We have 2 kids and have been through a lot together. Lows and highs. 

I have family history of depression and my wife knows about it. 


We have had our fair amount of arguments over the years due to her always being untrusting of me with other women and hating the fact that I speak to my parents. This comes from my parents not always being the nicest to her or us when we started. 

We got married at 18 when she got pregnant and decided to move to the US for a better opportunity ( all legally, but still scary and stressful ). I’ve been the one always in charge of working and providing for the family and we have had fights for that reason and she has always felt trapped of being a stay at home mom. 

During the years when we have arguments some are to my eyes blatant lies of me saying I’ve cheated and such that angers me so much that I feel I should just off myself and let things be as there is no way for me to even defend as she never believes me even though she says she does. 

We have gone to therapy as a couple with several churches to help us understand and talk which it helped a lot 4 years ago and we decided to move on from our doubts we had on each other and bad feelings we had as we had lived on our roughest time at that point. 

From there we started to get better as a family. We had our daughter and financially I was doing better. I still talk with my parents but my wife hates it. 

Last night I told my wife about a conversation with my mom ( we always tell each other everything since therapy ). And how my mom asked if she could give my phone to a friend’s son that was potentially moving to the US just in case he needed help or advice as we’ve been living here for 8 years. ( we also finally got our green card ). 

My wife got super mad about if because she says my mom uses me as a tour guide for people ( even though there is only been one other time this happened on the past with a girl I help that my mom asked me to, but we had issues because this girl started talking shit about me kissing her and bs which was not true and I never spoke to her again ). And this time is a guy who I know ( not too much but we are acquaintances). 

She started bring up our past and shit about me cheating ( completely unrelated to this conversation ) and this morning it continued as she pushed me more as I try to work ( I work from home ) and it just angered me so much I want to just die. I hate when people lie or say lies about me. She just basically proved she has never trusted me or believed me after so many years this happened and we had agreed to not mention it again ( she had done some dumb shit also I had to forgive her. ). 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to divorce I love her and the kids and I know if we divorce she will do anything to stop me from seeing my kids ( she has even threatened to do that multiple times ). 

Sorry for the long post. I skipped some stuff as I don’t want to make it longer. I guess I just needed to take some of it out of my chest as it frustrates me she knows I have suicidal thoughts she has even asked me to get life insurance for that reason ( even though she says is because she doesn’t work and if I die for an accident she would be hopeless ). 

It is really demotivating as everytime I tell her anything she spins it around and instead of listening she just then says she is the bad one and makes me feel even worse.",18Dec2020,2
548,"For a couple of years now I've had the feeling of trying to put al of my focus on one thing only to try and achieve the best I can within that subject. Now the thing is that I enjoy a lot that we are able to do in life and with that, I keep switching things I like to do. On the short-term, I do enjoy this since it gives me a nice look at everything that I like to do. But on the long-term, this reminds me of never achieving something big or something great within one subject. I will always be average at best if I don't put the focus onto one thing at the time.

Now I can see that this doesn't seem to be a big issue, but this always keeps going on inside my brain. This is also the reason why I am not happy with what I am doing, even though I might enjoy it for the period it lasts in. I always have the feeling of achieving something big/noticeable yet I can't figure out on what to do that as well as how to even neglect all the other things I might enjoy too.

I'm not sure whether this is an issue other people are facing, but I really hope someone can let me know if this is normal or not, how to cope with it, and how to effectively make a decision.

I didnt see if she looked my way or the opposite but im kinda mad at her for barging in now and she definitely knows and im embarassed asf now.

On mobile. 
One year ago I broke up with my boyfriend, i feel like he was manipulative, played the victim, and didn’t care about my feelings at all. 
So, on Easter he called my parents to wish a happy Easter or whatever. No one does that, and it was the first time he called for something related to that. 


On my dads birthday he called him again. 
He wished my friends happy birthday, including one that HE HATED and was the first time he actually wish him a happy birthday. 


Started following a girl on Instagram  I introduced him to once. 


And I’m pretty sure he’ll call my parents on Christmas. (He never called them before) 
I don’t know how to deal with it. 


My parents don’t know the real reason we broke up so they kinda feel sorry for him I think. 
I want him to stop, because is making me feel super uncomfortable. But I don’t want to reach to him and tell him to stop. Plus, I feel it’s unfair to tell my parents to just don’t pick up the phone.

I have no clue what I want to do in life, but I’m certain I want to drop out because I hate my degree. I don’t find any other degree interesting either.

Hoever, when i'm wrote my first dialogue, i became tired when writing it, and continued, the result was  so uninteresting, so bland (despite the character having very remarcable characteristics) and so stupidly basic to me to the point it shocked me, it left me thinking to myself ""the plans were so great and they were inspired, and i am 18 years old, an inspired young adult, yet this result was one of the worse it could've been, kitsch, fake art"".

At least I think he has, because I think that’s one of the reasons he has started to do this, because he definitely didn’t used to . I don’t see him very often but when I do I try very hard to engage with him because I want to be in my niblings’ lives. And that used to be fine. I’m pretty sure I’m his favorite aunt so he loves talking to me. 

But he’s started, very visibly and very noticeably, stealing glances down at my chest while we talk. I doubt he realizes how obvious he’s being, because he’d probably be mortified if he knew I knew that was what he was doing, since I’m, you know, *his aunt*.

I don’t really know what to do about this? I feel like trying to talk to my sister would get him in trouble because she is....very religious. I haven’t worked up the wherewithal to talk to him myself, because honestly the thought of having that conversation makes me want to sink into the floor. 

But it worries me. Is he doing this to other women? Other girls? I know how I would feel if I was a girl that age and a boy starting just staring at my chest all the time, and I shudder to think he’s making girls feel like that.

562,"I (23F) have a tendency to lead guys on when I know that I am not interested in them - I first noticed this when I was in uni but looking back, this trend has certainly been present from a young age. Over the past two years, I have made a conscious effort not to lead guys on or even briefly entertain a guy that I’m not interested in. However, this year I slipped back into old ways, perhaps partly due to boredom as a result of being stuck inside for the majority of the year.

The current predicament I’m in is that a guy (22M) asked a mutual friend for my number after we all spent time together. I hesitated at first because, despite only meeting him once, I knew that I was not interested in him in any way but said that my friend could give him my number anyway. Fast forward a month and we’ve had a few late night FaceTime sessions. The second FaceTime session I basically asked him what his intentions were and he said that he would like a serious relationship but he’s also aware that this can go anywhere and that there are no guarantees which put me at ease. Perhaps too much ease because our last FaceTime session ended in what I’ll call ‘FaceTime sex’. I just saw it as a bit of fun but now I’m worried that he might take this to mean that I really like him, especially because he said that it’s the first time that he’s ever done something like this.

I know the right thing to do is to tell him that I’m not interested in him in that way, well that probably would have been the right thing to do a few weeks ago. So how do I fix this? Do I just tell him that it was only a bit of fun for me or do I need to be a bit more subtle? He is a genuinely nice guy and I don’t want to hurt him unnecessarily but I do know that a relationship between us wouldn’t work.

TL;DR I had ‘FaceTime sex’ with a guy that I am not remotely interested in, despite knowing that he has serious intentions, and need help letting him down gently.",18Dec2020,2

So basically, I've been and am very unmotivated about planning stuff for my future and studying and I don't know how to get out of this ''I don't want to do anything and everything looks too complicated and tiring'' thing.

I have had to do stuff for my future for YEARS now. I won't talk about it in more details but it's very important stuff and if I don't do it, I know my future will be most likely ruined. I know that if I do it, then I would make my future life much better and all, and that if I don't do it, future me will probably regret and hate myself for it and it will make some things hard for me, but even with this in mind I can't find the motivation at all.

This sounds overwhelming to me (esp. because this is something I've been avoiding to do for a few years), even little steps. I'm confident I will be forever unsuccessful and will end up homeless or dead or whatever.

She would do this constantly and I didn’t notice. She would say she cared of me but pushed me off so badly and got closer to everyone else. She said she tried but in reality she just would avoid me. Each time I asked why she would avoid to see me she would change her excuses. She said she wasn’t going to get in a relationship because of covid and because she was depressed yet she got with someone 4 months after. I would even call her when I found out she had tinder and ask like what happened to not wanting a relationship. And she would say it was just to make friends. 

She also even made a secret twitter account subtweeting her ex constantly and one time me when we were together. So many red flags and yet she would play it off as of nothing or if I was making things up in my head. She made me feel like I was going crazy because I was making stuff up but in reality I wasn’t. The last straw was her getting with someone 5 months after we broke up which apparently she said she talked to 3 months after we did break up.

 The issue is that I'm currently kinda mad at two of the friends in that town right now. Should I tell them? Should I only tell one of them? Should I not tell either of them?

Friend 1 (known since 2016) 

* This friend tells me every detail of her life but gets disinterested when I talk about myself. An example of this was where we went on a Zoom call and I let them rant about something for two hours. When I wanted to talk about myself, this friend got tired and said they'd rather zoom another day
* Recently, I got a Snapchat memory showing the four year anniversary of me and this friend meeting. I sent the video and all they replied was ""I-""
* Friend 1 did not know about the possibility of this job offer but also has never asked me how my job search is going
* Friend 1 does not seem aware of their behaviors, but these behaviors have really annoyed me lately. They've also always been like this and I've never called them out on it. Mutual friends have told me friend 1 acts this way towards them too.

Friend 2 (known since 2019) 

* I used to be really close with this friend, we would talk every day almost all day, and hang out all the time. Lately, our conversations are one-sided. Them and I will exchange messages a few times, then friend 2 will open my message and not respond. They'll reply a few days later being like ""sorry I forgot to reply :("" They do this all the time now. One time, they did this when I was telling them about personal stuff. At what point are you actually forgetting or do you just not want to talk? Our conversations never last longer than 5-15 messages until they ""forget to reply"" again
* Friend 2 knew about the possibility of this job offer about a month ago and seemed excited about it. I wanted to tell them the night I found out, but they left an unrelated message of mine open.
* Friend 2 is going back to their parents' house next week, their parents live close to me, and they wanted to try and hang out with me while they're in the area
* Friend 2 at least seems self-aware that they're being flakey, and they're a much better listener than friend 1

576,"This is my first post, so sorry if I format it weird or write it out odd. I just don't know where else to go with this.

I'm (23F) living with my dad and his wife (40) keeps invading my privacy by going into my room and taking pictures. She came into my life around when I was about 17 and so she has never been an authority figure to me as much as she'd like to be. She has major control issues and my dad believes she's legitimately bipolar but she refused to get diagnosed. She has a 16 year old son that smokes weed, doesn't attend his online classes, and constantly sneaks out and gets caught. Because of this though if my dad ever even brings up her son's misbehavior she'll get upset and try to pick his children (I have two siblings) apart. My situation is I often don't have time to clean my room as I'm doing nursing program classes and studying on top of it 40+ hours a week (mon-fri) and I work doubles on the weekends to compensate for my lack of schedule during the week. My job is also pretty grueling (CNA) so I'm extra exhausted after 16 hour shifts.

And here's where my problem begins she'll go into my room when I'm out and take pictures even when it's not that bad and show her friends saying how lazy I am and how her son is somehow better despite everything he does. By the way he's an alright kid just going through some stuff and I don't blame him after seeing his mom. 

To help prevent her from invading my privacy my dad got me a coded door lock that only he and I know the code to and hid the key away so she couldn't come in; however, the door has a little lock that if turned will allow the door to be opened at any time. I always make sure that my door is locked with that switched especially before I leave the house to make sure I don't have that invasion of privacy. Yesterday night I got home and found that the door was unlocked. Both my dad and stepmom are here still as I saw both of their cars in the driveway when I'd gone out of my room and I've sent my dad several texts about it but gotten no responses yet (he may still be sleeping).

The only possible reason it could be like that would be if she found the key as if my dad came in he could just use the code. I'm at my wits end with this and I really need advice on where to go with this next.",18Dec2020,1

I was very flattered and I accepted. I told them free of charge because I know the family, but i'm starting to regret that and wonder if she asked hoping it would be free. Now I don't want to fuck around with a kit rn. I'm already looking for the proper sanitizing tools and all that. This is a semi actual gig as well as being in the middle of a pandemic. I'm being careful. The thing is, I gave her my number to talk details, looks, skin type, dates. And i've heard nothing. Her mom wants to do a ""test run"" but has given me no hints as to when. Like I said, I don't have a kit and I don't have the money to drop on a full kit just in case this woman wants something different. I feel like that sounds bitchy. I'm very stressed about this. I asked her daughter if she had a prefered foundation and she said yes but she wants to know if I have a better one for her. I DONT HAVE A FULL KIT! I just want you to fucking text me so we can plan a look. Also, I feel like this is VERY short notice. I was told on the 17th and it's happening on Jan 9th. And she wants a test run somewhere in there. Basically I need advice. Am i being a bitch and overreacting? Is she using me for a free look?  What should I do? please help! Thank You!

583,"Yeah that happened. Today for the first time I had my phone in vertical view as I was jacking, and I didn't even think about the charger port smh. I immediately realized some of it went on my screen so I wiped it off with wet wipes, but then I realized there was some in my charging port. My phone has an USB-C charger if that would help. I cleaned the outside with towels and got the most out of inside with the tootpick+paper towel combo. There is still some left in that is just too deep, any way that I can get it off? I am just very, very desperate. I still have warranty on it but boy it would be really bad to send it away because I literally came inside of it. It's leaning on my table right now with the port at the bottom, no luck so far. How can I get it out? I have around %80 battery and I can last 2 days with it. Should I just let it dry and try my luck with charging it?

Update: Can't even see it anymore, probably dried out and blended with the color of the port, or worse got more in. I have no idea how phones are built so I don't know the amount of damage this can do. If you have any idea how I can clean this or how much damage this can do please do let me know. I need to know.  


Update2: Just had the balls to plug it in and try, its charging without anything weird but I'm not going to plug it in overnight like I used to unless I clean it or have it cleaned. So still looking for advice on how to clean it up or what to do.",18Dec2020,1
584,"Long story short, I'm on an antidepressant and I am going to run out about 10 days before my next paycheck. I can't afford the rather expensive refill (my insurance is trash) until then due to other costs that have popped up. The problem is that I can't just stop taking this medication because not only would my depression get much worse, but I would also get severe withdrawal symptoms. According to my doc I actually have it a bit worse than most because I have much more severe negative reactions than most do to dosage changes. Going cold turkey for a week would cripple me. I've even considered selling stuff off to be able to afford it but I don't have anything worth enough that I could sell off quickly enough. I know my finances will be back in some sort of shape next month so it wouldn't be an issue to get it refilled then but I don't know what to do until then.

587,"Hi, first of I just want to say that I'm dyslexic so I'm sorry for any mistakes I make. (I am F23)

My mother (F51) has for the last.. I think year, has been complaining about severe pain. It started when she went to lie down and awoke in screams of agony. She would pass out from the pain every 5 seconds then awake again. Then it would repeat for about an hour till an ambulance arived. I remember crying over her while trying to gently ease her pain with ice. This event happened I think 2 times. Each time being taken to the hospital. They said something along the lines of her nerves at the top of her neck were pinched and that was causing the pain and all she can do is rest. 
She never had any surgery or anything, they gave her pain beds and for months she would cry out in pain every couple of days.

They put her on pain meds I dont know what ones but they wernt strong enough so they put her on something even stronger. Still painkillers. She now walks around with a cane and has those pills every day, some days she seems fine and others she is always moaning. My father doesn't belive her and honestly I kind of agree. 

They took her off the pills once and I got two diffrent sides from them. My mum said that she hadn't heard anything back from an xray they took (to find out why there is still pain) so she phoned to make an appointment. She claims the nurse that decided to take her off the pills doesn't know what she's talking about and that week she didn't stop crying in pain till they got painkillers from my grandmother. (My granny has a prescription and she had extra or something idk.)
My dad however said to me the reason she was taken off was because they found nothing wrong with her. 
She's back on the prescription now and can't walk for very long without hyperventilating and moaning in pain. She complains to me that my dad doesn't believe her while thinking I do..


The problem is I cant tell the truth to my mum. She is a pathological liar. I have known this since childhood. If she would lie and I called her out on it she woudl make me cry. Sometimes I would think it was a game. One time we went to a store to look at the prices of the TVs just to look not to buy. (We are not rich. Anything nice we have is saved up for or we buy broken and fix it. We walked uo to the TV and a worker came over. She started spouting nonsense about how we had the full gaming set up, every console, High spec gaming chairs, and maybe we should get a TV for each room. This is all a lie. At the time we had an xbox 360 and a spinny office chair we got out of a skip and put ducktape on. I thought this was a game  I didnt realise what it was till it started effecting me. She would tell someone a lie about me and I would be the one that gets shit for it. At a family Christmas dinner she told someone I was studying something I wasn't. I said ""mum im not learning that I'm learning this"" she looked at me and said ""shut up"" and the table went silent. I excused myself and left to the bathroom and cried. I was wiping my face to go back and she came in telling me to stop being such a little bitch and to go wait by the car and have my tantrum there. I didnt finish the food that night. I cried in the car. I was 10

If I said any of these things now she would claim im lieing. 

Another reason I cant tell my mother the truth is because she is very difficult when hearing other opinions. When I was 13 or 14 I think I had an attitude with her. I dont remember even being mad but apparently I said something with a mean tone. I didnt find out about this until an hour later when my dad told me to go appolagise. She was drunk (she doesn't drink often so not an alcoholic) I went to the kitchen to see where she was and saw her holding a bottle and behind her was a pile of pills. She tried to close the door on me fast and I kicked it down. She lay on the floor crying abut how she's a horrible mother and I would be happy with her gone. I poured all the bottles down the drain and threw the pills away. She passed out and when she woke up she didn't know who I was saying that I'm not her daughter. 
The next day we carried on like nothing happened. Thats the rule for out family. If something bad happens just pretend it didn't. 

Since then I have tried very hard to not have an attitude or complain, pretty much I never got to be a teenager from fear 

Shes currently in the process of geting her bluebadge because of this. We are uk baised and I would love some advice




Morral of the story is I dont want to tell her I think she's addicted because of sertain reactions. 

1. She could try to commit suicide again

2. She could try to run away and I won't see her again because she geting into an accident or something

3. Her thinking we hate her

4. Her stopping the painkillers all together and only maling our lives hell until she gets them back.(like screaming in pain claiming we don't belive her)",18Dec2020,1

A few months ago (about 3 months), I passed my drivers liscence. While I was driving with my instructor,  I was pretty calm, sometimes I messed up, but for the most part, I was relaxed.

When I got my liscence, I started driving right away. For the most part I just drive my mom to store.

When I drive with my dad, I am very anxious, because he  constantly points out, how I drive. But still at the same time, I feel the most relaxed, becuse he taught me how to drive and he has years of experience.

The trouble comes when I drive alone or with my younger sister. I don't know why, but my heart starts beating like crazy and I am more in ""a rush"" to get things  done. I start to panic if I mess things up (car stall) or if I don't take off very fast. And that then causes even more sloopines and fear. With my sister I just fear that my ""bad driving"" will cause an accident and something will happen to her.

Also the car I drive, was my grandad's who passed a few years ago. When I was about 10 years old, we got in a small car crash in the same car that I drive now. Nobody died, it was just a little bump.

I grew up in Alberta for my whole life, the place I was at last I was there for 9 years, longest I'd ever stayed at one place in my whole life, that's half my total age for fucks sake. Anyway I took it very personal upon myself to build a reputation there, I was bullied at my previous school. Long story short I succeeded and am one of few people lucky enough to say they had a great highschool experience (Obviously had my bumps in the road). I was well known, and was a force to be reckoned with, all is well in my life. I recently landed a job working in a warehouse which was so far the only job I actively enjoyed. 2 months into work, im working out my plan to get my drivers and move out with my friend (Yes ik, 19 with no license is shitty) so I'm vibing doing my thing and my mom says to me after work that she has big news, normally I'd be like hell ya, but my gut dropped for some reason, everything was going *too* well for me recently. Well low and behold we're moving to BC (the province [state] beside Alberta) because of certain family issues happening. Now this effectively trashed my work, more of recycled cuz I know Ill see them this summer. But what the fuck do I do now, I've been here for 2 weeks. Im a naturally social person but I have no clue what to do. Having to start over is really killing the energy I can normally carry and to top it right on off, Im at a hotel now, this was so last minute we didn't even have a place found, so Im pretty lost here which is a new experience for me

Hello everyone. So to make a long story short I have been working at my full time job for around 9 months now and I was not making enough money so I decided to get a part time job at a grocery store about 1 month ago; however, I recently bid for a better paying position at my full time job and I got it.
 
Currently, in total I am working 66 hours a week between both jobs and I get one day off every other week.

Now my issue is that in my part time job 2 people have quit and now they are shorthanded and if I left it would put a lot more burden on my coworkers. Overall my coworkers are very hardworking and I don't want to leave them with one less person but my priority is my full time job because with my new position I will be required to put more hours in and I won't be able to work both jobs moving ahead.

My dad was the first to talk to me and I talked to him about how I am utterly sick of having to guess my moms mood and change how I act depending on it, of how every time i try to argue against them they refuse to back down or attempt to listen to me and their own inability to cope with their emotions, only to be laughed at and told to get used to it because that is life. My mother arrived and also started to argue about why I was crying and elaborating on her forbidding me from working by stating I needed to study. A little bit of context, my parents have not helped me study, organize myself to revise or even shown any interest in my studies beyond their expectations to be the highest and their guilt trips. I try to work as hard as I can with school and everything I do by myself ever since I was 12 because I knew I could never rely on my parents on anything. Honestly I rarely every speak to my dad (he lives in another country) because he is normally preoccupied with work or my sister(shes not doing so well in school so they are trying to help her) and I don't even know if you could say we have a relationship besides a few short conversations we have. My mother is emotionally stunt and refuses to acknowledge the effect her childhood had on her as a person/parent, I never have looked at her for emotional comfort or advice and only ever inform her of what happened after it has passed or I have made a decision.

Typical retail environment, you are basically just a number and they wouldn't really care if I stayed or left, and mandatory weekends and holidays.

I’m currently on a teaching track and like I don’t know if this is what I want for the rest of my life... so I vented to him about how it’s a hard job I feel like he automatically assumes that I will be bad at it and tells me that I “threw myself into it” instead of offering me encouragement.

615,"I tried to include all the relevant details as briefly as I could, sorry if it comes off as too much!

So I'm 23 years old and Covid forced me to come home to live with my parents. Throughout the time I was growing up, I was really used to things turning bad and all the endless drama that comes with family feuds to the point that it affected me less and less the more it happened. 

I thought I'd seen it all, the lowest of lows people can stoop to over some petty fights which don't even make sense to begin with..but some recent happenings have really got to me and I can't imagine what I can do or what to make of this circus I'm living in.

Some background first - I have a narcissistic father who has serious anger issues, most of which have to do with his failure to be financially viable for the larger part of his 30s and 40s. He thinks of himself as an idealist and will profess all the great things in life but is a real fucking hypocrite when it comes down to how he has chosen to act in certain situations.

He has often projected his insecurities and frustrations towards me, my brother and mom in the form of verbal abuse and rampant violence. My relationship with him has always been rocky since I made sure I always stood up to his whims and his narcissistic self couldn't quite accept that.

 He has been extremely hostile and uncooperative with anything I have thought of doing for myself in life, being the control freak that he is and has even invaded my privacy on multiple occassions and tried to hold private aspects of my life against me in order to stop me from doing the things I wanted to do.  It kind of reached breaking point last year and there's scope for any reconciliation left with him. 

My mother on the other hand, is a giver through and through, the purest soul I know but she's too pure for her own good. This is her second marriage (her first husband died in a car accident) and my father claims he was doing her some kind of favour by marrying her because widows in India were looked down upon and with her having a newborn son (my brother, technically stepbrother) with no 'man' to raise him he was doing something exceptional.

All in all, their marriage was an arrangement like most marriages in middle class India at the time (even still) since was unfathomable for a woman like my mom to support her son by her self. Patriarchy 101. 

She's had a well paying government job since before I was born and has been the sole breadwinner of the house after my dad quit his job when I'd started middle school. She had a lot of assets to her name after the death of her first husband and that put together with her savings was a lot of money which my dad lost in the stock market right after quitting his job, setting us up for a huge lifestyle shift.

We were coping but my father didn't stop with his unsuccessful forages in the stock market, going to the extent of taking huge loans from my mother's family members only to lose it all. He started another venture at the time that he couldn't sustain because of his stock market gambling addiction which took most of his attention and of course, the money. 

All through this time, he would often get pretty agitated over petty things and bash up me and my brother for absolutely no reason. I saw how he would disapprove of anything my brother would want to do and force his agenda on him, and believed a good beating was necessary to set us straight. 

This one time I remember, my brother was flirting with this girl he had a thing with on Facebook chat, using my dad's laptop because that was the only one we had and it turned out that my dad had installed a spying software which was tracking all that he was doing...more than enough reason for a good beating session. He even phoned the girl's parents and told them how wrong it was of them to be talking to each other and she also got beat up and harrassed at home and ended up at a trauma centre because it was too much to take for her. 

That was the incident that gave my father enough leverage over my brother to set him straight for the rest of his life and to make him the man he wanted him to be.

 Something changed with my brother after that and he developed similar control freak tendencies like my dad..he too has snooped in on my private life and used that stuff as blackmail to 'keep me in check'.. I detest that side of him and feel as an elder brother he should've been more sensible about things but I guess he allowed himself to be conditioned rather differently. Carbon copy of my dad. 

The thing is that my mom at the time overlooked all this because she clearly did not have any opinions of her own and was too innocent/unaware of the consequences that such instances of violence can have. And she also was probably buying into the idea that good beating = good parenting..it's not that uncommon for Indian moms. 

We were living with my dad's parents and brother at the time as a joint family and those guys did not leave any stone unturned to harass my mom either, resulting in breakouts with them too which meant endless drama everywhere in the house. 

I was quite small at the time and didn't know what to make of it but as a child I could really feel the vibe turning sour and dark, often scaring me into disbelief. My brother on the other hand found it rather amusing to watch it all unfold. 

Those are the first instances of me seeing my mom get harassed like that, and my dad turning a blind eye to it for the most part but sometimes he did involve himself in those fights and wouldn't hesitate from beating his own parents up. 

But it always ended with him convincing my mom to make up to those crooked assholes and it wasn't that easy for her to digest but I guess the patriarchal norms had seeped in way too deep in her psyche for any kind of reason to prevail and for her to take strong action against all this unnecessary drama that was being made out of her life. 

Soon, my brother was off to college and I was starting to get sick of the shit my dad and his family were pulling. So I started speaking out everytime I saw my grandparents fuck with my mom or if my dad yelled at her or at me for no reason. I made it a point to remind them of how insensible they were being, and my dad would often get agitated at that and proceed to beat the shit out of me. I took it on the chin and I used to just take my glasses off and stand there with an empty look on my face while he punched, slapped, hit me with those metal cloth hangers and pushed me around till he was satisfied. 

My mom started to see things for what they were but she still didn't know how to take a stand. That time I was unaware that he used to beat her too, in the privacy of their room. She is eight years older than him. This one time I saw him almost hit her in front of me and I called him out on him and he beat the shit out of me for that. Me and my mom almost ran away that night only to be confronted by my dad's family who started making a scene in the middle of the road. 

My father has gone through my chats on my phone while I was away and stores pictures of them to blackmail me into doing things his way, same with my brother like I mentioned before. All of this, however, did not stop me from rebelling against them and going my own way, for which both of them still hold a grudge against me I'm sure and are always looking forward to the day I let something slip again so they can proceed to fuck with me. 

Anyway, coming to the recent happenings. In July last year my father beat up my mom real bad over some petty thing like her calling over her relatives to our house, which his high handed self doesn't approve of because he feels inadequate (financially and socially) to face them. 

All this stuff happened in front of person X, who has been our domestic help for around 15 years. He understands the dynamics of the house as well as I do and was quite close to my mom. Mom had been quivering like a little child, while my dad locked her in a room and started thrashing her. Seeing my father's insanity unfold in front of him he ran out of the house and went to the neighbours to seek help to stop the madness.

They came, but couldn't do much more than ask what's going on because my dad told them not to interfere in a family matter, and to be honest our society really fucking sucks for not being able to publically call out wrong for wrong and take a fucking stand for once. My mom also thought of it as another one of the thrash sessions and didn't make much of it at the time. I was in a different city then and I got a call from person X telling me what had happened. 

Some of my mom's family reached there as soon as they could to take my mom away from the shitshow that house that become, but she being the stupid, bovine personality that she is played it down and my father instead of accepting what he had done and apologising for it, started swinging allegations at my mom's family, digging out past issues he has had with them and belittling their character to shift the topic of conversation towards them and claim that those guys had no business sticking their necks in a personal matter. 

Just my dad stooping low as he can. They asked my mom several times to go with them but she didn't, making the same mistake she's made all her life by not acknowledging the limits my dad has repeatedly crossed.

I vowed to myself to get her the fuck out of there and a couple of months later, i did manage to do that. She moved in with one of my cousins and his wife who were living in the city along with person X who was obviously kicked out of the house for telling on my dad.

 But soon enough, my mentally unstable fickle minded father started showing up at her workplace threatening her with all sorts of things saying he will not let her live in peace etc. And he really did not. He would randomly show up following my mom and person X on the road, park right in front of them and start making a scene publically by saying all kinds of things that only made sense to him but all these things used to scare mom. 

A couple of days later, he relayed to my brother that he will first murder me and then proceed to murder everyone else in the family for breaking us apart, a threat as empty as his character but again, enought to scare my ever-fearful and codependent mother to shits. With that she decided to go back the house, worst decision ever.

That meant that he got away with doing what he did without even having to apologize for it, while my mom made a fool out of herself for even thinking she could get out of there in the first place. Classic shitshow scenes. I just wish that I had taken some time off to live with my mom instead of going back to college, but what the hell. 

I should add that during all this time, my dad had typed out some very belittling stuff about my mom's family (of course he blamed me and them for 'deluding' my mom into moving away from him), full of expletives and insulting stuff and sent it to everyone in the family, like the shameless piece of shit that he is. These are the same people he took huge loans from (amounting to tens of millions of dollars) and the ones that bought new clothes, gifts, furniture, electronics for the house and for everyone of us in the family (including him) every year because we barely had enough money to cope because he was gambling it all away. 

They never bothered to mention anything about the money they graciously gave and always welcomed and helped him if he ever had any matter of any sort in which they could help. And this is how he repayed them, trying to throw his own shit in their faces so that everyone else becomes dirty like him. It's hilarious actually the ways one's arrogance can take over one's ability to act sensibly. So much for not admitting that you have a problem.

My brother being the spineless soul that he is was behind my father this whole time and had a huge role to play in convincing my mother to return by saying how he was scared for his life because of my father's death threats.

Once she was back, so were the fireworks. My dad kept putting her through hell, but this time my mom didn't keep quiet like the obedient little wife she was supposed to be. She started giving it back, not as ferociously as my dad yelled at her, but she wasn't just sitting and taking it anymore, she was trying to fight back and respond like for like. 

A usual week would go like 1 day of peace and then he'd say something insensitive to which my mom would respond insensitively and his sensitive ass would get upset and he would go on a hunger strike. Still mom would lose because she cared too much to let a man go hungry and would have to go make up to him instead of it being the other way round. It's astonishing how cleverly that narcissistic fuck has crafted his shitty existence all these years and how he's managed to succeed. 

I came home earlier this year once lockdown began and this time, like the last time when I took mom away from him, i had absolutely zero fucks left for him. He would start ranting about me and abusing me and I'd fucking give it back to him. 

This one time he started arguing with mom and raised his voice to disturbing levels and started charging towards her as if to intimidate her that he'll beat her again, and I charged right back into him. He beat me, I beat him. He swore at me, I swore at him. It's clear this is the only way to not let him abuse the 'power' he thinks he have over us. Fucker thinks he's a reincarnation of God. 

Still, it's been a very difficult past couple of months having to deal with this ignorant madman who I'm sure will never find the humility in him to accept the mistakes he has made and move on, because it doesn't exist in him in the first place. That I'm sure of. What makes me sad is my mother having to deal with the emotional rollercoaster that all this can be, all over again. 

My brother also came down a couple of months back and since then things have gotten even worse. My father again weaved a whole lot of drama in front of him, he'd say something fucked up to which my mom would react back and he'd do his act all over again as if everyone is trying to suffocate him while he's the one suffocating himself. 

Then he would get angry like a person with psychosis and start breaking plates in the kitchen or throwing the food across the wall, just two of the many overly dramatic things he does to assert his dominance.

My brother initially tried talking sense into him to which he reacted in bursts of anger which I think scared my brother and he pretty much gave up on this man, and he clearly doesn't have the balls to tell him that he has genuine mental issues he needs to address. This kind of stuff has been going on and off continuously for the entire duration of the time I've been here. 

Last week, he said some very insulting things to my mother in passing about like how she'll never be able to set foot outside again and she has no dignity left and some stupid incoherent shit like that. My mom's response was somewhere between confused and worried, since whatever he was saying was quite vague.

Then later that night he called her to the room via my brother and both of them sat her down and played a recording of one of her calls to person X a few days where they were talking about general stuff and about how because of this man everything went to shits. Also about my dad's family and the spineless bunch of assholes that they are for never taking a stand and always harassing her for nothing. 

That motherfucker tapped my mother's phone!! As per Indian law, something like you can only do something like if the police is pursuing some serious charges, the law enforcement then asks the phone companies to record calls. He probably used some influence he must have had in law enforcement to go after something as ridiculous as my mom's phone calls!! It's outrageous.

 With this he's played another one of his signature trump card moves to throw shit on other people to save his own ass, and is threatening her to apologize to him for talking about him in bad taste to a third person (same guy who called him out), or he'll make the recordings viral and all the people in her workplace will listen to the things they're talking about, and she'll be left with no respect.

 And the best part, my brother fully supports him in this master intiative..I'm sure he must be filled with pride for how his father is orchestrating this. My brother and him have gone on a hunger strike since 2 days and won't eat until mom apoligizes. Lmao. 

Everytime I think I've seen shit sink as low as it can with this man, I am proved wrong. My mom clearly is not going to apologize to this fraud because there is nothing to apologize for. 

What my father put out into this world is gonna come back to him, and I don't think how my mom or person X are in the wrong when this piece of shit I don't even want to call my father has exploited her mentally, emotionally, physically, financially literally in all ways possible. And person X's resentment for him is also completely justified, for him to have been like a member of the family to be estranged like that, all because he took a fucking stand. 

I think after all the limits that have been crossed by him all throughout these years, this has to be the absolute worst. Breaching someone's privacy like this is nothing short of committing a crime. I'm exhorting my mom to take strict action against him and not let him walk out of this. It's high time he realises there are consequences to this thing. 

But then again, my mom being my mom, she's just too scared to do anything , too scared to live. Even if it's her self respect at stake, she just doesn't seem to be willing to do anything to change her reality. She keeps saying that she's only waiting for her retirement which is in 6 months, after which she'll get the fuck out of this house and this city and live with me. But i think if she doesn't get out of here even after all this shit, it'll keep getting worse and the 6 months that she can spend peacefully out of here without living in this constant state of turbulence and chaos she'll have to rot in hell with this rotten piece of shit that lives here and projects his rottenness onto everyone else. 

Her way of life is akin to that of a cow, and this house has become her patch of grass she's been grazing for so long now that the thought of another territory scares her to death. And I can only do too much, I can bring the spoon right in front of her mouth but I can't shove it in her mouth.

That last bit of action has to come from her, and has to stem from a conscious choice to change her reality for her own well being where she doesn't have to worry about this monster who's always looking to make her feel like she's worth nothing. 

I feel like I'm stuck between two extremes. 

On one hand there's the piece of shit dad and my spineless brother who lacks the balls to take a stand, both of whom are narcissistic control freaks who don't give two shits about domestic violence as a means to an end, the idea of privacy and are always looking for holes in other people's lives through cause that's the only way they can assert their authority, the only thing that makes them feel good about themselves. 

On the other hand there's my mother. Way too selfless, always giving but giving away too much for her own good that people like my dad and brother feed off of her goodness and manipulate her according to their sinister ways. 

And there's me, just sitting here wondering what it would take for her to realise that she doesn't need anyone who can't treat her with the respect she deserves, especially so the people who have repeatedly betrayed her and not stood out for her during dark times.

616,"So my husband and I got engaged in Feb. 2019 and shortly after I started planning our wedding. My fiance wasn't big on the idea of having a wedding and he would have preferred going to the court and getting married there. However, he knew it was something that was important to me as well as my family so he went along with it and we found a venue and scheduled our wedding for Sept. 2020. Fast forward to June 2020 and with all of the craziness of COVID we decided to postpone our wedding for September 2021. My father, who has been battling prostate cancer for 8 years, wanted to make sure he was able to walk me down the aisle and give me away. His cancer is not curable but he thought it was being well managed and assumed he would be around for a few more years but to be safe he wanted my husband and I to still get married Sept. 2020.  So last minute we put together a small wedding with our immediate family (parents on both sides, our siblings and their significant others). The wedding was beautiful and I am forever grateful we did this because now, three months later, we found out my father's cancer had spread to his bones (it had progressed long before he told us). We knew his cancer was aggressive and they were having troubles stopping the spreading but he suddenly started declining so fast and one day on a call with the doctor, he informed my father there was nothing else they could do and in his experience, he has about a month and a half left to live. Hearing this was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever had to hear. We knew his time would come but thought we had more time, like a year at the very least. I have been trying to process this information for the past 3 weeks and every day is a rollercoaster of emotions. My father is literally the best man I know. He's so kind, genuine, and giving. My sister just had a baby, making him a grandpa now and he is so proud. We have been visiting my father daily with my sister and her baby and his grandson brings him so much joy right now. He is only 63 and it's hard to believe he will be gone soon. We have home hospice set up to make him as comfortable as possible but it is so hard to see him in his current state. I feel so robbed but am thankful we had time to prepare and was able to have him in my life for so many years. To him he accomplished everything. He retired young thank god and got to walk his two daughters down the aisle and now meet his grandson. He lived a pretty good life overall but its still terrible it is being cut so short. I know there are people in worse off conditions and my heart goes out to them as well. This has not been an easy time for anyone. 

However, now it leaves me to figure out what to do with our postponed wedding scheduled for Sept 2021. We have already paid more than half of the cost of the wedding and if we cancel we will not get our money back. I have so many mixed feelings about this, I don't know what to do. My husband is against it and says it is wrong to go forward with the wedding without my father being there. But to me, he never wanted to have the wedding in the first place so it's easier for him to say forget it. I know it will not be the same without my father there, nothing will ever be the same. I know it will be an emotional day regardless but I think my father would want me to still go forward and have the wedding/reception/ idk what we would call it since we're already married. Also, I think it is different for guys in general, I don't think they realize how big of a deal this is to girls. We all dream of our perfect wedding day and celebrating with all our friends and family. I spent so much time and effort planning this wedding and still want to have our big day and wear my dress and take photos with our friends and I also think it gives us something positive to look forward to after having such a rough 2020 and losing my father. I know I have time to decide but any advice would be much appreciated. Another note is if I do choose to go forward with the wedding, knowing my husband feels against it, how is that fair either? I just feel like no one wins in this situation. I want to do what is right but is there a right or a wrong answer?",18Dec2020,1
617,"Recently, I've seem some *super* messed up gore stuff. While a normal person would click away and be traumatized watching people literally die in the most horrific ways possible, I would have no reaction. I don't enjoy it, I don't feel nauseous, I don't feel traumatized, I just feel nothing. Granted, I would still feel horrible for the people about how they went but I never really built up a good resistant of lacking emotion. It was kind of always there. I would probably feel a lot more sick if I was younger but ever since quarantine I would never really have any feelings to anything I watched.

For more context, I'm 15 male, living an ok life with a cool family. I've never had any traumatic experiences ever. I don't really watch gore related shows. I suspected something might actually be wrong with me ever since I questioned what the hell was presented in front of me. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit I'll delete it after.

I was living on my own for awhile but then my sister husband got laid off and she and her 3 kids came to live with us. Shes shares a room with her husband and 2 little kids. The oldest sleeps in the other room. On top of that my other sister lost custody over her 2 children so they came to live with us. One sleeps in the living room and has his own bed. And the  little one sleeps with my niece in the other room. My sister decided to have another baby. When she already has 3 babies and is struggling. Everytime her husband gets money he never saves, its been like that for years. I just turned 22 and i recently got married. De live in the biggest room where i have been living for awhile now. We have zero kids and dont plan on having any, any time soon. I pitch in buying groceries for the kids, i Cook whenever i can. I work 5 times a week and my husband does too. We pay our bills but never have enough for just us. My sister asked me if she could have the big room cause shes having another baby. I feel like in being selfish but i explained to her that its my only space. And that before she was living here I never has to clean yo after no one and that it was alot easier for me to go to school and work.

But i feel like she  doesnt see  that i Cook  and cleans alot. Cleaning not as much. Maybe not as much as her but thats only because i work. I feel like my room is my only space. The only space where i feel okay. Everyone is always arguing and i just her streaming all the time. Also this room is away from the other 2 rooms and has its own  restroom. This is literally the  only thing i have in the house. Im i being selfish? Should i just give her the room.

629,"Apologies if this post comes off a little salty. But I'm really tired and confused. And salty. Obviously. 

(Context if you need it: I'm seeking therapy for my depression and social anxiety, along with a plethora of issues with social skills etc. I struggle doing basic things in life and functioning like a proper adult.)

Basically I've attended cbt therapy with a therapist (actually, two different therapists) at some private clinic... Place thing. I started sometime in 2019 and took breaks every 3 months or so. 

And pretty much throughout the whole thing I had her bitching about me not making any significant progress, and politely implying I should just fuck off because they only work with the same patient for a set amount of time, before then you're either forced to take a 3 month break or ask for another therapist. 

Is this... How it's supposed to work? I thought this stuff lasted for years or some shit.

I genuinely don't understand how I'm supposed to change behaviors and get over issues I've had for all my life in just a few sessions. It legit made me scared of looking for any other therapists anywhere because now I feel like shit for not magically getting better in just a few months/sessions. 

The therapist also obsessively pushes me to try group therapy even though she knows I don't give a damn about it and am extremely uncomfy with it. I *desperately* need help to get my life together and start functioning like a proper adult before I inevitably neck myself, and these people are out here acting like a weekly tea party is gonna somehow help me fix that. 

She also had the audacity to tell me she doesn't think I'm ""really"" depressed or anxious on our last session, telling me how it's all just a lack of discipline or something. I think it was her last ""fuck you"" to me. Thanks. Very helpful.

Luckily I finally realized that I would love to study Computer Science, so I told my parents and they were pretty supportive and immediately bought the books I needed to study for the University Entrance Exam.

So I'm still attending and doing all my assignments, problem is that not only do I hate it but I also can't concentrate on studying for the University Entrance Exam because the Art School Assignments already burn me out.

637,"I work a customer service related job. I’m secluded for the most part, but I still have minimal contact with the public.

I rarely get tips, but when I do, I’m required to put them in the “tip” jar.

I know for a fact that I never see a dime of any tips given. Whether I’m the one who is tipped or someone else.

It’s that time of year when people become more generous.

Last year I was given roughly about $180 in tips in about a 2 week period. I did the “right” thing and put them in the tip jar. I could get fired if I pocket any tip given to me. My employer has fired a few people in the past for doing this.

I’ve only worked 5 hours so far today, and I’ve already been handed $45 in tips. Tips I will never see because my employer doesn’t put tips on my check.

A part of me wants to justify keeping them, as the money was given to me as a sign of appreciation.

If I don’t hand in the tips, I’m considered the “thief” but if I give them up, they’re basically stolen from me.

1. What's the best state for my situation? I'm a muslim from the middle east, I want the state that I'm studying in to be culturally diverse. I got recommended New York by a friend but I also want to hear from others so please let me know if you have any recommendations and why.

2. What major should I study? My initial plan was software engineering, but I've noticed that there are a lot more majors that are similar to that and different ik some ways. I want to become a programmer and programming games is my dream job.

641,"(The only reason I'm typing this out right now is that my brother has made me feel like I'm overreacting and non of this is a big deal. For context, I'm sixteen and my brother right now is seventeen and our parents have been divorced for a while now so our dad doesn't live with us) My brother has been like this I think for the last five to three years and my only real guess why he's like this is because he's insecure about his intelligence because somehow somebody made him feel stupid in his life, this is just my guess it could be right or wrong I don't care. My brother acts fine around my other family i.e my uncle, cousins, aunts, and grandparents even our dad but when it comes to me and my mom he pretty much criticizes us every chance he gets, and when he talks about politics with us he gets really heated and calls us retarded, stupid, and says we don't know anything. A couple of nights ago he was talking with our mom about homework and I suggested instead of copying off google search he put it in my own words so teachers don't get suspicious and he told me to shut my mouth. I don't know if I'm overreacting since he gaslights me when I say he criticizes us a lot by saying he doesn't, even though almost every time I walk by him he has something to say (ex. I walk by him with an annoyed look but not looking at him after he and my mom were arguing and he says stop being so depressed while I walk by). This morning He woke me up because he and my mom were arguing (i.e he was calling her dumb and told her she didn't know anything) when he walked past my room I asked if he was good cause he was getting really heated, he then proceeded to tell me, after a little back and forth (NOT about politics mind you, it was about him waking me up) he told me that I knew nothing, and asked if I was gonna start ""getting upset again"" even though he was the one yelling in the kitchen. Right now I'm waiting for him to get out of the house so I hopefully don't have to see him again. I'm pretty sure he's beyond any help that I could give him, I can barely have a conversation with him without shaking because I'm pretty sure I have anxiety, but not that sure since my brother told me to just ""toughen up"".

642,"I'm a 17 year old male. This happened back when I was in what we at that time used to call ""Lower Kindergarten"", My classes used to end by 12 in the noon and my sister's classes used to end by around 3 pm who was in 8th grade back then. Our home was a bit far away from the school and since both of our parents were working, no one could come and pick us up, hence we had to walk home together. So each day I had to wait about 3 hours at school before I could go home.  


One day two girls who at that time were in 3rd grade stayed back and that was unusual cause I was the only kid who used to stay back after school. Most of what happened is kinda murky in my mind but all I remember is that they made me strip and did stuff with me (I do not want to say what they were.)  


I was a kid at that time and I didn't realize what was happening. I had honestly forgotten all about it until a couple of years back. I was helping to put up some posters for the school. One of the posters was about child abuse and there was a sentence similar to ""If anyone ever touches you in a way that make you feel awkward then you should tell your parents and teachers about it"". I still haven't told my family about it .  


The only people I have shared it with are my boys who came to the conclusion that I was a 'legend' cause ' I scored even before my balls dropped'.  


I didn't realize that I was affected by it cause I didn't even remember it, until recently. I have been with this girl that I like, and she tried to kiss me, and I can't describe what I felt but I pulled myself back so quick, that she probably thinks I hate her. I just didn't want anything physical and this is weird cause I was a horny bastard like the rest of the teenage dudes until a couple of years back.

643,"So pretty much my now ex (22) broke up with me because she felt that she felt a bit overwhelmed and wanted time to do her own things, she told me she loves me a lot, but rn she really wants to love herself first. She told me “ she wants to get home and nap or watch Netflix without having this pressure of going out with me everyday”. I told her why didn’t she tell me she needed the space, but she told me she did want me around it’s just she feels like she needs her time for herself. She works 40 hours a week and has multiple responsibilities with her family. I asked her for a break and she didn’t want to bc she felt she didn’t know how much time she needed for herself likewise she didn’t want to keep me waiting for her. I asked how long as she felt like this, like wanting to break up, she said it was maybe right when the quarantine started. But she didn’t want to hurt me, even though I felt like this hurt more knowing she wasn’t happy with herself. Even with all of this she’s telling me she loves me, holding my hand, and hugging me. I asked her after “is this the last time I’m going to see you” and she tells me she still wants me around to “have dinner if my mom cooks”, “hang with niece”, and “occasionally go to the store together”. I ask her that’s fine, but I then I ask if there’s a possibility of us getting back together in the future and she just said “idk rn don’t pressure me”. Then I just said let’s do “baby steps” back into this friendship and see what happens, and she seemed fine with it. It’s close to Christmas so she tells me she wants to give me a gift on Christmas and not to say no to it, which I agreed. So we part ways and she texts me minutes after leaving “I love you don’t forget that”. I know most cases you want to move on, but literally the second half of this break up is bothering me because I don’t know what she wants with having me around. I’m not sure if it was out of genuine want or was it just to let me down easy. I’m doing better since it’s been a week, but just these thoughts have been bothering me go through accepting things.

He then took me to his hotel, and I stated I wasn’t comfortable to do anything sexual. I turned on the tv to Spongebob and laid down.

I  am 23 years old now . My family has a pretty big business in my  community and all my life I have been known to do only one thing, take  over that business . Starting from young age , I was told i am smart ,  bright and is qualified to do that kind of job . I was praised when i  accomplished small things , i was taught the basics of their business  .Had high expectations for me . and I believed  I could do it also.

But  as the times went by I made many mistakes , even more mistakes than  normal people . I wasn't  the best at anything also . I am clumsy ,  unmotivated and always causing problems . The older i got , I realized  more and more that I am not the person my parents want me to be .People  says I don't have a skills and knowledge of a 22 years old person and  still childish . All my belief and motivations of my childhood seems so  wrong and stupid .Sometimes i just wish I don't exist rather than  causing more problems . All those things I tried and learned these 22  years seems useless . I don't know what i want to be cuz they put me  that stupid idea of ""will be able to take over"" and now when I can't do  it as much as they want me to be and become useless .. I m so damn lost.  I don't even know anything other than what they taught me and I am not  even good at that .Feels like i am not cut out for the job . Feels like  there is no place for me anywhere.

I  know what my parents say and tell is the best for me . But i am not  reaching the heights my parents want me to be also .... they also  compares me with other people my age or the accomplishments they made  when they were my age. I know it is for my well being but  I can't do  like what they do and it makes me feel so useless.

661,"So, this is going to be a long post. Apologies in advance for the long read.

&amp;#x200B;

I made this throwaway account just for this reason in fact, some background. I grew up around a lot f negativity, and spite from my family. I was the black sheep, the asshole all the time regardless of whether i was at fault. My mother is hardcore christian, and has been for a long time and my dad is a spineless bastard (they are divorced). My mother had a new man at home every week, (im 25m btw) or every few months at least and was in a number of abusive relationships that effected myself and my little brother heavily for many years. My dad was dating a few woman much the same honestly, the last one refused to feed me for a long time. My parents, and stepparents decided the best thing for me was Christian Military school when i was 12 because i was such a demon, and bad kid. My mother was a hypochondriac, and believed whole heartedly i inherited all of her mental illnesses unlike my brother, and was pumped full of anti-psychotic and antidepressant medication from when i was like 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I was angry all the time at my constant treatment, abuse, BS, and pills. I hate my family and only ever wanted to be left alone after that. Then christian Military school, more of the same but alot worse. They were a bunch of racists pricks who told me i was going to hell for the actions of my parents and my inability to control them. God was watching, and working in everyones lives, and that if i pray hard enough god would take my fuckin problems away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started driving truck when i was 22 and got away from my family, i was alone and independent for the first time. 3 years later, i found a girl while i was truckin, and shes been pushing me to change constantly since we met. Its non stop work, i have to quit smoking which in all honesty i dont want to do, im tired. Im always doing some kind of work on something at the behest of others. I love my girl to death, she does alot for me and is a joy to be around. Im happy here, but i still feel the urge to just leave and be alone elsewhere. Im selling cars now, i own a mustang, and have a home to live in. But i dont feel like its mine, i feel like im just coasting on her back. Its her apartment, and very little in it belongs to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im tired of working on everything all the time, im tired of people, im tired of the heat (i grew up in the south, currently live in the south), i want to be somewhere alone in a forest full of trees and snow on the ground 5 months or more of the year. Somewhere i can go to work, go home, work on my car, and not have to constantly do shit for other people. All this suddenly hit me last night when a co-worker made an off hand comment about a customer i had sold a mustang too (ironic i know). This girl was legitimately what i had always pictured my dream girl way back when, covered in tattoos, short white hair, black lipstick, smoked all the time and didnt have a fuck to give. Im not considering a life with this girl, im ashamed to admit that im an asshole and have thought alot about sleeping with her in fact, but i wouldnt betray my girlfriend like that no matter the circumstances. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it has gotten me to consider things again, do i want to be here? Living in someone elses house, despite the fact were a couple of a year? I feel like im settling, eventually she wants to move north, but i enjoy smoking. Its relaxing to me, and she absolutely despises it, and is always up my ass about it and ive genuinely tried to quit, i just enjoy it too much and thats a deal breaker for her. Im tired of fighting, working constantly on a life that doesnt even feel like mine, and just being fucking tired all the time anyway. I feel like im just at a point where i want to work, work on my car, and overall be left to my own devices and be accepted how i am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things arent as rosy with her and i like you might think they are, she and i have had a few bad verbal fights that have really pissed me off. She made me an ultimatum when i proposed to her once, i was trying to quit smoking but it was exceptionally hard when i was working a high stress job with very long hours. Her words, more or less, ""quit smoking, or were done"". We arent engaged and have talked much about the proposal since, and a few times since she gets on a high horse and starts talking down to me, like an idiot because i dont possess alot in the way of life skills because i had never had anyone around to teach me that shit, and when being so broke for so long, nearly every dime of every check i made for many years was all food money, rent money, and gas to get back to work. I didnt have money to manage, i had no money. 

&amp;#x200B;

She consistently talks down to me about shit like that that im still in the process of learning. She gets aggressive with it sometimes when all i want to do after so many years of bullshit is rest occasionally. She recently started accusing me of cheating actually, before realizing how absurd the idea was despite going through my phone and laptop and figuring out i really like cars and havent really been talking to many people aside from 2 friends at work, both of whom are guys. I didnt tell her at the time, but that shit hurt because i hadnt done anything, even now im reconsidering life, not fucking my customers. I got out of trucking and into sales because she wanted me to, and im enjoying selling cars, in fact i love it. There money here, and im good at selling cars. Im a straight shooter, no bullshit, and honest as hell. But am learning how to work numbers and get good commissions on deals and can move up in this line of work. Theres growth here, and even if it all went belly up, i still have my class A to fall back on and get a job driving truck. I only have a backback and 2 duffles full of clothing and my car, i could rent a storage unit for my car, and hop in the truck right now if i needed to.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go somewhere it snows 6 months a year, with a forest of trees in every directions, and sub zero temperatures. Like seattle, and not tell family, friends, no one. Just up and leave. Sell cars there, or drive truck, get a 1 bedroom house or something with a garage, a cat, and MAYBE later have someone if they accept me and dont try to change me. I dont want, nor can i have kids anyway (shooting blanks hehe).

This is probably the hardest decision I’ve had to make. I really want to work things out but I mean realistically I don’t know where to go
So certain things that don’t work in our relationship are:
1. I’ve always wanted to get married my bf doesn’t in the beginning of our relationship he teased at the idea but ultimately doesn’t want to get married he claims he’ll do “anything else for me” though
2. My bf never reciprocates oral he says he will but never does
3. On the same topic my bf doesn’t really want to try new things in the bedroom or talk about sex at all he tells me I’m “weird” when I try to discuss sex
4. My bf seldom compliments me and I’m already insecure so i feel like he doesn’t find me that attractive
5. My bf always says there’s no point in lingerie since it’ll be off in 5 seconds
6. My bf hates drinking which is fine but I never drank before 21 and we turned 21 together so I haven’t gotten to experience this. He also has issues with me going out to bars with my friends
7. I wish he was more thoughtful. I got him a bunch of gifts last Christmas because he said no one ever got him presents and he got me a mug from Marshall’s
8. In the beginning of our relationship (the talking stage which I wasn’t aware we were in) he broke my trust and slept with his ex while my mother was at the end of her life and I know I forgave him but I don’t think I really gave myself enough time 

I guess these are all of our big issues laid out on the table

The things I love about him are 
1. He can be supportive at times 
2. When he does compliment me it feels nice
3. We have a lot in common
4. We’ve mapped out some of our lives together
5. He loves me and I love him

664,"Hey fellas,

I need to take advise

After the uni, i returned to my country.

Made some money (100k USD) on the first year still no income for 2 years but working on solo projects.

I moved out to plan my life a week ago and living without my family finally.

My brother(2 years younger) stays with me and plays video game whole day which drives me crazy and demotivates me.

I dont know how to approach him cuz he wanted to be football player and failed after 10 years of try.

He might be just recovering(been a year tho), cant talk with him too, he feels like crying when we do.

I dont want him to move back to my father too cuz he is happier here, just dont want him to be OK with his life and start doing something and my approach does not work, he says he is not ready but it is been a year he does nothing.

So my question is, should i be unaffected from him and focus my work while he hangs out around me or do sth?",18Dec2020,1

My parents had my brother and I before they wanted or were ready for kids and sacrificed everything to raise us. They are great parents and we are all pretty well off now but I know they were not living a good life when we were young. Myself and my husband are already in a much better spot financially than they were but we aren't at a stop where one of us could easily stop working full time. On the opposite side of things, my husbands sister is going through huge infertility problems and truly wishes she had gotten pregnant back in high school when she could have. We are hoping to send him to get his MBA but don't know when or if he will get in. So basically, if the answer doesn't come naturally to us, does anyone have insight on whether it's ever worth it to have kids before you feel 100% financially ready?",18Dec2020,2

673,"Hello Reddit, 
Long time lurker, first time posting. So I'm male, and just hit 30. My wife, whom I've been married to about a little more than a year, believes that I am not over my ex.

Some background: While in Uni, I dated a girl for almost two years. I think I was 24 maybe 25. We broke up, and that was that. I never spoke to my ex ever again, or had any sort of communication with her. Yeah there were some pictures of her and me on Facebook, which my wife found, and asked me to remove, which I had no problem with.

Everything is great between us, the Mrs and I. I love her dearly. And I'm grateful I found such a loving partner. But we continue to argue about the details of my last relationship. My wife asks me questions to the point where I am quite uncomfortable. She is having a hard time getting over the fact that I dated someone else, before I even knew she existed. 

Dear Reddit, on my part, I have been patient, spent long hours talking to her, told her THAT, relationship is done and dusted, and I want to build a future with her. Everytime I do something nice, like get her flowers, or chocolates, or make her breakfast, she responds, ""I bet you used to do that for your ex too, so why is it special now?"" 

I've thought long and hard about this. I've apologised profusely. I wish there was something I could do to change her mind. Even my family adores her and showers her with all kinds of gifts and love. 

I'm not saying I'm perfect, I've lost my temper, I've been rude and dismissive at times. 

I guess I'm just writing this because I'm really stressed and depressed about how my married life is going, and I don't have anyone to hear me out. 

Ps: she never dated anyone before marrying me.",18Dec2020,2

It would be all worth it if she actually did anything to make her situation better, but she doesn't and I don't know what I should do about it. She asks for advice but then outright ignores every piece of advice I give and I don't think she can ever get better like this.

678,"So a little back story. Last Sunday I was helping at my church. I’m a leader so I got there early to help. We had to stack chairs and put them away. The youth pastor says “be sure to keep masks on at all times unless you’re singing” well since I was helping with chairs I was sweating. I had my mask on my chin because I can’t stand breathing my sweat in and my mask getting wet. But after I cooled down I was gonna put it on. My friend has my youth pastor repeat what he said and then after my friend said “that goes for you too” talking to me. I just ignored him but that already made me a little mad because now my youth pastor without a doubt knows I ain’t following the rules. As soon as we get done we go into pre-service prayer. I took my mask off while praying (because as far as I’m aware there isn’t a set rule at the church to keep masks on while praying). So we get done and he says “and make sure you guys keep masks on”. I had mine on my mouth but below my nose, I was gonna put it on properly once we were done. My friend reaches inside of my mask and puts his finger on my mouth and pulls up my mask. I instantly jerk away and said “bro stop your fingers in my mouth” but I’m sure the way I said it he could tell I was not a fan. He proceeded to do it again but by my nose and not on my mouth. Ever since then I’ve been kinda mad at him just because if you really do want people to wear masks like him, you should also know shoving your finger in someone’s mouth ain’t sanitary. If he tried this crap again what do I say? And is it normal to be mad at a friend like that? 



PS: he’s also said a few iffy things but I don’t care that much because now I bark back. He says he’s smarter than me and I should know that “as a joke” but he decided to do school work at the last minute and said that to me and I replied “ehhhhhhh Idk about that” implying if he really was smart he would’ve done the work early. I’m all for teasing each other but there’s sometimes a line I guess. Anyways what should I do?

679,"Long post but please read if you have a minute, I could really use some advice. I'm a 26F and my male best friend is 25M. Lets call him Dan. We’ve been friends for a long time. I’m his only friend. We spend a fair amount of time together. I’m finding him harder to handle and starting to get a bad feeling. My summary of him would go like this: tall, dark, handsome, dead inside. 

Last weekend, my partner of 5 years and my group of close friends expressed to me a genuine concern that he may be a psychopath. I’ll admit, they had some points. Everybody says he seems “off” and after years and years of close friendship, me being the absolute closest he has ever been to any person, I feel like I don’t know him at all. I am mildly concerned because, I actually don’t know if I can trust him at this point. He is just SO hard to read. Our favourite hobby is hiking... which means we spend many, many hours together in the deep woods, alone. Most of the time its over 3 hours away from home. I had never really given it much thought but lately I’m feeling uneasy around him. One of my friends said, “I’m going to be honest, if you ended up missing after going to the woods with him, I couldn’t say I’d be surprised, and I’d feel really guilty because.. there are totally signs.” Yikes. 

Here’s what my friends and I discussed:

\- He’s incredibly intimidating, he never smiles (he downright glares sometimes) 

\- Nothing really seems to move him. I’ve never, and I mean never seen him elated, proud, enthusiastic, etc. I’ve spoken to him about concerns about his emotional health and depression, but he made it clear he is not depressed... “This is just how I am.” And I believe him. 

\- Despite him being overly composed, there have been a couple instances in which he sort of “snapped” at me (I’m super bubbly and energetic, the complete opposite of him and maybe it gets on his nerves) and spoke to me in a hateful way. I don't speak to my loved ones in a tone like that, ever. To me it was really sharp and kind of scary. 

\- He doesn’t know how to communicate, understand, comfort, or express empathy towards people. I admitted to him this fall that I have been struggling with my mental health since a friend of mine was brutally killed.. I spent some time trying to explain to him how I feel and when I said at the end, ""Do you sort of know what I mean?"" He just said, ""No."" Long pause.. end of conversation. This is a pretty typical interaction for us. He blames it on his introverted ness but, from what I understand introverts don’t typically completely lack interpersonal skills when in private with their closest person. 

\- I’ve never seen him express emotion at a sad movie, song, story, anything.

\- He sometimes stares at me intensely.. not longingly. With concentration. Both me and my friends have noticed.

\- Some strange parallels: We met when we both worked for my partner's family's business. When my partner started running a loader there, Dan went to another sawmill and started as a loader operator. Then when my partner left the family business to work in scrap metal, Dan also got a new job.. working in scrap metal. He also bought the same car as my partner. 

\- He makes EVERYBODY who I introduce him to uncomfortable. EVERYONE says things to the effect of, “I dont know.. I’ve never met anyone like him.” 

\- Even when he claims he’s happy/in a good mood he just has this constant blank stare on his face.

\- I’ve never ever seen him sway to music or bob his head to it.. I’ve never heard him even hum or whistle a tune. He doesn't seem to interact with his surroundings. He says he doesn’t get “those kinds of urges.”

\- I once hit a Red fox on one of our drives and to both the killing of the poor fox AND to my sobs of sorrow (I love animals) his reaction was complete silence.

\- This is a weird one but, he just doesn’t seem prone to the most human things. I’ve never seen him sick, he doesn’t get headaches or any kind of pain ever really, he doesn’t itch/fidget/giggle/talk to himself/ any of the quirky things humans do that makes us so unique. He is still, composed, cold and unfazed. I’ve never seen him trip, stumble, misstep, bump into something... he is weirdly coordinated and aware of his surroundings, just very calculated. Its always weirded me out. 

After some discussion about it my friends jokingly asked me, “like holy shit, does he have a crossbow or something?! Haha a collection of weapons?!” And the answer is... yes. He has a crossbow and a collection of weapons. 

As I mentioned, his personality is becoming harder for me to deal with. I’m a positive, busy, hopeful person who loves everything and everyone. He is the opposite. We have had many “arguments” this year that went like “Hey, I really struggle with your seeming indifference to the things I tell you and try to lean on you for. It feels like you are just waiting for me to stop talking, and you never respond. I feel unseen and unheard by my best friend.” And him saying “..... sorry. Thats just how I am.” End of conversation. To be clear, I spend mountains of time asking him about his day, how work was, how he's feeling, etc. I don't just ramble on about myself. 

Am I being paranoid? I dont want to pull away from him because what if he really is just a very strange, lonely person with 1 friend? 

But I feel genuinely nervous. I’ve become more aware of how strange and subhuman he seems.. and when my friends asked me what I get from this friendship, my genuine answer is that I don’t know. I mean, psychopaths are real. Some people are dangerous. What if he's one of them and he gets upset with me?  I know he has had feelings for me in the past. Should I be leery of going into the woods for 12 hour days with this guy? As I've mentioned, I feel like I don't even know him. Which makes me sad. 

I hope I haven't offended any introverts with this question. I want to make it clear that I do NOT think of all introverts like this. I'm just wondering if he really is strangely introverted or something else. And I really don't want to hurt anyone.",18Dec2020,3

683," Long story short, I have an IPhone 5s for about 6 years.

In July 2019, I got my first repair for it because the charging dock was damaged. Not only that, I even changed the battery as well which charged me extra. Please note that it was a third party.

Everything is fine until around the late-October, something wrong with it as the screen keeps flickering. It turns out that the battery was swollen.

So, I brought a new IPhone 7 but it still kept the IPhone 5s. The 5s still works until around early November, it stopped working anymore.

I always check my damaged IPhone 5s until March 2020 where my online class starts due to the COVID 19, I check it and found out that the left side of the screen popped up not so much.

However, I still kept it because I still have some data in it. It was currently placed in a huge plastic container with other of my family’s stuff.

So right now, I’m planning to get my IPhone 5s repaired very soon as possible.

Unfortunately, there are few reasons about it.

1. I’m Autistic and I can’t go outside unless I have a guidance with me. Because, my mom was very worried that go somewhere far or doesn’t know the direction.
2. I can’t go outside because of COVID.
3. Usually when I want something, I sometimes ask my mom’s permission first. But, I don’t know if I can ask her about the phone repair.
4. I read that the IPhone 5s support will end at March 2021 but, I’m in California and I heard that it will end 2023 instead if you live there or Turkey. 

So, is there any advice I can get from this?

686,"I met my best friend 3 and a half years ago on our first day at university. We became really close and I finally felt like I had the friend I always wanted (I haven’t had the best luck with friends). But lately she’s changed a lot and who she is just isn’t compatible with who I am. 

Over the summer, she had this roommate that she absolutely idolizes. I’m glad she has someone to look up to like that, but she has completely changed herself to be more like the roommate. She’s turned into a hardcore SJW. I have absolutely no issue with most of the things she advocates for, but her actions don’t line up with she’s preaching and the hypocrisy really irritates me. You also can’t disagree with her anything because she thinks all her opinions are right. She also gets high a lot which I don’t like. 

Over the past few years she’s mostly been a really great friend to me. She’s always had my back and supported me in things, but will also tell me when I’m being stupid. One issue is that about once a year, she’ll withdraw from me. She has some mental health issues (so do I) so I’m very sympathetic towards her reasoning for isolating herself from me. The issue with this though is that I’m the only person she stops talking to and she’s completely normal with everyone else. She says it’s because she knows I’ll see right through her, but our other friends are just as close with her and I know they would too.

689,"This year I will be celebrating Christmas with my mom and three other family friends (friend X, + her mom and step-dad). Friend X lives in another city, but will be taking the train down to celebrate with us. X demanded that we all take the corona test before she comes down. I assume/guess it’s because she has ME and is maybe paranoid about getting sick from us? I don’t know enough about the disease to know if it puts her in the high-risk category.

Her mom found it to be a stupid demand and couldn’t be bothered arguing with her and told us that she would be lying about having taken it and advised us to do the same. Now logically and ideally, I get it. It would be nice if everyone was tested before going to any kind of get together. I was also getting ready to do it, but after a little research, I saw that in my country, they only recommend people who show symptoms or have been in contact with others who have corona, to take the test. It advised against taking the test for the sake of taking it. I also generally felt an apprehension towards going to a place where people could actually have corona (even though I guess the medical staff would be making the testing area safe).

As an online student I have essentially been careful and only gone out publicly for shopping. I basically only hang out with my mom and boyfriend. The few friends I do meet are also taking precautions. When I do go out I wear a mask and sanitize my hands often. About 80%+ of the people I have seen in the places I go to are doing the same. Our parents have public jobs, but they also take precautions. I haven’t been sick in the slightest for months, neither have they.

We all kind of think that she is being pretentious/dramatic. Like our parents are old enough to be in the risk category. I am a smoker and am also wary of catching it. It’s not like any of us are irresponsible about it. Our city also has far less cases than hers, considering she lives in the capital. She is not always the brightest bulb and can often be dramatic which makes us take her less seriously about it. But none of us want a lecture/argument from her with her facebook-science level of intelligence. I know it sounds mean, I’m just trying to paint a picture of what it would be like realistically. I don’t really want to lie, but I also don’t really want the drama. On top of that. We ALL have finished our shopping/public outings/etc for Christmas and will be staying at home for 6 days before even meeting. Which I assume would give plenty of time for symptoms (if any) to appear before meeting. It’s only her that will be in public taking a train to get here about 3 days before Christmas.

The thing is I kinda hate lying and this is making me feel a bit asshole-ish/uncomfortable. Would it be okay if I lied about it? Should I just suck it up and take the test?

edit. Thank you all for the advice. I have decided that I won't lie and that I will try to get tested if the conditions are safe enough for that.",18Dec2020,0

The story is i bought something from someone online and bank transferred it to them. It was taking waaay to long so i said leave it i want a refund. Before i sent the money though i got his drivers license and he wrote my name on a peice of paper next to it to prove to me it was legit. I checked the name and address online from the voting poll website and its legit aswell. 

Now the refund is undergoing so many checks from the bank, or so he says, first his bank account was frozen and so i had to wait almost a month for that to be sorted and now he says he's sent it via his mum's account (again i checked and her details are real from the government polling website). Now that is also undergoing checks via faster payments?

I don't know if i have been scammed, but incase t have because i have a photo of his driving licence and his actual address and name etc. Can i actually do anything legally to get the money back? I've recored every phone i had with him and got all ybe messages aswell to prove everything.

698,"So I've decided I want to become a translator, I study two languages, Chinese (Mandarin) and Japanese. I am conversational level in Chinese, and beginner at Japanese. While I am more skilled at Chinese, there are some things that are more difficult for me, like sentences, word use, and I am very bad at speaking Chinese, I can text it just fine though. With Japanese, I think I can speak it better, while I am a beginner, Japanese hasn't been too hard for me (yet) also I am so much more exposed to Japanese (yes I am a weeb) I listen to it a lot, and end up reading it a lot, plus I am more exposed to Japanese culture, and I enjoy Japanese media more.

699,"I’m 22 years old and my mental health crisis was brought on by me getting into a new relationship. 

A little back story: I have a history of anxiety, but only when I get into relationships. I get anxiety because I usually start thinking about other girls, and I start to feel bad, beat myself up, and then I get into a negative thought cycle which I deal with until I eventually break up with my girlfriend. 

This has made me avoid relationships until one day I got serious with a girl I had been seeing for a while. Immediately, though, I started thinking of one other girl. It caused me a lot of anxiety because I could never figure out why I was thinking of her, so I got into a cycle of constantly thinking of her. It distracted me of all parts of my life, and lead me to the point where my anxiety and fear of losing control of my thoughts made me have a mental breakdown. 

I have since received treatment and am doing a lot better than before, and I have a much better understanding of how to treat myself, but I still find myself hanging onto these old thoughts that have caused me anxiety, and I want to let go of them. I just get scared. I feel as though they have become a part of me and I cannot let them go. I don’t care for what they mean anymore, I just want to stop giving them so much attention and keep me from enjoying my life.

How do I let go of something that has held me back for a long time, and that I feel has become a part of me? Any advice would be appreciated.",18Dec2020,1

702,"(M14) I have seen a lot of videos on TikTok of men wearing crop tops and encouraging other men to wear them if they want to, as well as other inspirational posts about how clothes have no gender. I think I would look amazing in a crop top and I would love to wear one. 

I went to Target with my mom once and I picked out a crop top that I liked (it was nothing bad, just a slightly cropped black t shirt) and when I went to pay for it my mom quickly said ""You don't really think I'm gonna let you get that, do you?"" ""Crop tops are for girls."" Even though she clearly stated that it was my money and I could buy whatever I want with it. 

I asked my dad if he could take me to the store so I could buy one and he said the same thing but followed with ""I didn't raise you to act like a girl."" I am not transgender. I am still a male, and I know that for a fact.

707,"I've known this woman for a little over five years now. I asked her out once, but she'd just started dating someone, but we've remained friends since. We usually text once a month, and meet up for drinks (just the two of us) ever 3-4 months probably.

Well, a few weeks ago, she texts about 11pm. She's at a winery, says she was originally calling to ask for a ride but felt bad and said she'd drive. I said nonsense, I'd be more than happy to pick her up instead of her driving drunk, or even tipsy.

I get there, she's super grateful, runs up and hugs me, clearly a *little* tipsy. When we get in the car, she seems to sober up pretty quickly, and we talk.

When we get to her place, we just sit in the car talking, and she opens up that she and her current BF had a pretty serious conversation (not *quite* breaking up, it wasn't a fight, but she felt like he was always second-place to his friends, he'd often bail on her last-minute to hang out with them), and it sounded like kind like they were on the *cusp* of breaking up.

Well, she invites me up to her place, but when we get there, we wind up just talking for a few hours. She says she wound up meeting up with some old friend of hers that night at the winery (doesn't quite explain if it was a date or not; kinda got the impression that maybe it was).

The conversation never quite felt ""flirty"" between us, although she was sitting right next to me on her couch. I keep replaying the night, wondering if she was wanting me to make a move...?

Anyways, the night ends, I tell her it sounds like she's had kind of a heavy night, she should get some rest, and I go home. Next day I text, seeing how she's feeling, she says better. That was *just* before Thanksgiving, so I asked what her plans for the weekend were, she said they were going to her boyfriend's parents.

Anyways, I just text an emphatic ""Happy Thanksgiving!"" the day of, no reply (I do that every year, for all of my friends).

For some reason, I just... can't stop thinking about her now. I really thought I'd embraced that ""sure I'm attracted to her, but I just like being friends"". And really, I *love* being friends with her; she genuinely makes me laugh, we can have deep conversations but also joke around... I think I would rather hang out with her than anybody else.

But I feel almost like I'm on pins and needles, too. I broke down and texted yesterday, seeing what she's up to, and it just felt... ""different"". Like, if a coworker was texting. None of the jokey banter we usually have. And I'm just wondering, have I done something wrong? Was I supposed to ""make a move"" that one night? If she regretting having even called me, and is worried she sent mixed signals?

I don't know. I *do* know I'm definitely overthinking everything now, but... honestly, it's like after that night, some door opened up in my mind, where I'm constantly wondering ""what if we were *a thing*?""

I'm actually flying out today to see family, but all I can think is ""man, I'd really rather be spending time with &lt;her&gt;"".

At 32, I feel like I should be over these feelings. Hell, I've already been on two dates since, just trying to mentally ""move on"". But I still keep thinking about her, and wonder if there's something between us, or not, or if I've screwed anything up, or if even *asking* what her feelings are would screw things up even more?

I've been friends with a guy for almost 15 years. We had a really good friendship and we shared a lot with each other. After I graduated from college, I moved to another city for a job and we had so little contact with each other. During that time, he was still in college. After 2 years, he also graduated from college and he couldn't find a job for 2 years. 

During the beginning of that unemployment time, we were still good friends and still talking. After 2 years passed, he became very upset to everyone around him. Not just me, all of his friends. He thinks that we didn't care enough for him. Every time I find an open position in my company, I delivered his CV to our HR department and vouched for him but my company didn't accept him. 

In the end of that 2 years, he didn't talk with me at all. And during these days, I've found a better job in my old city. I said to my friends that I'm back to the city so they can let him know. Also my other 2 friend found a better job there. After he learned, he blocked my phone, blocked my Whatsapp, stopped following me on Instagram..... 

He didn't receive that news good. We've known each other for a long time and I expected him be happy for me. I get that he's still unemployed but I've tried to help him and it's not my fault. I don't believe that I deserve that. I still care about him, what should I do?",18Dec2020,1

And when I try to leave the conversation he FOLLOWS ME INTO MY ROOM so he can keep talking down at me. He goes in and knocks my stuff over and closes my tabs on my laptop all the while talking shit. And obviously, I get mad, and tell him to leave me alone and that he's being so annoying. And he gives me another spiel about how he's doing it ""for my own good"" and that he has to point out my mistakes so I can learn better. And I tell him that's fine but he's being annoying and condescending about it. And it becomes a back and forth that escalates to him throwing things at me and yelling loudly. 

I mostly just take it because I know he's stressed and hates himself, he spends nearly all day playing video games and sleeping and eating and gets nothing done. I understand that he's at a low point in life and can't get it together so I'm trying to be understanding but it's SO HARD. He picks fights with me almost daily and with everything going on I can't take it anymore. I try to ignore him but he butts into my business and lashes out on me. It's not fair, and my parents do fuck all to help me. 

Ik this mostly seems like a rant (because it is, I want to get this out of my system lol) but I would also like to get some advice on dealing with toxic people you can't really cut out of your life and also butts into your business?",18Dec2020,3
746,"But not in the way you'd think. Their social tact is perfectly normal and they don't say inappropriate things. However, the issue lies in the fact that they will say LITERALLY EVERYTHING they feel. They told me that I can't take it personally when they say that they're hurt by my actions sometimes because it's not meant to make me feel bad, or feel sorry.

But it's impossible for me to not feel guilty for hurting her feelings (which seems to be every time we see each other almost). We've been together for a over a third of a decade, and this has been ongoing throughout our entire relationship, so I've never truly felt adequate and I always feel like I'm doing something wrong. I know they can't control their feelings or the need to talk about them, but it makes it hard to be their partner. I love them, but I feel constantly bombarded by their dissatisfaction. I can't just listen to them tell me all these things I'm doing wrong and then pretend like it doesn't make me feel bad because she's ""just talking"".

What do I do? I truly don't know how to move past this and neither of us can afford counseling.

EDIT: I should mention that the way she talks about minor issues sounds EXACTLY the same with major ones. So even if she has a minor ""scrape"" and tells me about it, it sounds like I broke her heart. She acknowledges that most of the things that make me feel bad are minor.

Some people asked for examples, and tbh a lot of the time I don't understand what even happened. But, some that I can think of are:
- I rescheduled plans insensitively and made her feel uncared about
- I unintentionally began to speak over her (which is a ""me"" issue but we've had this talk before; I have ADHD so I don't realize I'm doing it. We've agreed that if she tells me I'm doing it I'll back off and apologize)
- Speaking in a way she misreads my tone
- Something I don't understand and she can't explain properly",18Dec2020,1

I'm (12M) currently listening to my parents screaming at my 17 yr old sister.

Background: Turns out my sister has been lying about finishing her homework for months, but since the teachers are accepting all late work for full points my parents are pushing her to get it done. The problem being that my sister doesn't pay attention in class and honestly, I am better at her subjects than she is. Now my parents barely sleep because they have resorted to finishing her homework for her, but they don't know much about her subjects either, so they google answers. Meanwhile my asshole of a sister is crying and pretending like she is the victim and my parents should be doing the homework for her. I'd honestly like to punch her in the face a few times, but am instead browsing Reddit nonstop. Didn't help that I just got the mail and everything on it says ""HaPpY hOlIdAyS"" somewhere on it, which sounds like a gigantic oxymoron. good times.

would like some advice for how to get out of this situation. any comments are appreciated.",18Dec2020,4

754,"I’ve never done this before so I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this or if formatting is weird. 

I (23F) live with my parents and brother (20M). I graduated college a year ago and have a full time job but I just don’t make enough money to move out yet. 

My parents should have gotten divorced long ago but I don’t think they ever will. Things weren’t so bad when we were younger but for at least the last 10 years it’s been rare to have a day go by where there hasn’t been some sort of fight. My mother is a good person and loves us but has some mental illness I think. I’m not educated enough when it comes to mental illness but at the very least I think she has major depression. She use to take Zoloft for it when I was younger but she has since stopped. I think there might be other things wrong too though because her temper has gotten worse over the years. 

When mom gets upset, she starts yelling and just says whatever’s on her mind. She’s called all of us “lazy f******”, “idiots”, “f****** dense”, and other things. She also says she could take a 2x4 across our heads. I know she doesn’t mean it and is just blowing off steam, but it still hurts to hear. 
I remember when I was a young teenager, maybe 14, mom and I got into an argument. I don’t remember what it was about but I do remember one thing she said. 
“F*** you, b****”
That was the first time she ever said anything like that to me. It still makes me cry when I think about it. 

I think it’s important to note that she is not physically abusive and I don’t think she ever would be. My mom has experienced a lot of hardship in her life, starting when she was young. Her ex-husband was also abusive to her, physically and mentally. I feel so terrible for her because she is a good, caring woman who didn’t/doesn’t deserve to have such a hard life. I understand why she acts the way she does. I know that trauma can cause people to act differently so I don’t blame her for how she is. I just don’t know what to do to help. 

When she starts yelling, we try to bite our tongues. Dad usually just stays quiet because he knows there’s no use in arguing back. She doesn’t listen, even if you try to calmly talk to her. She just yells over you. But sometimes we mess up and talk back which always makes things worse.

I try not to argue back but when I do, I always feel terribly guilty after. I remind myself that she’s had a hard life and never got the help she needed. I remind myself that she does love me even if it doesn’t feel like it sometimes. And I just hate myself for making her feel bad. My dad, brother, and I all add stress for mom that isn’t necessary. We all need to help around the house more and be more considerate. We’re also to blame for why she acts like this. 

But I’m also worried about my dad and brother too. She is so mean to my dad and he just stays quiet. He doesn’t let on too much but I know it has to hurt him. 
My brother, on the other hand, argues back sometimes. I get so mad at him for it because things would calm down faster if he just stopped talking. At the same time though, I know it’s hard to just shut up when you’re getting yelled at. 
My brother was/might still be suicidal. He told me that he put his shotgun in his mouth the other day. He then told me he knows he was stupid for doing it but I am just so afraid he will do it for real. Him  and I argue sometimes but overall, we care for each other a lot. We tell each other more than we’ve ever told anyone else because we can relate to each other. 

I want to emphasize that my mom is a good person. When she is not stressed, she is nice and fun to be around. She has a big heart. She’s just become increasingly more stressed over the years, partially due to us. After things calm down, she has said that she regrets saying mean things. I believe her. 

I’m just filled with so many emotions and I don’t know what to do anymore. My heart is just a big broken mess because I just want my family to love each other and I’m just so jealous of people who have normal relationships with their families. I know every family has problems but I don’t know if their problems are like this. I just don’t know. I feel so stupid because I’m 23 years old and have been dealing with this for at least half my life so I feel like I should know how to deal with it by now but I don’t. I still just want to curl up into a ball and die every time this happens. I try not to cry in front of anyone but I still cry a lot when I’m alone. I feel incredibly guilty because I know I should do better and I hate making my mom upset. But I also feel so angry when the yelling starts. I just wish we could talk about things without yelling. 

When my mom has been in a better mood, I’ve brought up therapy and how we all could use some. She has agreed that it could be good but is hesitant.

Another problem is money. I wish I could afford to pay for all of us to go to therapy but I just can’t and I don’t think my family can afford it either, especially now with COVID. 

I am at a point in my life where I am very unhappy. I hate my job, I’m going to be in debt for the rest of my life, and I live with a family that can’t get along. I know many people are in the same boat or have it worse but I just am not mentally strong enough to handle much more of this. 

I don’t think I would ever end my life but I’ve been thinking about it a lot more lately; how things would be different; where I might end up. 
I couldn’t do that to my family because even if we don’t get along, I know they love me and I love them. I just don’t know what to do to make things better. 

If any of you have advice, I would love to hear it. I am open to anything at this point. Thank you in advance.",18Dec2020,1
755,"Today, I’m sad on my graduation day not because of COVID-19 and not because I can’t walk across the stage but because I feel like I have no one to celebrate with or no one cares. I also feel like the timing sucks. I graduate today cum laude with a bachelors of science degree... And I’m spending my day alone in bed with my dog. My parents gave me a basic congratulations on the phone since I’m out of state and my friends are saying congrats but that’s all. Idk maybe I’m expecting too much? My boyfriend graduated today as well and his friends took him out. I only have a few friends and they dropped out of college due to circumstances but we talked on FaceTime for a little but maybe I was expecting them to come over or something. I also was informed by my landlord I have 30 days to find a new place since he won’t be extending my roommates or my lease and I have a part time job so I can’t even shop or anything to make me feel better and won’t be starting full time until after the holiday so that check will have to go straight towards a new place that I have to rush and find. This also means I can’t even afford to get a cap and gown now to at least make it feel like I actually did it. During my time throughout college, I’ve been through academic probation as a freshman, domestic violence situation where I was almost killed, losing friends, a miscarriage and my house being burglarized while I was away taking all of my stuff that I worked hard for. I think this moment is triggering a lot of baggage I have and I also think the fact that my boyfriend has a stronger support system and friends that are close to him makes it easier for me to feel like my life is crap. I would love to talk to him about it but it’s his moment too so I don’t want to ruin it with my dark mood. I just feel like I can’t even celebrate or enjoy an accomplishment and I don’t know how to get out of this funk. Any advice on what I can do to feel better? 

TLDR: graduated from college cum laude today. Feel like crap instead of feeling like i accomplished something since I have a lot of terrible things happening to me.

758,Hey everyone! This is my first time ever actually posting on Reddit and I’m in a bit of a pickle and not sure what to do. I’ll try to explain everything as short as possible. So I made a tinder account with a random picture with a good looking dude I got off the internet (Ik it’s weird asf but I really wasn’t trynna catfish anyone). I was trying to find my buddy’s girlfriend to see if she was on there and I could match with her because they have been having some issues and he asked me to help. In the process of swiping to find his girlfriends tinder profile (which I ended up finding) I ended up matching with this cute girl my age who lives pretty close and it sucks I wasn’t on my actual tinder . I wasn’t messaging any of the other people I matched with but she ended up messaging me first and we talked for quite a while. She ended being a really nice and genuine girl and I’m really interested in meeting up with her but idk how I would being that she thinks I look totally different. Now I’m a pretty confident guy and think I’m pretty good looking so I’m not worried about that. I just don’t really know how to hit her up. She gave me her snap and Instagram so I could always wait a few days and just hit her up  on my real socials but I don’t know if that would be to sus. What should I do ? Thanks!,18Dec2020,2

760,"I (I'm 19) work with my sister(in her late thirties), who is the mother to two children. One is a teenage boy about 16-17 the other is a teenage girl 13-14. Our house has about 9 people in it which is crowded for a small house like ours, but we make due with it. While on break with my sister, I overheard her speaking to her husband about how to help my nephew because he recently told her and his sister that he had planned to kill himself for the longest time. The only reason he didn't go through with it was because a friend talked him down.

I was horrified because my nephew is my best friend. He was the one I spent my time with the most, he would always play games with me, him and his sister would protect me from bullies(Weird right? the older kid needing help from the younger ones in his family?). I noticed that he's become closed off recently much more detached from the world, and even his family, say his sister. I chalked it up due to the death of my mother which had occurred last year plus I wasn't in the right mental space either, my mother and I didn't get along very well and at the time I was suffering from a lot of guilt. However my thoughts began to change when he informed my and my middle sister (his aunt late twenties) that he didn't feel anything. I didn't want to push it because I know that when it comes to mental health, you can't force someone to open up.

Nephew and his sister didn't have it easy growing up. He and his sister were heavily pushed to do well in school, otherwise they would be grounded etc (His mother had lightened up about it in recent years as she saw both him and her daughter constantly worrying about their grades.). Not only that but for a long time, he felt as though there was a bias towards his sister as his family never punished him and his sister equally. And I'm not going to pretend I was great with him either. I would constantly get into arguments with him about the stupidest of shit.

I need some advice please. I want to help him, but I also don't want to break that trust he has with his mother. I don't want him to think that his mother is spilling his thoughts to others. Yes I'm aware my sister should not have shared this info because it's the kind of thing that pushes people with mental health away, but please don't be rude to her. She's a mother whose never had to deal with her own mental issues growing up (Both my sisters are tough people who went through a lot of shit. She knows she's partially to blame how my nephew is feeling right now.), so she wouldn't even know how to handle her son's. How can I help my nephew without telling him I overheard his mother?

761,"I joined a discord server, invited through an irl friend, and started chatting with people on there. I got close to a few, whom I dmed personally and chatted with. However, there was this one guy who is around my age (According to what he says and from photos he's sent) that we both shared similar ethnicities and instantly clicked because of it. This has been very recently, though, around a week or two, probably, but we chatted everyday. Not long conversations, but a steady stream of messages. And I'm not sure why, but I get a sick feeling in my stomach whenever I think about him. I'm not sure why.

762,"So I have this coworker. She’s cool and we lived near each other so we travelled together. I got to know her and started to really like her. 
I eventually told her that and it wasn’t reciprocated and I did my best to just keep it moving. I suppose I distanced myself a bit and tried to manage the situation. 
She then confided in me that she was dating another coworker which honestly sucked but that’s life you know?
I did my best to not exactly stop being a friend but keep a safe distance for myself. I moved closer to work so we stopped getting the subway and it made it easier.
Now a couple months back I was still doing my whole arms length thing and we were at a birthday party and She showed up with the guy she was dating and looked pretty sad. But I was still in arms length mode. There were a lot of people so it was honestly pretty easy. But eventually we ended up sitting next to each other and I asked how she was. She said not good and started crying. Her dad was diagnosed with cancer and had been given a short time to live. We went for a walk and hugged it out and she started telling how things with the other guy weren’t great and how she felt guilty about me. 
At that point I honestly couldn’t keep the whole arms length thing going. She’s my friend above all else. I’ve been through enough crap to know how important it is to not feel alone. I wasn’t gonna do that. 
It’s been tough on her and in whatever small way I’ve tried to be supportive. During this she ended up moving closer to work which meant she ended up living about 20 mins away from me. 
Her dad passed about 2 months ago and she’s naturally found it hard. We’ve hung out more and generally spent more time together. But the reality of the situation is that I do like her. Whatever progress I made before towards overcoming the feelings went out the window and I’m in that weird awful place where logically I just want to be the sort of friend I would want if this awful thing happened to me. But on the other hand there’s this little voice reading into every text cute gesture or hangout. over analysing things throwing out what ifs and maybes. 
Right now I’m honestly kind of struggling myself. Bad time of year for me. Family drama and issues. There’s a lot going on in my head and I’m doing my best to stay above water. But I don’t know if I should just man up and deal with it. Or take a huge step back. She’s not okay and I want to be the friend she needs but honestly it just kinda hurts my heart at this point. Things like not replying to texts or sitting separately or not waiting to the get the subway seem like such a huge statement but I dunno what else I can do to pull away. It doesn’t help that I can’t really do anything or go anywhere either.

764,"So recently in September I had gone to university with the intention of “trying out” engineering to see if I liked it because I had taken Grade 13 to take higher level math and science courses to become eligible for those type of programs. I initially had the plan that I would become and engineer(not sure which field) then if I didn’t really enjoy it or still wanted to become a HS teacher, then I could still go to teachers college to become one. But because of all the online learning as well as immense levels of stress going into this year, I could not focus on my schoolwork and ended up withdrawing from classes. I then decided to try to very much solidify what I wanted to do with my life, what major and career I wanted as an adult. Through copious amounts of research I have not came to any conclusion.

My problem is, I don’t really know myself that well, from my perspective I would realistically enjoy any career that I do, I could see myself being an engineer, a nurse, a police officer, a programmer, social worker, tradesman. Literally nothing is off the table for me. 


I’d say my dream job is something unrealistic like becoming a youtuber, being a famous comedian or actor, something in the entertainment industry as Ive always been interested in entertaining others. Although I know this is a risky field and it scares me potentially never getting a good enough job to support myself or build a net worth. Scary indeed.

Apart from entertainment I definitely know one thing, I want to become rich one day. I see non entertainment work as work and that whatever I do I would realistically like to be paid as well as possible and also have some skills that could allow me to start a business or make a lot more money on the side so I can just build my net worth as quick as possible and FIRE comfortably as young as possible so I can realistically do whatever the hell i want to do with my time. I hate the idea of working until I’m in my mid 60s to retire, that seems like no way to live. I’ve considered entering the military, putting in my 25 years and retiring that way with a 50% pension that would allow me to live comfortably and free from age 45 onward.

I posted this in the confessions subreddit but i got trolled. Im hoping for some genuine replies here

I really dont want to jump to any conclusions but i fear my mom maybe having an affair with our landlord

Now  for context i live in Pakistan. I have 3 siblings.Me my mom and Dad all  live in a 2 bedroom apartment.My dad is currently unemployeed. While my  mom works at a laundry service as the receptionist.Now we are a  conservative family. My mom wears a full burka whenever she is  outside.Now one thing that has always disturbed me is what when ever my  mom is outside guys try to check her out. Although she is totally  covered in a black burqa he female areas still kinda budge out. She is a  healthy woman and has allot of female body fat.

Now  this isnt something to be ashmed of in my opinion but what bothers me  is how guys eyes are always glued to her behind. Seeing their lusty eyes  follow my mom's ass makes me really angry but i just ignore them. My  mom never seemed to notice all the extra attention she receives but i do  when im with her and i dont like it one bit. I feel these perverts and  objectifying my mom in their filthy minds.One creep that really gets on  my nerves is our land lord. He is a fat pervert.Whenever it is time to  collect rent he usually comes at times when my dad isnt home. Now  instead of coming, collecting the rent and leaving like any normal  landlord he instead asks for tea.The jerk is always checking out my mom.  His eyes are always rotating in his eyes when he is infront of my mom  as if he is scanning her. Infact a couple of times i have noticed even  him staring at my mom's ass like a mindless zombie when she has her back  turned. Unlike the other creeps in our area this guy comes to our house  and has tea with my mom and interacts with her.Now a few days back i  was sitting im my room watching T.V. We have 2 bathrooms. One in my room  (my siblings share this room wid me) and one in my parents room.

Now  as i was saying i was in my room watching tv. My dad was in the shower  in the other room. My mom was out at the time with my youngest sibling  to buy some groceries.Soon my mom and brother came home.My mother rushed  to my room. Still in her burqa not even removing the face veil and  entered my bathroom in a hurry, since the other bathroom was occupied by  my dad.So nothing unusal here right?

But  here is where my suspicions began. What watching tv i could hear faint  sounds of picture snapping from the bathroom. This was strange as why  would my mom be taking pictures while using the toilet ? However i  assumed that maybe she is watching some video on her phone or  something.Soon i heard the sound of the flush my mom cameout, and washed  her hands. By this point i had forgotten the camera sound. My little  brother asked for her phone so he can play Pubg Mobile to which she  responded. ""I dont know where it is maybe i left it on the table""This  part struck me. Becuz i knew she was lying. I literally heard sounds  from the bathroom. The thing that puzzeled me was that why would she lie  about something so trivial ?I said nothing at that point. My mom then  took off her face veil and went into the kitchen and the day went on as  usual At night out of curiosity i took my moms phone after she had gone  to sleep. I know this sounds unethical and me invading her privacy but  what i found shook me to my core.My mom was indeed taking pics in the  bathroom and may no one have to see their mothers the way i saw mine.  She had taken literal explicit pics of herself in the bathroom.While  thankfully none of her pictures showed any of her private parts or even  her face for the matter as her face veil was still on and she probably  didnt take it off in the bathroom or else it would have gotten wet but  those picture did indeed show her nude thighs and legs.

I  literally felt ashamed beyond words seeing toilet selfies of my mom on  her phone. I really wish i hadnt check her phone and let this thing  pass.

But since i did see what i  did it raised more questions than answers. Why did she take those  pictures. I opened her whatsapp and checked her chats.Again i know this  is wrong for me to do but i was dying of curiosity at this point. I kept  scrolling until i reached the land lords chats.What was strange about  his window was that all the chats on her whatsapp with him were deleted.  Despite the fact that it showed that they chatted everyday.I checked  the chats at the timing when my mom was in the bathroom. I was watching a  serial on Geo T.V at that time which is on from 8 to 9 so that was the  time when my mom was in the bathroom.And the worst of my fears came true  when i saw that the chats from that time was present but deleted.At  this point i knew those pictures were probably for him. I took a screen  shot of the deleted chat and sent it to myself.

Now  im so confused about what is going on.Is my mom really exchanging  sexually suggestive pictures of herself to our creepy landlord ? Could  this mean she may be having an affair ? This incident has made to so  much paranoid that i dont know what to make of it.

Why is my mom taking explicit pictures of herself ?

Why are all the chats in the landlords window deleted ?

Am i over thinking this or is my mom really possibly having an affair with our landlord ?",18Dec2020,1

But there's this really interesting pattern in my life I've been noticing, when it comes to art, it's became easy street (at the moment) recently I was worried about having a degree for a job, and someone posted about art careers and having a degree doesn't matter, I didn't even ask the person about degrees or anything (my point is it looked like life itself was telling me where to go at that point) then, I got my first commission not too long into my art career, (what the heck, I hadn't even been active online too much) and then recently I had my favorite artist follow my art account, and she even said she liked my art (I'm still fangirling over this) I know I'm probably just wanting life to tell me to become an artist, so maybe I'm fantasizing about it and it's making me consider that career path.

She has been acting a little flirty around him too and that has made me a little worried. They text a lot with each other and do a lot of activities together.

791,"Hi reddit, I am almost daily thinking about this question. Basically there are two completely different lifes that I think of when look into the future. 

There is one where I stay with my GF who as I said in the title is the best woman that I can imagine. In this life I stay with her and we will marry and have kids and have our ups and downs. My GF is the most loving, kind and sweet person that I know and she will be an awesome mother. We will go on vacation once or twice a year and will live a kinda ""normal"" life.

The other life is what I am dreaming of. I always dreamt of working abroad and travelling around the world. I know that right now is the worst possible moment to do that cause of covid but this decision has to be made sometime and it's stuck in my head and I can't stop thinking about it.   
I am currently working in a company that has offices all around the world and they already told me that it is possible to work in a different country. So I basically just have to tell them that I want to do that and they will help me arrange everything and support me. So I am so close to achieving my dream and do what I always wanted to do. 

The problem is that my relationship would definitly break when I leave to work in another country. 6 months after I got together with my GF I was doing an internship for my bachelors degree in another country and she only stayed with me after I told her that I will come home every second weekend. It was only like 6 hours with the bus so it wasn't too bad but that's not an option when I want to work in another continent where I would have to take a plane for \~8 hours to go back. 

Kinda TL;DR  
So here I am with the best and most loving GF by my side that I can imagine with a dream in my head that I am so close to make real and I have no idea what I wanna do. Stay with my GF and have a nice and ""normal"" family life or leave my girlfriend and live my dream. Pls help me.",18Dec2020,1

I know I should be keeping up with hobbies and bettering myself, but that can only go so far without feeling that emptiness of not having any obligations.

So I have been thinking about making a YouTube channel recently. It would be nice to start making videos about things I like just for the enjoyment of it. My thought process on why I think YouTube would be a great place to find a community is because it’s virtual, and can extend to after the pandemic: I would make videos, and people would watch the videos and comment on them, and I can find a sense of community through that. If they’re watching my videos, they must like whatever I’m making a video of more or less.

I would like to start a gaming channel, and I watch a lot of gaming Youtubers. It seems like a lot of them started their YouTube channels and found friends through YouTube (usually they find other creators to befriend and they make videos together, for example). It seems like a fun hobby that can help me find new friends that have similar interests to me. 

I probably shouldn’t go into it with expectations, but if there are any Youtubers here, what has been your experience? Have you found friends through YouTube?

I hi I’m 18 and a female I think I’m in love with my best friend. we have been friends for around six years and throughout the years we’ve gotten extremely close, I tell him everything and we have never had a major disagreement or fought( and not in an unhealthy way we are just extremely alike) . 

When he was around 14 he had a massive crush on me and ask me out but I said no because I didn’t have feelings for him at the time. I think I realised I found it hard to develop feelings for people in general. I’ve only ever had one boyfriend and it didn’t work out because I didn’t have Real feelings for him. Anyways, around two years ago my best friend got a girlfriend and I was very happy for him and the three of us are good friends now but recently I’ve realised how much in love with him I am. 

I never thought it was romantically but now I’m realising  it is and I don’t know what to do about it. He is the only person I’ve ever clicked with this much and honestly I see us getting married or something I can’t imagine my life without him. 

On my birthday this year him and his girlfriend broke up, but he came over to my house after to celebrate which made her extremely jealous. I felt really bad as I am good friends with her and love her to death and don’t want to be a home wrecker type person at all, that’s not me. After they broke up she became extremely suicidal, she was very depressed to begin with but he is one of the only things still getting her through the days. His mental health was being affected by this and I could tell but he loves her, he’s told me. 

They ended up just taking a break and getting back together. It kind of upset me which is bad to say because she got a lot better after they got back together. It is selfish of me but I still have hope he likes me. I found out yesterday it took him six months of a relationship with her to get the crush on me. 

I broke his heart already when we were 14-15 and I don’t know what he would say if I told him about my feelings. I’m not sure if I should ignore them and hope it’s just a silly crush that will go away or tell him and risk ruining our friendship or his relationship. I would be so scared to do that because she would hate me and get so bad mentally, plus I would be hated by some of my friends if I did that. 

I don’t want to be a home wrecker and I wouldn’t want to be but it’s getting harder to just be around him all the time because of these feelings. I’m not sure what I should do?",18Dec2020,4

799,"So, a little (but fairly long) back story at how it all began..
Roughly around 3 years ago I met this guy online and literally his first words to me were ""I am married, I have a wife and a beautiful daughter so nothing funny."" I was completely okay with that seeing as I just enjoy a good chat and all. He'd send me pictures of his ""wife and daughter"" almost daily and I'd always be polite with my replies and occasionally help him ""choose presents"" for them. 
Fast forward a few weeks, I can clearly see him hitting on me/flirting with me. I pinned it as him just being super friendly. Then it started getting slightly weird, for example he'd constantly be demanding pictures. I thought he meant anything random but apparently ""his rule"" was that the pictures either have to be a selfie (I hate taking selfies) or they have to include a single body part of me (hands, legs, arms, fingers, etc..). Another weird thing was he kept asking for my clothes size, shoe size, underwear size (WTF?) and even my ring size???? He also started asking what my family likes and their preferences and such...
Fast forward another couple weeks he decides to ""confess"" by saying he isn't actually married and that all the pictures he's been sending me were actually his cousin's wife and daughter. And I'm like ""...okay...."" then he carries on by saying that now that he's free from any lies he's going to start a full on frontal attack of wooing/flirting.....
I noped out of there, basically ghosted him and then blocked him on the messenger app.
3 years later. I see his username float around so I decided to give ONE of his post a silent like (it was a picture of one his family member's new puppy, who am I to say no to a cute puppy).
Bad. Idea. 
He starts talking to me and is being really, really, really weird. He starts off with saying that it's been exactly 3 years, 48 days and alpha hours since I last contacted him. And in the very next sentence he goes ""Don't worry, I love you but only as a friend.""
I wish that was true. 
Because right now he's just guilt tripping me, like he expects me to remember everything he told me 3 years ago and if I don't he starts saying ""Am I really that easy to forget? I'm sorry for not being the man you wanted... But it is technically your fault for suddenly disappearing on me but I know I should be the one to apologise for not being the man you wanted me to be.."" 
I have been trying my best to be so polite to him but he's pushing me to the limit. 
Any time I use any kind of heart emoji he keeps saying stuff like ""Oh so is that heart for me? How thoughtful of you my love, I'm so glad you think of me that way my love."" If I say no it was most definitely not for him he goes (without fail too) ""Can't it be a happy misunderstanding my dear? I mean you did disappear on me for just over 3 years and it did make me so very lonely.."" 
He's also demanding pictures/selfies of me and I have been saying ""No thanks"" for a week but he keeps saying (again without fail) ""But I sent you pictures of me so you should compensate by sending me at least 3 pictures of you to make up for the fact that you disappeared on me for over 3 years...""
GAHHHHHH!! 
I've had my fair share of dealing with annoying assholes online but this guy just won't take ""No"" for an answer and he keeps bringing up the ""...but you disappeared on me for 3 years..."" BS.
I get the feeling if I pull off another disappearing act on him this time he won't leave me alone.
This past week I have been trying my best to draw the line by saying stuff I know he won't like and liking stuff he hates. Each time I do that he just goes ""Stop joking around my love, I know you're just teasing me and this is all foreplay."" 
God I have no idea how much I can handle being sarcastically polite.... Any advice, please?

Mind you he lives in a completely different country from me (HALLELUJAH!) and this is all happening online. Also I've been taught to be polite to anybody ever since I was a kid and it's not something I can switch off easily.",18Dec2020,1

But this is still happening so I really need some kind of advice as my parents and I are sick of dealing with this. This morning he actually filed an assault report against me which you can read about in my post under legal advice. My mom just said she does not want to take legal action though, so I’m no longer going forward with my own report of him. Anyway, please let me know if you’d like clarification on anything! 

My [F19] dad [M68] is a Vietnamese war veteran who’s suffered a lot of trauma, like seeing his dad get killed by a bomb, getting shot in the leg + being forced into a refugee camp at 20, believing the rest of his family was killed while he was here in the US (he ended up reconnecting with them 30 yrs later). So much so that he ended up taking out his frustrations on my mom [F65] and my brother [M26]. I know my dad was a pretty shit husband/dad before I was born, as I would hear a lot of terrible stories about the physical and verbal abuse that occurred in the house. It got less crazy over time, my dad tends to treat me as his little girl though, so my brother often got the worse end of the stick when it came to abuse. But I still witnessed some pretty messed up shit. My mom tried divorce a few times, but in the end my parents always got back together because of financial issues, and also my mom and I still cared about him to an extent. After all, he worked really hard to keep paying for the house and the cars and school etc. 

Fast forward to now and my dad is retired, mellowed.  I think what really helped was him reconnecting with his family. I don’t want to be one to excuse abuse, which is ironic because that’s exactly what I seem to be doing here. But my mom is fine with him now, and that’s all I care about. My parents actually live pretty happily I would say. They’re old now, so I think both of them just wanna settle down and live a quiet, comfortable rest of their years. The issue now though, is my brother. 

He suffered a lot more because of what my dad did, and it took a big toll on his mental health. He dropped out of high school around his third year after getting caught with heroin. For a while he was basically a hermit, never leaving his room. Then he turned to more/heavier drugs and became aggressive and hard to control. There was even a couple of times where police had to be involved since he got too violent. Threats were frequent, whether it be to kill himself or kill our family. I distinctly remember a time where he chased me out of the house with a knife after I defended my mom, who he was swearing at. He would also manipulate my mom, and financially abuse her, i.e. use up her card without permission. He was always in and out of jail/rehab at this point. 

Eventually he got “better” after one of the many rehab visits, but really he just returned to his hermit lifestyle for a couple more years. Now, he’s 26 and still lives at home, but he’s recently been motivated to become rich “like Trump”, so he’s been going out for “business” every day. We were initially happy for him (not happy that he wanted to be like Trump but that’s aside the point ha) as he seemed to have finally found a purpose to life. But then his aggro personality made a reappearance, and he’s once again financially + emotionally manipulating my mom and me. He even tried to commit fraud on her birthday by maxing out my mom’s balance and telling the bank that the transaction wasn’t his. 

He’s also been in various car accidents over the years, some of which left the car my mom most recently lent him completely unusable. Needless to say we don’t really trust him with cars anymore, so he resorts to asking me to drive him around all day or asking that I buy him Ubers. And if my mom doesn’t have money to give him then it comes out of my pocket. He currently owes me around $500. 

Anddddddd he’s out 24/7 god knows where, and doesn’t wear a mask though my mom has asked him countless times to. He won’t even self quarantine or wear a mask inside the house at the very least. Literally jeopardizing my parents’ health, as well as my grandma’s (she lives with us).

You might ask why my mom and I don’t just tell him to stop/leave/whatever. The reason is because when he doesn’t get what he wants, he lashes out and either 1) yells at us/calls us degrading slurs, 2) threatens suicide or indirectly threatens us by saying he has lots of gang/mafia friends that would kill for him, and/or 3) brings up his abusive childhood and blames my mom for staying with my dad. When my dad speaks up, my brother threatens to kill him for what’s he’s done in the past. 

Really sorry for the long post I tried to condense it as much as I could but there’s just so many factors/stories/details it’s hard to explain in a few sentences. Any advice on what to do, or even just words of comfort would be really appreciated though. Also, is it right for my brother to use my dad as a reason for acting the way he does? I understand that he is the root of my brother’s troubles but I’m not sure if he can use that as an excuse for how badly he treats all of us now. But idk hhh that’s why I’d like to hear what you guys have to say.",18Dec2020,1

I’m f15 and for the past year and a half I’ve had this history teacher who creeps me out but I don’t know why. He’s a friendly and chill teacher who hasn’t done anything wrong but for some reason I’m scared of him. I know it sounds dumb but I just keep thinking he has done ulterior motives and that he’s secretly a pedo and I feel really bad about it. At first I tried to ignore it but I only realised how bad this fear of being alone with him was until today when I got to class early And I peaked into the room to see nobody was there beside him so I circled the whole school like twice until some other people went into his classroom. At one point I began finding it hard to look him in the eye too because I just look at him and start freaking out slightly (he’s like 6”6 and lanky so he looks and reminds me of slender man or some serial killer cause he has this unnerving look in his eye ) That sounds terrible.

I feel really bad because he’s just some some normal guy trying to teach kids history but at the same time I can help but we weary around him. This has happened with other male teachers before but it was never this severe and I don’t know why it’s happening.",18Dec2020,1

I have a learners permit.. or whatever they’re called when you can only drive with another adult in the car. I don’t know how to ride a bike nor do I have one, not many buses are running because of COVID but even when they’re running, my parents hate me going on buses and allow it minimally. Most of the destinations are so far from me that walking will take over an hour. My parents don’t want to drive me because they’re way too busy. 

So I guess my main question is: what can I do? I need money bad and I want to start going to the gym as soon as they re-open but as you can imagine an hour walk would be very demotivating.

812,"I (24F) love my little sister (8F) and we get on great. Four months ago I temporarily moved back home after traveling for a year, and I have an apartment set up for January. 
Whenever I’m home, most of my time is spent with my little sister. Whenever I’m off work, she will want to hang out with me 24/7. Don’t get me wrong, I love spending time with my sister, however I feel like I can’t relax until she has been put to bed. Whether it’s playing games, doing crafts or just watching a movie, I can not find a moment to do anything by myself until she goes to bed. Occasionally she will play by herself or my mom will give her something to do, but there are many hours in a day. 

I feel bad for not wanting to spend time with her, because I love her so much. I’ve always wanted children but now I’m questioning whether I’d be a good mom, since I’m already tired of looking after my little sister. 

I’ve been stood down from work this week until January because of Corona so it’s been a lot of child time these last few days. Maybe its just dawning on me that I’ll be spending all my time babysitting. Any ideas of how I can manage my time while I’m home? Or any ideas of what I can DO with her that could be fun for both of us?

So, since then I got a nice job actually! I make $14hr and it has its downfalls sometimes ( a lot of coworker drama, guests being rude or crazy, etc. ) but im honestly just happy to have a job. So, I decided to stay in the area that Im in now, even after i graduate from college so i can keep my job and have some stability. 

What’s killing me now is bills and im just confused on how im supposed to live a normal life? My gross biweekly pay is $750-$800 but I get my check and it comes down to like $600-$650 after taxes. My car insurance is like $250, groceries cost me $30-40/week, gas is $30-40 to fill up. God forbid I order a burger one night or drive a little further than usual. And this week is me and my boyfriends birthdays, christmas, drive 3hrs home + tolls to help my mom then new years like.... how is anyone expected to live if you’re one emergency away from 3/4 of your check being gone??

Anyway what I need is like some adult insight on is how Im supposed to work out rent. (Since I’ll still need to move in the spring). If i get $600 biweekly, that’s only $1200 a month. Rent here for one person is about $800 for something moderate, 1,000-1200 if you’d like a nice place.

$800 rent means $400 biweekly from my check, then $100 for utilities and $125 for insurance... $625 total biweekly not including food, gas, gym membership, even a 24 case of water, nothing. So I dont get it, what can I do???

Each time the driver comes they say it was placed online or over the phone, and the weird part is they all have the exact name of one of my family member’s, phone number, and address so I really hoped it was a weird coincidence but they got it all right.

So what should we do now? We have been monitoring our bank account apps, emails, but we’ve been really weirded out by it. We even checked with friends and family to see if they’ve been trying to surprise us with pizza, but it was nobody really. 

If anybody has experience with this I’d appreciate some help. I know it’s weird and I wouldn’t think too much of it, but I feel bad because these drivers are making food and using a lot of gas to come out here when everybody in the house didn’t make any order at all. 

Which is why we’re trying to figure out if it’s just someone pranking us, which is awful considering that those pizza places are the ones being affected.

So what is the next step we should do or precautions to take? If it keeps happening would they ban us from trying to get delivery or something because of this?",18Dec2020,1
819,"I (21f) am constantly coming back and forth between my home and my apartment at school. I’d say I live home half the year and at school half the year. When I come home obviously I’m with my family which consists of my mom, my dad, my best friend Husky named tango, and then there’s my 24 yr old brother. Now of course I’ve lived with him my whole life for the most part. Everything that hes done while growing up he still does and now it’s driving me crazy and I can tell it’s driving my parents crazy as well. The other day my dad literally had a fit of rage because my brother is driving him crazy by not doing *basic* household chores, like walking the dog, laundry. Just basic stuff.

For background, me and him both have ADHD, we’re both on the same medication. The difference is I take it and he doesn’t. I’ve learned in the past the effects of skipping my medication, nothing serious, but there’s a noticeable difference on how you operate day to day. He doesn’t take it, no specific reason, he just doesn’t feel like it. And I can’t even tell if it’s being off the meds or just who he is that’s driving us nuts. I’m just gonna make a list of the shit he does:

- Goes into my room and takes my stuff like lighters and other things. I buy a certain thing in bulk when I’m at school so when I come home I can share with friends and it will last me a very long time, I get migraines, I feel like it can be guessed what it is. He always is stealing that. He recently has taken all my beer, I don’t really drink much, so beer and wine I usually have a lot of that I buy WITH MY MONEY. he’s always taking it and I just don’t have the money to keep buying things because my brother takes them.
- when he pees it gets all over the toilet seat and he doesn’t wipe it up (me and him share a bathroom)
- is ALWAYS coming to my room and knocking on the door, I don’t care normally but I need space and it’s nearly 20 times a day just to come in and bug me
- I have a juul (I know it’s bad I’m working on quitting) he is constantly asking me for it and he’ll hold it over my head if I ask him something , EX. I’ll ask him to move the car he uses as it’s blocking mine in the driveway and he won’t do it unless I give him my juul and he will RIP the shit out of it. 
- uses my bathroom towels, pretty clear which ones are mine, I use mine consistently until I have to wash it, hes just too lazy to wash his own, and I can be a germaphobe, it doesn’t really get in the way of anything but this kind of stuff is where my line it

- we each get one side of the sink to ourselves, he leaves dirty plates and dishes and empty contact lense cases all over the place and when he shaves at the sink he doesn’t clean it up
- he is incredibly loud, slams doors in the very early AM and the middle of the night, he has a TV in his room and plays it very very loudly. 
- is extremely irresponsible, you can’t really trust him to do anything and it worries me with my dog. We have strict procedures on how we handle our husky. We love him to pieces and if he sees an open door he will dart out of it before you can even blink. He’s a very mischievous dog, but we love him and he loves us. We let him in our fenced backyard with a very long lead line, the fence isn’t exactly the most secure, my brother with let him outside without the lead line, and is incredibly negligent when he walks the dog and takes him on hikes. It literally scares the shit out of my as this dog is considered to be mine by my parents. It’s made me cry before about his negligence as it would ruin me if anything happened to the dog. 
- me and him get a set allowance a month, my mom doesn’t want me getting a job (yea I know) as she wants me to focus on school and getting my business started up, my brother on the other hand,JUST got a job recently in his field, it won’t pay much right now. And he hasn’t gotten a paid job since freshman year of highschool, I’ve been working multiple jobs at once since highschool. My brother has failed so many classes just by being negligent and irresponsible that he’s just graduated this semester, he’s been at his college since he was 18-19 . And no it wasn’t just because of majoring issues. He’s taken summer courses every year, it runs my parents dry and even though they say they have enough money I feel so bad . He’s constantly running out of money because he doesn’t know how to manage it. I felt bad about getting my birthday/hannukah gift because it was so expensive but also basically what is letting me start my own business and do schooling from home (I’m a double art major in glass, they got me my own torch) my mom says dont be ridiculous and that they’re investing in me and whatever I need they will get. But it’s given me so much guilt. 

- he doesn’t listen to my parents. This is usually just an edgy teen thing, but my parents will ask him very nicely to do something or advice on what to do and he will literally just ignore it. EX me and my dad were going to Home Depot to buy wood for my new studio in the garage, we have to take the big car because the wood won’t fit in the other car. He takes the dog on a hike 15 minutes later after my dad tells him not to take the white truck, what does he do? He takes the white truck.  

- he lies about a lot of obvious things. 
-is incredibly inconsiderate of others space and time
- extremely impulsive, I’m afraid he will mess with something in my studio, the equipment is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND EXPENSIVE. And when I say dangerous, I mean could blow up the whole block dangerous. His impulsivity will not give a fuck about that though. 

Anyway I could go on the list for a long time. And it’s very worth noting that EVERYTHING I listed on this, we’ve talked to him about, everything, multiple times. My mom even got involved when he was taking the thing that I pay for to share with friends, we literally have conversations about this stuff on a monthly basis. He’s driving all of us insane with his antics acting like he runs the house and he can do whatever he wants, sitting around literally all hours of the day on video games. I just don’t know what to do. I really don’t. And I can’t keep living like this",18Dec2020,2

He's been through many doctors and has had multiple tests done on his stomach, his throat, and even some brain scans and cat scans. They've found nothing. He's been prescribed pills to fight the nausea and vomiting, but that just causes more nausea and vomiting. Anything he eats or drinks is likely to come back up shortly after, and he's recently passed out in the bathroom.

825,"No, I’m not complaining about the snow that inevitably gets pushed into the driveway as the plow drives by. The plow piles snow on my driveway. I live on street A. Street B is perpendicular to my street. The end of street B is directly across from my driveway. So, when it snows the plow comes down street B and pushes it across street A onto the town sidewalk and driveway. I understand when there’s a lot of snow there’s not much they can do so I don’t mind about the sidewalk. But I obviously care about my driveway being blocked by a massive snow bank. I don’t think they knowingly do this, so what can I do to make sure that they know my driveway is there? 

I thought of some solutions that have not been successful. 
#1- I have tried putting a car at the end of the driveway, which works, but since street B is at a bit of a decline cars have slid through the stop sign and into my yard before. I don’t want to risk it. 
#2- Call the town/talk to the person plowing. I don’t think this would be much help because the people plowing my street are not town employees. Also it is a different person every storm, so I would have to tell them every storm and I’m usually not home. 
#3- Make a sign that tells them my driveway is there. I did this for the last storm. Admittedly, the sign was dinky and I don’t know how visible it was for them. They either didn’t see it or ignored it. I’m thinking I should make a bigger, more noticeable sign. But during the last storm the sign just got buried by snow from their plow so I’m worried that may happen again. 
#4- I do have my driveway plowed. But it’s still an issue because I work during snowstorms, so I usually leave before my driveway is plowed. Also the pile has gotten so big before that the plow couldn’t get through it. 

I also do not want to put anything directly in the driveway because I don’t want to make my plow guy have to trudge through snow to move it.

TL;DR at the end. 

I [19F, US] have been asked to take a freelance interpreting assignment in a nearby community. We live in a rural area, and I’m the client’s last resort. It’s for a job orientation. I’m comfortable with the language I need to interpret and I *love* doing it, and if I lived alone I’d do it in a heartbeat. 

Herein lies the problem. The assignment is in a nursing facility/senior care center. These places in my area have been hit hard by the coronavirus. The facility is offering to be very accommodating, and it’s within my risk profile to go. However, I live with my 80-year-old nana, who is my favorite person in the entire world. I am not her caretaker, and we have enough space for me to self-isolate/quarantine if need be. She says she won’t stop me from going, and that I should absolutely use my skills to help someone. I suspect she’s just saying that to make me feel better, because I know she’s scared about the Rona, for her health and mine. 

We’re not hurting financially; I can afford to not take the job, but I don’t want to be the reason my client can’t perform their job well. 

So I appeal to you, wise random people on the Internet. What should I do?

831,"So I’m trying to become a content creator I love doing it and it makes me full of joy, but once all is said and done I always look back on my work and feel nothing but self doubt. 

Ik my work is good, I already have a small following and a good community but I can’t help but just feel I’m not good enough for going any further. At one point I was growing so fast I’d gain 100 subs and followers on my media’s in a day and I convinced myself that I didn’t deserve it to a point I stopped working for a full week which is a lot for what I do. Ig the reason I say this is bc other than learning by experience and watching tutorials I never had any professional training like a lot of the big content creators I like say they did bc many of them went to college for that sort of stuff yk. So I feel compared to that I’m not worthy of growing; bc of that i feel my work isn’t good enough and it isn’t as good as I would wish it would be bc I don’t have the budget yet that a lot of others have and thus I can’t even begin to do the stuff they can do. Ik ur not suppose to compare urself to others but when going into a business mindset u do have to look at those in ur same field as well as I always learn my seeing what they can do and figuring out how they did it. 

Overall tho I just often feel my content isn’t good and it’s even harder to fight that thought when u can have one thing go viral and another thing flop and it’s all internet stuff so comments can either be a blessing or a curse. 

In the past I never worried about it bc I tried my hardest not to pay attention to the numbers and just do what I enjoy and I found entertaining but now that I have a small following I feel I should start paying more attention to that stuff yk? 

And Ik there is plenty I need to work on and even more I need to learn and I know a majority of what I need to do to achieve those things but it’s sooo much it feels overwhelming for me to learn it all and do it all... as well as it’s hard to learn how to do things when u don’t have a teacher in that yk?

844,"This is not for me, but for my mum. She’s been with this guy for 7 years and while they were good in the beginning, we all know he’s a douchebag. I don’t even know where to start, but I’m just going to point out the fact that I hate him. My mum is 13 years older than him; he’s immature and a total prick. We all don’t like him because we know he was just using my mum to get a visa to permanently live here, which he finally got. 

For a while now my mum has caught him talking to other women, and they’d fight for a while, then he’d tell her he won’t do it again... then he does it again. Recently a woman contacted my mum and sent her screenshot of his messages. He was asking her to meet up with him and complimenting her looks. I thought finally she’s going to end this relationship, but no, she gave him one final chance which she’d given him plenty of times before.

She’s hesitating to leave because they have 2 kids, but she didn’t hesitate to leave my dad whom she has 4 kids with. I think it’s more of the fact that she had this douchebag as a back up once my parents split, but now she has none. I care about my mum, but she’s incredibly stupid when it comes to these things. She’s making a fool of herself, and that guy is taking advantage of her. Her family hates him, my siblings and I hate him, but she still continues to be with him to the point that my family just keeps in contact with her for the sake of my half-sisters.

I’ve been blunt to her and told her that she’s a clown for letting him do this to her and giving him a chance, but no. She just told me that she’ll understand once I’m in her shoes, but I’ve been in her shoes before and I wasted my life. I get that she’s older, but it’s never too late to let go of something not worth holding onto.

What else can I say to open her eyes? I feel like this is just going to continue on a cycle. I find it embarrassing that all of us have common sense except her.

852,"So I was talking to my mentor, a Pastor, amd I came accros the question. “Why can men have what they please and be what they please and women cannot” To which he replied, “is man made for woman or woman made for man”
I wanted to cry. But I stayed strong. He said I was trying to put my opinions before his God. He didn’t force me to agree but eventually he went back to work. 

I’ve been racing my mind for a while. This is a common question and one particularly hurtful. I thought I was, or wanted to be, a Transgender man since preteen age. I took me years to finally see that wasn’t realistic as I am not, nor have I ever had, gender dysforia. I did on the other hand, I have a repulsion of my gender. Puberty was not a happy time, as I was a fat manly child.

 I won’t say I hate being a woman, as I don’t have any urge to harm myself or want to change to a man. But I’d be lying if my place in this body doesn’t make me cry. I hate how I belong to a sex that is secondary. People say women are badass. But the word and requirements comes from man. Every god damn thing is build by man. Every biological card is stacked against me. Children, biological clock, marriage. On my back. Men don’t have a biological clock, a burden of children, or a mentality (generally) of supporting. I want to be the alpha, top dog, but that role 99.9% belongs to men. Having children isn’t an achievement to me. It’s biological. Men can make 10 a day. And I can’t help but admire the male body (admire) and what it can do, how they don’t cry as much, and really build the world. 

I fucking don’t want to be part of a gender that when I become a doctor, lawyer, or anything “honorable” I will be surrounded by men who are twice my size and maybe only one female at the top. I hate that in sex, I am the taken, not the taker. I feel like that’s woman hood. This is a man’s world, and I’m tired of just being “protected” or “allowed to achieve” in it.

I honestly don’t wish to hurt anybody, I really need help. I hate what I am. And somebody on this website has to know how I feel.

Edit: i’m speaking of my gender and that I don’t wish to belong to it. Biologically women seem to be the supporting gender to do the mothering and the community like work. I’d like to be long to a gender that does the hard work and creates history. I apologize if I offended anyone but I’m sure there is someone out there that understands how I feel.",18Dec2020,0

861,"I live in Germany and it has been a dream for me to study international law or human rights as i've decided on a career path in this field. I do need a Master's degree for it.

However, to study either of those, you would have to do a Bachelor's degree in German law overall first, only then would you be able to study the specific field as a master's degree.

Or, i could study in the Netherlands, which is very close to where I live, and study there. That would mean that I can skim down atleast 2 to 3 years of university and enter my profession of choice faster.

Here are the set-backs though:
University tuition is a thing in the Netherlands (~2,200 Euro or ~2,000 USD per Year), and my desired university is located in a very expensive city (Groningen), besides that, I don't speak Dutch (though i have a few years until i finish school so i can definetly try and learn some of it; the course i want is in English). That means that i would have to pay atleast 3x to 4x more for university than what i would've to pay in Germany.

But at the same time, I don't want to study law in Germany, with regards to how long and ruthless it's curriculum is (~40% fail rate, where you'll end up with a high school diploma after 7 or 8 years, without the chance to retake it).

871," TL;DR: I started dating the crush of one of my best friends after his date with her didn't work out. I started dating her after some time and now he is fuming and overreacting in the friend group and I don't want it caving in.

This story starts with me(20m) and one of my best friends(20m) who i've been good friends with through the entirety of collage. (4 years)

My friend has had a crush on this girl(20f) from school for some years and then in our senior year. (Let's call her Katie) This year he finally had a shot at dating her. This was because she got closer to our friend group and they eventually discovered they like each other.

I didn't really know her but we got along well and became friends. At this time I was dating my crush too, who was coincidentally Katie's best friend. So we basically became part of a friend group with both our crushes. Naturally I talked about dating my crush with Katie and my friend a lot and we got along really well. and really started getting to know each other well.

I'm supporting my homie and I was hoping it would work out with her for him. And he was supporting me too.

Since it's quarantine time, dating is hard and Katie and my friend didn't see each other much, but they did however speak a lot over voice calls. When they eventually had a date IRL, Katie discovered that she wasn't really into my friend, to the point where they even got annoyed at each other and both started rambling to me about how the other person is flawed.

So they kind of hate each other now and after a period of one month of them talking a lot and having 1 irl date. Katie told my friend that she's not ready for a relationship with him after getting to know him better.

My friend is devastated by it since he's had a crush on this girl for the entirety of collage. And is now in-between hating her but still wanting to give it a shot. (Love is a weird thing)

Back to me:  
I've been dating my crush over the quarantine too but we went on a few more dates over a longer period of 5 months. Eventually she told me that she wasn't interested in me romantically but wanted to stay friends since we can always laugh and talk about everything together. Over that long period I had of course already noticed this, and I agreed. I was a tad heartbroken, but I was pretty much already processing denial that last month. So my heartbreak wasn't that bad. At least I gave it a shot

During this time I was still good friends with Katie and my friend. Even though they pretty much hate each other. I still appreciate them both separately. I'm not choosing sides.

Katie and I talked so much and created such a strong bond over these last few months that we both eventually admitted that we like each other. This is 6 months after she and my friend ""broke up"" (after having 1 date). So i figured he would've gotten over it by now.

Anyway I've been dating Katie for almost 2 months now, and it's going well. So I figured that I had to tell my friend about it. I'm aware that there's thing like the bro-code where you don't date your bro's ex. But they literally only had 1 date after which he said that it wouldn't have worked out for them anyway. I tried respecting the code for a long time but Katie and I just happened to like each other so much. And we can't really do anything about that.

So I went along with it. Yesterday I talked to him, hoping that he was over it since they only really dated for one month and weren't in an actual relationship or something. Heck they didn't even kiss and this was 7 months ago.

Turns out he's furious... But not with me. He's just disappointed in me but says he understands me (because apparently I'm desperate according to him). He is however fuming at Katie. He hates her even more now to the point where he insults her passively aggressively every time she speaks in our larger friend group's chat and doesn't wanna hear about her existence.

They both stated that they never wanna see or hear from each other again, which would've been kind of tricky for me, but is especially tricky since we are all in a larger friend group together.

Is there anything I can do to retain the relationship with Katie, but also stay in a healthy friend group when they don't wanna feel each others existence?",18Dec2020,5

I have done everything I can to show that I do not like her but none of that has stopped her, and I don't want to insult her by outright telling her (unless I have to, which I might).

None of this was a huge problem until this week, when on the bus, she told me she wanted me to take her to prom. I was surprised, and didn't know what to say, so I fumbled and said that I didn't know what my plans were yet. Then she said that the reason she wanted someone in grade 12 to take her was because all her friends were going. The conversation on the bus changed subject, but then someone brought it back up. She started saying that she didn't actually want to go with me that much and that she would leave me to find her other friends when we got to prom, and since I hadn't actually given an answer yet, and I was a bit taken aback, I straight up told her no. 

The next day, she said she didn't mean what she said the previous day, and I said it was alright, but I told her my answer still wasn't yes, because I wanted to be clear.

Now, I'm hearing that she is calling me an asshole to other people and saying that I ruined her christmas break because according to her I said yes and then changed my answer later, and I don't know what to do, because she has told this to several people so far, who have talked to me about it. I know that she has a rough home life, her parents had her when they were teenagers and her dad abused her mom and now they're separated, her dad even kicked her (the girl in question) out of the house at one point because she forgot to take the trash out and she had to live with her grandparents. I don't want to hurt her feelings any more, but it's annoying that she is telling things about me to other people, but still being nice to me in person. I don't know if confronting her would clear things up or only make them worse.

I know this is a really drama-y story so sorry about that.

TL;DR - Girl in the grade below me likes me and recently asked me to take her to prom, but insulted me in the process (probably because she was nervous). Now she is spreading rumours and I don't know if I should confront her or not.",18Dec2020,1

In the degree at my school it’s inevitable to fail because of how badly the teachers are. In the group chats people talk of how they failed classes many times.

This is going to be super long but I’m just really torn up and not sure if I made the right call or not and I need some fresh perspective on everything. I (17F) broke up with my bestfriend (17F) since ninth grade today, I’m going to call her Diane, obvi not a real name. We’ve been through thick and thin together and shared almost every highschool memory together. Being seniors this year things have really changed a lot and she kind of turned into someone pretty nasty. My other two best friends, who I’ll call Rachel and Fiona, were also seeing it. Me, Diane and Rachel had been a friendgroup for a since ninth grade, and just last year Diane brought Fiona into the group and we welcomed her with open arms and grew just as close with Fiona. A couple months ago Diana was caught with marijuana by her mom, her mom claimed that we were a bad influence on Diane and Diane let her believe that and kind of blamed it all on us. We had nothing to do with the marijuana she was caught with. 

The night she was caught was Rachel’s birthday, and Diane had to cancel last minute because she was grounded, but we still decided to go out to dinner because we wanted to do something special for Rachel’s birthday because she had had a pretty tough year. Diane shows up as we’re about to walk into the restaurant, crying in her car. We stood and comforted her for a little bit but we had to get inside because the restaurant was high end and if we were more than 20 minutes late to the reservation the table would’ve been given away. Any other night we would’ve stayed out there with Diane, but it was Rachel’s birthday. Last year on Rachel’s birthday, she was grieving the loss of a close family member and didn’t really want to go out, so it was important to me that this birthday was a good one for her. From that night into the next month, Diane wouldn’t hangout with us, we thought she might just still be grounded but she wouldn’t answer our texts either and would go out with her other friends. We would text her and ask if she was okay or if she needed anything and she would give very short answers or none at all. It was weird because we were the type of friends that were constantly talking and hanging out, but we gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought she just wanted some space to process everything. So we let her know that we were there if she needed us but that we weren’t going to push. And continued to hangout the three of us for that month. 

Then suddenly she started wanted to hangout with me and Rachel again, but said she didn’t want Fiona there because she didn’t like her. It was super strange since Diane was the one that brought Fiona into the group, we agreed to hangout with Diane without Fiona but we didn’t want Fiona to know because we didn’t want to hurt her feelings, and we still very much liked her. But we also loved and missed Diane and wanted to hangout with her too. Then one day after school Rachel invited Fiona and I over her house, but didn’t invite Diane because all Diane could talk about was how she couldn’t stand Fiona. Diane found out we were there without her and freaked out on us, called us fake, said we’ve been bad friends ever since the night we went to dinner instead of comforting her in the parking lot, that it didn’t matter that it was Rachel’s birthday that her relationship with her mom was more important and we weren’t there for her. She also went on about how Rachel and I were closer to Fiona now which isn’t fair because we were friends with her first and she doesn’t understand why we were closer to Fiona. Should we have stayed in the parking lot to comfort her and scratched Rachel’s birthday plans? I know Rachel would’ve been upset. Diane’s words were “birthdays come and go but this was my mom and I’s relationship do you understand how important that is?” But doesn’t getting caught by your mom come and go too? I’ve been caught by my mom before and I’ve always survived, and I’ve always known that it was my fault and my fault only. This was about the third time Diane had been caught by her mom and they always turned out okay. And the only reason we seemed closer to Fiona is because Diane stopped talking to us for a month. 

That was the main incident that happened that changed everything, we ended up working that fight out and then a week later one of Fiona’s friends overheard Diane saying “I fucking hate Fiona and I hate her house she’s so annoying” to which Fiona heard about this and was heartbroken, because she had no idea that Diane didn’t like her that much and thought they were still friends. (Side note I have no clue why Diane stopped liking Fiona because to me Fiona is a really good person) Diane sent her a long text about how she simply just didn’t like her anymore and that was that. Rachel and I weren’t sure what to do, so we tried to split our time and hangout with both of them separately. There have been other explosive fights with Diane, and everytime we fight she says we’re bad friends and we’re not there for her and make us feel guilty. One night, Diane wouldn’t stop saying bad things about Fiona so I nicely told her she shouldn’t say that stuff just because she doesn’t like Fiona and she got really angry at me and talked down to me and started a whole fight and went on again saying we liked Fiona more and our friendship wasn’t going to work out if that was the case. Somehow we ended up working that fight out too and then Rachel’s grandma died of covid, Diane said she couldn’t go to the funeral because she had to go to practice, Rachel was pissed, but then Diane ended up showing up anyways. Then today, Diane invited us to sleepover her house with a bunch of our other friends, I said no because I’m currently quarantined after being exposed to covid and Rachel said no because she doesn’t want to risk infecting her other grandparents at Christmas. Diane then went on about how covid is bullshit and everyone needs to get over it, Rachel was pissed because, well, her grandma just died of covid, they fought. Diane then started saying again how we weren’t good friends and then I said I couldn’t do it anymore and ended our friendship. 

Did I do the right thing? Or am I in the wrong? I feel terrible knowing that Diane just lost her two best friends, and I know she is going to tell the whole school bad things about it. I’m not too worried about that part since I’m graduating June, it’s just going to be a long 6 months once I go back to school. Are we bad friends for what we did to her? I’ve been feeling like the only reason our friendship has stayed so long is because I’ve always excused her shitty behavior and pushed Rachel to excuse it too, because there have been a lot of times where Rachel said she was done with her but I would pull for us to make up because I didn’t want to lose Diane, or ruin our friendgroup. Even Rachel admitted the only reason she stayed friends with Diane so long is because of me. I feel like this is a lot and it might be confusing and there’s way more I could say but I don’t know how to put everything in without making it more confusing. I just need to know if I did the right thing or not because I feel really guilty. How should I go about seeing her in the future? And what should I do if she twists everything and tells everyone?",18Dec2020,1
882,"My brother and sister in law are bat shit, to say the least. Like, pulled a gun on my sister and their own children in my house because she wouldn't watch their kids bat shit. DHS has already been called out so many times and they've done nothing, but that's besides the point. 

They are extremely far right. They live and breathe hate speech, and have been stocking up on guns and ammo preparing for a ""civil war"". The other day, my brother said he was going to ""discreetly learn how to build a bomb"". They were part of a ""militia"" that recently disbanded. My brother always talks about how he's ""ready for the war"" and ""ready to kill liberals"" and ""they all need to die"". I'm not only terrified because they could be terrorists, but they have me labeled as a liberal for my ""extreme far left views"" (equal opportunity is far left, apparently).

They threaten my family all the time. I'm afraid to say anything, I'm afraid they'll kill me. They've already told me I should kill myself and talked about how much better their lives would be if I was dead (which is funny my brother admitted to my parents I don't do anything to bother them, and that it's his wife who starts all the drama -- I keep to myself because they scare the piss out of me). All of us siblings live in a complex owned by my parents. I can't leave, I can't afford anything else and I'm stuck here. My parents won't kick them out because, again, they threaten us.

883,"So, this is gonna be a bit hard to explain, but please read.
So, i recently started a new school (i just turned 17 (female) btw). I got a lot of new friends, and this guy friend that i’ve been talking to a bit, just like my other friends from school. 
He sends me a lot of texts very often,
but The thing is, he always talked about his girlfriend and how they always were fighting and arguing and she cheated on him and he did some bad stuff to her (which he didn’t mention what the bad stuff were). He always asked me for my opinion on their situation, as most people would have said, I said that the cheating-situation is a bit fucked and that it looks like you guys don’t trust each other, ect.
He asked me if he should move on or give her another shot,
I told him that, if you love her, give her another chance, people can change.
He did.
And apparently she cheated again with the same guy. Sucks for him, and i’m really sorry for him but the same day he told me that they’ve broken up and that he was single again he asked if i ”know anyone or something that i could try something with?” 
He could really just be looking for anyone new just like that and I didn’t think he had any interest in me whatsoever, BUT i’ve talked to my friends and they ALL say that it looks as if he might like me. 

IDK, what do y’all think? I would really appreciate advice here, since I recently got out of a relationship I’m not looking for a new one, if he’s interested that will say. So tell me this, from what i’ve shared, do you think he likes me? Or ? And if he does, what are some nice ways to give the hint sort of that you are not interested that way?",18Dec2020,2

886,"Hi. I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m scared. When I was around 11-12, I was on my moms phone playing app games and for some reason I went on her notes app snooping around, I found a note that was talking about my dad and what my mom found on his phone with the date next to it. I kept it to myself and had no idea if he was actually cheating or not. A month later, since my parents share the same Apple ID, there notes became linked together and he saw the notes that she had wrote on his phone. During that time, tensions rose a lot but eventually got better and they began kissing and holding hands which I had never seen them do that much. His coworker moved jobs and they stopped talking. After a year, they stopped doing that as much and it just went back to normal. To this day, I don’t know if he was actually cheating or if my mom was just overreacting over their friendship. About 4 years have passed and I am now 16. They seem to have been doing fine and haven’t argued in years since then. They do get a little upset with each other over priorities and money but that’s it, or at least I thought so.

Anyway, today my mom was driving the car and I was in the passenger seat. She got a message and asked me to respond for her since she was driving. It was just her boss, but while I was texting, there was a notification from her coworker that I’ve met before and since it was only a notification it only showed half of the message. From what I read, he called her beautiful and told her he hopes she has sweet dreams. I finished writing the text, but didn’t open the rest of the message because I didn’t want it to say I opened it. She opened the message sometime after and throughout the rest of the day, I was trying to get her phone so I could see if she was really cheating or not. Well, she went into the store right now and left her phone and, lo and behold, they are sending kissing emojis, talking about their days, calling each other beautiful and saying goodnight and sweet dreams and such. 

I just cannot believe what I just saw before I started writing this post. I have no idea what to do. Earlier this year, my best friends parents just got a divorce and my parents felt so bad for her, especially my mom, yet here she is doing stuff like this. I just don’t get it and I don’t know what to do. She’s so religious and if her siblings and parents found out about this, I’m sure they would be surprised. I don’t know how to feel right now. I don’t know if I should be upset or understanding that marriages fall apart sometimes or sad that the relationship that my parents once had is deteriorating. From here, I don’t know what to do. Here I am, 4-5 years later with another secret I’m keeping from everyone else. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or just let it be. I don’t want to ruin anything or get involved in something I shouldn’t be. I don’t want to break my family apart especially during the holidays. Here I am with my mom today and she’s buying a gift for my dad like she actually loves him. I don’t even know if she does. I’m sitting next to her right now and I just can’t look at her right now. She’s all happy and singing Christmas songs while I’m sitting here and can’t even hold myself up.

Not only this, but this isn’t the only secret I’m holding from the rest of my family. I’m gay. No one knows and I haven’t told anyone. I’m tired of keeping secrets and they just keep piling on and I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I don’t know who to tell or trust anymore. I don’t know if I should tell my best friend who’s experienced this before, my older siblings, or one of my parents whats happening. I don’t know, sometimes I wish I could just live a different life. I wish I wasn’t gay and I wish I lived in a perfect family. I feel like crying but I can’t, especially not with my mom next to me.",18Dec2020,29

889,"So, my partner has ADHD and anxiety, and takes meds for it. His anxiety meds take away _all_ sense of fear to the point where he just flips people off in public and does other things like drive at 100MPH and swerve in and out of traffic, and try to start fights.
Recently he decided to tailgate someone to see their reaction and got a gun pulled on him as a result. Luckily he didn't get shot.

He does these sorts of things even with me around, so he's not just endangering himself, but me as well. He doesn't really listen or take my feelings into consideration until I get stern or beg him. He always blames it on anxiety meds, and other attention-grabbing behaviors he blames on ADHD.

I've never seen anyone with ADHD, who's an adult, behave the way he does in public. He'll yell in public, pretend to trip and fall and scream loudly, and flip people off for no reason.

Also just to add we haven’t kissed yet so it’s not exactly like I’ve used her - just went into it without thinking properly.

893,"My husband has been having an affair most of our marriage. He always claimed she was just a good friend he has known since middle school. Only time I met her I knew something was off and told him then, for the sake of our marriage, to say goodbye to her...3 months later he fucks her. He hid their texts and phone calls. He always used the excuse of seeing/helping his dad...but, he would secretly get together with her. He claims that it was only 1 drunken hookup. But, they have gone on numerous dates. The year I caught him, thinking then it was only an emotional affair, he admitted to taking her out on at least 6 dates...that year he only took me out on 2 obligatory dates (anniversary &amp; valentine's day). I threatened him with divorce unless he completely cut it off with her...the only reason I didn't walk away then is because I was pregnant with our second daughter and truly wanted to believe it was only an emotional affair. He said he broke it off with her for good. Fast forward a year. Discovered they never ended the affair. He claims now he is definitely done with her and wants to save our marriage. That he only mistakenly slept with her once. We have 2 very young daughters (2y/o and 5 months). I believe he only wants to save our relationship for their sake. Of course he says it is because he truly loves me. Feelings don't shut off overnight. I mean I truly thought we had a great marriage. He always seemed happy. He said that he cheated because he wanted us both and wanted to live in his ""fantasy"" world as long as he could. But, how could I ever begin to trust him again after years of lies and deceit? Especially when both adulterers stories don't match up. Naturally, he wants me to solely believe him. It's become a he said she said situation.

He intentionally pursued her once she walked back into his life. He told her that we were in an open marriage and it was ok for them to see eachother because 1. He said I was sleeping with other people and 2. That I knew and approved of them hanging out. I am at a loss. I don't understand this kind of destruction. He wants to go to couple's therapy.

Man, it fucking sucks having write about my feelings because it feels pointless but at the same time it's somewhat comforting.

I always feel like ""Why the hell am I bothering to express myself to strangers on the internet? It's not like they can magically make me better."", ""Do they TRULY care?""

Yes, I'm very pessimistic and I apologise for that, maybe im pessimistic because of my current life? Like, how am I supposed to be positive when I have several, chronic mental illnesses. And I'm pretty sure im bipolar, too. Hopefully not, though.

I should get into why I am always in solitude. Oh shit, I- that's the thing...I don't FUCKING know?! It might be cocky but damn, I'm a good guy and ever so loving, I just have a lot on my shoulders.

It truly sucks when you know you're a good person, but you have literally no one to prove it to. I have online ""friends"", but they're not really friends. They claim to be there for me but never actually check up on me.

I want people to talk to me without me igniting conversation. That way, I know people actually want to talk to me.

Now, I'm going to speak about my previous relationship.

I gave everything. Treated her like a real princess (not so much by money), but my love and affection. We would have still been together. Y'know, I'm 20, I'm getting to that age where marriage is pretty normal, and me and her really wanted to get married (and not just some fairy tale bullshit, we loved each other that much)

However...my mental health was too much for her, my anxiety and anger issues was too stressful for her, EVEN THOUGH I was in treatment for my anger and anxiety and she noticed that I was improving, but still decided to end it with me. It hurts so bad to say this but she knew that without her I wanted to die (this was true)

I'm so ashamed. How could I be so stupid to tell her that I want to die if she were to leave me. I apologise daily. Sometimes I say things without thinking.

So I'm here, painfully still loving her, and her loving me (I like to think) It's so fucking hard to move on when you don't have a reason to stop loving someone, like shit If it was a serious reason, like cheating or something, then yeah, I wouldn't love her.

But me and her are apart now, and there's no sign of her and it's been a year and 3 months.

I would take her back in a heartbeat. I miss her dreadfully and I still call her my baby in my head, cuz I cant stop loving someone when I don't have a reason...

And my feelings are all over the place now, I miss being in love, and I know I can find it again, but part of me will always love her.

She was my fucking QUEEN. My first ever TRUE love. I haven't ever loved someone as much her before.

It's literally like ""i hate u, I love u"" kinda thing, I want to hate her for leaving me despite telling me she'd help me through everything and love me until we grow grey hair, but nah, cuz of my issues, everyone disappears.

I want to be that in love again. But I've had no luck. I have tried dating apps but they don't work and I can't socialise in person because of my anxiety",18Dec2020,2

He doesn’t usually invite me to his family occasion even though they have this get-together every weekend but never bothered to asked me if I want to come. He told me I was her first girlfriend that is not asian. I was jokingly said “so do I have to act like an asian because I am not an asian?”. He haven’t posted pictures of us yet but he keep on posting pictures of him with his friend(same girl every time). I told him that I don’t feel his love for me and he told me that I was being dramatic. 

He’ll always go to my place but I have never been to his place. He’s living with his parents. Although he is working full time and giving his parents money. I asked him why he would do that, are they asking him for money and that’s his money they have nothing to do with your money. He’ll just shrugged it off. He’s talking about going home this summer but didn’t asked me if I want to come with him. I don’t feel like I’m his girlfriend. He is making decision for himself and never bothered to ask me. 

I love my boyfriend so much but I don’t think he loves me enough. I don’t know that much about him when it comes to his personal life. I met his friends one time on his birthday but that was a simple dinner outside. Although he celebrated his birthday on the weekend, he was having a party without even inviting me. I could see his instagram stories, he should have invited me instead of us chatting during that day. He told me it was a surprised party from his friends. However, every time he added stories this girl (same girl I’ve mentioned above) always the highlight of his instagram. I confronted him one time if he’s cheating on me.

I have tried everything to avoid smelling like it. I’ve used every spray I found recommended for this, washed my clothes immediately, let them air out outside and left them out to not get reinfected before I leave, paired with showering and washing my hair RIGHT before I leave the house and getting ready on the way outside of my house. It all doesn’t matter. The second I walk into a room and sit down someone has to ask, “why does it smell like cigarettes?”

I'm getting older and I've achieved nothing. I haven't had a close friend in years besides my BF"". I had started getting doubts about my BF around the time I turned 21 and the cancer scare 2 months later added more fuel to the fire. He has a chronic mental illness which causes him to confess any mean or inappropriate thought he has. Usually they aren't true but he has no filter. He feels like a liar if he doesn't tell me every bad thought he has about my looks/personality/if he's settling etc. I've been hearing this stuff on and off for 1.5 years. It has made me cry/storm out of his house and just feel exhausted because it happens so much. He is good to me 90% of the time and I know this is out of his control, but I've made it clear how much it hurts me and he won't get help. He has been doing great for a few months and this happens less but the damage is done and I'm bitter. I've thought over the crap he said so much that I barely want sex anymore with him and the thoughts of moving in next year scare me.

I can't fight this feeling I could have a much easier relationship with someone else cos what are the odds I've found the best match for me at 19, when I hadn't dated anyone else seriously, nor do I totally know myself. I don't believe in soulmates so I imagine the best way to have a lifelong relationship is to meet them past your mid-20s when you've already experienced other people and know what you want. I won't be able to go overseas or move across the country without consulting him either. I just feel very limited and I already feel like we may as well be married from how we behave. Frankly, my dad is more romantic towards my mom after 30 years than he is after 2. I know he still loves me but he admits he has kinda given up cos he's comfortable and I love him. What should I do?",18Dec2020,4
908,"I’ve been getting extremely spiritual for the past few years, and when I told my mom about it, she wanted me to stop. She doesn’t accept my beliefs ever. I believe a lot in the universe, energy, god, etc. Today I was doing a meditation to meet my spiritual guide and my mom called me. She asked me what I was doing and told me to stop. She told me to stop following everything people are saying and says it’s not real. She told me to stop believing in my beliefs and if I don’t, she would take my phone away and do it herself. This isn’t the first time she was unaccepting of my beliefs. I’ve always had obsessive thoughts (and still do) ever since I was little. I never knew how to explain it when I told some of my friends. But when I found out about OCD and saw that the mental illness is exactly what I’ve been suffering for years. I told my mom out of courage when I was 12. She flipped out on me and said that I don’t have it and that I’d be washing my hands over everything (even though I do that). I’ve been suffering through OCD for years now and I don’t even mention it anymore in front of my mom because she’ll obviously not believe me. I love my mother, but I don’t know what to do about it.",18Dec2020,1
