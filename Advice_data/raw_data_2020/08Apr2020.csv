1,"My family friend (D) right now is 12 turning 13 and shes is absolutely obsessed with boys, now that isn't that much of a problem itself but her last boyfriend was 16 and they constantly had problems. She got a new boyfriend the next day, he's 15 and he's a ""shared"" boyfriend between her and and her friend (H) 13 turning 14. I don't know if this is a problem or not which I what I need help with. It's not like she's engaging in any sexual activity with them but she has sent boob pics the 16 year old before. H is also not the best influence as they have an on and off relationship and shes the one introducing all the boys to D. They both have family issues and D's mother doesn't really care what she does. ( D's mom had her at 18, don't know if that matters but just an extra detail ) I feel like D is just too young to keep going in and out of relationships. I want to be supportive of what she does but I honestly don't know how to feel about her. She says she would never get pregnant as a teen but she also said she would never said boob pic to a guy, which she did.",08Apr2020,1

4,"I live with my Father, and his Girlfriend.
We both work for the same granite shop, live on the property (owners let him move there during a hard time).
I moved down here to Florida 10 months ago after 10 years in washington.
The intentions of me moving here was to rekindle a relationship with my Father that I wasn't able to continue when I was 9.
My Dad offered to move me down here, said he was very well off, and that now was the best time for us to reconnect.
Once I arrived, I realized I wasn't being told an absolute truth.
The house is still just barely considered livable after constant work and wasting money (we aren't on a lease and the owners can decide to kick us out if they decide they dislike us) 
Very pressured to be overachievers at work in fear of a forced relocation. 
Pretty much, my dad is very fine living like this, I am not.
I still have a social life in Washington that I miss, I still have family members in washington that I miss.
I've saved up more than enough for a plane trip back to Washington.
I just don't want to leave my dad in a sinking ship that was already sinking before I came.
He also dispises my mother, and he hates the distance.
I know everyone's first thought could be ""You're an adult, it's your life, his problems aren't yours""
He's my father and I know he'd kill for me.
I just don't want him to feel betrayed. I miss my siblings, I miss my friends, I miss being somewhere I feel at home and am familiar with.
With the current travel advisory, flying is sketchy atm (though I'm extremely familiar with PPE) (Dad's also a less than rational dooms dayer and can't handle distance but also won't travel himself.)
If he's against me going back to washington all together then talking to him is pointless and I'll just pay for a cab, but I'd like for him to understand my piece, 
Work together with me on traveling back to washington as safe as possible, with no unnecessary tension.
To reCap;
* In florida for 10 months reconnecting with my Father.
* Stuck in a slavish tyrannical work for housing scenario.
* Started missing my past independence, social life, and siblings up north.
* Covid-19 situation is making every decision I make way more blown out of proportion that it has to be.

TLDR: have money and means to move back acrossthe country, don't want to ruin Dad and I's relationship.",08Apr2020,1

7,"Hi! 
So me and my ex never have nice conversations to each other, I’m currently pregnant and every time I try to talk to him about the baby he gets really ignorant with me because of the person he is with, when he’s not with her he’s okay. But, he recently unblocked me on Facebook and almost every morning now when he gets up I’m assuming he makes his posts public and shares memes and our favorite anime show. I have my posts on public and do the same, not for him but for some of my friends that can’t share my stuff. I also tried something yesterday to see if he was stalking my account and posted a story and made it public, behold he watched it. So I’m just confused on what his intentions are? Is he being ignorant to me because of her, or does he just really suck at communicating 
Whenever he posts something is usually right after I post something. I’m just confused! I’m not going to talk to him about it because that will cause problems but someone explain his logic lol. I don’t get where he’s coming from. 
Also, i left him bc of stress he was putting on me, then he ran back to his ex wife that abused him, cheated on him, and ruined him and supposedly they are getting married again (congrats to them) but he never posts anything of her? No one even knows their together but some of his family, none of his friends know.. I dunno. I’m just confused",08Apr2020,1

9,"The timing of this is AWFUL!

My boss gave her notice to leave mid-February. I met with the President the following week to discuss if I could move into her role. He offered me the job, and said that we would discuss compensation AFTER I met with the board and also received their approval. The board approved this the first week of March. In the second week of March our jobs became consumed with our response to the worldwide pandemic and we haven't met one-on-one since.

My boss left 2.5 weeks ago and I am doing everything in our department now alone, and have additional high profile duties like quarterly presentations to the board and completing company-wide initiatives. I have a meeting with the President tomorrow and plan to bring up the salary conversation then. I have tons of salary data and have no problem negotiating in normal circumstances. But the President and I are both part of the pandemic task force at our organization where we are discussing the possibility of mass layoffs, temporary salary cuts, or furloughed employees. I plan to acknowledge the bad timing but still discuss the salary increase anyway.

For the record, I expect this increase to almost double my salary, so it's incredibly significant to me and my family. His executive assistant told me that I should be prepared for him to say we need to hold on making any big changes right now.

How would you handle this situation?

1. Would you still ask for the increase, given these hard discussions regarding job losses?
2. How would you acknowledge the crappy timing and make the ask?
3. What if he does respond that it's not the time now? Would you NOT take on the additional duties? Would you continue working in that role knowing that you're being paid tens of thousands of dollars less than anyone else in that role? (I know this for a fact, at least in my state. It's a niche role.)

Any advice is helpful. Thanks.",08Apr2020,1
10,"Me and my buddy have been good friends for years, but he’s been a heavy addict and an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried to help him but he doesn’t want to change. I live out of town so me and him would hangout whenever I’d get back into town. But I’d keep the times we hung out short as he’d usually be drunk and become a dick, or force me to listen to rap and sit in his car and watch him drink. This is literally all we’ve done for years, I’m not a drinker by the way. At first it was yeah whatever, I would make sure he wouldn’t drive, but then he would get wasted and try to drive so I would leave and walk to the nearest bus stop to get home super late. Really wasn’t having a good time. But I stuck around anyway. I’m pretty sure he looks up to me but at the same time the guy can’t control his impulses and can’t consider other people. At all. For the past three years all we’ve done when we chill is sit in his car, free style or listen to rap and I watch him get drunk. I’ve suggested we do other things but my buddy didn’t really want to. 

Anyway, so my last turn around in town was a few months ago and it was my last day, me and my friend had hung out a few days prior and it was the same shit as it’s been for years, he gets blasted in his car and I have to convince him not to drive. He calls me on my last day and wants to chill. I say sure man let’s go downtown because we usually just chill in your car and you drink, and I want to actually do something for my last night. He says “nah sorry if rather chill on the whip and drink” I said cool man whatever and decided I didn’t need this guy in my life anymore. For years I’ve been trying to get him to be a more functional person but I just said fuck it after that. If you want to waste away and ruin your life give her. Let’s not mention he’s $3000 dollars in debt and trying to pull every scheme he can to avoid it. He keeps digging a whole for himself deeper and deeper.

We didn’t talk for a while, I still haven’t talked to him, but due to recent events I had to come home (fuck you covid 19) and I’m pretty sure he got whiff that I was in town. Hasn’t stopped messaging me, hasn’t stopped calling me, etc. 

I think he’s a toxic friend, he has a really solid heart but He’s the type of person to bring others down and I don’t want that shit in my life. I’m perusing a degree in marine bio, recovering from narcissistic parents and I’m a recovered drug addict. I want no toxic people in my life and I just don’t know how to break it to him. 

What do y’all think. 

It’s painful because I don’t want to break his heart, he had it rough growing up, but I don’t see our friendship going anywhere",08Apr2020,1

12,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone! I'm going to vent here because I would like to know if i'm doing the right thing. In a way, I feel like I am but who knows? maybe i got it all wrong.

Me and my ex-best friend used to be really close, we have been friends since we were in kindergarten until we graduated from high school, she went to study overseas and so did i, obviously not the same countries. Everything was going great until last year, when i decided to go to therapy because i felt really bad about myself, and also i felt like I was the one who was always initiating conversations with ""my friends"", meaning that if i didn't talk to them, they would not talk to me.

My bff would stop responding to me for weeks, but she always talked to me after the weeks passed and apologized, but honestly i was getting tired of it, because although she apologized, she kept repeating this over and over again. After going to therapy, i decided to talk to her and tell her that the fact that she suddenly stopped talking to me for a long time, made me feel really sad, and it made me believe that she didn't have any interest in talking to me anymore. She told me that was not the case, that when she didn't answer me, she just didn't feel like talking to anybody and that the next time she would feel this way she would tell me so i wouldn't feel bad about her suddenly disappearing.

I agreed to this and also told her that if she had any problem i would be there to listen to her. Everything was going great until she stopped talking to me for 2 weeks, apologized, and then we talked for like a week and then she did not answer to me anymore. This was the first week of january, so weeks and weeks passed, and still nothing.

Until a few days ago, it was my birthday, she wrote me a really long message sent it to me at exactly 12:00 am( We used to this when we were younger) . In this message she wished me a happy birthday, told me she loved me, and to not hate her for disappearing (it had been 3 months since we last talked).

The message really confused me because i had already accepted the fact that she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. I don't even feel angry anymore, it's just that i had been honest with her, and told her that when she did that i felt awful, and it made me feel like she did not give a f about me feeling awful. However, i answered that i still appreciated her, that i don't hate her and i would always wish her the best. I thought she would leave the conversation there, but she actually continued it by asking how was my birthday, and that is when I stopped responding to her.

I just feel like I had come to terms with losing her friendship, and just starting talking to her like nothing happened would make me feel more than awful if she disappeared again, which is very likely to happen since she didn't talk to me at all these months (even when the freaking apocalypse started) until it was my birthday, maybe i am a bit bitter about it and that's why decided to do the same thing to her that she did to me.

But at the same time, I'm tired of playing this ""game"", I just want to move on, accept everything her friendship taught me and continue life. Besides, I honestly believe that we just drifted apart, and she doesn't want to continue this friendship, and I don't think I want to continue with it either. Did I do the right thing?",08Apr2020,1

19,"TL;DR my dad is a good father but I feel creeped out/uncomfortable by him. I'm also always irritated while talking to him. I dont know know exactly what caused this way of thinking. (Its a lot better to just read the full post tho)

So, let's start with what I think could be the reason that started it all and then later progressed.

When I was 12 I was leaning over the counter in my parents bathroom to put on mascara. My dad walks in and I turn to look at him. I swear I saw his eyes look at my butt for a split second. I dont know if my eyes were deceiving me but ever since then I've been creeped out by him. On top of that, I was at the age where you dont really like your parents as much and want to be left alone. 

After that I was always annoyed with him when he talked to me. Could never make eye contact. There was even a year where sometimes I'd just blatantly ignore him if he talked to me and always walk certain paths of the house to avoid where he was. I stopped eating dinner with my family too. This was because my dad loves to make conversation and I'm not really into talking when I'm eating. I'm especially not into talking with him. I also like to watch youtube/tv when eating so I always just ate in my room. Only for special occasions/holidays would I eat with my family.

Im 18 now and I stopped that completely ignoring him bullshit ever since highschool. I know that's just outright disrespectful. I answer him always but in a quiet voice and dont say much. I still rarely ever look him in the eye. I feel uncomfortable everytime hes around me.

But I've also noticed over the years that I've picked up things in his personality that I dont like. And I feel like I have other reasons why i dont like him ontop of me being creeped out by him.

One is hes always talkative/positive. He always wants to talk and hes never in a bad mood with my brothers and I. That doesn't sound bad but to me is annoying because I dont always want to be talking at home. I'm the type of person where I'll socialize all day outside the house but once I'm home, I dont want to talk and I just want to stick to myself and in my room. 

The other thing I dont like about him is he doesnt take no as an answer. ""(My name), do you want to go on a walk with us?"" And I'll say no. Hell always say ""Yes you do."" This goes for other questions like ""Do you want to watch a movie with us?"", ""Do you want to play with game with us?"" Everytime I say no, he cant accept it at all and it's so annoying.

Another thing is is one time I asked my parents if I could get therapy for my social anxiety. My dad said no. I remember texting him a whole paragraph about how it has affected my life and he never answered. That's the only time hes ever just ignored a text of mine. He also said he doesnt believe that depression is a mental illness.

My dad....he has a really good paying job. So he pays the bills for all of us and my mom stays at home to care for us. Hes a nice person. So I've just been at a loss for how my brain has led me to be so creeped out/uncomfortable by him. I feel like such a terrible daughter because of it knowing theres people out there that dont have a great dad or dont have a dad at all. But I cant bring myself out of this way of thinking. I dont even know if this would be considered ""daddy issues"" either bc it's not even really my dad being the issue, but of me being the issue. But it still has caused a strained relationship with my dad so. 

Anybody have any answers or similar experiences??",08Apr2020,1
20,"tiny bit of context:
me and my girlfriend broke up, neither of us wanted to, but because of family issues we had to. i wanted to help her get some closure since she has bad anxiety and i still care about her, i didn’t want to just abandon her.

so i want to help her deal with our breakup and everything surrounding it healthily by letting everything go, otherwise it’s just going to get bottled up and fester and turn into anxiety later in her life, but she has a very big ‘oh well im gonna die anyway so what’s the point in dealing with it healthily’ attitude.

i want to help her but i can’t help someone who has given up on themselves, for me, it would be better to go, i would heal easier that way, but she wouldn’t, and her not healing would be significantly worse than me not healing as easily, but i’m giving up on trying to help, she’s completely resistant to it. should i go? should i stay to make sure she’s okay? 

she’s not the kind of person to get therapy or anything either, she’s completely resistant to trying to help herself and i dont know whether that means i should stay and help her or leave and let her deal with it herself, im just worried by leaving id be making the selfish choice.

It's just the latest blow to my self-confidence, as I've somehow convinced myself that I'm a bad person destined to live a terrible and mediocre life. I don't know how I stop being jealous of everyone around me. I find myself hating myself more and more every day, because now I'm starting to believe that I'm a bad person that no one actually cares about, who possesses no talent or drive.

Pros: Open Book 

Can get an A+

Cons: Havent been keeping up with material 

Open book does not mean easy, with the time limits and the teachers making it hard, you have to study basically like a regular exam. Every open book i've taken I end up never even referring to my notes. 

Exam is in 4 days

27,"So I’ve been with a girl for 18 months. I’m 19m and shes 17f. In that 18 months I absolutely loved her, we were golden and a sort of couple you’d see in the movies. Typical teenage stuff. Out of now where in around September 2019 I found out she’d been speaking to another boy, not just one but a load of guys that she’s met on an app before I met her. She’d been speaking to them since we got together the previous October.

This was extremely messy and to cut a long story short we got past it and I have her a second chance, I thought she was young and stupid and she promised to change. Trust was never fully there as I hardly trust anyone but I thought she was a good girl, she is a good girl so I at least had the trust to believe she wouldn’t do it again. Since said September things have been rocky and recently something felt off. You could have guessed I found out she’d been talking to the same boy she’d been speaking to the first time around. I found out around a week ago, she’d made a fake snapchat etc. I asked her about it and told her I’d find out and she came clean. 

Currently with the covid 19 situation going on we’re taking a 3 week break before saying much. She said she wants to change and she needs space and time to do that, she doesn’t want to be that person anymore and for some reason I believe that. After the next 3/4 weeks we’re going to come together to see what’s best but for now we’re not speaking and only saying goodnight. 

Tonight she came to me and we got talking about her father who passed away a year before I met her. Even though I’m obviously hurting I still let her know I’m there for her if she truly needs someone as two wrongs don’t make a right. I care for her happiness and if she needed someone to be there, I’d still step up. So we got talking about how she’d been grieving today particularly badly and eventually she said it helped a bit..

Here’s the issue. She went to bed and just said goodnight and she’ll see me to say goodnight same time tomorrow. Am I wrong for wanting a simple thank you? She’s cheated on me again, for the second time and I’m still there for her. Im hurting but I stilll want to see her happy and would put myself through the pain to help her tears. Am I wrong for wanting to tell her “A simple thank you goes a long way” or would that be out of order?

* I rent out a room in my house to a friend.

* I charge him about a third of the mortgage and no utilities.

* He was working and making good money until things started shutting down.

* He voluntarily quit his job because due to lack of business because he was going to be making half of what he was before. The job is waiting for him whenever he wants to go back, or so he's been told.

* He was planning on taking some time off due to stress anyway and has 6 months worth of expenses(including rent) saved up. Possibly more now that certain loans are being delayed.

* I am still working full time, from home.

* The full mortgage is about half my monthly salary.

* In the past when he has been unable to pay rent due to cashflow issues I started a tab which took about 3 years for him to catch up on but has been current ever since(about 2 years ago).

* He has not asked me to not charge him rent.

I feel like since I am still working and can afford to do so, maybe I shouldn't charge him.

I see a lot of hate out there for landlords and I do not want to be one of those that is demanding rent from people that cannot pay in these hard times.

34,"the past few weeks he's been making fun of her right when she's in earshot, lashing out on her for the smallest things even when they're his fault or an accident, just being very disrespectful overall.

i don't think it's bad enough for a divorce, they're not screaming at each other, it's just my mom doesn't stick up for herself so i feel the need to, and then suddenly i'm ""disrespectful"" and ""talking back"". whenever i tell him how rude he's being he just laughs because his masculinity is too fragile to ever admit being wrong. 

my mom has a fever and she's under so much stress from work yet she stills cooks dinner and cleans and helps with anything we need while my dad stays on his laptop all day.

35,"**Background Info:**

I am a sophomore in high school living in the US. This year I started my own nonprofit volunteer organization to teach conversational English online to underprivileged kids around the world. I am personally experienced as a teacher because I taught online with another volunteer organization for the past 4-5 years, but I am not very experienced with managing a team. In the past few months, I've recruited around 25 teachers from my school and we've started numerous classes with kids in China.

**Problem:**

I have an officer team which consists of mostly the friends that were with me when I just started the organization. They have specific positions such as ""VP of Student Services"" or ""VP of Internal Management"", and I delegate tasks to them such as helping students sign-up for our program or observing new teachers to give tips. Two months back, I noticed some of them were not very motivated or had work that was not exactly of quality. In an effort to improve this situation, I implemented new rules that would have everyone reapply to be an officer once a semester. I also introduced ways to measure the officers' performance, such as the number of students or teachers he/see recruited. This has helped decently and I see that my officers are overall improving. 

**Specific Questions:**

1. It's almost time for us to have an officer switch (old officers and anyone in the team can apply). How should I go about this officer switch? Should I review all the applications with the current officers (conflict of interest)? Should I look at all the applications by myself (people might see me as too authoritarian)? Or should I do a combination of these two? This is the hardest question for me, and also the most urgent. If anyone could help that would be great!

2. What questions should I be asking on the application/interview? My ultimate goal is to have Motivated AND capable officers.

3. Any other general suggestions (how to motivate my team, how to communicate these ideas without angering people, etc.)",08Apr2020,1

47,"Hello,
I thought a lot about posting it here and I felt a little bit ashamed because I feel like I have kids problem but it is really destroying me

So I met this girl 2 years ago on a video game and I felt in love , she was in a 5 years relationship but left her bf for me, we dated for 1 year but I never had the chance to met her ( she said she was too ugly etc and facetime was different from real life )

After this year, I broke up because thing weren't going well anymore but she was still in love with me during 2/3 months, after 2 month, I felt in love again 

 But in September I went to studies and I was home only weekend so we didn't play anymore and as I was lonely and by myself, she, forgot me 
Then all started to fuck up, I started to be dependant, 
I was all her life and all of a sudden I become a random guy, take 3 hours to text back etc so I became boring. And of course we were arguing a lot which fucked us up, things went worst etc and it's been like that for 7 freacking months now
This destroyed me and keep destroying me, I've been hurt a lot, like really a lot and I feel pain everytime now. 
For example she said she regret she left her ex, and that she speak to him again because it make her feel better  ( ""do you love him?"" ""Idk"" )

And today I am stuck home so I play again, I tried to block here and forget everything but it's not possible, for 1 week I spent my days at bed thinking about her
I feel like I've tried everything ( in 7 months trust me I have )
 I came back as a new man, I said to myself ""ok I will give her space, I will do my own shit"" but nothing work, when I hear her voice I became strange, when she speak to other the way she doesn't speak to me anymore I'm falling apart. When I see the lack of interest she have about me, when we are in vocal with other people and she spend her time writing to everyone but not a single msg to me. I am being very jealous about the attention she give to everyone but me .

 Also that whatever happens she won't ever be on my side, whatever I say she has an answer and she is always right and I am a liar/ dumb guy
And now I can see the effect that has on me, I'm trying to find new way to reassure me and I am starting to be really worried about myself, I even woke up in tears because I had a nightmare about it few days ago, I'm not in peace even when I sleep
I told this story to a few people, talking about it make me feel better indeed, but I am for once mainly in research of advices. I don't ask for a way to be rid of her but for a way to feel better

50,"I know love is a strong word. I’ve never felt this strongly towards someone, no one I’ve met or known. We’ve never met. We started out friends, then I started to express my feelings and he did too. Turns out he had similar feelings, and we flirted a fair bit. He’s never been with anyone, we’re both still quite young. 

He made me blush, smile all day and feel like I was in a movie to be honest. Other times it was harder. Because we’d talk about meeting one day but we’re struck by the reality of money and he won’t wait. He’s an eager man, he doesn’t like long distance relationships and says he couldn’t be in one. So although we flirted, I never asked him about dating because I knew he’d say no. I know how he feels about dating someone he can’t be with in person and he doesn’t like it. 


I said something stupid, I was foolish and hurt. I asked whether he ever actually cared because I started feeling like he didn’t. Not because he gave me less attention, he was still the same, but because the idea of us meeting seemed so impossible to him. It made me feel he didn’t care. I felt he liked me but didn’t want to commit because he could find someone else in the meantime. So he really hated me asking whether he ever cared, he recommended we stop talking for this week because it’ll only end in heart break. And I agree, I’m already heart broken over the fact that despite all this, I may not mean much more than a crush to him, but I’m sure I could be much more heart broken in the future. He’s said he really really really likes me, but I don’t know what that means. It can’t mean much if he wouldn’t be willing to go long distance right?


After this week, what do I do? He said things could never be the same since it’s not fair on me, but I don’t want to lose someone I deeply care for romantically and someone who is one of my greatest friends. I can’t simply drown out my time with friends in real life, I don’t want to and I can’t exactly leave the house unless necessary because well this pandemic. I don’t spend a lot of my time doing productive things at home, like writing and working. I don’t believe I need to forget about him, I need to make it up to him because I haven’t stated this, but I’ve done some stupid things in the past too so I don’t expect him to see me the same way after this.

TDLR: I've fallen for one of my best friends whom I've never actually met and he (I don't know to what extent) likes or liked me back but I've messed up and hurt him because I was hurt by the reality.

59,"I've had this lifelong sensitivity problem where I get easily upset when I come across opposing opinions on subjective topics (books, music, movies, etc.) that I really enjoy.

As an example: let's say I'm a big fan of some band. I often find myself feeling upset when reading or hearing people say they ""don't like their music."" Obviously, the degree of unpleasantness correlates to how softly their opinion is expressed (e.g. ""It's not my thing."" vs ""They're absolute shit""). But even when they explain why they feel a certain way (e.g. ""The melody sounds weird to me"") I still end up feeling pretty irritated and upset. 

I think the subjective nature of the topic is important in this discussion. If the topic is  objective, I can pull together logical arguments in my mind about why I have my own opinion. However, when the topic is clearly subjective, as it is in the arts, the only explanation is often that *people just have different tastes.* (The melody might sound weird to you, but it doesn't sound weird to me...)

My brain knows all this, but I *still* get upset, to the point that I go out of my way to avoid opinions that differ from mine. Which I know is incredibly unhealthy and unhelpful.

64,"Rigt now, I'm currently living in an apartment in the town ""Smith"", but I really want to move to ""Johnson"". 

I'm in my lease from now, until the end of July 2021, however since I'm in a college town I could (kinda) easily sublease and move out in July (If said school announces that fall semester is online before I sublet then I'm stuck). This means that I would have to make arrangements to find a sublease, a company that's willing to move me (it's one hour away and I don't have enough friends here to help me), and make arrangements to move to the new place in Johnson. Also due to the dynamics of the location where I'm renting, July is really the only good time to do a lease takeover of this nature.

The pros are that I'll be in a location closer to my SO, closer to my family, and closer to more potential job opportunities in my field. I'll also have no issues with keeping my current job if my move.

The cons are, it's already a careful balancing act between finding a subleaser, making moving plans, and finding a new apartment. There's only really one good complex in Johnson that I absolutely would love to live in (town is generally sketchy, except for this one nicer part, I'm going to be living alone and I'm not comfortable doing so in sketchier parts of town).

Things could easily fall through, between a subleaser being flakey about signing, the fact that I already wouldn't be comfortable with signing until late april (my state's coronavirus peak is supposed to be in early May), having to make moving arrangements and hope the movers don't close down if things get bad, I may not be able to get an apartment in the place that I want to since I'm not able to make arrangements to move as fast/early as I wanted to due to the virus. Also, moving is incredibly expensive and with the economic uncertainty if I were to make arrangements to move and then lose my job, then I would have no choice but to move anyway and spend a lot of money from my savings.

If I stay down here, I have less job security (It's looking like I'll be able to keep my job through the worst of the virus (aka at least this wave), but long-term once the virus settles down there's a chance I may be let go because I am very far from my office (I'm redacting a lot of work details because it's a complicated circumstance). Also, I'm further from my family and friends, and especially my SO- the distance is really hard since we can barely see each-other since we can now only see eachother once a week instead of daily (If I stay down here, even after the crisis is over I'll still only be able to see them once a week). 

The pros to staying down here is that it's less stress on my older cat, it's less stress to worry about moving on top of society possibly collapsing, and the apartment itself is pretty nice. Also, I won't have to spend money moving which will help a lot if I somehow lose my job.

I guess I'm just confused because common sense is stating to stay down here and ride out the pandemic even if it sucks ass, but there's so many cons of staying in Smith that I desperately want out. I love Smith as a town and I can see myself visiting often, but as far as life opportunities go it really don't have much. I miss my SO, and I'm realizing my parents are starting to get older and I'd like to see them more.

Okay, so I’m [22F] moving in with my boyfriend [22M] next month, and I’m really excited, but I started freaking out over the weekend. Maybe it’s just that I’m already anxious because of work and what’s going on around us and the world around us or I’m slightly crazy and over analyze everything, or maybe a bit of both haha. 
But anyways, I live on the southern border of a state and my boyfriend lives on the northern border of the state south of me, so it’s only like an hour away, but a different state.

I moved 4.5 hours away and to another state for college, but I did that for me and not for anyone else, and I’m not close with my family like he is. A couple months back we got drunk at my roommates birthday party and he told me that if we ever broke up he’d probably end up killing himself within a month. I know he was drunk and he probably doesn’t remember telling me that, but now I’m too afraid to argue, fight, or bring up any of mine or his insecurities because I don’t want to rock his boat too much. I know he would marry me tomorrow, but I want to give it more time, and that’s stressing me out too.But the pressure of me fucking up or ruining his life is stressing me out and I’m nervous about moving in with him.

However today we got a complaint from the landlord saying that they have gotten ongoing complaints about noise from our unit. The complaints said that we run around and create deafening noise at night preventing them from sleeping and move furniture around between the hours of 11pm-7am.

My family finally called the cops but when the cops got here his family lied and said everything was okay. It’s been about two weeks now and everything is back to normal and they act like nothing happened. I don’t want to be in the same room with this man. And he comes over every damn day. Eats, makes a mess and asks for money before leaving every time. He’s got two kids that he doesn’t take care of my mother in law and I do that for him. He has full custody because their mom is on drugs. But they live with us while he gets to mess around with his girlfriends, yes he has multiple partners and they know about each other. They all lived together at some point but that not why I’m here. Every time this happens his mom blames it on meth. He’s been doing this since he got out of prison 3 years ago but He was on probation for a while after getting out so I think it’s just a cop out. What do I do? Sorry for the rambling I have a lot more to add but I can’t. Forgive me.",08Apr2020,1

70,"I’m a sorority woman. It’s honestly embarrassing at this point. I don’t fit in. I am a gay, sober, sorority woman. I don’t have any friends in my sorority, I used to, but after I relapsed off of my anti depressants they distanced themselves from me after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

I’ve gotten to the point where I try not to care. My birthday was 2 weeks ago and I didn’t get a happy birthday post on our Instagram, which isn’t a big deal. But I made a funny tik tok about it because I deal with things through comedy. My tik tok got about 1000 likes and a lot of people telling me similar things happened to them and telling me to get out of there. 

Then my sorority sisters found the post. They started bullying me online saying I’m irresponsible and I’m insulting our social media chair. It honestly sucks that when I make something with the words “I don’t have any friends in my sorority” that instead of making sure I’m alright I get bullied. I’m so glad to be home with my parents. But I can’t handle the sorority anymore. 

The girls are rude, classless, fake, and most of them are bullies. I will say there’s been multiple girls who I’ve talked to who enjoy me being in the house, but I’m not super close to them. It’s sad. I joined this house feeling great, but currently I’m lost.",08Apr2020,1

I can't stop thinking about the things that stress me out, I get anxious and stressed and I feel like I'm in that nervous state of ""I'm about to puke"" but without the puke and without the end to the feeling. It's constant. Today I slept for most of the hours because that's the only time the feeling goes away.

It's basically my family, my friends, and work stress. Nothing I can outright go and fix, it's just the situations are all stressful, especially work. I want to quit, but it's not an option right now, and they keep eluding to firing me but aren't actually doing it.

It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop... Idk it's been happening for a few days, and that, coupled with my usual depression and anxiety ... I'm inches away from breaking and I just can't keep feeling like this. 

I've tried distracting myself, playing games, doing art, my usual go to activities. But every time I just want to break down and cry. Non of my friends talk to me so I can't even reach out and ask for outside help, or try and distract myself with group activities. 

What do I do? I can't resolve the things that make me feel this way, I can't distract myself... I'm tempted to go to the doctor to ask for help but with what's going on I don't know if I'd even be able to get an appointment, or if they'd even help.

About a mont ago, it started where If I talked about anything family related, they would say stuff like ""wow, too far, my dad is dead and you're gonna talk like that?"" or ""you're not allowed to say that, you still have a dad.""

It might sound like I'm just overreacting about some jokes because maybe that's how they cope with what happened? Maybe they're over what happened and is able to joke about it? That's fine for them but I have asked them multiple times not to bring it up because I really don't work well with the topic of death but they kept doing it until I was brought to tears, after that they laughed and didn't stop.

75,"Hello, 

TLDR: I gotten an apartment to get my peace of mind but parents don't want me to leave and are getting slowly more aggressive. Course of action (given I already have an apartment I can afford)?

Growing up I think there was something wrong with me. I never really felt the love form my parents, I lacked any friends, got depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. I think my unhappiness came from two main sources. The first being a religion I was disgusted with but had to practice for fear of repercussion. I live in Canada so I wouldn't be getting a public execution thankfully but I was seriously worried about going homeless thanks to my dad's threats.

The second source would be my parents. They gave me just enough to get by. I got food, a place to sleep, live, eat, my education. But I pretty much felt worthless and hated myself because of it. My parents felt like super strict religious conservatives. They would pressure me to not go hang with possible friends. I feel like I live under a rock because I don't share the same experiences other families do I think. Even now  I'm pretty much out of touch with others. I don't know how to explain it. But my main thoughts towards them were that I have to be a good faithful child that doesn't talk back and that if I do then its the streets for me. I know now that I took their words quite literally but I didn't want to risk it. Besides what parents threaten their own children like that? Its my normal life so idk..

To avoid going homeless, I lost friends and potential friends I would've liked and focused on university for 2 years until I got my internship that lasts a whole year long. This internship pays pretty well and I've saved all the way up to now to get my own apartment and can possibly afford my expenses for 2 years so I feel confident I'm set.

I broke the news to them that I'm not religious last month  and that went ... okay. They want me to continue prayer and think im going through a phase even though I told them I haven't believed in years... I expected to get kicked out tbh but damn I was surprised. 

I told them I wanted to move twice also but they did not like that. It was mainly just a bunch of yelling and then the next day would be like nothing happened. So I told them recently I got an apartment. My dad implied that I could move but it'd be a 'one way street' meaning no coming back ofc. He hasn't said a word to me since.

My mom came in yesterday telling me to break my lease and to stay home for another 2 years... I really don't want to waste another 2 years of my life. She said I could do whatever but I don't buy it.  Besides you can't break the lease so simply here in Quebec but that fact didn't seem to enter her mind. Also it seems like she cares more about her image because she would bring up what other people thought of our family which I don't give a shit about. I firmly and calmly said no but she said she expected me to cancel the lease for the next day. 

Tonight she was more aggressive and kept on yelling. I hate to raise my voice but also I think I'm a pushover because I really wanted to yell back but just let her carry on. Then she started with more threats praying for my failure if I left and that I have to fork over 50 thousand to make up for what I owed her for raising me. I told her why'd she give birth to me but to no use ofc. 

Dear, reddit... Do I just walk away from this? I hate getting walked over like im an easy target or something. I've listened to them for as long as I could. I would even give up seeing friends because they firmly said no. I feel like I would rather harm myself then live in this 'home' I don't even like. I'm terrible at social relationships including my parents, but it seems like there's no equal grounds to talk on. I'm always hit with ultimatums like 'If you want to move out you have to get married' or 'If you want to be like that you can just leave' (lol because that's what im doing). 

I've done what I could do to maintain my relationship with my parents but seems like If i do move out then I would lose that. Its not like I care what they think honestly. More like I'll be losing another connection in my life that would be useful in the future. Having parents to rely on would be better than none right? But I can't seem to rely on them. I don't even go to them for emotional support. 

What the hell do I do? Am I making the right choices in life? Will I end up dying a terrible death from her prayers coming true? Will I ever become a normal functioning person and fit in with society?

&amp;#x200B;

Debating running away asap before they get more aggressive...

I’m a daily user but they’re very against my habits, however I am an adult and I live on my own, so I make my own rules. However, i am responsible and i only smoke when i have the free time to—i don’t avoid my responsibilities to smoke. My sister smokes a decent amount, too. Our parents know that we do smoke and have called us out individually on multiple occasions, but we’ve never been in serious trouble. Both of my parents smoked in high school but now they’re opposed to it for the most part, for whatever reason. They believe the reefer has serious health effects, like, just as bad as cigarettes. I’ve had some heated debates with them on how it’s not nearly as bad as tobacco &amp; nicotine (which i don’t do either). p.s. my dad uses tobacco products. 
Whenever we’re back home, we typically sneak out the back door to smoke once the rents have fallen asleep. Since the start of quarantine, we’ve become sick of waiting until late at night when they’re asleep, so we started doing it in our bedrooms —plug the door with a towel, candle lit, window open, sploof, perfume—the whole nine yards.

82,"I am 14 and he is 15-16

in 7th grade i was apart of a peer assisted learning group. Basically i played bored games with special needs kids. it was during my english class. I didn’t go very often because i wanted to keep my grade up in english. Plus it was awkward at times and i’m not very good with kids. 

a few days ago one of the kids from that special needs class from one of the kids in the special needs class. I thought it was a bit weird, because it was a year ago. But i replied anyways. It was a pretty average conversation. maybe a bit awkward. 

Now, i’m not sure what this kid has nor is it really any of my business. But he seemed pretty normal. 

He started asking me very inappropriate questions. Like if i was on my period, what i was wearing, what color my underwear was, what color my pee was, and other questions of the same category. seems like he had a weird kink. something i wish i didn’t know. 

I didn’t answer any of those questions. I didn’t really even reply to his messages. He’d spam me and call me but i’d only reply with a “why are you asking” he lied and said that it was because he wanted to be a doctor. He knew that what he was saying was wrong so he lied about it. 

i texted my best friend all of the things he sent me and we both thought it was kind of funny. we always share creepy messages we get from people and laugh about it and this was no different. 

i picked up his call because i’m a bored teenager and i wanted to see what would happen. If you’re here from my last post, this isn’t AITA or a debate post. I don’t feel that it was my job to teach him that what he did was wrong. I don’t want to “make friends” with him like people said i ruined the opportunity of. I’m asking for advice and if you’re here to tell me i’m a spoiled bitch then please don’t comment. I’m not saying that what i did was right, it’s just what happened. So i decided to delete and repost later. Please remember that i’m a minor and you may be an adult.  anyways. 

i’m stupid. I picked up his call. Please know that he had called me probably about 10 times in a day. This is google hangouts. from my experience you can’t block people, only delete conversations but you’ll still receive new messages. my school flags certain messages and i was scared i would get in trouble. i’ve been sent down before and forced to talk about a girl that said she was gonna beat me up even though i didn’t want to. 

It started off normalish but he got inappropriate. i told him he was creepy and hung up. he apologized and called again and again and again so i picked up. more creepiness and weird questions. he called for the last time when he went into the bathroom and asked me to watch him so i hung up and will not answer a call ever again. It passed whatever humor i found in it after that. I told him that it wasn’t okay to do that to anyone and he was worried about me telling on him, and i probably will. these chrome books are school issued and if he can’t handle himself on one... well he shouldn’t have one. 

I have anxiety and posting on here helps me process things sometimes. I’m scared of what will happen if if i get called down to the office. The dean once called my mother because i sounded “too scared.” i was just nervous 

my mom has been emotionally abusive at times. she would hate me if she found out. i tried to tell her about how i thought it was weird and she said she thought it was sweet that he was texting me so i gave up. she talks about how i’m harsh on people and says i’m judge mental when i’m just joking around and i just didn’t feel like dealing with it. i know she’d want me to tell her, and she’d probably call the school. but she’d also yell at me and ground me and with quarantine there won’t be a way to not feel trapped. 

i don’t think i really did anything super wrong and neither do my friends. But i’m scared they’re gonna say that i should know better (which is probably a dumb fear because it’s not like i did much wrong other than pick up his call. but i don’t know) 

he’s still texting me but i haven’t answered and i’m not going to. i took screenshots of everything, though. He makes me very uncomfortable and he talked about wanting to speak with me since last year and he looked me up in the yearbook. 

experiences like these bring back traumatic memories that i try pretty actively to suppress and i know if i cry in the guidance office they are going to feel like this has deeply affected me and call for me to talk to the counselor and i am not about to talk about le tragic back story to her, even though she is very sweet.

Am i in the wrong?

My boyfriend (20) and I (17) are having issues with his family. A few weeks ago, his dad suggested to me that i should quit my job because i am a frontline worker (pharmacy) to the coronavirus. I was like ok ill think about it. Then a week later, my boyfriend tells me that he told me to tell me that i need to make a choice about whether i want to quit my job and not see my bf or quit my job and be able to see him. I of course was shocked, and devastated. I cried the whole day and i was angry at his dad for demanding a major choice from me in such a short period of time. 

That day his dad also texted him saying that the fact that I couldnt make a choice/not making a choice was a choice in itself. I was even more shocked and upset at his dad. My bf was pushing me to make a choice asap. I just got mad at him and told him i need time to make such a big choice. 

So that night i told my parents about this and cried to them. They were of course outraged at his parents, but didnt say anything to them and just supported me. I decided to keep my job.

I thought this was over, but about 2 weeks later my dad was on a call with his dad, and decided to mention the whole situation again, and he asked his opinions about it and his pov. My bfs dad was outraged, and yelled at my dad (meanwhile my dad was being extremely patient and nice because he wanted to maintain their friendship). My bfs dad said that he was in no wrong and that i need to apologise to him for making him look like a bad person or else i will not be welcome at his house again.

I of course was very upset. I called my bf and cried and he was surprisingly on his dads side. So i talked the situation over again with my parents, and we realised this whole thing was mostly my bfs fault. This is because he was the one who miscommunicated the whole thing and made it seem like i must make a choice between the 2 when (apparently) his dad only wanted an opinion on the whole situation from me. 

So we called him and he apologised, which im happy about.

But wait! Thats not it.

Now my bf is pushing me to apologise to his family. Because his dad demanded it. And also because i was largely at fault too in his eyes. He thinks that because i didnt figure out that this situation was his fault and didnt tell my parents earlier that i am at fault. Which i guess is kind of true, but i think that i wouldnt have done anything different, because i was so upset and its hard to analyse the situation perfectly when ur hurt. 

He is still pushing me to do this, in person, to his dad. I emotionally dont think i can. I know this is not an excuse, but my anxiety disorder and panic disorder make it pretty much impossible to do that. But he doesn’t understand and still continues to push me to do it, because he thinks everything will go back to normal if i do.

My parents think im in no wrong and i shouldnt have to apologise if i dont want to. 

At this point i dont know what to believe and what to do. Im not planning on coming back to his house again because i just dont feel welcome there and i have too much anxiety to. 

His dad knows about my mental issues. I have also had some problems with him in the past because he is a very emotional person and acts out super intensely while im there and it causes me panic attacks and i of course overreact.

His mum has done nothing in this situation except for talk shit about me and my family. 

I am extremely stressed and i dont know what to do. Im also in my final year of school and im stressed out about that too. I have been extremely upset and crying a lot and having intense panic attacks every day for the past week. I feel like im going to die.

Okay so a while ago my (now) ex and I broke up very briefly because of a previous issue. We got back together and things were going well until last week. We had been together a year and a half.

So two weeks ago I started to feel nauseous and couldn't hold down any food and then I realized that I didn't think i had a period the month before. Naturally, I started freaking out thinking I was pregnant. I knew I couldn't tell my bf because he'd freak out worse than me and I didn't want to burden him until there was solid proof. I'm in quarantine so I couldn't get out to get a test.

Last week I was having a really rough day with the stress of it and I started a fight with him over something stupid instead if just talking about it, which could have been done very easily. It got pretty heated and he said I should dump him so me, being incredibly stressed and freaking out, decided that that was for the best and i broke up with him. Instant regret. I know it was incredibly immature of me to do and I can't blame the stress because at the end of the day, I still did it.

I think part of me thought that if I broke up with him the situation would disappear (super dumb and naive - I know). The thing is I cannot have a baby, I'm a student, I'm on medication that causes fetal abnormalities if taken in early pregnancy and I just could not deal with a baby at this point in my life. My ex has said on many occasions that having a baby at this age would ruin his life. But at the same time having an abortion has never really been an option for me, I'm pro-choice but I never thought I'd have to go through with one. So when he said 'dump me then' I just couldn't take the stress and i figured I wouldn't have to keep hiding it from him if we weren't together - again, stupid, i know but it was a very on-the-spot decision.

Protection was used btw

I was due my period this month on Friday and when there was no sign of it I messaged him and asked if we could talk and told him it was important. I wanted to know if he remembered if we'd had sex last time I saw him (If we had then I'd know for sure I didn't have my period because it was due that weekend). He responded and asked if I could leave him alone so he could get over me which is completely fair. I figured I'd leave it a few days and if my period still hadn't shown up, then I'd contact him again because as I said previously, I didn't want any unnecessary stress on him.

Yesterday, still no period. I called him and asked him and he said he was pretty sure we'd had sex that weekend. He understood immediately why I was asking. I told him not to worry about it and I'd handle everything myself. Then my stress levels went through the roof. I broke down and text him this morning when I woke up and said I needed him during this time.

I managed to get out to the shop today and got 4 tests. I did two first, thinking 2 would be enough. One of them didn't work properly (the control line didn't show up) and one had a positive reading I think. It wasn't very strong but it was a definite blue line. I decided to do the other two after. There was another faint line (fainter than the other test) on one within the time frame and nothing on the last at first, but after the time frame had ended, a faint line had formed.

Now I'm freaking out and I'm stuck in the house and can't leave because of the virus so there's nothing to distract me. I can't get out to the shop for another few days to get a digital test so I'm stuck here not having any idea how to get through this, and on top of all this, all of my final year university exams and assignments are due soon.

When I'm not freaking out about the possibility of having something growing inside me I'm sitting here thinking about how I miss my ex and how I wish I hadn't been so stupid in letting him go. I told him I missed him today when we were talking but he told me that we're not getting back together. He knows that the reason I dumped him is because of this but he said i must have been considering dumping him for a long time if I dumped him so suddenly - which is untrue. I really messed up with him and because we broke up before over an unrelated issue, he thinks there's no point in trying to save it and doesn't even want to talk about it.

I have absolutely no idea what to do about either situation. I need advice..

TL;DR! - broke up with bf because I was stressed about the possibility of being pregnant

Update - Will have another test by friday and will see doctor if that's positive.",08Apr2020,1

Nothing's been set in stone yet as they're waiting til May to see if this whole COVID-19 epidemic calms down a bit first. Ideally, I'd only work during the summer and during vacations, but the first interviewer mentioned coming down once a month for training which seemed fine for me. Now that I've made my course schedule I'm realizing how hectic things are going to get when I go back to school, especially because I have extracurriculars and a work-study job at school, too. Before officially accepting and starting the job I was thinking of asking about working seasonally, or perhaps working only one or two weekends a month.

97,"So, yeah, the first TV provider I watched was DirecTV decades ago. Then, around 2009 or 10, I switched to Charter Spectrum just because I couldn't afford quantity over price (even though I like having a large quantity of TV channels.) So, then, around 2018 or 19, I got Sling, because I heard it was a cheap alternative to cable. At the time, there were many channels not there like Discovery Family, FOX, QVC, etc. So, then, later, I got Philo. There was very little channels but there was at least Nickelodeon and Discovery Family and Scripps channels. I really wanted the local channels, though (NBC, CBS, ABC), and neither Sling 'nor Philo had them. So, I got an antenna. So, then, this month (or last month), I decided to get Charter Spectrum because I was fed up with how little channels Philo had. I was thinking about getting Sling again, but then I was like ""Screw it! I'm getting Spectrum Gold."" Spectrum DOES have a lot of channels, but the thing is, I've now got both an antenna AND cable. I don't know if the antenna is really necessary. There are some channels you might not be able to get on Charter, but they are further away. The thing about Sling that's MAINLY attracting me to it and making me want it again is the ""Sling in."" commercials. Like, both Sling AND Netflix seem to want to make their commercials ""cool"" just to attract young people. So, they use phrases like ""Sling in"" and ""Netflix and chill"". I've already got Netflix but not Sling. Another reason I'm tempted to get Sling besides the ""Sling in"" commercials is because they say it's a good compliment to your antenna. It seems to be the #1 streaming service to pair with antennas. I don't know if I should use ""modern commercials"", ""Sling in"" and ""pairing with antennas"" as deciding factors, should I? I mean, Charter DOES seem to have a good amount of channels but then again, Sling recently added a few more channels. I could also consider DirecTV again but it's expensive. But one thing I DO know is that my city only has Charter, but some places have Comcast. From what I've seen noline, Comcast is probably better. I guess you could say it's like Charter Spectrum and Dish Network in one provider. It has some on demand channels that can only be found on Dish Network and of course, Comcast, plus it also has similar features to Dish with some channels that can be found on other cable providers like Spectrum. Sadly, I don't live in a city where Comcast is available, and obviously, it would probably be harder to move than it would be to just buy DirecTV or Sling. So, what do you think? Charter Spectrum or Sling? Thanks!",08Apr2020,1
98,"Hi all! With all of the COVID-19 craziness, things have been obviously different for my college courses. I’m in my undergrad for a biomedical science degree and my immunology course has changed our exams to take home exams. I thought, “wow, she’s being really understanding of the craziness of this situation and cutting us a break. That’s really kind of her.” Ha. Wrong. She posted the take home exam today and it’s 40 (!!!) short answer questions, SEVERAL with multiple parts. It’s beyond excessive compared to her previous in class exams, especially when you consider this is a complicated course and her questions are fairly in-depth. 

Honestly, maybe I’m crazy and this isn’t excessive but it seems so daunting to me right now, especially since I am medically essential in my job right now and have been working more (not less, like most students) than I was before. I also have a physiology exam the day before, and my senior presentation (a 20 minute presentation on an advanced research article). I’m just feeling so overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do.

101,"So I'm 22, and a few years ago I registered for university; however, since my grades weren't good enough for the bachelor degree, I had to do an alternative degree, which was made for people already working who wanted to change their careers. My classes were during the evening most of the time. I also had to do three different programs to get my degree, which means I was with different people all the time. At first I didn't mind, I was doing my own thing, my classes were actually pretty specific and honestly, I loved being on my own. 

But now I got more extroverted, I look back and realize that I missed out a lot about being a college student. I couldn't join any clubs or sports team because their meetups were at the same time as my classes (and most ''outside of school'' clubs or activities were during the evening too), I couldn't be part of the school activities because they were mostly made up of regular bachelor students and they all knew each other (I tried to join a competition once, and I got rejected), and not only did I change programs every year or so, the majority of my classmates were a lot older than I was, so it was difficult to make strong bonds and have people to go to events or parties with. Sometimes I look at pictures that my acquaintances post of social media, how many friends they have from school and how many events they are joining together. It makes me sad because I didn't really live this. I always had trouble making friends, so sometimes I wonder if I would be rejected if I was part of the normal college community.

I'm asking myself if I ruined my college years. And if I did, is there anything I can do to ''make up'' for those missed memories or any way to be part of a community and make friends. I'd like to have a more active and social lifestyle while I'm still young.

106,"Me 24F, Him 25M.

We have been official for a month or so, friends for 3 years, friends with benefits for 2 of those years. We have a lot in common and get on really well, we make each other laugh, shower each other with affection when we are together and most of the time through messages also just chatting like friends would too, and we can giggle off an argument but... I can't shake this feeling like I can't fully trust him. When I see a girl I don't know pop up on his messenger (I don't read his phone ofc) for example I think he could be trying to get with them, yet it doesn't seem like I'm projecting because when I speak to my guy friends or any guy, i don't try to get with them.
 I love spending time with him and I love the sex we have but sometimes I think I should end things because I can't decide whether I'm just paranoid or he's sneaking behind my back. The only reason I could believe he might be is he was meeting up with other girls when we were just friends with benefits but now that we're together I don't want to think he would but I can't shake the feeling no matter what he tells me.

- I have spoken about these thoughts to him maybe 4 or 5 times and he has reassured me, a few times he has got annoyed and said it may be best we aren't together because of it if I don't start trusting him.

The thought of us breaking up makes me feel completely alone if I'm honest. Sometimes I feel like I can fully trust him, then I'm not so sure. As you can probably tell from this post, I'm pretty unsure how to feel or what to think. 
I'm not very good at faking emotions or hiding them when they're strong, especially involving relationships so I feel like it would be hard for me to pretend to be fine. Part of me wants to keep it going, enjoy it, have fun with him, possibly bottle up emotions and another just wants me to be alone so I don't have to have a nagging feeling like I'm being betrayed...even if I'm not..
Take into account, I don't hang around with many people, I have a fair amount of friends but over the last few years have distanced myself due to depression and anxiety so only really speak to friends on messenger, meet up every few months if that. I also love having sex and really don't like going without it, but I only really like having sex with someone I'm close with.

I'm wondering, what would you do? honestly, would you stay in it for some fun and intimacy or would you leave it?

tldr: Would you stay in a relationship in which you didn't fully trust your partner (would need to pretend you did mostly) but had fun and shared great intimacy? They haven't really shown signs of being deceitful but you have a nagging feeling they could be doing something shady behind your back. Do you stay, hide your paranoia and enjoy it or leave?",08Apr2020,1

Should i quit my job? I was working in sales( 9-5, 5 day work week), until recently, the employees were cut down in my workplace and those still staying started to have to handle full operations of just below 30 floors on shift work with only around than 10 people per shift with absolutely no prior knowledge or training to what we are doing.

The pay is very low and the workload is absolute shit. We have to do Housekeeping, Garbage disposal for all floors, back of house, cleaner job everything that needs to be done is to be done by us whatsoever the job scope is.

There are currently no proper SOPs in the workplace. Although they want everything to be done, they don't even have the necessary tools to finish some of the tasks we were told to do.

It doesn't sound as bad as it is but on most shifts, the only time we are not doing physical labor or actually have time to sit down is during the meal break that we are entitled to.

Please advice me. I understand it is really fortunate to still have a job in this COVID situation but the workload to pay ratio is absolutely disgusting.",08Apr2020,1
109,"(Rant ahead; I'm sorry for the bad language, I just had to get it out somewhere.)  

Decided to at least chop up some fruit so my youngest could eat something healthy while I tackle the same fucking pile of dirty dishes that I've been trying to get done for the last three fucking days. Of course I've got no clean knives to cut with. Of course I've got no clean chopping board to cut on. Of course I've got no clean bowls to even fucking put it in.  

So when I finally make room in the sink to wash the things I need, to cut up a single fucking piece of fruit, the baby has found me in the kitchen. Great.  

So I pick up the fruit to put in the bowl and what next? I notice a dog hair on it. On the fucking bowl I literally just fucking washed.  

Dog hair because I haven't vacuumed the floor in the last 20 minutes. And just like that, I'm a failure.  

I grab the bowl of fruit, grab the baby and plop them in the loungeroom. In front of the tv. Again.  

I go back into the kitchen to at LEAST fill the fucking sink with hot water.  

I can hear my oldest saying ""No, baby, NO"" over and over again. She comes in, telling me the baby got into her chips. You know, chips/crisps. The salty shit that's bad for you and definitely not good for your kids but at least you don't have to wash a fucking knife and bowl and chopping board to prepare and serve them.  

""Did the baby get into your chips?""  
""Yes.""  
""Were you holding your chips?""  
""No.""  
I angrily snatch the packet from her hands, and fling them into the back of the highest pantry shelf and shut the door.
""Problem solved.""  
She's quiet.  
""You either hold your chips while you're eating them or you put them away where the baby can't get them.""  
She walks away.  

And just like that, I'm the worst mother in the world. And my kids are probably going to be traumatised for the rest of their lives because their mum is an absolute fucking cunt.  

Don't patronise me with your ""oh honey, we're all in this together, isolation is hard"" bullshit. This is a regular fucking day for my kids and I, which we've had regularly long before this virus shit kicked off, and I fucking hate myself for it.  

Don't you even think about mentioning my husband. He works 12 hour days, 6 days a week, studies, cooks dinner when I drop the ball (which is most nights, because not only am I a shit mum, I'm a shit wife too), and is the most incredible, present father. We love him to bits. HE IS NOT THE PROBLEM.  

You can shove your therapy up your arse too. Unless you want to look after my kids for however long it takes for me to talk to some stranger over the phone to fix my problems? No?  

I know of other mothers who have their shit together. They cook healthy meals on time, make sure everyone has clean clothes to wear, keep a clean house, have jobs, actually dress well/do their hair and makeup most days and have more children than me. I know they exist; don't try to tell me they don't. They probably even still have enough energy left to fuck their husbands at the end of the day as well. WHY CAN'T I.

I graduate in December.

Ideally, I’ll be doing an entry level job in my field to build some experience and doing an online Masters at the same time. 

Because of corona and everything going on, i spent some time looking at what is available for rent in the area right now. One thing I noticed is that some places say you have to show proof that one week of your income is equal to the month of rent. 

He would pay his half with the financial aid that would go to on campus housing, plus he has a job at school. I would pay my half with my job. 

Here’s where I need some advice. If I’m looking for a job in a new place (about an hour and a half from where I am currently) I can’t just start working there. But if I need proof of employment I can’t get a place first. I can save up so I have first months rent, but I imagine that is not enough.  

I guess it’s a mix of looking ahead, virtual interview, and an offer letter as proof. But I also imagine renting isn’t a quick process. I’d have to accept a position with a month out start date, or would it need to be longer? 

Also, what would I do in the interim between graduating and then moving? Would a 5-6 month break job look too short and make me seem unreliable? I guess if I found a job that could transfer me to a different location it would be ideal, but that doesn’t seem like something to hold out for.

119,"Hello everyone! It's my first time at this sub so I hope it's well redacted; but it's something nobody has really given me actual advice for other than ""Hold on"". 

You see, 5 years ago I entered Animation college, and I got in a debt with them and I had to leave mid career because my parents could not afford it and I tried to freelance work along the way and I ended up unable to pay AND with bad grades because I couldn't focus on studying anymore because of said freelancing. I kept working as a freelancer and I've learned way more than I ever did in school; I realized many animation schools taunt students into joining only to leave them stranded with sub-par skills for any studio to work with, and no actual demo reel from my experience and what I saw from my old classmates graduate last year. That's besides the point, however.

Sadly, I didn't come to that realization back in September when I was adviced to study online at another animation school; from which I am really learning nothing but I am supposed to graduate in two years and a half; a shorter career basically, but it'll give me a degree. The thing is, I am the one paying for my own education now as I've been able to work a lot, thankfully; so the burden is on my own shoulders. 

That's however, where my issue comes from. I live in Mexico (hence my somewhat messy english here and there, I apologize for some weird phrasings); a third world country still, and we don't have a developed animation/game development industry and in general, a degree paper is still highly valued over skills. I have plans for making my own studio saving with my own money and I don't plan on working on studios or as a mere freelancer forever, though.  Because of this, friends and family don't want me to drop out, however economy is incredibly rough in here and it's hard because I have to pay for many things, and that includes of course my career... 

...Is it worth it, though?  I feel like I should just quit that career (It's also a somewhat shady school that will make me pay a forfeit payment and in some cases I've read, they keep sending you invoices for you to pay the monthly wage even after leaving and send you into credit bureau; I didn't know this back in September either though, I just joined because everybody said it.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am studying online and I feel like I really don't need the paper even though everybody wants me to get it in case I do need it in the future.

Protip: If you want to study animation and require to learn from an institution, atleast in a third world country, go for fine arts to polish your drawing skills and then tackle animation. It'll save you a lot of disappointment.",08Apr2020,1
120,"So everytime a girl tries to start a convo with me and flirt I just completely freeze, and ghost. I get why, because my ex girlfriend bashed me quite often for being very extraverted and now it made me introverted, I can barely talk to friends, but it still works. But I often have a lot of interest in someone and just can't do anything about it because I get shy and scared I'm too ""intense"" and now I lost my personality and I just feel completely lost and insecure. Is there any any any way to learn how to be confident with myszlf and my sexuality enough to dare to get a convo with a girl?

121,"Here’s the story. My school advisor talks about me behind my back with my other professors. Just now, one of my professors CC-Ed an email regarding my performance. 

He literally said “OP doesn’t do well in that course. I’m thinking about putting him on probation because I don’t think he’ll make it further in the program. He doesn’t have what it takes to become a doctor.”

I had family issues in the past couple months. I’ve lost a parent, and some friends in the span of 3 months. I’ve mastered through everything and came out with passing grades in the last semester. 

The professor who CC-Ed me the email is concerned that this guy is not a good fit for me. I’m headstrong, and I put everything as straightforward as possible.

I’ve had issues with this guy before. He’s not too fond of me, and especially since he detests the fact that anything aside from medical studies is important.

I’m a brass player, and have been playing the brass family for 15 years. I do musicals and shows on the side for my own enjoyment. He’s gone to the measures of blocking me out of these classes so I can specifically only take the courses he wants me to take. The funny thing, these courses are either taught by him, or his best freind (Another teacher that really despises me)

I have a professor that’s willing to advise me. I’ve been good friends with him for many years now, but the only thing is timing. He’s only free in mornings because he works night shifts. 

I don’t know what I can do. How do I switch advisors without confronting this arse-hole? Who should I speak to in my university?",08Apr2020,1
123,"Hello, my name is Lance and I have a story to tell and the outcome of my story is not what I ever wanted or the outcome I wished for. I know life isn’t fair but it’s ruining me. My story starts off freshman year. I’m the first kid to go to high school. I had no clue what a sat was or what a gpa meant. I went to a new school and didn’t know anyone. I did good and made some friends but met my first girlfriend. I didn’t want to be with her but she guilt tripped me into dating. Long story short she both physically and mentally abused me and I have a restraining order on her. This whole event created trauma and made me depressed over the summer. In the fall I was vulnerable and was taken advantage of by an evangelical cult. They were anti science anti college and anti school. My strong religious beliefs pushed my friends away and left me lonely. They told me only god matters and school is a giant scam. They said don’t go to college and don’t worry about school. They told me I must believe This made me not try in school. I was bullied sophomore year and it made my grades worse. He used to push me around and punched me. He made fun of every aspect of me. I became so insecure and ashamed to be me. I never wanted to go into public or participate in society. I felt worthless. Thankfully he is expelled. I am a junior now and have straight As and am working towards making friends. My past defines me. I can’t go back and fix things and it bothers me. I want to go get it but it haunts me. I want to get into a college in Miami to get a fresh brand new start and prove who I truly am. I don’t have amazing grades tho. It can be better but I’m trying everything.(3.9 gpa) if anyone has solid advice let me know. Thanks for reading",08Apr2020,1
124,"Hello, so due to all these COVID things and not having a right sleeping schedule from school being away, I've been often going to sleep at around 4-6 am and waking up at 2 pm. It's pretty unhealthy, I know but something strange happened yesterday my mother said as she went to check on me as I was sleeping.

Yesterday I remember going to sleep at around 4:45 am or 5 am before being unconscious as sleeping goes. Apparently, at around 7 am when my mom went to check on me, she said my eyes looked towards her and I was freaked out. I was half asleep she said and I was screaming but not like loudly since I was tired/half asleep. I apparently tried to get up from my bed before my mom tried to secure me in my bedsheets making sure I was alright and nothing was happening. She said she thought she did something wrong as I was so freaked out like someone bad was in front of me.

I don't know what to do or what this really is. I don't remember anything of that happening, I just remember going to sleep at around 4:45/5 am and waking up at 2 pm. Did I just have a bad dream or was in an awkward resting/awake phase? I don't have any mental issues, medical issues, or like bad thoughts or anything, and especially not towards my mother or family and this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me, despite going to sleep like this for a while. Really I really only have this bad sleeping schedule I think, The only reason I could think to be afraid is I would try to like go to sleep before my mom woke up so she wouldn't know I was still awake at this time so maybe I just got freaked out that I was still maybe awake when she woke up? Again I don't remember any of this. I am just very worried about what I did/would've done and if this means anything. If anyone can give me some reassurance or maybe some insight/advice on what happened it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you! :)",08Apr2020,1

127,"Hello lovely people!

This is a new account but not a throwaway, my family and friends know my other one and I don't know that I want to ask them for advice on this. Sorry if it's a little long. Also sorry if I go to bed and don't see your responses, I'll try to get back to you soon! Appreciate you in advance!

So I guess the advice I need is on gender. I'm biologically female. I've always used she/her pronouns because it never really occurred to me to use anything different, and I present as mostly feminine or neutral (I'll wear a dress now and again but mostly pants and sweaters, my hair is longer, I shop in the women's department, I think I have foundation somewhere in my house). But I've never felt tied in to womanhood. Everyone always talks about sisterhood and this idea that women are WOMEN and that this female-ness is an inherent part of their identity. I just haven't felt that, at all. As a queer person I am attracted to women, but I don't feel like ""part of the club."" I just assumed I wasn't that social, or that if I got involved in women's causes it would come to me, but the older I'm getting, the more it bothers me. I think about it a lot and ""woman"" just doesn't seem to fit quite right. But I'm certainly not trans either. 

But it's gender. Shouldn't I always have known? I've known I was attracted to women since I was like 11, but now I'm 23 and I feel like something about me is wrong. I don't understand it. Has anyone been through something similar? Was this even coherent? Thank you, again. 

Please stay safe out there. Or rather at home. ♥️",08Apr2020,1

134,"So I (19) made a post elsewhere on this, I was in a fit of rage, so what I wrote wasn't very good, and my responses to comments weren't amazing either. I got dragged through the dirt in the responses, I don't want that to happen again.

So here it goes...

My gf and I have been together for 8 months, and around 6 of which she has been living with her sister and up until recently her sisters ex, as she was kicked out of her foster home. For around the last 2-3 months, we have been living together in that house, up until two weeks ago. 

The sister kicked me out 'because of whats going on right now with the virus', which was a cover-up as she wanted to spend time with her ex before he moved out (which she told my gf later). It was then dictated by the sister that I wouldn't be coming back until this is all over. My parents are separated, one has let us stay over (only whilst my younger sisters weren't there), and one flat out doesn't even allow her over.

The likelihood of me going to my gf's house decreases every day (they just lost a pet), to the point I feel its personal. My gf and I both feel as if its her sisters way, or the highway. No discussion can even begin over any point or rule she makes in the house, despite the fact that they both pay equal rent and bills. A clear example is when the sister told her I am not allowed over anymore. My gf began to cry, and walked off to her room. As she was doing this, her sister walked behind her and criticised her for crying, and continued to lecture her. This is all despite the Victorian Governments (I live in Australia) ruling that they will make an exemption to the social distancing rules so that partners who don't live together are allowed to go and see each other. 

I'm not really looking to get name-called again. Last time I was referred to as being selfish, self-centred, arrogant, etc. but I was highly emotional, and I don't think I worded it very well, in a way people didn't clearly see what I was asking, and probably saw it as a rant. 

I know that this isn't my fight; it should be left to my gf and her sister. But it affects me (I've been experiencing a lot more negative emotion than I would usually, and its not good) and it affects our relationship (intimacy, face-to-face interactions, spending time together, missing milestones etc.). I need advice as to what to do? Do I try and talk to the sister? Leave it to my girlfriend, providing support to her throughout discussions with her sister? Just accept that that's the way its gonna be? I just need some help.",08Apr2020,1

So one night I threw a party. She was there and so was this chick with her bf.  She was flirting with everyone there, and I mean everyone. But I found her attractive and started talking to her, and that means she started flirting with me as I was flirting with her. So the night went on and I drank more and more. And then she asked me where her and her boyfriend would be staying. I told her to follow me and I kissed her. I remember her kissing back. So I told her to follow me Into the bathroom where I kissed her again and she pushed me off. I was drunk and misread the whole situation. I apologized for making a move. I was not aggressive just sloppy drunk. But I felt horrible and went and told my gf. She then yelled at this chick and accused her of leading me on since I was highly intoxicated. It was my fault for making the move tho. I ended up dumping this chick cause she deserved way better. She agreed and is now happy in a relationship.

Some context on this story

\- I have a work from home at 2am-11am , He on the other hand has all the time in the world since he doesn't work for now as the retail store is closed.

\- Lately He spend his time watching Kdrama in Facebook , so I introduce him to netflix, which kinda ate most of his time , like almost to the point as before I message him and he will say that he is watching netflix but now he doesn't respond, I think He off me at my messaging notification.

\- we aren't as out yet as a couple (gay couple) , but I post him on my wall , he post me on his stories , weird thing is , one time I commented ""love"" on one of his fb post and he deleted the post, one of my mutual friend say that he got on fight on one of his post with his friend about politics and deleted that post as well (which I never saw the post btw)

\- we like to play this game Mobile legend , since he started binge watching he never invited me to play the game again now, he also change his icon pic from his face pic to a sad devil emoji

Again , I just find it weird , most of the time I get a seen or he doesn't message as he used to (which is funny because when he was working , we always update all the time) Half of my friends said something is up while some of my friends say that since there is nothing to talk about since it's quarantine that it's fine and I'm just Paranoid, It's weird to get an advice here , but I need all the thoughts that I can get ...should I confront him ?

Today I brought the topic up again but my parents said I will not go. My father even said that I should just get a small career here. Now this is what led to a HUGE argument. How can they say this when they sacrificed their lives to come to a different country just to tell me to conform? How can they tell me this when they clearly saw how much effort I had put in ALL of my high school career? Not only that but it pained me to know that they do not trust me enough to be able to go to college that far away. I feel like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and they just can’t see that.

(F13) I haven’t been truly happy in 5 months, this passing time I’ve felt overwhelming sad, if not sad I feel nothing, numb. I can watch a movie I like and laugh and things like that but right after it’s back to normal. I don’t want to die, I don’t think I could ever commit suicide, yet there’s always this thought in the back of my head saying that if I can’t take this feeling anymore just end it. This thought comes in my head everyday, like a plan b. I don’t want to think like that. But I feel so unbelievably sad. I can’t make myself happy, no matter how hard I try, I want to be so happy so bad. But I can’t, and I don’t know what to do, other than ending my life.

My boyfriend’s (22M) brother’s girlfriend, let’s call her Ashley and the brother Jake, is being terribly reckless during quarantine. On April 3rd, her and “Jake” went to a party with at least 8 people in attendance. I know this because she posted the party all over snapchat. 

This pissed me off anyways because Jake and my boyfriend live together and I visit their apartment often. Ashley also stays over there most nights of the week. So they already were disregarding my boyfriend’s safety, my safety, and their own.  My boyfriend attempted to ask Jake about this party and why they thought that was okay. Jake said that “they knew everyone there though”. Wow. Idiots. 

Now here’s the real big problem. Ashley works WITH CHILDREN. I hoped that she was done working last week and this wouldn’t be an issue. But today she posted on snapchat pictures with toddlers and her kissing their cheeks. (I feel like this is its own issue in itself...sigh) Ashley went to a party during this pandemic, brought all those germs to my boyfriend’s apartment, and then brought them all to a daycare. 

What do I do? Do I email the daycare my concerns and what I know? I feel like morally I can’t just sit here knowing all of this. She’s putting children and their families in danger. I’m scared, angry, and so frustrated. Help!!!

TLDR: Girl dating my boyfriend’s brother works at a daycare and has not been practicing social distancing. She went to a party on April 3rd and has had shifts at the daycare this week. I am scared she’s risking infecting babies, toddlers, my boyfriend, and even me. Looking for advice on if I should contact her daycare or what I could do.",08Apr2020,1
149,"So for the context and as the title suggests everytime we have a quarrel, My brother always belittle me because he is now a teacher and I'm still a student so, he feels he has the ""right"" to do it, and Im a Gamer and has a PC that's about to be completed. I only did this because I want him to watch Netflix without any complains about connections, and others as he always does complain about it.

So here's the story, Last night, My friend told me that I can boost the Internet Band to 5Ghz, and gave me instructions how to do it, so I asked permission to my brother if I can reset the router as I can't acces the Router admin account as he and I forgot the password(He and I are the ones who only knew the password but forgot it), and said that I have to wait till midnight because that's when everybody's asleep and so I waited, as soon as they were asleep, I started doing it, and at that time I can still acces the  admin page but couldn't log in because as I've said, I forgot the Account. So I did reset the router to its Factory settings, and as soon as the router connection got back, it prompted me to a site where I should change the Wi-Fi password. So fast forward, I changed the password of wifi and as well as the admin Page, and got connected to the Internet, Now, I typed 192.168.1.1 as it is the address, Im surprised that i can't access it no more.

So when morning came, my brother asked me about the Wi-Fi password and did so told him, he wants to change the password back to the old password we used, I told him I can no longer access the 192.168.1.1 we did everything we can, from the cmd, Wi-Fi IP address in the settings, change the Address to see if it loads but nothing, this is where the time he got angry about it, he told me ""Why did you reset it though?"" I said, ""Of course, to improve our connectivity a little bit so we can all enjoy it""but then he furiously said ""No, you didn't do it for Us, you did it for Yourself, you did it so that YOU can have benefit from it, YOU only think about yourself and only YOURSELF, For what? for your games? now we can't access the page because of it""(We live in Philippines so Internet really is an issue here) I got shocked and replied to him in an ungrateful manner, ""WHAT? I did it for Us! I did it because I think it'll improve our connectivity,I did what I think is right, there'll be no loss if we just try it right? Im sure we can find a solution from the internet if we just stay calm"" then he started spitting very hurtful words ""No, You are selfish, you are only doing this because you want your games and all, you have done nothing in this house other than just be lazy and shit, and I have the right to complain because I pay for it, I pay for all the things we eat here,(which is not true, and yes we live in the same house because we practice extended family) I pay for the bills here(which is again, not true), and how about you? Did you pay for all this shit? You son of a bitch,(yes he called me that in front of mother) and how dare you talk to me like that?"" i said ""But then you insulted me"" he said, ""Who cares? It's true right?"" (He is really known to judge me, and only see my mistakes, he doesn't see my worth, my efforts and my concerns, all he sees is my despair and make fun of it, he sees me as a black sheep in the family, he sees me as a worthless person, where in fact he couldn't have gotten a job if not for mother who was a Principal at their school). We had continued to quarrel for a bit telling me how worthless of a person and a son I am,  until Mom kicks in and scolded us, this would've been much much easier if he did not start insulting me and talking trash to, Now I'm crying and so down, I don't know what to do, he felt happy when he saw me crying, and I hate it, I hate being a crybaby that I am, well he made to what I am today, Back when we were young he always teased me and hurt me and felt rewarded if he sees me cry, now, I know my story is kinda messed up in terms or storyline and I apologize for that as I am not a native English speaker, here I am now in my room crying, and having existential crisis, I feel that I want to get out of this house, I want to get away from him, seeing him being happy that I am in sorrow, More worse, I want to die, I feel that I wish I can disappear in their lives to make it easier for them, I've done all my best that I can to prove him wrong, High grades, Sports achievements and all.

Hey guys. I (15M) have a dilemma. So I like someone and they like me back (she knows we like each other) but here’s the thing: I had bout 2 years ago and I only just got over them late last year after breaking up with them almost a full year prior. That girlfriend kind of dragged me down with a ton of emotional baggage and that impacted my own emotional state a bit. My new crush is incredibly sweet and we talk a lot and she’s way better than my ex but I don’t want to date her out of fear of 1) I don’t wanna have to lose a friendship like ours and 2) I don’t wanna risk my grades like I did with my previous girlfriend where my grades dropped because I was emotionally invested in her and 3) I don’t wanna risk my emotional state again

I started to think, what if something happened to one of her pets, while she was drunk, and she was too drunk to do anything, and they died? I had a talk with her about it 4 days ago.

156,"I am a 23 year old woman finishing her last college class and living under my mom's roof along with my two school aged brothers. My father passed away 2.5 years ago and one of my brothers (18) has severe Autism and needs a lot of help in day-to-day life, including after-school care and pickup, etc. My other brother (11) has ADHD and needs a lot of reminding and prompting to do his chores, homework, etc.

In 2017, when my father passed, I kept going to school, but by Spring 2018 (the semester I was supposed to graduate), I flunked all my classes and needed my mom's support to continue school. The disappointment of me not graduating on time, combined with a number of other stressors, really took a toll on my mom. In 2018, she was started having recurring panic attacks and was diagnosed with panic disorder. 

When my father was alive, my mom dropped off the kids at before care in the morning, and he would pick them up in the afternoon. Lately (pre-covid19), I have been the one picking them up from their respective after-care programs. I don't prepare every meal, but I cook a large percentage of them. I help with homework, I shower my brother that needs help, I don't pay for the groceries, but I am the one who does the physical grocery shopping, etc. Some days, weekends in particular, I just do not want to get out of bed. But I am never able to indulge that. Without fail, I have to be up by 9am (10 on rare occasions) to make breakfast, or set up for my brother's aid to come work with him, or move some furniture around. It sound silly when I write it out, but it drives me crazy. 

I don't really have much freedom to live my life, it's home, work, the kids, the grocery store, repeat. I also feel massively disrespected on a regular basis: insults about my life choices, restrictions on where I can go and when (such as I can't go out when it's dark. no date nights for me.) My best friend from college invited me to one of her shows and I wasn't allowed to go, because she had not been able to attend my father's memorial (actually, she asked to ride with us because she couldn't afford to uber and my mom refused). The list of little grievances goes on and on. They seem petty individually, but when they add up to make your day-to-day life, it grates on you. I turned 23 in March and lately, I just feel too old to be living the way I am. I have to say ""Mother may I"" for everything and I am just too tired of it. Of course, I am living rent free, which is enviable, but jail is rent-free too - a thought that has become an ungrateful sounding refrain in my head.

$900 or so a month with a roommate sounds like a fair price to pay to be able to manage my time the way I want, have hobbies, sleep in on a Saturday/Sunday if I want to, and not be referred to as a drug addict for smoking weed. I am willing to pay rent in exchange for my autonomy and some respect as an adult.

The solution seems simple: just leave, move out. But here is why it isn't:

\- my 18 year old brother gets violent sometimes. I am the only one able to restrain him (with a tight hug) when he begins to throw, kick, hit, and scratch.

\- my mom's panic disorder. when she has panic attacks, it is terrible. I have not personally experience them, but I know that they are a traumatic thing to deal with. Plus she has been widowed, there is no medication for the pain of losing your spouse of more than 20 years. I cannot do much to counteract the panic attacks, but I give massages, I bring water (that helps sometimes) if it's not around, and just let her know she is not alone while it is happening.

\- we have no one. the neighbors are sweet, but we do not have any family or close friend support in the United States. The couple friends my parents had, my mom does not associate much with anymore as she has been widowed and feels like a 3rd wheel.  The quarantine lifestyle has barely changed our lives, other than less grocery shopping and teleworking instead of commuting to the office.

Even with all this, I want my own life. I want to live like someone who is single with no kids because I am single with no kids. I want to learn to survive on my own and pay for all my living expenses so that no one can tell me ""you can't clutter my house with this lamp"" or ""the bed has to face this way"" or any of those other annoying and seemingly arbitrary rules. I do not want to still be living with mom at 24. I have racked my brain for a solution, but now I turn to Reddit. Help?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr- I'm sick of living like a child and an assistant in my mom's house, but I can't seem to leave without feeling evil (mom has panic attacks, brother has violent outbursts sometimes). But I can't stay forever. Advice?

I don't really get invited to things, and a lot of my friends are graduating next year. I really want to leave to go to a different school, but I feel tied to my school's cross country team.

169,"Backstory: I am graduating from college in May (have already moved home because the dorms kicked us out due to corona). I have a job lined up in texas literally 10 minutes from my parents house where I am currently living. My start date is supposed to be early August, the job is a generic business analyst role at a major bank (think bank of america, chase, etc). My boyfriend has a full time job several states away right now, but his boss just approved him to transition to fully remote and move to Texas so he will be able to live with me. We have lived together for two of our summer breaks and everything is great in our relationship, so that's the only part I don't need advice on haha.

My boyfriend's lease ends on May 31st so he will need somewhere to live starting in June. I found a really nice and reasonably priced apartment that becomes available on June 6th, and I really want to apply for it and sign the lease now so we know where we will be living and can start planning his move and our lives. My boyfriend's parents are strongly in support of signing a lease as soon as possible because they think as the pandemic passes rent prices will go back up, and because boyfriend needs somewhere to live. The only issue is my mom is \*freaking out\* and seems to think its the worst idea ever for me to sign a lease right now. I have no idea if this is just because she doesn't want me to grow up and move out, or if she has legitimate concerns.

Here are some examples of why she wants me to wait:

1) ""we're about to be in a recession and rent will drop, it would be stupid to sign right now"" (again, the apartment is \*well\* within our budget even if you consider only my savings and offered salary, but especially once considering my boyfriend also has a well paying salaried job that he already is working at)

2) ""what if your offer gets rescinded"" (I have enough in my personal savings account to cover the entire lease for a year, so while this would be bad it would not be the end of the world. I also don't think this is likely but you never know.)

3) ""what if we go ahead with our international vacation?"" (we had a vacation scheduled for late May/early June but as it is international there's essentially no chance of us being allowed to go given the pandemic situation. even if we did go the worst case is that we paid two weeks of rent while we weren't moved in yet. this one especially makes me feel like she's grasping at straws to get me to stay at home)

4) ""(boyfriend) can just live with us! your brothers love him anyways"" (maybe viable short term, only my mom likes this option, even my dad is only tolerant of it as a possibility)

5) ""you need to visit it in person at all times of day to see if its noisy and if you really like it"" (I do agree I would like to visit in person and they are offering self guided tours, which she wont let me do because she hasn't let me out of the house because of stay at home orders. Further she says I need to visit \*post stay at home orders\* to tell if it will be too noisy. honestly it might still be quarantine by the time I start my job so idk if that is reasonable.)

Under normal circumstances I would say that getting an apartment in June for an August start date would be completely reasonable, but this pandemic has me doubting everything. If my mom wasn't so adamantly against it I would definitely be applying for the apartment asap because it's really perfect and they only have one unit with the floor plan I want becoming available this summer. Also the fact that my boyfriend and I are adults, have significant savings in case anything goes wrong, and the normal adult thing to do when your lease ends is start a new one, not move back in with your parents or your SOs parents. In general my parents are supportive of what I want to do and usually I just tell them what I'm planning on and they say ""are you sure?"" and then I do it. I think my mom is just having a hard time with me being the oldest about to move out and be a real adult, but also since she's never been so adamantly against something before maybe I'm the crazy one right now.

Advice portion: Are my moms concerns valid? Would it be stupid to sign a lease right now? Should I sign the lease now? why/why not? How should I handle my mom if I sign the lease even though she doesn't want me to?",08Apr2020,1
170,"Hello everyone.  Sorry for any formatting, grammer and spelling issues. 

So I applied for an at home job with WPS health solutions. (I have high anxiety so working at home would be awesome). I'm currently working at a different company, (Normally in an office environment but they are letting us work at home until the stay at home order is lifted. Once it's lifted we are not able to continue working from home) but WPS is 100% remote. I got an offer today and was excited until I started reading reviews on LinkedIn and Glassdoor. 

Most of them are negative.  It definitely is a legit company,  but it has a 2.2 rating out of 5. To put this in perspective,  I also researched where I work right now and the reviews are more positive with a 3.5 overall rating. 

My concern is that if I take this position and put my two weeks in,  that I will find out all these reviews are accurate. Some of them state that they have to work off the clock,  or that they are constantly being threatened of termination (and actually being fired after less then a year of employment. ) They state that the goals are impossible to maintain.( There was also only three semi positive reviews in all. )

I already accepted an offer,  but I am also waiting on my background check to clear. 

Should I write the supervisor and ask about these negative reviews and tell her my concerns to see what her response is? 

It's nearly impossible to find a 100% remote job and I don't want to pass up the only opportunity I might get.

172,"This post will seem immature but it’s created a large argument between my friends. 

To start off, there is a game called Valorant in beta right now. The only way to get into the beta is to have a riot account attached to a twitch account and watch a valorant stream for a chance to be dropped a key. 

I really wanted to get into the beta, so I created 3 twitch accounts and 3 riot accounts to increase my chances (please don’t sue). I had one account on my computer, one on my phone with a VPN to change the IP, and I asked a friend (who I’ll call Paul) to open a stream. 

My friends and I all wanted keys so we could play together. I get one right away, and a couple of my friends get them too. One friend sells his key for a $140 profit. Another friend (who I’ll call Steve) didn’t get a key, but really wants to play. 

Paul ends up getting a key on his twitch account after I get a key, but he can’t play it because he doesn’t have a computer. I am the only one who has access to the riot account, so I’m in control of the extra account with the key. 

I say that I will give it to Steve because he doesn’t have a key, but Paul felt betrayed because he thought that I would sell the key and give him all of the money (which would be around $40). 

The argument ensues over whether the key should be sold or given to Steve. Paul argues that he worked for the key and won the key, so he should decide what to do with it, saying that he would rather have no one play on the account than have Steve play on it. 

In the end, I flipped a coin and it favored selling the key, so I agreed on the condition that Paul and I would split the money because I set up the account for him and the “work” that he did was just leaving a stream on an extra device. He gets even more angry, calling me selfish because I took some of the money.

If I give the key to Steve, Paul is angry. If I sell it because Paul wants to, Steve is angry. We all know each other well and play games with each other a lot, so things are now awkward. Did I make the right decision?",08Apr2020,1

I live with two people that are over 80 and I feel like I absolutely have to keep working because I am so new, because I just got the job, which is adding more stress, I'm worried that I'm going to come in contact with a carrier and I am going to get my grandparents sick.. I feel like I can't do what a lot of the other employees have done, taking the 30 days, paid time off due to virus concerns, I feel like I will lose my job if I leave this early..  it is much more stress than it should be, and it's really affecting me.

I have struggled with my mental health for years.. and I haven't been able to get help for it or get a diagnosis of what is wrong with me. Bipolar disorder runs in both my mother and my Fathers families.. my mother, as well a my primary doctor, told me that it is very likely that I have bipolar disorder.. my doctor gave me a list of therapist in my area but I couldn't afford it  so I never went... In the past few months my mental health has been on a steep decline and the stress from my new job has been making it much worse..",08Apr2020,1

181,"So my partner, John (26), gets his daughter, Sara (7), once a week and every other Thursday. Lately we’ve been keeping her more days to help her mother, we’ll call her Amy, as she’s still working at Walmart . Well last weekend she made a post of her son (not John’s) and her hanging out with a group of friends. 
Now my partner and I have been trying to take all the right steps with social distancing, so this just irritates me that she isn’t taking this serious. I mentioned this to my partner and he immediately messaged her told her that we can no longer take Sara until this virus has calmed down.
Well she blew up (which she has done in the past) and called John, with Sara listening on speaker phone, saying “do you want to explain to your daughter why you don’t want to see her” and basically just going off on him. 
He eventually gave in and now I guess Amy is bringing her here tomorrow. I feel uncomfortable with this, as John and I have a son together and he’s only 1, and I feel like she’s putting her kids and us all at risk by hanging around with friends and potentially speeding this virus. 
I told John I was upset and he says he feel guilty and wants to see his daughter. I told him I understand but this is serious and Amy is still hanging out with people and putting herself, her kids, and us in danger, but he doesn’t seem to understand.

182,"So I live in a 2br 2 ba apartment. Its me (24f) and my roommate (28f). Her boyfriend apparently has been staying here for about a month now. He's here every single day, all day. Now I'm thinking this is coronavirus related, but I haven't asked because I've been trying to keep it light around her because we are basically acquaintances. Its just us 2 on the lease. Would it be wrong for me to ask for him to pay rent, even in the midst of all this? And if I did, what do you think the appropriate amount would be?

So for backstory, we are not close but she is a good roommate. Very clean and quiet and always pays on time, hence why I don't want to rock the boat. My room is bigger so i pay about 100 more than she does. I pay about 800 she pays 700.  It may just be starting to get to me because of the noise, the fact that we are now all home all the time and the fact that she didn't tell me. The last part is what's getting to me the most.

183,"a few weeks ago back when the mall was actually open I met someone I’ve been talking to online. They were friends with my current friends in middle school so that’s how i was introduced, they go to a different high school than us. so we met and it was kind of a date and some softcore sexy stuff™️ did happen nothing serious. also at the end of the date they asked if we were dating and i said we shouldn’t be exclusive because we haven’t seen each other enough in person. that plan was ruined because of things out of our control. 

so fast forward to yesterday i was feeling horny and i normally try to use my imagination and not rely on pornography and role-play chatting because i used to not know how to do that in moderation. But i caved and texted the only person who’s contact i saved after i deleted all my sexual roleplay accounts.

 i did it because i didn’t want to text the IRL crush and seem like i was only interested for sexual reasons and because i’m not comfortable discussing my sexual preferences until it’s more private, intimate, and in person. I still feel like i cheated though. i told that person we can’t roleplay anymore if i get into an exclusive relationship but we’ll stay friends (we’ve never met IRL and actually hadn’t roleplayed in a really long time until yesterday so this isn’t a big issue)

184,"These are the noises I hear from them regularly, for the past couple of months:

1. Every hour of the day starting at 5AM until 2:30AM I am hearing f\*\*\*ing marbles rolling on the floor and being dropped. Alllll the time. For weeks. And it's a different sound than footsteps. I get woken up by this all the time.
2. Aside from that, I'm hearing random screams from the guy. As if he has some sort of mental disorder or something. Today it was from 7:15 until 9:30 pm.
3. Other than that, a month ago time I heard a guy and a girl's voices screaming from up there, arguing, and it woke me up at 4:50AM and lasted until 5:45am.
4. They were having a loud party at midnight on a Tuesday (dunno how many ppl, could have been 3) a week ago with blaring music.
5. Other than that, they've recently adopted wearing what sounds like heeled shoes to walk around the apartment in.

All this amongst other random noises that aren't as annoying but still annoying.I've reported it to the condo management once already and they talked to them. Neighbours told them they understand and they will stop... but it has been about 2 weeks now and they have barely changed their behaviour. I'm hearing marbles dropping/rolling, heels, and thumps, all as I'm typing this at 12AM... I can report it to management again but I don't think they can do much. This is a condo building so the neighbours probably own the unit they're in, so I doubt they can be kicked out or face any real repercussions.

189,"Basically, am I at wrong for him saying he wanted to shoot my siblings point blank as a “””mercy kill”””. All of me and my siblings have been abused, me more so than the others (half-biological). He says he would be putting them “out of their misery”. I say it would be giving them the chance to life the life I got to live after I got out of the house. He has no intention to physically harm the siblings, but it’s disturbing to me he thinks it’s justifiable. I say it’s like threatening to kill my own children because I effectively raised them on my own for several years as a child myself. I hold no resentment for that towards anyone but my “guardians” at the time. They’re a bit fucked now because I’ve had years without them but what else do they know? It wouldn’t be a “””mercy killing””” because they haven’t been given an opportunity to learn or live a better life. I think it’s disgusting and honestly a bit unforgivable what he’s saying, but honestly I’m tipsy and he’s pretty drunk and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t totally wrong here. I did push him several times when he put his hand right in my face which I’ve explained many times gives me major panic attacks because of incidents related to said children’s father. Admittedly I did push and then panic and bit his hand after repeated times of shoving it in my face. But I’ve explained to him numerous times, including leading up to the incident, exactly what sets me off, how to stop it, what he can do and what I will do in return, and anything else you might possibly want to know in this situation.

191,"So, I'm graduating this May. Yay right? And i've been wanting to go back home to Illinois since the minute we moved to a different state. But, I was a minor with parents who wanted to ""start over"" and what I said didn't really matter. I decided that the best time for me to go would be after I graduate so I started looking for colleges ahead of time. My grandmother, amongst other family members, offered her home to me and she's been really helpful and supportive with helping me look for colleges and offering to pay a little of the expenses since my parents never bothered to put any money aside for further education. 

Now to the real stuff. My mom is..... something. She's angry and explosive all of the time and tends to take it out on me and my dad. She has a past and pain thats she's never gotten over, even from long before I was born, and she's been an angry woman. Our relationship hasn't been too good for the last few years, actually since we moved here and I was old enough to understand that she's not a really good person. She says the most insulting things, we sometimes even have explosive arguments after I get tired of not defending myself, simply because she's my mother. She used to hit me, currently makes me feel like complete shit, and constantly invalidates my feelings. I don't think I've ever had a talk with her about anything from what my favorite color is to relationships. In short, I've even contemplated taking my own life just to get away from her for good.. That's how bad it is. 


I've always expressed my want to go back to Illinois and how much I dont like the state we currently live in and she agreed with me 99% of the time. 
When i got accepted into my first college in Illinois, I immediately told her. I was excited and rightfully told her that it'd be in Illinois, so it wouldn't be much of a shock. Her only response was ""So, where your granny is?"" I say yes. She says ok. I just assume she's fine with it. Then 3 months later, after all of the phone calls and me telling her that my granny was helping me with fafsa, she wakes up one day yelling at the top of her lungs to my dad about how my family is ""trying to take me away from her"" (which she has thought since the day I was born because she's such an insecure parent) and that ""my ass isn't going anywhere until I'm 21."" Now legally I know that she cannot force me to stay anywhere with her. I'm legally an adult and can choose to move out and where I'd like to live and attend college, especially if she isn't paying for anything. If i were to get the police involved and even told them half of the stuff I'd been through in the last 4 years, she's probably be in jail or they'd strongly recommend that I get a restraining order while simply escorting me out of the house. But, who wants to have that kind of problem with their mother? 

I'm afraid to even bring up the topic with her. I try to avoid conflict with her as much as possible because it's never pretty and arguing with her/getting called out of my name seems pretty pointless. I'm afraid that if I were to just hop on the plane and leave, shed do something petty like tell the police that my grandma kidnapped me. She's known to do stuff like that, ruin a persons life just because they upset her, and my granny is really concerned about that too and recommended that I made it clear that it was my choice to leave. How do I even tell her? Do I wait last minute until i'm at the airport to send her a long text about my decision? Do i try to bring it up again? I'm really leaning towards the first option.

My girlfriend works at a fast-food chain and recently she told me, two employees that came into work sick one day. I was like WTF, why are you guys still open?! She told me that management was quick on sending them home, but now I’m concerned that the whole time they were working, they might’ve been spreading the disease!? 

We got into an argument recently over this because I said that maybe she should relay some concerns about other employees that aren’t showing the symptoms spreading the virus, but she knows that management or even corporate won’t do anything about it. It makes me extremely upset that she continues to go in for work while potentially being exposed to this. Yes I know that she needs the money to pay for the bills and all, but shouldn’t something be said about how careless they are being?

I just feel like having the restaurant open still is just a reckless move. No one has control over what your employees do outside of the business.

Recently, I binged-read a book series. Then maybe a few days afterwards, I started to think that the main character was in the bathtub (no I wasn't turned on by it. Even if they actually existed IRL and they were in fact in my bathtub, I still ignored it). I don't think I imagined them as naked, and I didn't even fully picture them. My brain just told me that ""this character is in your bathtub"", and I was just like ""yeah makes sense"" and told myself I was stupid. The same day/a day later I was leaning on the back of the couch and my brain was like ""this same character is sitting on your couch (specifically, to the left of the one I was leaning on)"", and I couldn't actually see it but in my mind I was able to imagine them sitting there, meaning that I wasn't alone in the room and I had a friend. 
So there's that, but then I've also recently associated a person with the toilet seat. I literally imagine it as if the person owns it, or as if the person's soul and body is ""haunting"" the toilet seat and therefore I am being watched while doing my business. I also thought the same with the toilet lid and bowl, but as different people. I had to distract myself heavily so that I could actually do my business without feeling uncomfortable.

I haven’t told my friends yet, but as this happened school was shutting down, and in my state school is out for the rest of the year. So I went from lonely to happy to lonely angry and upset. I know this is a first world problem or whatever, but me, a nerd getting a girlfriend who is one of the “popular girls” and is actually a genuinely awesome person was out of left field. But life didn’t give me much time to enjoy it before we have to FaceTime for months and months. We made it a month before this happened. Now I have to wait a while to see her again.

215,"Right hello . I’m 17 from the UK , weed is illegal , not sure what it is classed as but it’s illegal .

I’ve been smoking weed since I was 15 ( I know it’s young but oh well) and for a good year I didn’t get caught until early 2019 when I was caught . I was grounded but still proceeded to smoke . Recently it’s been really getting to me , I’ve been caught a few times recently and I just want to talk with my dad and mum about me smoking . I want to know their opinions of it and I want to give them mine . For a 17 year old I’d say this is pretty mature . 

However my dad likes to think he controls the house , he controls me and tries to run our house with fear . In his mind he’s the leader . That’s not how I think , I believe you need to talk things out and understand each other’s view even if you don’t agree with it .

I’ve been wanting to tell them why I smoke . I smoke because it’s fun , I don’t eat very much when sober so getting high helps me to eat . It also relaxes me and also helps me sleep . Being discrete about smoking is always number 1 . I make sure to hide the smell , I never smoke in my house I either go to my garden (when my family arnt home or during the night) or to a fiends house or a local field.

I feel like I’m pretty respectful when it comes to it . I do understand why they would be worried , drug dealers are supposed to be big scary men but my drug dealer is a nice guy , I know what I’m getting and I’ve never been spiked I always go to the same guy unless he hasn’t got anything I go to another . I hide all my weed stuff away .

I also understand that people think weed is a gateway drug , I have no opinion on that . The only other drug I tried was a pill and I’ve done it once and never tried it again . 

I need your opinion if you guys think it’s a good idea to bring all these points up to them.

Added info : my dad used to smoke weed when he was younger , no idea how old he was or why he stopped.",08Apr2020,1

224,"For context, I don't really keep up with talking to people or am particularly interested in talking to them. I used to be really talkative, but unless I make the effort or the first move, there's not much going on between me and another person. I have felt like I lost interest because conversation can be repetitive, and realistically, people aren't all that different to me. There's rarely been people who stand out, who aren't interested in generic things, or people I can wholly agree with on most things. Maybe it's to do with repetition or something I've grown out of, but it's not that great. And at times, it can be pretty shitty if I need to talk about someone and all I hear are crickets. 

Now, I do think that it's not completely a bad thing. I can focus on what I want when I want, and I end up with a lot of time to myself. But the downside of that is I often don't get to share that time when I want to share it, or I offer to share it but I'm declined.",08Apr2020,1

For several years now, my friend believes he is a skilled rapper, and has these delusional half-baked ideas about starting a producing company and also being a famous rapper. He also has given himself this sort of brand name that is like his company name/rap clique/personification of his whole... whole struggle. He believes this brand of his somehow has value just because he says it does, and that he's going to start this label/producing company when he has no value to his name at all because his music is really bad. He is totally deaf to any form of criticism, and won't look at the situation rationally. He doesn't have the slightest idea about what a company is, yet he throws around terms like ""LLC"" and shit.

229,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We’ve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. All of these things happened from August-March by the way.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then later in the night, I see him hooking up with another girl. I got pissed so I eventually found another guy and we got touchy and I eventually was just sitting on his lap talking and I knew the main guy saw it.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",08Apr2020,1
230,"Hullo everyone, I’m a bit nervous to post but here goes.

I started college in September and moved into residence, but around October my Step sister ran into financial issues and moved into our house. She has this toy poodle dog she got 3 years Ago and I guess has been neglecting training it. Because for the last 6 months, the dog has been peeing on my bed and in my room and it’s only gotten worse since the quarantine. I really don’t know what to do..

To preface, my step dad has been living with us for a couple years now and we had a pretty good relationship. He’s been in my life since I was about 4 or 5 so I feel like he’s a second dad to me. However, since my step sister moved in our relationship has only deteriorated due to this dog...

My mom, brother and I all have bad experiences with this dog peeing on all our things. He’s destroyed 100 dollars + in property of mine, and eaten a bunch of my clothes. I try to remember to close my door at all times, but my door is extremely finnicky and doesn’t close properly. This dog is just intend on running into my room and peeing on my things, and I’m getting really frustrated.

No one seems interested in actually training the dog, so I feel like it’s just going to be this way forever. No one keeps a watchful eye over him, and him being left alone often results in him peeing/pooping etc all over the house, multiple times a day. I guess I’m asking what we should do about this dog? Especially in quarantine, I’m feeling really hurt and ignored. I feel really seconded to this dog, and it’s really affecting my mental health. I’ve gotten so frusterated and upset that I’ve been crying a lot recently over it. I really feel like this dog is out to get me or something ): 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I suggest to make this better... my step sister seems to just find it a non issue because it doesn’t affect her, but this just makes me more upset!

232,"**TL;DR: Was a broke college student from a lower-middle class family, now making $160k at 21, feeling super weird about it**

My family is lower-middle class in the sense that they live in a small apartment in a third-world country and spent most of their life savings sending me to college (with hefty loans). Still, I never had to worry about being homeless, and I don't want to downplay the real issues that people go through that I'm very thankful to have been sheltered from. 

That being said, my lowest point in college was when I had $10 in my bank account, and had to resort to making my own bread because I didn't want to be any more of a financial burden to my family. Not great, not terrible. 

I was lucky and worked hard enough in college to graduate at the age of 20 and secure a software engineering job that pays $160k (in salary+bonus+stock). It's been almost a year now, and I've gone from constantly trying to calculate how much money I'd need to spend on food for the week, worrying nonstop about overdraft fees... to rarely even looking at my receipts. It's surreal for me to know that I can just buy what I need and not have to worry about money. I do still try to save most of it, though, and am on track to pay off all $70k of my student loans within a year of graduating. 

Even though I worked my ass off to get to where I am, after almost killing myself as a teenager (a thing of the past), I can't help but feel that I don't deserve this. Not after seeing friends struggle to just get a job. I am a US citizen, but spent a good chunk of my childhood in the aforementioned 3rd world country, so I'm no stranger to poverty. I don't flaunt my money or anything like that, but it kills me inside that so many people are struggling, and I'm...not. I can't help but feel guilty.

I can't vent to anyone about this without coming off as a massively pretentious douchebag. I try to help out friends when I can (buying drinks every now and then, etc.), and am planning to help pay for my younger sister to go to college. I'm... tentatively happy, but deeply uncomfortable, I guess? If that makes sense? 

People have told me that I should be proud of what I've accomplished, that I shouldn't feel guilty because I've worked for it, etc. But none of that really seems to help at all, and I still feel shitty. How can I feel better about myself?",08Apr2020,1
233,"I'm 22, and I've played games my whole life. They were a huge part of my life, and I would often play with real life friends or people I met online; however, lately, I don't really have anyone to play with. My real life friends have moved on in their life due to school, careers, etc. My online friends have done the same. 

I keep coming back to games, trying to reignite that passion, but I always fall bored after an hour. The things is, I feel like I'm a pretty introverted person, so I need my time away from people. I tell my girlfriend that I need some alone time, which I plan for gaming, but I always end up bored surfing Reddit. 

Games were also my escape from reality, and now I don't have that. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise; it allows me to get away from wasting my time gaming, which I do feel guilty about. 

I guess I don't know how to replace all the time I spent gaming with other activities. None of them seem to stack up. I'll then go back to gaming, get bored, and just surf reddit.

237,"I have been feeling very doubtful about my career, my studies and my university for over a year now. I tried to maintain myself optimistic about my situation and take the best out of it, but being isolated for weeks has gotten me thinking and re-thinking my future and many outcomes of my decisions.
For context I am 18 M, live in a third world country, I still depend on my parents (with which I have a good relationship), and should be starting the second year of my career. 
To list very briefly my problems and the reasons of why I want to drop out:
-The economic factor. My parents have already paid the whole semester. Compared to what they could have spent on other unis, this is almost nothing. But I don't want them to feel like throwing cash away for no reason, or on a son that wasted a year learning and doing jackshit. It is guaranteed that any other place I could end up will cost more, I just want them to feel know that I am not comfortable in the uni I currently study.
-My Uni is absolute garbage. I DEFINITELY could have done some research and make a better choice, I just entered the first place I heard before most universities started classes. It is possibly the cheapest private uni in my city, and despite all this corona craze, they haven't been doing any online classes for 3 weeks now. I could go on and on on this subject, but i don't want this post to last much longer.
-No longer feeling passion or interest. My Uni gave it a weird name but essentially, I went there to study Journalism. I don't know if I did not gave enough effort or the Uni did not provided all the resources, but I know that the lack of interest runs in everyone. Classmates, professors, the staff. Everyday was sad.
-On top of that, corona. I don't want it to be an excuse, but is it a real reason to drop the career?

He even told my other friend that was battling depression that he was worthless and to go kill himself.  All of the people he picks on don’t speak up for themselves because it makes them look uncool to everyone because they can’t handle insults. He also has his own unofficial ‘inner circle’ that backs him up in every argument no matter if what he did was horrific.

248,"side note: we’re both females in this relationship. 

i’ve been dating this girl for awhile now. we’ve had our fair share of problems that people in a relationship experience from time to time, but we’re always able to talk it out—no big fights so far. however, as someone who’s future oriented and as someone who likes to think ahead, it’d be nice to have a partner who’s on the same page with me when it comes to future goals, relationship wise. this is where i have issues with. i haven’t talked about it with her as i feel like it’s not necessary just yet, but i would like to hear other people’s perspective and opinion. 

she’s mentioned before that she would like to travel and work outside the country after studying, but i don’t think ldr would work for me. she said that maybe when that time comes, and we’re still together, distance won’t even be an issue. she has a point, and i do agree, but personally, with the kind of person i am in the present, i don’t see myself staying in an ldr relationship. i eventually shrugged it off because i want to support her dreams in life. but the thing that bothered me the most was when i was playfully teasing about our age, i was causally mentioning different age groups: 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s, she blurted out that by that age, she’d want to try dating guys, because in her whole life, she’s been always romantically involved with women. i get that she’s curious and i don’t want to hinder her from experiencing that, but now, every time we talk about our future, i always see myself ending with a heartbreak, especially since she’s asked me before if i was sure of dating women because she’s been doing it for a long time, and i have reassured her that i am. and now, i’ll hear something like that from her? it’s confusing. that said, i don’t want to take away such experiences from her and we’re our own person with different dreams in life, but are those differences too much of a dealbreaker? 

i’m sure that people come and go in our lives, and we shouldn’t think that our partner would be with us forever, but it’d be nice to feel secure about it. 

i might be just overthinking things and maybe i’m just too focused on the future, but is it worth staying in this relationship knowing those deal breakers? are those things small enough that i could just put them in the back burner and give all my focus in the present instead? or are those big enough of a difference that won’t be good for the both of us longterm wise? 

tldr: we’re both females. the girl i’m dating said that, in the future, she’d like to travel and settle somewhere else, and perhaps, try dating men, because she’s always been romantically involved with women all her life. now, every time we talk about our plans for the future of our relationship, i feel like i’m holding onto something that won’t end well, because i plan to stay in this country after studying, and every time i date someone, i’d like to think that they’d be in my life for a long time. are our differences too much? is it better to leave now before more things get involved? or just focus on the present and put all those thoughts in the back burner?",08Apr2020,1

252," Needing some advice on my sister's situation and what resources I can send her way. I live in another country, while she lives in the States in Arkansas. She has 2 children that are being looked after by a rotating shift of family. She had a seizure late last year and they took her driver license away for a year. She has had another seizure and the doctors cannot find out why. The meds make her loopy and dysfunctional, so she is afraid to watch her kids alone. The father of her babies is abusive and has lead her to suicidal thoughts (runs in the family, as my mom committed suicide and alcoholism is prevalent in our family). She is from a tiny town, has absolutely no one she can rely on to help her or even get her to and from places. No money because she cannot work, cannot drive (this is a tiny town and public transport does not exist), no actual place to live because she cannot go back to living with an abusive ex and has no money to get a place. My dad is about to go to jail for a year, and he was the only person that could have  kept her from being homeless. I have no idea what to do or how I can help. I cannot give her money, as with Covid we are on a one person salary and budget in my own home, and I live 7 thousand miles away. She applied for disability in September and have not had any luck, as they say they need more info (got the letter mid March, they asked for another dr consult, which is now postponed because of Covid) so there is no help there. 

This is a TLDR version of her situation, as it gets much darker and dire than this, but I am just at my wits end with the anxiety that she will kill herself, be homeless, and what will happen to her babies.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. TIA.",08Apr2020,1

254,"Ok so this is gonna be long but I need to get this off my chest because its destroying me and I dont know what I should do.
I guess I should start where everything began. When I was 10 I lost my uncle who i was really close with to suicide which was really hard for me as i have such vivid memories of him living with me (he was a stereotypical skater guy) and I loved him and he doted on me all the time, my last memory of him was seeing him outside the local library and he told me he would teach me how to skateboard which unfortunately never got to happen (I still have his skateboard all these years later).
After he died I forced myself to grow up during his funeral i dont remember much other than hiding all of the emotions i felt because i felt bad for being so sad this is where everything began. It was around this time things at home started getting bad, I started to see visibly how much I annoyed my parents as they would continuously tell me to shut the f*** up etc. Then one day they started tormenting me calling me horrible names until the point I burst into tears, I tried running out of the room but my dad blocked me from leaving so they could laugh at me, I screamed at him ""LET ME GO"", he then grabbed me by the throat and pinned me to the wall and shouted at me to never speak to them like that again and threw me to the ground, alot of things like that happened as I grew 1 moment sticks out and that was when I was 12 my mum screamed at me during and arguement that i was a mistake and she regretted having me, by the age of 12 I was suicidal i use to pray to god to end it (it was also the time I lost all faith in religions and became an atheist) 1 day i had it (again when i was 12) and tied a belt up and was about to jump when a friend text me to play a game at the time, if it wasnt for him I would be dead right now, after that I was very depressed, i did my GCSEs, barely passed despite being a top mark student for the fact I didnt care anymore, my parents then would use those results as another way to attack me calling me a sp**tic and re***d, when I turned 18 during my a-levels i became a regular at a bar going there every day after school to drink. I have been depressed for 9 years, knew about it for 5 years and have only been able to admit it 2 years ago and have been getting help for just over a year now, despite this my parents refuse to accept there is anything wrong with me and still call me worthless etc and I'm making it up I moved out nearly a year ago now but when they call me it almost always ends in arguments and me isolating myself from my 2 best friends to cry to sleep.

This isnt the full story but what I'm comfortable talking about, I posted this to get it off my chest and because I really dont know what to do anymore because I want to disown them but if I do I probably wont be able to see my little sisster anymore and she means the world to me and she looks up to me (her amazing big brother as she says) but I dont know if I can take much more abuse from my parents",08Apr2020,1

262,"I’ve hit the point in my life where I need to start adulting; with that said, I’ve hit a huge crossroad in my life. I’m 17 and getting ready to go to college, I’ve felt more out of place in this past year than I’ve felt throughout my life. 

My boyfriend (Blu) plans to join the army and I don’t know for certain what I want to be yet. I’ve got a jest of what career I’m looking for, for instance, law enforcement/homicide detective or a biologist/veterinarian. I got accepted into all the colleges I applied to, but I’m stuck on choosing the right college. With the rise of spring-break and the quarantine, it gives me some time to think. 

Me and Blu plan to stay together but with that comes complications. He wants me to go into the army with him and for us to get married. Although I would like us to get married, I’m not to keen on joining the army. I mean I can, it’s a possibility but I’m just not sure about anything in my life yet. All I’m sure about is that I want to marry Blu. By joining the army with him I’d go to college first and do my rotc and when I graduate I’d be an officer with him and then we’d get married that way we could get stationed together. I can see the army thing working out only if I were to get a career in law enforcement.But this poses so many questions :

1) Do I choose to follow a person I could have a future and lifetime with or do I choose the option of chasing a career that I’m not even certain of ?

2) Will we work out ?
* there’s so much stigma on military couples not working out that it gives me a lot of anxiety. I truly love  Blu but  it makes me realize that so much is at stake and all this is causing me to have meltdowns. Honestly, if he can give me a straight answer that he’s willing to try then that’s all the reassurance I need because when I’m committed to someone I’m willing to go to great lengths for them. 
** if you’re married or a military spouse please give me some advice

3) I’m just really scared for life as a whole. I guess many would say I’m weak, but I’m a very sensitive person and at this point in my life I don’t know what to do anymore.

We've both dated other people and never really talked about it so I have no idea how she feels.

265,"As the title says, tonight an older man came into the store and he could barely walk. I helped him with purchasing his items and as I did, he was so kind and grateful.

Some backstory, I used to be homeless and have another man like him in my life that was like a blood grandfather to me. So I felt especially strongly seeing him struggle.

After helping him, he told me that he had passed out earlier that day, and that he did not know where we were. I grew more concerned at this moment and I told him our location and he was trying to get somewhere else, but he could not walk. He took a few steps and fell, so I called 911 as he was having trouble staying awake and got him a chair and some water that he could barely even hold.

The paramedics came and did their checks, and after talking with him they decided he was alright enough to let him leave and try and find his own way to the bus station. 

This man could barely walk, was clearly disoriented and struggling to remain conscious. He smelled strongly of urine and feces as well. And they just let him leave.

I came home after work shortly after this and completely broke down. I’m still crying. It’s not right. It’s not right that people like him have to suffer the way he is right now and I just feel so fucking helpless to do anything. Good people should also get what they deserve and I feel he hasn’t.

All very weird things that he said needed to be done because he was  hacked.

My gf was having problems activating his new chip and with all the corona virus quarentine(we  live in brasil) there was no place to get a new one.

So she used an old cellphone from her father to test the chips for him to use, and in that cellphone his gmail account was logged in. 

And in that email was some massages in broken portuguese(with some screenshots that we found we believe the source is french) that claimed that they have a video of him, that would ruin his live. Going as far as label a video with a screenshot of youtube studio with the name  ""masturbate to a 13 year old"".we only get to see one frame of the video but we are positive that its his room.

Also in the  email we can see that he transfered 2k reais(brazilian money) with the western union. A bank that we think transfers money abroad.

My gf lives with her brother and dad, we said all of this to her brother and now we dont know what we should do, should we talk to him or ignore it.

I should add that the emails we found started by acussing him of trying to hide by changing his number, but saying that they know him and his family,  sending names and pictures from  facebook of friends and family(all of those screenshots of french facebook) and that he should negociate with them to stop this.

So with the pandemic, of course my university has chosen distance learning for the remainder of the semester. My professors are doing the best they can with what they have. I am currently taking three science courses and a religion course. Two of my courses, Immunology and Organic Chem II, I am not doing great in. (I didn’t go into this semester with the heart to really push myself for good grades). 

I’m at a crossroads. I’ve fallen quite behind in these classes, and with my already bad grades, I can probably squeeze out a C or a D in these classes with maximum effort. 

My problem is, I don’t care. I just can’t find a fuck to give about these classes or these grades, and school makes me miserable. I can’t just drop the classes as the VA will remove my living stipend, so I need to continue. 

Another point: since my field of study is relatively competitive, a “C” grade and below is grounds for the university to cause me to repeat the class anyway. 

I know this is all very confusing, but basically, if I choose to fail these classes, the next month of my life would be amazing. I would focus on the other two classes I have, enjoy the rest of the time I have home, and relieve me of anxiety. But I would leave with two F’s. 

Alternatively, if I choose to continue the classes, I will have a lot of work to do in something I really don’t care for, and the chances of me receiving a good enough grade for it to count would be very slim. But I wouldn’t leave with any failing grades. 

So, what would you do? Choose freedom and happiness, take two F’s and move on, or choose to buckle down and salvage whatever GPA you can? 

P.S. If I do fail two classes, I will not owe any money to the VA, as I will fall under an academic forgiveness program where they will forgive 6 credit hours, or two classes.

He's on a c-pap right now and doesn't want to be intubated if that becomes necessary. According to the doctor, he has stopped breathing once already.

Hello everyone,

I am wondering about getting new PS with VR or new GPU + Oculus Rift S. But here's my problem. I'll be studying in different city in September, I'll be living in a small room, not much place for a pc + vr. And I don't want to take it every week with me. I'll be away 4-5days a week. So I was thinking about buying a new console, it is small, so I could easily take it with me and back. Or buying a new PC + Rift S, but it will be at home probably for most of the time. On the other hand I have holidays 5 months long, so I’ll be at home.

I consider myself as a medium gamer, I don't tryhard multiplayer games nowadays, but I  enjoy singleplayer (mostly RPG) games. I do have PS4, was playing NHL, FIFA, RDR2, Rocket League, ... but not RPG games, I have computer for this and I enjoy it more (Kingdom Come, Skyrim, STALKER, Gothic, ....). 

So what is your opinion, what would you buy? New console + VR or a GPU + Oculus Rift S?  
Money is not main problem I only want one device, not both of them.",08Apr2020,1

I was walking to my bathroom which is near the door to my room, and I overheard my boyfriend talking about a girl. So of course I had to stop and listen. 🤓 but he was talking about how he was at a winery and this girl was just staring his down, his friend pointed it out, and that she was probably one of the most beautiful women he’s ever seen and that he spent the night making out with her, added her on Instagram, and he’s wanted to go back to Serbia ever since. So before you freak out, he has not been to Serbia since we have been dating, but I’m kind of annoyed. These are my roommates, and I feel uncomfortable that he said he’s been dying to go back since then, inferring it’s because he wants to see beautiful women. I feel very secure in our relationship, but by him saying that to them, it sounds like he’s down to do whatever. I’m probably overthinking things. But I’m annoyed.",08Apr2020,1
286,"Im 18 (male) and want to move out of my house asap. My dad is being toxic towards me by always making me feel like im good for nothing just because im not the way he was back when he was my age. Hes always on my case about everything which is pretty annoying. And with this corona virus pandemic happening hes staying home more often which puts more stress on me. I cant even lay down in peace without him barging into my room and telling me to do something.  Anyways back to my point of moving out. I want to move out but i cant seem to find a job. And its not that i cant find a job, its my parents not approving the jobs that are available to me. For example, recently i applied to McDonalds (I know, but it was the place that was hiring near my house.). I let my parents know about my application submission to McDonalds and they completely lost it. It was like the worst thing in the world for them. They told me that i could of done better but in reality, what place is gunna hire an 18 year old with no job experience whatsoever.  And I have another reason to move out which is college. I  got accepted to 4 colleges this year. Three of them are nearby and one of them is about 3 hours away from home.  I applied to the one far away since it already had my major and it was my saftey school.  But heres the thing. My dad really isnt on board with me going far away for school and i just really dont know what to do.

290,"I know this is going to sound stupid, but I’ve been on 3 different social media platforms in the past hour because it’s getting to the point where I can’t handle this anymore and I need to ask for help. I literally just joined this sub literally 1 minute ago, but I’m really desperate for help and advice right now. I am a teenager {15} and I’m sorry if this sounds cringy but I’ve gotten to the point where I kinda don’t care if it’s cringy. 

My mom is a single mom and has been since my sister was born when I was four. She’s had a drinking problem for quite a few years, but we’ve always figured things out because her problem wasn’t too bad. When I was about 9 the situation got a bit worse and started affecting her work and she got a couple dui’s (tbh, I don’t know how many or if they were dui’s or dwi’s because I was a little kid). My grandma found out that she had a drinking problem after she had to be picked up from the hospital about a year or so after it first started getting bad (she was fine, but she wasn’t allowed to leave because she was intoxicated when they found her. Once again, I was only 10ish, don’t know the fine details.) apparently my grandma was completely clueless for several years. She knew that it had been a problem in the past, but she though it had resolved when I was about 6. I also didn’t know my moms problem was drinking. When someone would ask she’d say she just gets really exhausted and her medicine makes her act weird, which I believed because I didn’t know any better. After the hospital thing, she started having huge fights with my grandma which I still have recordings of on my cousins old phone he gave me. 

ANYWAY, jump to last year (2019), still a drinker, but it’s quite a bit better, doesn’t fight with anyone about the drinking unless they bring it up. She got fired from a job after a coworker who was a good friend passed and she went to work drunk on more than one occasion. My grandma once again thought the drinking had been resolved and it once again had not been but oh well. But in June of last year my aunt moved in with us. My mom pretty much stopped drinking (like full cold turkey) for about two months and was really upset all the time and started having other problems with her health. She eventually started drinking again but my aunt seemed completely unfazed by it and acted like everything was normal. That went on for months and when my mom noticed she just drank more and more. Then in October I guess my grandma finally finds out again and everyone keeps telling me I should have told people which I did NOT want to do because I knew I’d just get yelled at and my family would just fight more. Which happened. It’s just been going on like that for a while now, she gets drunk, I try to tell my aunt, she gets mad and refuses to lighten up to anyone all evening and everyone’s just mad. Jump to the middle of March, my moms working from home and drinking a LOT. She’s also scared to death of covid and won’t stop breaking down crying. My aunt is just always mad because my mom is just always drunk now and buying a lot of stuff and my grandma just keeps griping. Everyone’s fighting and yelling, my aunt is threatening custody because my mom is ‘incapable of caring of the girls’ (me and my sister). My sister is upset that she can’t go places and has resorted to throwing things and cussing everyone out (she’s 11). I just don’t know what to do. 


TL;DR - My aunt is mad and is living in a camper outside and my mom is just breaking down in tears because she’s scared to death of covid and she’s just constantly drunk. My sister is out of control. My grandma is doing nothing to help. I just feel so bad because I’m not old enough to drive or get a job so I can’t do anything to help financially right now, I don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to talk to anyone about her drinking and we live walking distance from a gas station so just taking her keys won’t stop her getting alcohol. 

Please give me advice on how to talk to people and let them know all of this is making me really depressed and I’m to the point where I’m privately breaking down.",08Apr2020,1

295,"  First, I’m not a Lesbian, I’m straight.

  And I’m really terrible at expressing myself, I’m super oblivious towards affections, and I have trust issues. I also don’t find boys or girls around me “my type” hence I never see them as anything other than peers, acquaintances, and friends.

  But both genders have confessed their likeness towards me. But I turned down all of them “politely”, but two of the Lesbian girls had started to talk behind my back at one point. One is in high school, which I’m totally over with, and now there’s another one! 
  
  I told her I’m straight. And before all this, I didn’t give her any special treatments, I treat her like how I treat friends. And when we first met each other at the start of college, she had never mentioned her sexuality. I just thought I found a new friend.

  And I can’t even fathom how many boys who I perceive as friends who genuinely like my personality and artistic talent, and asked me out so many times. Some of the boys are popular around girls, they are good at sports and schoolwork performances, but I see them as friends and I have known them since we were like 8-12, which is why I see them as friends!

  I never considered anyone other than “friends”. And this situation has been bothering me since I was 15.",08Apr2020,1
296,"This has been happening for almost 5 years, with each year getting worse. I’ve never talked to a professional about it. I’ve only recently read up on it and have just started to practice self healing tricks. 
 To put it simply, I ruminate on times I have embarrassed myself, have been unfiltered at the wrong time/to the wrong person, gotten angry, over spoken, made mistakes, etc. These memories make me feel deep shame and other awful emotions such as; Annoying, mean, pretentious, ignorant, abusive. I keep this a secret to most people. Only my mom and boyfriend know I do this. My boyfriend will see me zoning out or talking to myself and ask what I’m doing. I just tell him “I’m replaying a conversation in my head or I’m thinking of a cringe memory”.  He always wants me to tell him what it was so he can help me rationalize it, but I physically can’t say it out loud. I get beat red, a tightness in my chest and shoulders, and nauseas. These memories are always running in my head, I can kinda block them so I can actually enjoy my day, but once they’re triggered and brought to my entire attention, I’m paralyzed. My brain will subconsciously make myself shake or jump or I’ll make an involuntary noise to get myself out of that paralyzed feeling.

300,"Hello everyone,

I (F23) met a guy (M22), who we should call Joe, at a Halloween party in 2018. We clicked that night, exchanged numbers, and hung out 2 nights after the party, went out for drinks, and I ended up sleeping over but no sex was involved. I really enjoyed how socially comfortable I felt around him, and the following morning after out first date he continued to text me. However, a few days later I hung out with another (second) guy I met at that same party, and all of us being in a small town, they happened to know each other, so Joe with found out and he was mad at me but I believed he didn't have the right to since I had just met him, there was nothing serious between us, and it immediately struck me that he might be a clingy type. He then went on to text me ""I was starting to feel you, we were vibing good, but whatever have a nice life."" I thought that was over with him. 

Anyways, fast forward to a week later, Joe ended up texting me out of nowhere asking me to hang out with him, which was a little confusing because I thought that he wanted nothing to do with me? I didn't give much thought into it, so I went ahead and hung out with him again, this time having sex, and me sleeping over again. During this second time of us hanging out, he asked if I was still talking to the second guy I went on a date with, I answered yes but that it was nothing serious (which it wasn't) , and I asked him how he felt about that because I don't want to end up hurting anyone. He then told me that I should listen to my heart and that I ""cant hurt him."" 

Joe and I started to hang out more often, on a weekly basis, even though he felt I had something going on with the other guy, which I did. A few weeks later however, I told Joe that I had stopped talking to the other guy (which I did), and Joe said he felt bad because he thought that he got in between what me and the other guy had, but I told him that I just didn't feel strongly for the other one, which was strange to me, because even though the other guy was more of a gentleman to me than Joe was (opening the car door for me, texting me more often), I still liked Joe more. Joe also had his flaws; he had his side hustle of dealing drugs, he didn't like himself, he seemed a little distant at times (hot and cold moods), but I really enjoyed time with him and the sex was GREAT; there was something about this man that intrigued me a lot. I was starting to think that what Joe and I had was something casual, just sex and occasionally smoking with him, but we also started to talk about how we felt towards each other.

The day after the night that I hung out with Joe and told him that I cut the other guy off, he never texted me back...for the whole month of December. During that whole month I texted him 3 times, but no response, which made me wonder and wonder about what the heck I could have said or done to make him ghost me like that. Then New Years Eve came, and he finally texted me a short text saying he was sorry for everything. I responded with ""It's cool I'm not petty like that."" I was excited but a little hurt that he would text me during New Years Eve, because he probably felt lonely and wanted to do nothing but sleep with me, at this point me already having feelings for him built from the times we hung out. I agreed to go over, but by the time he wanted me to go over it was 3 AM, too late, so I decided to just contiue on my night without him. 

The next time I hung out with him, I asked him why he ghosted me. He said that he had a lot going on, which I called bullshit. I also remember me bringing it up again and asking him why and he gave me a different response, that he was starting to get feelings for me and didn't want to end up hurt. He told me about him being with a girl for about 7 years, having to find out she cheated on him, and that left him with trust issues around girls saying ""Dont take it personally, but I dont trust any girl."" I had a small feeling that the reason he ghosted me was because he was talking to another girl but the thought of that makes me pretty unhappy, and I asked him if he was but he denies talking to any girl during that month. He also said that I was perfect and deserved better, a better man with a good job, and that he wasnt looking for a relationship, only to chill. I was like yup this guy just wants to fuck which was cool with me in a way. The following months were him and I hanging out, sometimes he wouldn't text me back, and sometimes I would do the same to him because there were times when I just didn't feel like responding to him when he would ignore my texts sometimes. I felt like he fit the ""emotionally unavailable guy"" stereotype so good. He would text me out of nowhere at times saying he missed me, but I felt like that was just so I would go over and fuck. He would ask to hang out usually late at night, anywhere from 9 to 2 AM. That kind of bugged me because it made me feel like a booty call but then again he would also text me during the day, and even asked me to go to the beach with his friends at a decent time, we would go out to eat, he introduced me to his parents, so I believe it was a fucked up kind of FWB relationship. 

Last summer, I ended up moving about 50 minutes away from the town where Joe and I met. He would text me every now and then but I would never reply. Then one night he texted me saying ""so youre not gonna talk to me anymore?"" I told him the truth that I had moved and begun my new life here to which he responded ""Wtf and you didnt tell me? I guess I didn't mean shit to you..whatever fuck it, and you."" I didnt respond after that. But days later he kept texting, and he even called me saying he missed me, to go back to the town, he even offered me to live with him??? I was like ""Is he this desperate? Lonely?"" He texted me saying I wouldn't even compare to his old ex, and that he couldnt get over me. After texts and calls, one day when I was visiting family in my old town, I decided to give him a visit after all, and we had it planned too. So yes we smoked, drank, had sex, just like the old days and I even ended up sleeping over because he wanted me to, so I did. Anyways I thought that was the last of it and I stopped talking to him for a while, but just recently, he popped back into my life, saying how much he missed me, called me, saying that he fucked up, to give him another chance, that he wants something serious with me but he was afraid of getting hurt, that him and I were meant for each other, and at some point I called bullshit and told him that he just wanted to fuck me and he said ""yeah ofc I wanna fuck but I also want you in my life, Ill never find another girl like you, youre the one for me. You like everything I life, youre perfect for me."" I just texted him to leave me alone and that he was a thing of the past. He replied with a simple ""alright then."" And I felt good about telling him that, but LOL a few days later he texted me saying ""even after you tell me u dont want me im still here, i cant get over you, please come to me. You showed me so much love unlike any other girl has."" I told myself ""ooo this fucker is good with words.""  So I told him ""make the damn effort to see me then"" I as of recently dont have a car and he always told me about how he had anxiety about driving long distances due to a car big accident he had, so im like how tf are we supposed to see each other then? Shit at this point I should have never responded honestly. He said ""ill pay for an uber to bring you out here just come please"" I'm like fuck should I? I was a little excited: good sex, a few drinks, we get to chill again, but I had no intentions on smoking since I had quit that 2 momths ago. So yeah I went on my day off on Saturday, his counsins and family were there having a bbq or something but he was like ""its ok dont mind them."" So we grabbed some food, watched movies, drank, talked and fucked like I knew we would, thats about it and I hada  fun time overall, but it didnt feel as intimate as the old times when we used to hang out more often. This time I didnt stay the night over and before I left he asked ""when am i gonna see you again?"" to which I asked ""when can you?"" and he answered ""shit, tomorrow, whenever, next saturday?"" so I agreed yes next weekend. The following morning on sunday I texted him good morning but something in me didnt feel right about our hang out. I told him that though the sex was fun, I was done with him. That was one last goodbye to him. he replied with a simple ""really"" i never texted back, and hours later he sent me a ""?"". It's been two days since we last hung out and I have been feeling low. I can't tell because I was stupid enough to go see him when I felt he didnt really care about me, or if I expected more from the visit, or the fact that after I told him it was one last goodbye to him, he never called me back. Im not asking him to chase after me, but I thought he try more to get my attention. I believe he is a toxic person and I'm glad I cut him off and this time for good, but I can't bring myself to understand this man. Such a confusing person, and though I havent replied to him, I havent blocked him either, maybe cause Im waiting for him to hit me up again and see if he comes back? I feel stupid but at the same time not that regretful. It was fun, and I was there to show him that I did miss him too, and who knows, maybe all he wanted to do was fuck, but why would he say all the other shit? And why was I stuck on a person like him? I can't seem understand myself either. 

What kind of guy does he seem to you guys? Should I just block him and not wait to see if he'll text me or call me again? After all this bullshit and yet I somehow went back to see him. I need advice on how to move on from someone toxic like him. Thank you!",08Apr2020,1

310,"I’m 19f and I met one of my best friend’s 20f during my junior year of high school. I had a toxic friend group and becoming friends with her gave me the courage to leave it for good. We got extremely close over those last 2 years of high school and she very quickly became my closest friend for quite a bit of time. When we graduated she took a gap semester and I went straight to college in our small city. I was working and going to school and she was working and saving up for school because she didn’t qualify for any scholarships or financial aid so we were both busy but still made time to see each other when we could. She’s an outgoing party girl that had been going to night clubs since she was 16 and as my parents were very strict I’m very introverted and suffer from social anxiety but she was very persistent that she wanted to take me out clubbing to find me a guy. Towards the end of my first semester of college I got back in touch with my high school sweetheart and we got back together and the relationship soon got serious. When she started college in the spring she was still working full time while studying part time and our schedules never fit enough to see each other, and she started blaming my boyfriend for our lack of contact. At this point we are a year out of high school and I notice that every time we talked the conversation lead back to girls she didn’t like from school and old drama, I was over it and started speaking to her less and less because it started to feel exhausting trying to engage in the same conversations over and over about people I didn’t care about anymore. We tried double dates and every time we got together she was rude to my boyfriend and often told him things like “if I told her to choose between us you know she would choose me”. On one particular double date she brought a boy she was very interested in and wanted a relationship with, she came over to my house and we got ready together. I’ve never been great at makeup but we were going to a nice restaurant so I wanted to try a little bit so I put on modest and barely noticeable false eyelashes. When we got to the restaurant my bf and her date were waiting and after she introduced us she jokingly asked me “why’d you have to get all done up like that haha?”. Her date was nice and he told us he was in town for college and didn’t have any friends yet or anything. It went well and afterwards he added my boyfriend and I on Snapchat from quick add. She was not happy about this and interrogated him as to why he added me. She asked again about why I had to do my makeup and then decided she no longer wanted to date that guy. After that I wasn’t too excited to hang out. 
My relationship progressed and eventually we moved in together, I spoke with her sporadically over the last few months and told her about the move and everything. Later I started seeing passive aggressive posts on her Facebook about her best friend(me) being caught up in a relationship. I ignored it and any other vague posts about it, but recently I’ve seen her stop her passive aggressiveness. She started posting on Snapchat that she acts tough but she actually just misses her best friend and having me always there. Of course I’m always there but I know she means it as in consistent and frequent contact. Of course I still loved her so much and I want the best for her but I felt that I had just outgrown our friendship. It felt like we were just at different places in our lives, even though we’re both working and in college she’s still going through her party girl phase and often drinks heavily and I’m just the opposite of that. Are we just not so compatible anymore? Or did I abandon her? What should I do?",08Apr2020,1

312,"Just been feeling really down in the dumps lately. I live in a place where the housing market is incredibly high and overpriced. Everyone lives in multi-generational houses because its too expensive to live anywhere else so I live with my parents.

My parents have been poor and lived paycheck to paycheck their entire lives, so they obviously don’t own a house or land. With the threat of financial doom coming due to the virus, we are most likely going to have to relocate. 

I’m just feeling so sad and down about this. One of my dreams in life is own land and a house but being 21 and still in college thats a long away dream for me. With my parents not having the best money and landlords being incredibly cruel here I am housing insecure and may loose where I’m living now and I just cant help but think she got two houses for $15k.

316,"tl;dr at end

I’ve always had urges to cut, to become bulimic, and to break my own bones (I’ve only attempted the last one, I’ve never cut or been bulimic) and I’d just like some opinions/to open a conversation about my “solution” or alternative to cutting. 

Because I don’t want scars from cutting (for many reasons) I found an alternative activity that causes mild pain but does not leave lasting damage (as long as it’s not done too excessively). I used to put a rubber band around my wrist and snap it whenever I wanted to self harm. This gave me the pain I thought I craved, without leaving scars or raising suspicion. Plus, it doesn’t hurt an overwhelming amount and the pain subsides quickly. 

Recently, I’ve been having urges to self harm again so tonight I put a rubber band on my wrist for the first time in years.

What are your thoughts on this alternative? 
Do you think it increases or decreases future urges to self harm?
Is it just as bad as other forms of self harm?
Do you use/know of any other “harmless” alternatives?

tl;dr: I snap a rubber band on my wrist instead of cutting. Thoughts?

how can i stop talking to someone online politely? a few days ago this person private messaged me on this forum i'm on and i agreed because why not? but then after that i told her to switch to discord since it's more convenient for me, so we did.

i don't know why but i feel quite uncomfortable around that person. she hasn't done anything but i just have an unpleasant feeling, it manifests only when i don't talk to her but think of her. plus she's also taking up quite a lot of my time and basically, i just don't feel like talking to her anymore.

but 1) she told me she was worried i'll stop talking to her and 2) it'll be rude to just block and remove her from a server i'm on, and i cannot think of any excuses.

i didn't post on here for quite some time but i seriously don't know where to seek help, it's not a big issue but she really, really gives me uncomfortable vibes and i'll be better off without her account showing up on my fav app

321,"I'm currently a sophomore in college majoring in Civil Engineering and after spending two years at my university, I've come to realize that engineering is definitely not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. While I ultimately would probably be **content** being an engineer, I probably would not be **happy**.

With that being said, I have recently discovered a passion that, while is *super* unrealistic, is something that I would put my everything into: content creation. I already know how unrealistic and stupid it sounds but I started streaming on Twitch last August for fun with no real intention of having it go anywhere but I was able to become affiliated only 2 months later and have continued to do it regularly. By no means could I consider it a job at this point but I have never felt so strongly about something before. 

I don't really know why I'm even posting this because I know I'm not going to give up on maybe one day being a content creator but I also feel like my schooling is way more important and guaranteed. I guess I just need some help on balancing this lifestyle while also maybe help with truly deciding whether this passion is worth pursuing.

TL;DR - Engineering student does not want to be an engineer anymore and would be much happier being a content creator/streamer although it would be very unlikely of it happening. Need help balancing school and passion and deciding whether the passion is worth pursuing.",08Apr2020,1
322,"From the ages of 4-7years old, It's likely that I was younger than 4, I was sexually abused by my cousin. When I moved to the states to live with distant family a few months after I turned 7 years old, I sexually abused my cousin. During the deed, I came to the realization that what I was doing was wrong, that it would make me no better than my perpetrator and also that I hurt my younger cousin. The way I felt that day until this day is very vivid. All I could involuntary think about was, I am feeling this change in my genital area and I needed ""sex-the behavior that my perpetrator inflicted"" to satiate the way my body was reacting. I know that there is absolutely no excuse and my action cannot be forgiven.That one time was enough to condemn myself to a life devoid of joy and happiness. I am in my mid 20s and I desperately desire to be in a relationship that has meaning but every time that opportunity has been an option, I didn't pursue it because of the guilt, shame, and hatred that I felt towards myself. It was challenging growing up as an anti-social, suicidal individual from an already toxic family that physically, mentally, emotionally abused me, and is in denial of my past. However, there is not one day that goes by where I don't think about what I did to my cousin. To have placed such a burden on someone else because I couldn't deal with my mixed emotions keeps me awake at night. I try to forgive myself and my perpetrator everyday about what he did to me because letting my pass control my future makes wanting to be alive difficult. I know I say that but I have never forgiven myself for what I did to my cousin. Am I a bad person for wanting to forgive myself about the way I behaved towards her (my cousin) and wanting to be in a meaningful relationship?

324,"So I confessed my feelings to this guy about this time last year and it was just bliss, we were like the same person, texting for hours each day, etc. Over the summer he became really depressed and would lash out at me, I always wanted to be there for him and I really still think he is worth it, but he said a lot of hurtful things to me. I think I blame myself too because it's really hard for me to just not react to things like that in a way that's not just making it worse, so we would get in a lot of fights. Anyways, once school started again and his support system expanded things got a lot better and he apologized a lot and tried to right all the things he had said, but I can't help still feeling insecure about a lot of the things he said. Recently he's started becoming more distant again and I'm really scared that because of school being out again and some other things going on that he's going to begin lashing out at me again and I don't really know what to do. I've tried talking to him about how a lot of the things he said still hurts me, especially nowadays that he's not showing as much enthusiasm towards me. I feel really selfish because I know that he's having a tough time right now, but I feel like this time he knows what he's doing, he says nice things and reassures me whenever I bring up my concerns,  but is generally cold to me, doesn't try to reach out much, and has admitted to ignoring me. He apologizes a lot, but I don't understand why he can't just fix it. I'm in this cycle of him apologizing and me feeling a bit better, then me realizing I'm in a cycle, me not being mad at him because at least he's acknowledging it and I'm more disappointed in myself for getting my hopes up, me feeling worse because I remember all the good times that I wish we were still having, me thinking that this is going to be the last time I say it's fine, and then him apologizing again. Writing that out this sounds so horrible but I really don't know what to do anymore and I don't have a very shiny spine and I really just want to help him through the hard times. Last week for example I went way overprotective angry gf when one of his ""close friends"" did something mean to him. Ahhh this sounds so terrible, why am I even asking for advice when it's clearly not a healthy relationship, it's just me being a wuss not cutting him out. He's still such a big part of my life.

I have problems of my own (toxic mother, mental illnesses and etc) and I am usually open with him about it, even if he can't do anything specific to help, its good to be open and at least be there for each other , on the other hand, he seems to not like to share problems with me, and when I confronted him about it a couple of days ago he said things like ""I like dealing with things myself"", ""its romantic on paper, destructive in action"" and he just kept going on about how he's going to bring me down with him. I completely understand and respect his personal space, but it still bugs me that he won't open up even a little. It feels so wrong when you are always there asking for help and support from your boyfriend and receiving it but not being able to give it back because he thinks its better off being dealt with on his own. I'm curious what could be the possible reasons to why he does that or at least how to get him to be more open with me, even if a little, so any help or advice is highly appreciated.",08Apr2020,1

So my friend that I rent to wants me to continue to rent to him (the same place he lives). 2 months ago I ended the contract because of things that I didn't like about the place (messy roommates, electricity often shuts down, he has several projects going on in the apartment, etc.).

Since he still wants me to live with him, and now that the other messy roommates are out, he offers to cut the rent in half the next two months, and after that, 15% less than what I have previously paid.

Sure, that sounds like a good deal, but the thing is, my friend has some serious neurotic tendencies (highly anxious, power-hungry, depressed, restless, disorderly). The other day he flipped for something he misinterpreted and told me to leave the apartment after this period is over in a very demeaning and rude way. And said sorry after that..

On the other hand, a part of me wants the peace of being alone. I am secretly a sort of hermit that naturally likes isolation. And even craves it.

**So here are my options:**

1. Live with another friend, and pay rent to a landlord that is not anyone I know
2. Pay rent by myself somewhere else (that will be expensive), but I'll get the isolation
3. Go live with my parents again. 1 hour away from friends. Save up for a house or camping-car (I believe I can make my job work living that far away, but corona has made things a little unsure)

I didn't wanna start anything or any drama so we were on the down low. The next few months we were distant and I had a gut feeling they would leave me.

I have different opinions ways to de stress, some are more effective than others it’s just how it works.

I usually go for a bike ride to de stress or I’ll call friends and talk because that’s fun and it’ll get my mind off of things or I’ll talk to my discord friends.

Ok so I have another thing that helps me de stress, please refrain from making me sound like a freak or retard for liking this. Don’t comment if you’re gonna say negative things please.

Ok so the thing that helps me de stress a lot is paraphilic infantilism. This is no where’s near a sexual type of thing it’s completely a sfw thing for me. Basically...like regressing back to a babyish age helps me not worry so much, my mom is aware of this and is ok with it, this is mostly effective for me the most the only problem is that I can only do this during the night because my brother and dad are not aware of this and tbh it’s sorta a weird thing. I wish I could do this more often because it keeps my mind straight, this is private and I don’t involve anybody else. 
A bit of description over this: most people into this, they like it naturally, they did not choose this nor did I. Basically people in the community like: Diapers, onesies, baby like things, regress to a certain little age  and get treated like one.

I would like to do this more often but during the daytime I’m doing schoolwork and my mom doesn’t like when I’m in my room all that much, she wants me to also exercise during the day which I do.

341,"So I’m a senior, and my whole senior year got cancelled which is shit enough, but now one of my teachers is making online school absolutely hellish. She is assigning double the work. She has assigned us two separate essays and only 3 days to do both of them, 10 or more chapters of reading per day (on top of writing assignments), and a shit ton of mini quizzes and online forums. The worst part is she keeps on setting the due date with a time so they’re all due at 5 pm.

First of all, my parents are essential medical employees working 12+ hour shifts. I am the oldest child and have younger siblings who I am now solely responsible for, 24/7, 7 days a week, because when my parents are home they can only have limited contact with us and they are stressed and exhausted beyond belief. So, I have to get them out of bed, feed them 3 square meals, monitor their internet usage, monitor and help them doing online school, do a shit ton of chores (cleaning the entire house and taking care of 14+ animals). 

On top of that, I have college info and registration that’s currently requiring daily attention and of course I have 6 classes giving me online assignments. All my other teachers have sent out one 30 minute ish assignment per day, sometimes less, and are being incredibly understanding with the stress we are under. My English teacher is fucking whipping assignments at us left and right with absolutely no mercy.

All I can think about is her and its driving me crazy. Also the though that we could've had something is killing me. 

Please share any advice. I'm sorry if this seems exaggerated but I just had to let all of this out cause I feel like I needed to tell someone",08Apr2020,1
343,"     My friend let's call her Sarah is going through a lot  right now. Her home life never been steady since her parents are divorced and her mom is always off and on again with a boy which lead to 10 children at least( I don't remember). She is usually only with her mom on weekends but since quarantine she been with her mom a lot. Her mom recently broke up with her fiancé which also split up her and her stepsister who she was really close to, and they had to move into a new house. Her mom used to be an active alcoholic and for three years had been sober but about a month ago got drunk again and broke up with her fiancé. Her mom is severely depressed to which she is currently on meds and lead to Sarah also being suicidal and depressed.
 
     Today her mom's ex fiancé called out of nowhere telling her that he was going to pick her and her brothers up, she asks why and he said that she had taken 150 Tylenol. She was in the living room at the time and looked through her window and saw her mom with her head back and her eyes rolled in her car. She asked him if she should check on her and he said yes, she went outside barefoot crying to go get her mom. To her surprise her mom was alive and asked her what's wrong.

Her mom: What's going on why are you crying

Sarah: It's nothing are you okay

Her mom: Im fine Im fine Im fine Im fine

Sarah: (ex fiancé) said you took tylenol

Her mom: Yes i had a headache

Sarah: He said you took 150 tylenol

Her mom: *smiles* I had a big headache 
  
      Her mom then gets out the car and asked her for a hug and she says no and starts walking away. Her mom starts following her then starts walks faster while yelling, Sarah didn't know the neighborhood well so she just ran until she found a long driveway. She ran up to the house and started banging and screaming on the door until she figured out the door was unlocked and went in. When she went in a man and a girl the same age asked they her what was wrong, she told them her mom took 150 tylenol. I forgot what happened here but I think her mom came in the neighbor's house and dragged her back to their house while the girl neighbor was following her. When she went back into the house the police arrived and her mom told her to lie or else cps would've taken her away. After the questioning she went back to her room while texting me this story.

    She told me that maybe her ex fiancée lied and she actually didn't take the tylenol because they never saw the pills in the car but her mom never denied taking the tylenol but if she did take the tylenol wouldn't the police search the car. That's the thing though what if she manipulated the police so she could keep Sarah and not sound crazy. She feels bad because she trusted her neighbors and her mom's ex fiancé at that moment more than she trusted her mom ever. She likes her mom, her mom can be cool and funny, she told me a lot about her mom. She told me every time her and her mom get into situations like this her mom always acts weird. Her mom always acts like everything is normal and you are the weird one if you think it's not. She is scared her mom is going to be mad at her in the morning because she was shaming her for going to the neighbors for help. She never disobeyed her mom before so she is questioning why she said no to her mom's hug. She is scared her mom manipulated everyone into thinking she is fine and she is actually dead right now but Sarah can't check because if her mom was alive and saw her she would ask what she is doing. She is so scared right now and doesn't know what to believe. 

   Sorry about how bad I told that story keep in mind Im 12 and my friend just turned 13 this January. She told me she loves me a lot and that she wishes she could see me right now but I don't know. I don't know how to tell her everything is going to be okay when it's clearly not and this is probably going to happen again. How do I help her keep her mind from racing when clearly nothing is going to stop her brain from replaying the moments she just experienced I, I just don't know. She told me I helped her a lot but really all I did was organize her thoughts, what do I do? What does she do now? How should she feel?",08Apr2020,1
344,"So basically my brother has been saying the n-word and other racist slurs for years now. He's 21 and I'm 16, turning 17 in a few days.

Every time he says that sort of thing I call him out on it and get angry. I try to tell him it's wrong to say those things and that he can't say it. But he just says, ""Why can't I say that word? Why should my skin colour prevent me from saying a word?"" When I tell him it's racist, he always argues that he's using it either ironically to make fun of 'actual racists' or 'not in a hateful way'.

He has that attitude popularised by idubbz I think where he says ""either it's all okay or none of it is"" and ""I'm taking power AWAY from the word"", as if he's doing this to be such a good guy.

I've tried to tell him before. One time I was telling him about a (white) teacher in my school who I liked, and he said, ""Yeah, he's a cool [n word]."" Immediately I told him ""DON'T say that"" and he started laughing at me. He said, ""I can say any word I want, I can say [n word], I can say [racist Asian slurs], I can say r*tarded..."" After that I just yelled at him to get out of my room and he laughed at how upset I was.

I was so upset partly because he said the r word. I'm getting tested for autism, I've known for years and I told him that because I wanted to let him know. He just used it as leverage against me intentionally or not. I just burst into tears after he said that and was so angry at him. It's not okay for him to use any of these slurs, they're hateful and bigoted, but he won't hear me out.

I'm honestly sick and tired of him. Yesterday we actually had a conversation about something unrelated to race, something that I was really interested in, and he ruined it again by doing an 'Indian accent' or whatever in the middle of conversation. 

I don't know how to have a productive conversation with him about this. It just seems like he's turning into someone I really don't like. His racism has made a huge rift grow between us and we aren't as close. He thinks he's so much smarter than me and I just don't know how to get through to him. I don't want to just excuse it because he's family.

348,"Okay so I’m just a regular teenage girl that’s really bored right now and I decided that it would be kinda nice to be in a relationship/build a strong connection with someone during this time. Just some background about me: I’m pretty cool, I’m a Sagittarius so I’m shy at first but I can be pretty extroverted. Tbh I think I’m pretty but like a bit on the bigger side, but my height balances it out but I get insecure just like everyone else. However I tend to try to fill that insecurity with attention from guys. (I also tend to catch feelings QUICK) 

Anyways, I started talking to this guy, let’s call him jack. And jack is so hot like he’s exactly my type. And it’s kinda rare for a guy like jack to actually have interest in me especially cus he knows he’s hot and he’s veryyyy popular so he has A LOT of hoes. Soo jack has been like perfect like he’s my ideal guy and by that I don’t mean he’s super sweet and caring or anything, I mean he’s realistic like he’s sweet when he wants to be but most of the time he’s just him which I love. 

So a little background on jack: he’s been through so much, like his childhood was terrible and because of that he’s like “immune” to everything. Basically he doesn’t get mad, he doesn’t get hurt, he’s happy but it’s so hard to connect with him cus he has such a “I don’t care, it is what it is” attitude towards life. Which is cool and all but I tend to overthink so little things make me anxious and so I question him. (He’s also really sexual) 

Soo a little bit ago jack and I hooked up and I really enjoyed it but I feel like he’s acting different now. 
Example 1: I used to get jealous as a joke so if he got like a notification I would be like “who tf is that” but it’s just a joke and he told me that he likes it when I act crazy but like now when I do it he literally tells me to shut up (in his defense he’s not being 100% serious) 
Example 2: we FaceTime every night and 2 nights ago he decided to get on a call with his friends and I was like “call me when ur done” and he didn’t 
Example 3:he said “morning” instead “good morning” this morning (this may be stupid but it’s different soo)
Example 4: he was kinda weird on FaceTime like he’s not usually nice but usually he was like not mean but not exactly nice

Idk guys, I REALLY like jack and I just want him to like me back as much as I like him and idk if hooking up with him messed things up, cus I asked if it changed things and he said no and I know he liked it so I’m confused. And I really don’t think he’s talking to other girls. Its also hard to find things to talk about because I’m so scared to say the wrong thing and lose him or be boring.",08Apr2020,1

My ex just tried to contact me recently and the reason we broke up in the first place is because they weren’t in a good mental state (self harm, suicidal, etc.) and It just wasn’t healthy.

I admit, I’m not a genuinely good person, but I have put in the effort to be nicer to my family. I don’t scream or argue or say negative things to my family anymore, thankfully.

Unfortunately, even if I don’t express it, I still do get annoyed by my family but like I said I don’t act on it anymore. To me it still feels like I’m being fake, I want to genuinely NEVER feel upset/annoyed/impatient with my family. I never feel annoyed with my friends, I wish I can do the same with my family.

357,"A week and a half ago, I told someone I thought life was meaningless. This is a person I trust, someone I feel comfortable with. He asked if I wanted to talk and when I was available for the next two days. So I told him and then...nothing. He left me on read. The first two days I just thought he was trying to find a time when he was available, but a couple of days went by and he still wouldn't respond so I wrote to him again. 

Again, nothing.

After a week, I asked if he had changed his mind or if he was just busy, and asked if he could at least be honest with me. Nothing. He hasn't read these latest messages (at least it doesn't say so) but I know he's online as he's posted on social media. I know he's ignoring me.

I know he doesn't owe me anything, but he did say he was going to make some time to talk to me so at least an apology or something to let me know what's going on. I don't have many friends (less than a handful), let alone people I feel comfortable around and comfortable with sharing things like this. I don't know what I expected from telling him how I feel, but him ignoring me feel even worse, like there really is nothing out there.

I know I should seek professional help but I just needed a friend to talk to.

So my question: do I confront him again or do I just leave it be? As I said, I don't have many friends and there is nobody else I really feel like telling. Do I just give him a call or is that too pushy?

367,"This a throwaway Account that I made since my boyfriend and I kind of “share” a reddit account.

I noticed that my boyfriend recently stopped wanting sex it’s strange because he has a really high desire in this. Then I found some porn pics on his phone on chrome that were just opened (we’re allowed to go on each other’s phones and since my phone died I wanted to google something). I also notice that every time I enter the room that he instantly closes the opened tabs in chrome and puts his phone away. Sometimes he hides it from me, when we’re together in bed he just hides his screen so I don’t see what he does. This made me insecure and then I just couldn’t handle it and confronted him about it. I said everything that I found out or noticed expect the porn sites. I even asked him if he may have a porn addiction and that’s maybe the reason why he doesn’t want to get intimate with me. All he said was: “I stopped watching porn as we moved together” and “you’re just putting to much pressure on me by saying I’m a porn addict so I can’t have sex with you”. We often had sex and he initiated that as well. This made me really sad as he lied to me. It just didn’t made any sense however I accepted this and hoped that maybe he noticed the difference in his own behavior and would just stop. But things continued to be the same until I addressed these porn sites. He tried to talk himself out. At first he said that it’s a browser that he never uses which is a lie. Then he said to me that it’s not porn because porn are videos and what he was looking at were pics. I didn’t get the difference because both things are pornography but whatever. And then he said “I just like to look at it, not because I’m horny but I just like to look at some pics y’know? I’m sorry that this makes you feel insecure however I know I can’t promise to stop as I just like to look at it. I’m not jerking off to it.”. He lied himself thru this whole situation until I started crying and then he said this. 

Is it really a thing to just like to look at porn pics? If so why aren’t my pictures enough? 

I just don’t know what to do. I know that he thinks that we cleared everything up after our conversation but I can’t stop thinking about how he lied at first and I’m not even sure if his final statement is the truth. I couldn’t sleep the whole night thinking about it. 

I’m also kind of uncomfortable around him as I know that almost every time I step out of the room he looks at these porn pics or when he goes to the bathroom (he takes his phone everywhere after the incident). 

I think that he even thinks that I didn’t noticed his lies throughout the whole situation. 

What should I do? I don’t want to confront him again as we talked about this topic a lot already.  
Trust and being truthful is everything to me and I just feel betrayed by his lies. (I also said something to him once in one conversation about his lies and he just denied lying and and said the lies were the truth (chrome, porn are videos, etc.))",08Apr2020,1

Apparently they are worried that they can’t afford to pay us the 80%, is it correct that they have to pay us then claim it back from the government?

Each week we have a couple of conference calls that either get cancelled, or we just chat about how everyone is coping. I stopped wanting a light hearted chat when I started to panic about my bills. It’s just hard being told that I will be told on “such a date”, telling myself to hang on in till that date, to then be told an hour before the call that it’s cancelled, it’s hard.

On top of that my landlord has not offered a rent break. I’m panicking.

First, context: I'm spending a few days in my dad's home, and sometimes I hear a woman screaming and insulting someone. I don''t know who she is,but it seems that she lives with someone (I'm not sure who is, but I hear someone arguing with that woman when she starts screaming) so I asume it's his/her son/daughter (again, I don't know)

Normally it goes like this: The woman starts screaming, insulting someone (You're shit, you're a little bitch, etc.) I can hear a boy/girl trying to argue, the woman insults and screams louder, until she stops.

I asked my father but he says that I should mind my own business, that she is just crazy.

Two weeks ago I started hearing the woman screaming louder than usual and clearly fighting with someone, so I get scared and I called the police. They said that they will fix everything. I don't know what they did, and the next days I didn't hear any screaming or insulting.

The problem is, recently the insults and screaming started again, now louder. And I'm not sure what to do. My father won't do anything, of course, but I can't just ignore this situation, knowing that this could be an abuse case. (I know, it could be anything).

Should I try to talk to her direcly? Call the police again? And why?",08Apr2020,1
377,"Okay, so this is going to be kind of hard to explain. I'm going to do my best, but if anyone has any questions before they can offer me advice, please feel free to ask.

For as long as I can remember i've had this ''thing'' where I can ''sense'' how other people feel. It's a feeling in my chest and stomach. It's fairly easy to identify what's happening and most of the time I can even tell who i'm ''feeling''. This doesn't happen with everyone I meet, it only seems to present itself with people I seem to care of have cared about. 

For example; when someone I care about is experiencing a negative emotion I can feel it in my chest, it feels like there's a vice around my ribs and breathing is harder. If someone is sad, i feel like my heart is being squeezed, etc. 

I can focus on it, and really try to ''read'' it, but I can't seem to filter it. There are some people out there i'd rather not ''feel'' anymore and it's an unpleasent experience in general. Does anyone what this ''thing'' is and how to control it better? It's not as easy as just ''not thinking about it'', ''ignoring it'' or breaking contact with said person, I have tried all of the above and even though ignoring it is always an option, I still have to experience it. I've also noticed that lately, this ''thing'' has grown stronger, more overwhelming. 

So, does anyone know what this ''thing'' is, and how I can either shut it off or filter it?",08Apr2020,1

381,"This’ll be long but please read.

In the midst of the COVID-19 situation I’ve been thinking about starting SOMETHING up, be it a YouTube channel, a business, anything really. For a long time I’ve been wanting to sort of get myself out there and gain a following on social media and such, because I want to be heard more and open myself up to more opportunities.

I’m 19 years old, I live in Chicago, born and raised, and I attend the University of Illinois at Chicago. I’m a freshman, I major in electrical engineering. I have a deep passion for the mathematically sciences, particularly, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. I like engineering too of course. That being said if anyone who reads this knows any condensed matter physicists, it would be nice if you can get me in touch with them. Just for possible opportunities in the future and for me to just pick their brain. I have a large number of textbooks on the mathematical sciences and I plan on reading all of them. I want to do reviews on them. 

I also love languages. I’m fluent in Mandarin, which I have been studying for 7 years. I have quite a bit of experience teaching Mandarin as well, a tad bit experience teaching English (which is harder than you think lol). I would say that I can pass HSK5 easy but I’m not sure about HSK6. I have many Chinese friends in college as a large percentage of the student population is Chinese, and I have no problem communicating with them. I have never been to China before. I wish to go there lol, if I went there I’m confident my proficiency would reach nigh native level. 

I’ve been trying to learn Russian. Я учу русский язык. It’s been hard starting up though. At the moment I can only say really really basic things. I have many Kazakh, Ukrainian, and Russian friends from school. I’m thinking about learning Spanish as well. I used to learn it in grade school.

Say I was to start a YouTube channel about me and what I do overall, what would I even do? I feel like I’m an interesting person but, I don’t know. I simply don’t know. I just want to put this here so I can get some advice to get the creative juices flowing.

Why deep down do I want to get myself out there, you might wonder. One reason is that when I look on social media I see a lot of pretty women, entertainment ,and athletes holding the world’s attention. It seems as if people don’t care about academic achievement anymore; new ideas and new intuitions is what changes the world. I want to inspire people, especially young people, to take more pride in academics. In Chicago, growing up, a lot of people only want to be or be associated with such people (pretty girls, rappers, athletes) that have a degree of clout. A lot of people want to live the fast life. What I’m saying may never reach the ears of such people, but I want to be a positive influence on as many people as I can.

Right now I’m essentially at a zero. How should someone like me go about increasing social media following and using my abilities to do big things and send a far-reaching message?",08Apr2020,1

394,Hello so this started about a year ago and since then My kife really changed. I didn't feel immediately in love with him. I felt it when the school year is about to end around march. We're not really close keep in mind and I'm still confused about why I feel this towards him. I tried messaging him about stuffs and its ok but I confessed my feelings for him in chat when I was about to commit suicide. Keep in mind that I'm a bisexual guy and we're both 16 he's a bit younger and he's quiet but he has friends. He's also the first to add me on my social media account but i didn't really gave much attention to it(biggest mistake that i did because if i somehow talked to him at that time we might even be friends now but no) instead i just accepted it and moved on now i feel like i missed my chance. He's stuck in me now. In my mind. In my heart. I tried so hard to move on but i can't. I tried for about 3 times and between those I actually felt like i could live without him but i can't. The feelings goes back every time. I'm so blinded by it that I don't even feel love for others. I do get attracted to some people but it's sexually and not feelings. The way i feel about him is both love and sexual but I love him more than I lust. Like I don't even want to have sex. I just want to hug him and kiss him. I know it's impossible to happen because I already got rejected or not because he was confused and i just said I sent my confession message to the wrong person. It's been a year and the feelings hasn't changed. I still feel it. And maybe it's because I've been daydreaming about my life with him since I've felt this. I stopped but it comes back whenever the feelings does. I feel like it's better to die than to live without him. I need some help and advice on what I should do. Thank you.,08Apr2020,1

Now onto the story. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started talking with this guy, I won't say names for obvious reason, and all was well for about 2 months. I'd go over, bring him clothes that I no longer wore but thought he would look great in them. I would also bring other gifts as well. I won't say for his privacy. As the months go on he tells me that ""all is well"" and ""not to worry"" which lightened me up, a lot. One day he tells me that he has PTSD because he hates who he once was and holy shit did I feel that. I felt so bad for him because I know what that's like. He didn't tell me specifics but I will tell you mine. I used to be a rapist. I was 12. My fucking god when I look back on it, I can't remember a day when I didn't want to drive a knife into my throat and I was like that for a long time so when he told me that, I wanted to cherish him and keep him safe and stay because he also told me that everyone of his exes leave because of how broken he was. Not me and I still don't. One day came where we had hung out and I asked for a kiss and some lewd photos. He kissed me and later that night did send the photos. Two days go by and I go to work only to have my best friend at the time look at me and say ""He has a girlfriend"". I got anxious and sent him a text asking if it was true. It was and he got into a relationship with her about a week and a half prior. It hurt but I understand that I can't please him in every way and she could please him in others, well I would have understood, if he told me about her sooner. About 2 weeks go by after this and I finally work up the courage to tell his gf that he cheated (I get a lot of back and forth with this). About a day after this I see that him and his roommates have either blocked me on facebook or deleted me. I thought to myself, ""alright, if that's how they're going to be then fine"". Turns out, someone hacked into my facebook account and sent him a death threat. Now before you say anything, I didn't even know my own password at the time. I haven't had a reason to change it until this. After freaking out and trying to get in contact with them to make amends, I should mention they know I'm not the one who sent the message, none of them want anything to do with me but god dammit I still want to be there for him because no one else knows how he's hurting but ***I know it will never happen.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, while I always have believed in the saying ""try, try again,"" I really don't want it to be another disaster and a repeat of the first time.

I try to be the best person I can be such as helping anybody who needs it, being there for my friends and family, and trying to make an honest living for myself. I’ve always been kinda handsome I guess. I’ve been able to have sex with women that most men would barely have to confidence to look at. I’m a great singer/guitar player and write my own songs. Music is the most important thing in my life and I practiced with my band several times a week before COVID-19. About 6 months ago I met a girl and fell madly in love with her. She’s everything I’ve always wanted: easy to talk to, not stuck up at all, and beautiful. The interesting thing about her is she’s so pretty that you’d think that she’d be full of herself but she’s very down to earth and that makes her even more attractive to me.

Fast forward 6 months later, we’ve spent many days and nights together or on FaceTime. Somethings having sex and cuddling, or sometimes just hanging out and watching tv, talking, or showing her whatever new song I was working on at the time. We get along great and have a good sexual chemistry. But every time I think things are about to get serious with her she either starts talking to her ex again or tells me she’s not ready for a relationship. I know I’m probably not doing anything wrong but I just feel like I’m not striking her as husband material. I have no clue how to change this or become more desirable to women in a boyfriend capacity and not just a friends with benefits situation. My last real relationship was 5 years ago in high school. I just feel like I’ve been left behind and don’t want to die alone. I know that’s pretty fatalistic talk for a 22 y/o but I can’t help but feel like if I don’t make a change then I’m just gonna end up one of those lonely old men at bars that make women feel uncomfortable. 

In conclusion, I try my hardest to be a classy, honest, and caring person. However I don’t feel like women want to lock me down. I don’t feel like they want to grow or build with me.

411,"TL;DR: My parents are making do me do a medicine degree which I don’t want to do anymore and I’m sure of this, should I defy them or not?

Hey guys, I’m currently a 16 year old living in the United Kingdom, taking my A levels right now.

I’m having a bit of an issue right now. What happened is that I’ve had a few arguments with my parents around what I want to study at university. Two of these happened last year in the summer and I eventually gave in like an idiot and told them I’d study medicine (I didn’t actually, I made it clear I liked maybe and physics and would rather do a degree in something like that). Soon after I was filled with regret and dread, but instead of doing anything I kept these feelings in me until just some days ago.

This was the third time, where I decided to admit to them as soon as I woke up that I did not want to do a medicine degree. This initially started an argument between both of my parents revolving around me, which lasted a good portion of the day. My parents are actually Nigerian but I don’t understand their language very well, so I didn’t know much about what they were arguing about. The day after though, my dad has a chat with me.

The chat was essentially him just telling me that I must study medicine because this has been his plan, and that I don’t have a proper plan for what I wanted to study (I suggested electrical engineering at this time). He said I must not deviate from this plan and told me I wasn’t stuck despite the fact he would only let me study medicine. He also told me about the fact that he was using his savings to allow me to go to a private school, that was with the expectation I would study medicine, since that’s what I used to want to do before I had a change of heart.

There was another chat where my dad also talked about the fact that this “plan” my parents had meant a lot to my mum, who would apparently have a breakdown if I did not follow through. He also told me that he could not keep arguing with my mum. He told me I must follow through with this plan no matter what.

I know that this isn’t the right thing to do since I know that I do not want to study medicine and I don’t think this is fair at all. It also doesn’t make sense that they’d so strongly want me to do medicine because I don’t even take biology at A level, because it’s my least favourite science, and biology is important for medicine. I take Maths, Chemistry and Physics. I also know for a fact I won’t like medicine because I volunteered in a hospital ward (before quarantine due to coronavirus) and I didn’t like it, I’m dreading going back to it.

I’m thinking of defying my parents but I’m scared of what they may do to me, so I have no clue what to do for now.

P.S: I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make much sense or is difficult to read/follow. A lot has happened regarding this and I’ve had to dig deep into my mind to think of a many things are possible that would be important to put in here.",08Apr2020,1

The issue is I cant figure put how to stop it, overhydrate before bed? Nope. Strips to open up my sinuses so I'm more likely to breath through my nose? Nope.

413,"I'm just finishing up my first year in a four year Philosophy degree.

Before this I did a year of Physics, which I found way too difficult when compared to my interest in the subject itself.

I have fairly broad interests, so I decided to try and Arts degree and Philosophy seemed like something I'd enjoy.

Academically I've had no problems in both courses, I just can't seem to shake my disinterest in studying them.

I've a fairly good idea that Philosophy is not something I want to pursue in any academic or professional capacity after graduation. It is interesting sure, and I do get marketable skills out of it, but in no way am I passionate about it.

I am not in a financial situation to switch courses again, and honestly wouldn't know what course to switch to that wouldn't result in the same outcome as this.

So my question is, how do I motivate myself to just get through the next three years of this degree?

Am I doing the right thing by continuing?

416,"its time for me (f14, eighth grade) to pick my courses for high school and i got recommended for honors advanced geometry, honors physics, honors english, honors spanish 3, and ap world hist (ik you guys probably had different courses but im just giving some context lol, these are basically highest class u can get into for each subject). Im conflicted on whether or not I should take ap world hist because I get stressed really easily and i dont want my freshman year to turn into a mess. im thinking of taking all of my recommended honors courses and take ap european hist in my sophomore year. but im afraid if i take this path i wont meet the number of expected ap or ib classes for the universities i want to go to. but if i take ap world hist (ppl say its very time consuming and demanding) its going to add to the already heavy workload i will be having from my other courses. there is also a two weeks period in the beginning of the year where we can drop our classes, but if i take AP world hist, i wont want to drop it because i do not like quitting, and i will feel embarrassed if my friends and classmates dont drop but i do.


theres also the problem of how many courses i should select (6 min 8 max) if i choose 6 courses i will have 5 free periods a week, 2-3 free periods if 7 courses and no free periods if 8 courses. i dont want my freshman and soph year to be that easy so that ill have more time to study for SATs in junior and senior year. the graduation requirements include the core classes credits and in addition to that 0.5 computer/robotics credit, 1 public speaking/debate/politics credit, and 1 performance/visual art credit (at least 22 credits total) i want to get the requirements over with in my first two years of high school, but then again i dont want to cross my own limits. so currently i dont know what to do.",08Apr2020,1

418,"Me and father don’t have the best relationship and to be honest I don’t want to fix it. He went to prison for attempted murder on my mom when I was 2. He was gone for 8 years and it was just me and my mom. I loved it. I grew up with mainly woman and only had one father figure. My grandfather...he wasn’t my biological grandfather but he took the role. So when my dad came back it was weird. It felt very unbalanced. When he first came back he had a job and seemed like he was going to have stable life with us. I was 10 around the time. But he did something that didn’t seem like a big deal at first . He drank a beer everyday. It was nothing extreme just 1-3 a day. He got my mom pregnant with my little brother and they started arguing more. He kick me and my mom out when she pregnant. My grandma broke up with my grandpa so I had no male figure anymore. A few years later we moved to another state and long story short became an unemployed alcoholic. My mom had to support the whole family and her pay wasn’t enough. Due to him not having a job me,my mom, and my brother had to move again. My grandma had lung cancer so my mother wanted to be closer to her. We said goodbye to our father and I felt free. I didn’t call unless he did and tried to block him out. I will admit he was nice person when he wasn’t drunk but that doesn’t make up for everything. He didn’t want to help my mom out at all when we moved. And when we did talk he he mostly would talk shit about my mother and how she left him with bills. Keep in my the whole time we moved he lived with he’s parents paying no rent and only has to take care of himself. He always calls me and when I pick up he talks shit about my mother and her side of the family. Today he snapped and yelled at me for never talking to him or his side of the family. His side of the family always made me feel left out. I’m a mixed person. I’m Hispanic from my father and half black, half Filipino from my mother. I look very different from them. They have straight hair while mine is curly and my skin is tanner. They make me feel guilty for wanting to eat something . When they are mad at my mother they take it out on me.

This may be long, I just need to vent.

So yesterday I found out that my mum has Multiple Sclerosis, I knew she was having an MRI yesterday because she was having problems with one of her eyes and dizziness, but her doctor was telling her nothing was probably wrong, so totally wasn’t prepared for this. 

I live in a different state from my mum, roughly about a 10 hour drive away, and I can’t even go see her at the moment with all of the border restrictions. I’m even more worried about her now with the current Covid-19 situation, as MS is an autoimmune disease, and she works in a hospital, so I guess she’s more at risk. 

I’m considering moving to be closer to her when Covid-19 is over, but who knows when that will be. This whole thing has just made me realise that I need to spend more time with my family and not take them for granted, my relationship with my mum isn’t the closest, and I need to at least work on that. My sister currently lives with my mum, but I feel like it would be good for her to feel like she has support from the whole family. 

My dilemma is that my partner I currently live with, does not want to move states, and even less live with my family(I know he doesn’t like them). This has also led to me questioning my relationship with him, I’m torn either way. My partner and I have lived together for our whole relationship of 16 months, and we own a business together, which I will be taking my name off in a few months(which we have discussed), as I want to pursue something different. My partner wants to do van life as well so that we can travel around more, and be more ‘free’, which initially I was excited for, but I honestly just feel like I want to go home to my mum at the moment. 

My life feels like a mess, I have no idea how to proceed, or even if I’m over reacting about everything.

My dad recently had a messy breakup with his ex girlfriend who we’ll call Alisha. Alisha has two children and we all lived together for several years but she hated my dad’s 3 kids (myself included, all 18+ while her kids were under 13). She recently moved out and it’s now myself, my dad and my sister living in the house as my brother has moved out. 

My dad has gotten very strict with Coronavirus going round now. There are to be no guests in the house - including my boyfriend and my sisters boyfriend, we are to follow the guidelines (we live in England FYI) and only leave the house once a day but see nobody or at least keep our distance, him and my sister are not working right now but I work in retail so have to go several days a week still, and we just generally have to stay safe and be clean. This is all fair enough. I haven’t seen my boyfriend now for around 4 weeks, however the problem is my dad continues to invite Alisha over despite their messy breakup, they go cycling and out together all the time, they go between houses even though they live separately now, and they absolutely do not keep 6 feet apart.

My sister and I do not get on with Alisha to start with because she’s rude and manipulative but my dad’s too in love to see it. If we try and bring up his contradictions to the strict guidelines he’s set us he spins things on us like I’m the one putting family at risk as I’m still working, it’s half her house still so she needs to come over (not true she often just comes to have a coffee or cigarette), and that it’s his house so he can decide who comes and goes.

446,"(34F) I have been employed at the same job for 12 years. It was my first professional job. I completed my internship there, graduated college and was hired on three months after. Next to being a supervisor I am as high as I can go. I always wanted the supervisors position once she retired but she is very indecisive about when she is retiring. There is a huge possibility I would get her job when that happens but there is also the smallest chance I won't. I have had many job opportunities to be a supervisor in other neighborhooding counties doing exactly what I do now but I always turned them down to stay with coworker friends, my family situation at the time, holding out for the supervisor position where I currently am and out of fear. Other than being offered those jobs I have never looked for another job. I am a state worker and have a lot of time invested and would hate to leave the state in fear of losing benefits, time saved and so forth. I have an opportunity to move into a new position (not a supervisor one) in a neighboring county doing something completely different than what I have been doing. Under new management with new coworkers, same pay and a little more travel. I am very unhappy where I am but I am afraid I might not like the new job and be just as unhappy. My supervisor loves drama and feeds off of it, she favors coworkers (mainly men and whoever benefits her at the time) she has a delivery method that keeps you stressed. We are never fully staff because are always calling in and where I work if that happens you have to cover there stuff it's not a wait til they get back kind if place and it's always been like that. I have been working from home for almost a month because of the quarantine and even being away from the office and coworkers at a distance hasn't helped. My body has physical reactions to when my boss calls me or I find out I'm stuck doing someone else crap because they've called in ""from working at home."" I also don't care for the work anymore. I still make sure my job duties are fulfilled because I do care about the clients but I have way less passion than I use to and I really just go through the motions because it's very repetitive at this point. I am nervous and fearful that i wont be able to perform at the new job or that I am making a wrong decision or not will be worse than I have it now. Also worried that if I leave my current office that things might get better and my boss will be different and my coworkers will get along better without me and I'm not sure how that makes me feel.

449,"It's holding me back from feeling proud of anything and it sucks! I just received a mark today for a university essay and before this point I have only received 1st class marks (72%-95%) and today I received a 68, which is a 2.1. It's very close to a 1st. And it's a good mark. Objectively I know that and I know this is going to sound so braggy but I literally don't even feel proud of that work now. I feel disappointed which even makes me feel guilty because I know others would love to be in my position.

I feel like I have tainted everything that I have done and it feels so bad. I'm scared of coming across really arrogant in this post but that's not my intention at all. The mark isn't even worth a lot. I just have these horribly high standards for myself and it's really exhausting to keep trying to adhere to them when it's the only thing that's important to me at the moment and a lot of my self worth relies on it. 

How can you just let go of these feelings and accept that not everything you do has to be perfect? I feel like if I had got this mark at the start of the year I wouldn't feel as bad but because I've ruined my 1st class streak I feel so demotivated now and pretty stressed out. :-(

My friends (online, yes I'm a gamer, and real life) have all said I as selfless as they come. This feeling of isolation I feel like are roots that constantly climb up my body and strangle me and devoid me of emotion. This year, there is something that I've struggled with and that is, I can't feel anything. My short bursts of joy and happiness are just that, short bursts. I see everyone at school before COVID-19, having people to lean on and yet there is no one for me at all as Ive surrendered myself to this darkness of isolation.

454,"( If this is inappropriate for this sub I will take it down. I know this is very long but it's all part of the conflict inside me. TL;DR at the bottom)

When I was 13 years old I got to know this guy in school who I found looked pretty... He was 4 (!!) years older than me at the time. For some reason we got together pretty fast, even though I didn't even know him, I just liked how he looked, because that's how you are at 13 years old. 

We had some things in common, but pretty fast I found out how he really was. He always talked about sex, how he was looking forward to doing it soon, how he was expecting it as a Christmas present and so on... He was really touchy, and only a few weeks into the relationship he went home with me while my parents weren't home. We ended up laying in bed and he took my hand and made me do things I didn't really want to do. During all of this I never had the power to say no, I just let it happen, thinking it was normal and that it was going to be better soon.

Shortly after this we broke up under confusing circumstances that I don't really remember. I didn't think about what happened at all for a long time, like my brain hid from me how bad it really was. It felt like it happened to someone else, not me. Then, a few years later, I got together with my now boyfriend and that's when I really realized, what happened back then and how much it had damaged me. When I think back about it I get flashbacks and I used to be unable to unfold my sexuality in a normal way. For example I used to have to get drunk before I could flirt with my long distance boyfriend over text...

Since then I got into therapy because of it, but 5 years later I am still scarred and can't think about the events without getting flashbacks and feeling horrible. 

So, now to the part where I need advice. Today I accidentally found my abusers Instagram account and apparently he has a girlfriend. I want to write to his girlfriend and tell her what he did to me and what the consequences for me are. I want to ruin his relationship/life as a form of revenge, but I am wondering if this is too petty. 

I also feel bad because I don't really want to harm the girl if she's happy with him, but I feel like she deserves to know what he's done and what he's capable of. 

So what do I do? Is it too petty and I should just get over myself? Does she deserve to know? Should she keep living in blissful ignorance?

TL;DR """"""""ex-boyfriend"""""""" abused me when I was 13 and he 17, this has left me traumatized. Found out he has a girlfriend, should I tell her and maybe ruin his relationship or get over it and leave them alone?",08Apr2020,1

460,"My parents are divorced. They are still friends to this day, my dad still helps us with financial problems whenever we need help. My mom got full custody of me. My dad moved to another country after their divorce was finalized.

At first, we had gotten along and even though I was kind of struggling with the divorce and all, I still manage to pull through. Lately though, my mom and I had gotten into so many fights. Most of which end up in us crying, shouting, etc.

I forget things a lot and make mistakes every now and then like every other person and of course, she gets mad at me. For example, she gets mad at me when I forget to do chores.

But then after I'm done with chores, she just has to find something to blame on me and then lecture me about it. It was tolerable for the first few years (3 years to be exact). I didn't talk back to her and I understood she was just tired from work and that's why she lashes out on me every night, I didn't think much of it. (Note: she slapped me every few weeks or so but it wasn't that bad.)

However, it escalated into her slapping me every few days and/or throwing stuff wherever resulting me to waste more time trying to fix her mess whenever she gets mad. I tolerated it for a few months but after a while, I couldn't take being treated like that anymore so I started to rebel.

It came to the point where if she was to slap me, I would scream as loud as I could. She would retreat of course and then leave me alone. That went on for a week. Sometimes, I slowed down as much as I could and delayed my arrival home as to avoid her. It came to the point where I didn't feel safe there anymore.

However, that didn't last long. The next week, when I screamed, she had slapped me and screamed at me to shut up. I remember trying to shout again for help but she had slapped me again and said something along the lines of, ""I dare you to f-cking shout again!"" Since then, I haven't tried to shout for help whenever she laid her hand on me.

Her lectures took a huge toll on my mental health. Her lectures would be a collection of:

""You're a f-cking mistake! A failure! God, why did I get a daughter like you?!"" ""God, you're f-cking ugly. Do you ever try? (Note: I remember she said this to me on a nice day in where I really actually tried, ruined my whole week. Not the only time she's said it to me thought.)"" ""Sl-t! Stop f-cking texting your boyfriend and wash the f-cking dishes here!"" (I didn't even have a boyfriend at the time but was only friends with a bunch of dudes.) ""I wish I never fought for you in court! If only I knew.""

I had actually tried talking to her about it and it didn't end well. I tried multiple times but she just couldn't understand my point. She thought I was just always wrong and disrespectful as I had lashed out a few times when her words really got to me. I tried talking about it to my teacher and she had nothing much to say.  I had opened up about it to my friends and at first, I naturally thought it was normal for parents to slap you or punish you in a similar way whenever you made a mistake. They had told me it wasn't. They told me to talk about it to a police or something.

I smiled and had thanked them for the idea. I wanted to, but my mom was smart. Whenever she laid a hand on me, she wouldn't leave a mark. What evidence did I have that she was verbally abusing me? I knew they couldn't do anything about it. But I still tried once.. Let's just say it didn't end well with the police officer I had talked to since.. he.. took away my innocence..

Fast forward to now, I lost my friends and don't have anyone to talk to as they were busy with their partners and I had found out that 5 of them disliked me and had even talked bad about me behind my back. Needless to say, my relationship with my mom hasn't improved and it doesn't look like it ever will.",08Apr2020,1

So, the people that live next to me in my apartment building fight constantly. It’s a younger couple (early 20’s?) with a baby boy and a little girl. The fighting always starts with one of the kids crying, and then it sounds like things are being thrown, (ex. One time something was thrown so hard it knocked TWO picture frames off my wall), doors and cabinets being slammed, or maybe even people being shoved/pushed around??? idk. Then it’s always the wife who starts ballistically screaming and crying. I never really hear yelling or anything from the dude, but I always hear him telling her to “shut up” and “stop crying” because “people will hear” in a very mean voice, but not yelling. I’ve heard her scream over and over again “I hate you” and “I don’t wanna be with you” and “stop leave me alone don’t touch me” and things like that. A couple times it’s even sounded like the husband is hitting the wife and pushing her around into the walls and stuff. One time I heard her crying and screaming “it’s not fair how you can just take my phone, I should be allowed to look through yours too!” And he said “shut up. It doesn’t work like that. Stop crying everyone can hear you” and then things got really loud (slamming, etc.) also, I’m not going out of my way to listen, it’s just so loud I can literally hear them on the opposite side of my apartment. Im surprised the cops haven’t gotten called yet. I’m starting to get uncomfortable listening to it and feel like I need to do something? But at the same time it’s really none of my business. After what I heard yesterday, I have an even weirder feeling. I was coming home and could hear perfectly in the hallway, the wife’s car wasn’t there so it was just the husband home with the kids. The little girl was screaming and crying saying she wants to leave and telling the dude to leave her alone and then he said to her “if you don’t shut up in 5 seconds I’m going to pinch you so hard” like wtf? Pinch?? Weird. Am I over reacting or should I like call the cops or something?

469,"Hello! I'm not sure who to ask about this but I thought this could be a place to begin. I am using an old throwaway because my main account is using the name that I am asking about. When I was a kid I read a book series that I really liked, and there was a character with a name that I liked. I have basically used that name online for everything since then (Instagram name etc) The name is pretty unique, I've never seen anyone else use it, and the books aren't super well known. It was also a very minor character. Having said this, I'm a ""hobby musician"". I write and produce music for fun. Lately I've been considering uploading some of my songs to like Youtube, and I would love to do so under this name since at this point I identify with it quite a lot, it feels like my name but I don't want to use my actual name. I don't expect to get famous, mostly it would make it easier to share my music with friends. Now to the actual question. Does the author own this name (or rather her agency, as she unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago)? Could I get in trouble for using it? I have considered emailing her agent but it feels like a really stupid question so I wanted to anonymously ask the internet first.

I get that if I wanted to release music under the name ""Harry Potter"" that might not be okay since it's such a well known name but if you Google this name four out of five top suggestions are my accounts on different social medias.

I’ve been “best friends” with a girl for about 3 years. I don’t really have any other friends than her, so I’m bad at noticing when somebody is not a good friends because I don’t have many. I had never noticed problems in our friendship. Until I was noticeable sad in a car with her, she asked why and I told her that it was around the time of my fathers death anniversary, she began to tell me that i should not be sad because “since my dad died a while back I should have just gotten over it, and how it wasn’t a big deal.” I felt hurt after she said that, but she said that she didn’t mean it like that and that she was just trying to make me feel better. But it still hurts a lot, the words she said still effect me when I mourn even tho this happens months ago. We also both got into a program where only a select few were chosen by grades, (program where you get to go on a trip and learn about different cultures) which I’m super interested in, but the fee was very expensive, my mom and I couldn’t afford it so I didn’t get a chance, I told her this. Then soon after she told me how excited she was to go to this trip (her family is well off) I would normally be happy for her, but she kept on telling me about it, telling me how fun it would be, telling me how “ it must suck to have a single mom who couldn’t afford the trip.” That also hurt, these are not things I cant help, but maybe she was just trying to sympathize with me.

People can’t even go to births - funerals or to see their loved ones in the hospital dang it! 

Growing up in a family that struggled financially and wasn’t there to “support” because they were working, we kids always had to figure it out. But those setbacks are what made us stronger - resilient and truly learn how to be creative.

I’m really really sorry if any of this is incomprehensible because I have had a lot to drink over the past little while.

I’ve tried really hard to forget about being bi over the past several months, obviously it hasn’t really worked and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think being gay/bi is a bad thing and before I knew about myself I considered myself a really passionate ally. I think about boys and crush on them all the time, if I’m being honest I think about them more than I think about girls. I’m still in to girls and they’re definitely really hot but for some reason the thought of the romantic aspect of guys just makes me totally melt. I fantasize about guys all the time, I’m a pretty masculine looking person but really cute guys make me feel very feminine. All of this makes me really sad for several reasons that I’ll go into below.

The first reason it depresses me is because it feels like everyone I know will be so disappointed/disgusted with me. I am from a really rural town in eastern Kentucky and most people are still really homophobic. I see anti lgbtq posts all the time on facebook and hear it from people all around my hometown. Pretty much everyone in my town knows me, for starters it’s a small town but my dad is also a huge public figure in our town. I know it may not seem like a big deal to you guys but he’s the most successful highschool football coach we’ve ever had and to a lot of people that’s a huge deal, he’s much more well known than any politician in our town. My parents always talk about how excited they are for grandkids and my dad makes a big deal about how I’m the only one out of my siblings (I have a few sisters) who gets to carry on the family name and I don’t want to take that From him :(. My dad also is guilty of some homophobia, all throughout my life he’s made fun of my gay uncle by calling him things like “fudge packer”, I don’t think he’s a bad person but I feel like he definitely holds some backwards views towards same sex relationships.

Another reason it’s been making me depressed is because it feels like a lot of gay guys don’t like bi men anyways. I don’t judge gay guys if they dislike me; their reasoning seems somewhat understandable because they bring up how the bi guys they were with left them for women. It makes sense to me how that would easily taint your image of certain people because of that experience, it just sucks because women don’t want bi guys either. I’ve heard plenty of girls talk about how bi guys are really gay but just afraid to commit, I’ve heard plenty of guys say this too. I don’t want to be a problem for people and it makes me sad to think about the fact that if I ever were to put myself out there guys and girls would turn me away for my sexuality.

And the last main reason it makes me depressed is because I’m not sure anybody would want me anyways. I feel like I’m really ugly and at the moment women want nothing to do with me anyways, it scared/depresses me to think about ever coming out and turning out to not even be good enough anyways. I know it’s not anyone’s fault that I’m ugly, I’ve tried really hard to fix it by losing 85 pounds but still I feel like I’m pretty disgusting. It feels like I have nothing to offer anyone anyways so coming out feels like shooting myself in the foot.

I don’t want to come out and scare guys and girls away, and then also ostracize myself from my town for not being “godly” enough. Girls are always afraid that bi guys are really gay and gay guys have had bad experiences with guys who eventually settle down with women, and the people in my hometown always talk down to the lgbt community. 

I just feel like I’m trapped, like I have all of these feelings and urges but whats the incentive to come out? I don’t want to come out just to never be good enough. I don’t want to be alone forever but at the same time I understand why nobody would want to be with me. I don’t know how to handle the depression it’s put me in, I am constantly worried about how to fix myself and make myself good enough. I have to drink and smoke pot every day just to forget about it. 

I’m sorry for the long post, i know it’s kind of cringey but I’d really appreciate some help.",08Apr2020,1
477,"Male mid 20s. 

A few months ago I was shopping in the city. I was standing still wondering where to go when I saw someone looking at me at the corner of my eye.

 She was probably looking at me for about 10 seconds. I then decided to look turn my head and look at her. She was standing there leaning slightly forward, she was smiling, her jaw was dropped and she just kept on staring at me. We had eye contact for about 3 seconds until I turned around and walked away. 

About a few weeks after I was in the city and I saw her again. We were walking in the opposite direction. I looked at her and she looked back with an angry face. I then kept on walking and I could see her still being angry at the corner of my eye. I then looked at her again and she gave me the same angry look. 

I got freaked out and then just looked straight and kept walking.

478,"\*\*TLDR\*\*  
\*\*-am close with bosses/families\*\*  
\*\*-business is suffering cause of COVID\*\*  
\*\*-my hours got reduced and then retroactively told wouldn't be paid\*\*  
\*\*-asked if I could volunteer, and come back in the summer\*\*  
\*\*-i'm skeptical they're gonna be still open in the summer\*\*  
\*\*-have another paid job, but want to volunteer some still, but unsure about making future/summer plans cause I don't know what's going on and kinda doubt my bosses do either\*\*  


Long-ass title tells most of the story, but more details  


Background: For several years I've worked for a really small company, like \~5 employees. I'm close with the owner of the company, and even more so my direct manager. Stuff like holidays together, pet sitting, and crashing over her place when the roads are bad. My direct manager has known me and my husband since we went to school with her kids.  


In the midst of COVID-19, my hours got reduced and I was told  payroll would be late. (I figured at that point that the business was gonna close) THEN, the next week, \*after\* I'd come in and worked my already reduced hours, I'm told they're actually ""not offering paid work at the moment"" but would love me to come back as a volunteer (I did start out as a volunteer for several months back when I started working there). It would have been really nice to know this in advance, but I also very much doubt my boss knew herself as she is notoriously not financially savvy.  


So yes, I did used to be a volunteer, obviously I enjoy doing tasks there for their own sake (it's outdoor work and good for my mental health). It also makes me sad to think of this business closing. I want to both spend time there while I can in the event that it does close, and also not damage my outside-work relationships with what ends up happening to the business. However, I have another part time job where I can pick up more hours, which obviously I will now need to do. I still want to volunteer, but only when I have time, or when I decide. I worry it'll look petty if I don't show up for several days at a stretch, or don't come in at a specific time.   


I feel I need to talk with them about the reality of coming back in the summer, or if the business will still be around. The owner is ironically not always the most business-minded (having inherited the company from her parents) and I don't even know if she would have a realistic view of if the business will close or in how long.   
I realize like 90% of that was just rambling and not actual advice-seeking but  
What now?",08Apr2020,1
479,"Look man, I'm 16 years old and I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me. I just need some fucking advice, so I made a random reddit account. Since I was young, I had trouble talking to new people- I'd always envision making friends, how to talk to them and all, but I could never approach them. I'm obsessed with being at the top of everything though, so I somehow made friends. Throughout the years I went through a weeb kind of stage and an emo stage. I have these moles on one part of my face so I'd use my hair to cover it up. I have terrible self-confidence and I don't allow myself to wear certain clothes say certain things and my voice is fucking the ugliest ass shit ever. I'm skinny and I'm your typical asian with ugly ass chink eyes. Of course, I got my good fucking grades, but because people were building a stereotype off of that I got into sports. Then I only hung out with the 'popular' kids when I got into sports growing a hatred for my 'nerdy' friends. I'm so fucking awkward too so what gave me the right? In Grade 8, I joined every sport, but basketball and track stuck out to me. At this same year my twin brother who is 'chubby' went on random outbursts claiming he's kill himself- which he admitted was for attention- and throwing shit when he did something wrong. It was embarrassing and everyone weighed the responsibility of watching after him on me. This effected my image and I grew a secret hatred for him, because we related in no way whatsoever. My mom is always concerned about everything and my dad always comes home from work angry. There is really no abuse except for the daily arguments and my father getting mad at the smallest shit like chewing with your mouth open, but at another seek of attention my fucking twin brother decided to tell random ass people that my dad beats him up. This resulted in a large miscommunication with social workers and therapists and shit. Ultimately, the doctors diagnosed my brother with Asperger's Syndrome a spectrum of Autism and ADHD. But, my stubborn father refused to let him get on the drug because he thought it would only make shit worse. So my brother continuously stressed all of us out. My mom focused all her attention on him and of course I was jealous at first, but this grew into a hatred for the both of them. I realized my mom is a house mom that keeps a fake smile in front of others and only getting mad at us. She has 7 other siblings that have their own family, but she seems to like them more than her children. I truly appreciate the things my parents do for me: I have an education, I have food and clothes. Though, at most times they wouldn't let me go out and if I were 10 minutes late to a curfew they'd threaten to disown me, it never was too bad. I just genuinely COULD NOT relate to my parents nor my brother so I never grew a tight relationship with them. Plus, whenever I start conversation, and once they formulate an opinion, it's impossible to change it. In Grade 9, I moved to high school, in a whole new district. I found myself too socially lazy to consistently talk to the 'cool' kids and ended up repairing my relationship with my old 'nerd' friends. In grade fucking 9, I barely even opened my mouth, I couldnt fucking speak, I was a loner. And my shy ass didn't join any sport thinking I wouldnt make it anyway. Miserable year. My old school was predominantly Black and Asian and this new school was all whites. My subconscious racial tendencies made me uncomfortable for the whole year, they were all rich white kids with airpods and mac laptops and it boiled my blood how spoiled they were. So I just became more closed off. In Grade 10, this year... I told myself to join a team... I broke my finger playing tag football in gym class and missed basketball tryouts. I became more distant with everyone, really. I brushed everything off as a joke as per usual and lied in my bed everyday unsatisfied with my fucking ugly untalented average ass asian wimp nerd self that no dude will ever fucking love because I'm a fucking loser who cant talk to anybody. And thinking this everyday made my social anxiety worse. I hid it, I hid everything. I get too scared to answer Instagram messages but get sad when no one dms me. Fucking bitch. And the close group of 'nerd friends' are the only ones that are there for me nowadays, but the only thing I tell them is jokes and funny shit cause I'm scared they'll think I'm a psycho when I tell them I genuinely hate my family with no good reason as to why. I made some friends at my school, I really did. But it's not enough to satisfy me, all the friends I made are either no that close or the 'nerd' type, which I'm trying to steer away from because I dont wanna live up to my stereotype. And By semester 2, I finally joined track with an equally antisocial friend of mine, things were looking good, I was talking to people. But then, this whole quarantine shit happens. I start realizing more and more shitty things. I can't do sports, I can't have alone time because my mom will be breathing down my neck the whole time. I'm pretty sure track and field was the only thing keeping me sane, I mean, hell I was getting good grades too, but now its all online. I can't FOCUS online. I can't FOCUS in my room. I can't FOCUS in my household when there's so much as my mom yelling all the damn time. I'm growing a hatred for my family. My brother gets all of the attention cause now he has bladder problems, BOTH MY parents are diabetic and cranky. My dad still has to go out for work since he works in a bank. And I couldn't relate to them before, no difference now. We have absolutely nothing in common: My family and I. They have a completely different mindset, they dont strive for goals and greatness. Everytime they see me they think I'm up to no good. They assume I'm doing some crazy shit. I can't even really formulate the problem at the moment cause there is so much going through my fucking crazy ass head. Don't mind my dumbass just ranting, imma leave now and try to do my stupid online homework that gives me headache staring at a bright screen all day.",08Apr2020,1
480,"I'm sorry if this isn't the subreddit for this, I'm relatively new to reddit but suddenly thought of something that happened to me a while back, and thought that someone here might have answers.

Backstory: My mum and my dad dated for 10 years, but never got married / moved in together etc. When mum fell pregnant with me, she didn't find out until 4 months before I was born. When she told my dad, from what I've been told, he more or less said ""that's nice, I'll see you around some time"" and left. As far as I'm aware, mum hasn't had ANY contact with him, whatsoever, since that day 16 years ago, and I've never had anything to do with him, other than seeing like 2 pictures of them together.

For context, my mother is 58 yrs old currently, and had never used wifi or technology, until about 4 years ago, when we got wifi at home and she bought herself an ipad. She isn't on any social media, and uses sentences such as ""will google know that?"" for basic stuff, to show how not-technology based she is etc. My mum is addicted to playing candy crush on her iPad, and one day saw ""link your facebook to the game etc / save progress etc"", so she decided to mAKe a FaCebOOk. The account was completely blank, and the ONLY info she had given was ""FirstName LastName"". Despite not in contact with my dad in 16 years, not knowing anything about him, never having googled him, been around him etc, my dad was the first person in the ""people you may know"" section.

Does anyone know how tf this has happened, should we be concerned? (I walked in on her crying saying ""he's trying to find me"" etc, and immediately deleted her account, but I'm still curious as to why/how this happened in the first place.) Thank You.",08Apr2020,1

My pay is basically minimum wage in my country and I work 10 hours a day with an hour's break only when all the kids are asleep (2pm).

Keys to Increase our **self strength and Positive Energy.**

Be aware that what is happening these days on the planet is a normal thing in life... disease, old age, death is waiting for everyone, it's okay! This crisis is a message to let us know that our social model is not viable and that we need to change.

We haven't been acting well towards Mother Nature and she gives us back what we have done (it's not a punishment, it's just the change of our coin.

Accept it, do not worry and simply take care of the ones you love as the strangers, do not suffer from this low energy field made with fear, and anxiety created by media, governments, and people freaking out, these negative emotions and thoughts are toxic for you, do not give them importance, observe them coming and let them go away.

Think about what you want to do or change to make the world a better place, do not forget that the change you want to see the need to start from you to have a real effect.😇

486,"My cousin is pregnant.

A few days after she announced the pregnancy publicly my mom called me and told me that my cousin called her to say she wanted to ask me to be the godmother of her baby. My cousin doesn't know I know. 

That confuses me a lot as I barely know her (my mom told me because she was surprised too). 

We never see each other, never call, never speak online.

She already has a kid who I've seen twice in my life and who doesn't know me. I don't even know his age. I have never been to her place, she never met my partner and I've never met her dog. 

I believe she (and her close family) used to think I wasn't stable or would be a failure because I listen to rock music, had piercings and dyed my hair when I was a teen, I've been to music festivals and parties, I don't eat meat, I started university but changed major after finding out I wasn't happy with what I was studying...

Now I graduated, I have a job in a cultural centre that makes me very happy and allows me to bathe in culture and art, I have brown hair and not eating meat is now seen more as ""healthy and caring"" than extreme (as it was 10 years ago). She and her close family now think highly of me. It makes me feel like they care more about the image than who I really am.  They also acted a few time with hypocrisy and interest to get money or stuff out of people. These are things I'd never spend energy on as I think it's wrong (ex: trying to get money from a deceased family member, being interested in expensive objects more than just the simple stuff just to ""pretend"" ). 

She also told my mom she wanted me to only speak English to her kid (we are a French speaking family but my boyfriend and I speak English at home because he doesn't speak French).

I've got nothing against the idea. I think it's pretty sweet that she thought of me. She told me and my mom she wanted to get closer to me and to see me more often. But I am so confused and I don't think it's fair for me to be the godmother of her child. 

I don't understand why she thought about me and I don't want to be an asshole by questioning her when she asks me but it's really weird. I don't know if she  genuinely wants to get closer to me as she likes who I became or if she acts out of interest. 

I need advice on what to do and on understanding what her motivation is. Should I tell her that I'm flattered but ask her if she is sure as I barely know her and her kid? 

Also, another cousin who I am VERY close to is trying to get pregnant and she wants me to be the godmother. That is normal, we are like sisters and I see her a lot. I would be way closer to that child than to my other cousins child. It is really unfair and not natural.

TLDR: My cousin wants to ask me to be the godmother of her child but I barely know her and we are very different. I don't understand why and I think it isn't reasonable to choose me.",08Apr2020,1
487,"Let me preface this by saying that I feel terrible to have to think about this decision. I have spent the past few nights beating myself up and crying already so please no need to tell me I fucked up or I'm a horrible dog parent.

That being said my husband and I finally moved into our own home recently. Shortly after we we're super excited to finally have a dog of our own. We talked about what we wanted and after visiting some shelters we landed on a puppy (16 week boxer) that someone else had to surrender. 
We thought this would be the perfect time to introduce a puppy/dog into our home because I am working from home. 
I knew having a puppy/dog would be difficult but it's proving to be more than I can handle or schedule in.
She needs to be taken out every 45 minutes or she'll pee. I can't have her out for play or training because five minutes in she'll be peeing. 
I know she's supposed to be able to hold it for four hours max but she will only hold it in her pen. The second she is out she's peeing. I took her to the vet and nothing's wrong with her.
My company changed my schedule and way of working due to everything going on so I have to be physically working for different shifts and I can't just stop whenever I want to take her out. Because of that it feels like I am just taking her out for her to potty and then she has to go back in the pen because she's pottied somewhere and I have to clean it up.

I feel the best thing to do would be to rehome her to someone who really has the time to take care of her properly. Not just to have her get by but to have freedom. We don't have a backyard so it makes the whole house breaking and potty situation harder.

All in all it breaks my heart. I really love her but I don't think we're doing right by her. I know moving is stressful for dogs but I think it'll be better in the long run. 

Any advice?",08Apr2020,1
488,"I'm in college and live in a house with 5 other guys. We're all college ""seniors"" (whatever that means anymore) except for one who's a few years older than us. I met all of them in college except for one guy, who I'll call Ben. For the most part, everything is great with the others. Pretty much all my problems lie with Ben.

I've known Ben for almost my whole life and we've been very good friends the whole time. There have been a few times where I thought he was acting like a bit of a dick but I didn't think anything of it. I figured everyone acts like that from time to time. I didn't start noticing any of the actually shitty behavior until we moved in.

We all moved in together at the start of junior year and things were fine at first. As time went on though, Ben started getting worse and worse. He never does his dishes despite all of us asking him to constantly, he never buys anything for the house (toilet paper, paper towel, soap, food, etc.) but uses anything he sees like it's his own, I'm pretty sure he's taken things from my room, he never cleans up after himself, he takes over hour long showers in the morning when I have to get to class, etc. Basically any bad roommate trait you can think of, he has. 

This on its own I could deal with. The real issue is that he is so narcissistic and self absorbed that he doesn't see anything he does as a problem. Any time somebody calls him out for anything (and I do mean anything) he'll come up with an excuse and won't claim responsibility. All of us have asked him to change his behavior and he never has. Not even a little bit. He's the type of person who doesn't think anything is ever his fault. In his head, he's always been the coolest, funniest, most interesting person in the room and nothing anyone will ever say will change that. He sees himself as the taste maker of the house: if someone is playing music on a speaker he'll kick them off without asking to play his own music, he always wants to choose which movie/show we watch, he's always trying to come up with the ""plan"" for the day, etc. 

This post is already long so I wont, but I could go into plenty of other details to let you know who this guy is (he constantly says the n word and the r word for ""comedic effect,"" he's a typical sleaze bag who lies to and leads girls on just for sex, yada yada yada) but I'll leave it at this. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

What should I do about this guy? I've already decided that he's ruined any chance of us being friends after we move out but do you have any advice on how to not go crazy while quarantined with him?

tldr: After living with one of my oldest friends, I've learned that he is a narcissistic, controlling, idiot who refuses to change his behavior. What should I do?",08Apr2020,1

To start off let me explain what I mean by “most of my friends live in another state”. When I was about 10 my parents divorced and my mom moved to another state. Less than 1,000 miles from where I grew up. I spent 5th grade through 12th grade living in said state with my mom. I hated living there, the weather was always bad and most importantly I always felt alone. Until high school, I didn’t have any friends. I suffered with major depression, suicidal ideation, insomnia, anxiety, panic disorder and so on. So when I graduated high school I moved back to my home town. I started a pretty good job and I’ve been there for a while now. I like my job and living situation a lot.

However, growing up without many friends taught me you need to hold onto what you can. I currently live with my only friend still in my hometown. Things have been going great with just a minor hiccup here and there. I’m worried I made a mistake in leaving behind my 4 closest friends. I saw what happiness my mom got back when she moved. She started hanging out with her old friends and she was just always in a good mood.

I know that if I wanted to I could get a job there, and be happy. However that would mean moving away from my dad and best friend. I’m obviously very conflicted about this and would like to know some other opinions or options. I would love to visit but with everything going on in the world right now, I just don’t know if or when that would be possible.

It helps to be safe, of course, and by avoiding big risk, I've avoided big losses, but over the last few months I've been reflecting on how many opportunities I've missed just because I spent too much time debating on whether or not to do it. This is with life stuff, friend stuff, personal hobby stuff, it's really everywhere. 

What do you suggest to get me out of my shell and get me into taking risks? Is this a permanent fixture of my personality or is there a way to knock off my habits. Thanks for the responses.",08Apr2020,1
507,Last night i received a phone call from a young lady that asked if I know a lady named XXX. I said I did and i even spelled her name back to her because it is a very unique spelling. She conformed that I was correct and said that she was my daughter. She did a DNA test and found out her dad wasnt her dad and it lead back to my family and then to me. Apparently her mother did not tell her or me about it and took it to the grave with her. It was only through the DNA test that she found out. So yeah i just found out I have a 23 year old daughter.,08Apr2020,1
508,"So... An older female friend of mine has a problem with this stalker, except we don't have a clue who the guy is. 

The dude shows up on random nights at around 1 am.
She has a weird sleeping schedule for an adult woman so she's still awake at that time. 

After the first time she noticed him, a camera has been installed that notifies here of movement... So now everytime she gets a notification at that time she's scared to even move. 

Police have been called multiple times but the dude always disappears a few minutes before they show up. Also he's gone as soon as he thinks he has been spotted... 

So basically my question is, are there any ways tho enhance the face on the camera footage? Or maybe another way to fix this problem?",08Apr2020,1
509,"I know in life there's people that will always dislike you, and there's not a lot you can do about it, but it's getting to me more and more lately.

I do a lot for my local running club - I was a big part in creating the thing. A lot of the people that go there, do so because i introduced them, or they attended my beginner running sessions. I created the logo, got the initial setup done. For the first 6 months, I was doing so much work to help.

We moved into a club hut in the winter and things changed - it just felt like I was constantly rubbing people up the wrong way, I couldn't figure out why. I get the feeling because I do a lot on social media, i'm a running coach now etc, that maybe they think i'm too confident, or a show off. I don't know why, but virtually everyone on the committee seems to dislike me. It got to a point where recently (not even recently, 2 months ago now) 2 committee members sat me down and we had a full argument, which ended in me feeling I have to step away from that side of the club as I didn't want all the aggravation that was coming from it.

But what annoys me is i'm not a bad person, and all i've ever wanted to do is try and help people. If I was rude, or selfish, or had some horrible traits that I knew of, i'd understand it. But I don't, and so it's frustrating for me. 

I feel ridiculous as i'm in my thirties, I should just accept that you can't please everyone. I just don't get it, and it gets to me inside knowing that people dislike me that much.",08Apr2020,1

I've been applying for 9 months now and have received essentially someone with more experience has accepted the job. My girlfriend left for the peace corps around that same time I started applying. I was extremely happy for her fulfilling her dream and we decided to focus on ourselves a couple months in and all I wanted was to get a job to make her proud of me. I started to battle with depression, living at home, working a very unfulfilling retail job, getting rejected by jobs I want and missing the first person that came into my life that I loved more than myself and gave me a purpose to improve myself for her. I brought up some of these feelings to her when we were only talking a couple times a month. I was hoping she would give me loving words and maybe we could talk more often and I could understand her life there more. She didn't take it well, she was trying to move on, I started to get extremely anxious and started to become selfish and got emotional which freaked her out more. A couple days later she finds out shes being evacuated and had to come home. She reached out to me to let me know shes home, I sent a message welcoming her back. I also sent a message to her mom for advice on giving her space but also wanting to be there for her during a tough transition. My mindset was to not get a mutual friend involved and want to get advice from someone who really knows and love her. She obviously found out it and understandably got freaked out. We aren't communicating right now. That was a rant but anyways, I'm not having any success getting a wildlife job that i don't even know anymore will make me happy. I don't want another entry level job cleaning bathrooms and doing grunt work for a park. I want to take a stride in life getting money and getting an apartment and continue to work on myself and hopefully show this girl that I want a future with her and am willing to do what it takes to make that happen.

I'm sober from marijuana which I think really held me back before, I'm mediating, changed my diet and adopting new hobbies but I'm still not as happy as I was with her. I guess I should stop with all the background stuff to make myself feel better. The big advice question is should I continue to apply for this very competitive field (now more than ever) of jobs I got my degree in or should I pursue a sales/finance like job, continue to work on myself and hopefully try and get this girl back in my life? Also I feel like I could volunteer in Natural Resources while working a sales/finance job I have a good lead on and maybe get my foot in the door by that after 2 or 3 years.

513,"I’m in my third year of college living 4000 km away from my family and where I grew up. I had a lot of challenges with my parents growing up: with lots of physical violence. I have had issues some serious issues with my moms boyfriends and partners in the past (though they change pretty frequently) which adds to the already tremulousness of the situation.  


I have gone back home for breaks, sometimes for months at a time. I grew up on a very rural island where it is really difficult to get anywhere without a car. For reference, the closest bus stop to my dads home was a 30 minute drive. We all fight a lot (my parents siblings and i), both my parents partners both. I don’t like the lack of privacy.. i could probably find 10000 more things that i dont like. 

However, despite our issues, i love my family so gosh darn much. I miss them all a lot — especially my siblings. I miss them so much that i cry a lot thinking about them or talking to them on the phone. There are some other factors which make me want to go back. Below will be a list of my pros and cons, what would you do if you were me:

Pros of going home:
-get to see my family whom i love and miss 
-get to play with my doggos, goats, pigs, cows all of my four legged family! 
-would be 30-45 minute drive max,  away from the beach at any moment 
-i would finally be out of the same state as a person who abused me as a child
-no more dorm bathrooms or kitchen! 
- i could see and spend time with good friends i hadnt seen in years

Cons of going home
-no privacy
-lots of fighting
-i wouldnt have a car
-i would have 6 am classes because of the time difference.
-different state as my dr’s
-so much sand
-my family is super judgemental which makes me feel like shit about myself (but pro is i tend to take better care of myself with them because im afraid of being judged)",08Apr2020,1

517,"So I’ve been going to therapy for almost a year now. I go to a specialized trauma therapist because I have severe PTSD, and he’s helped me a lot with EMDR therapy. I have several sources of trauma, but my mother is definitely one of the major ones. Let me explain some backstory before I get to the actual advice part. 

My mother grew up getting abused by her stepfather, and she basically didn’t know what parental love was. She ended up marrying my dad super young, and then they had eight kids. My theory is that she wanted to show tons kids the love she never received. However, because she didn’t have good parental influences, she had no idea what she was doing when she raised as. As a result, a lot of really bad things happened in my childhood house, including sexual abuse from an outside party. I don’t blame my mom for that abuse specifically, but she was a stay-at-home mom and never caught the abuser. He ended up abusing my older sister and my three younger sisters. I was safe for whatever reason. However, finding out that someone we were supposed to trust had done that was traumatic, and then my mom ended up protecting that person and the case was dropped. Yep, he abused four children and is not on the sex offender registry and never spent a day in jail. 

On top of that, my mom was always verbally abusive. Until I was an adult, I thought I was unintelligent and lazy because my mom told me I was every single day. She also insulted me all the time for “not walking with God.” She basically let’s her Christianity guide her entire life, and she’s so caught up in it that she uses it as a tool for abuse. She has physically abused me a few times too. If I ever made her mad enough, she would repeatedly slap me in the face until there was a visible mark. 

I could give many examples, but I’m going to move on to the part I need advice on. 

My therapist has listened to many stories about my mother abusing me, and he believes she has Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (not to be confused with OCD). Basically, this personality disorder means you follow strict routines and expect others to follow them as well (which my mom does), and you are virtually unable to see your own flaws unless you want to. Unfortunately, she’s never been to any form of therapy in her life, and even if she doesn’t have a personality disorder, she definitely has trauma that needs to be addressed. 

I forgive my mom for everything she did, and now I just want her to get the help she needs. It makes me sad to think that her life has probably been hell because she has untreated mental health issues, but she was raised thinking mental health doesn’t matter, and she still thinks that. Is there anything I can do to help her see that she needs help? I’ve made comments before that she should go to therapy for the abuse in her past, and she didn’t get offended; she just shrugged it off. Is there a way I can help, or should I just let it go?

Disclaimer: I am not saying abuse is ok if you’re mentally ill. It’s not. I just forgave my mom for what she did to me so I could heal. 

TL;DR: my mother abused me my whole life, and now I realize it’s because she has many untreated mental health issues, and I want to help her seek therapy. Advice?",08Apr2020,1
518,"I am having a serious issue and I am scared no one will take me seriously because the reason for my suffering is seemingly insignificant but I assure you that I wouldn't be posting this if it didn't affect me the way it does. I don't know the reason it affects me so much, I have a few theories but...hear me out.

A few years ago I fell in love with a band. Deeply in love. I couldn't go one day without listening to their music. It felt as if their music became the soundtrack for my life and this band has helped me cope with some of the most painful times in my life. I am not a teenage anymore either, so my attachment to this band might seem a bit bizzare, but I've always had kind of an obsessive personality and I have a long history of obsessing over things. But this one was the strongest I've ever experienced.

I am depressed. Sometimes life is bearable. Sometimes it's not. When life is no longer bearable, I need something to keep me busy and to make me want to continue living. It just happens so that, during this time in my life, listening to my favorite band was the only thing that made me want to get up in the morning. Every time I felt sad and empty, I would just turn up one of their songs and become overwhelmed by the rush of feelings that the music made me feel. I am sure it was not a good coping mechanism and now I'm suffering the consequences of that.


Long story short, a few weeks ago, I felt like something was 'off'. I no longer felt the urge to listen to my favorite band. Now, this should be expected considering the fact that burnout is a real thing and that this band hadn't released anything new in decades. You can grow tired of doing the same thing, especially in my situation. Still, I hoped it would be temporary and that my love for my favorite music would eventually return. I tried to ignore it as much as I could. The days and weeks went by, and I started becoming more and more empty and sad. I felt (and still do feel) like something was missing and that I was growing more distant from the one thing that I once loved so much. The memory of their music started to fade. The memories associated with their music started to slowly dissipate. I could no longer remember what their music made me feel and why I even loved it so much in the first place. This realization has been stuck in my mind ever since.

Here I am now. It's been three months since I last felt enthusiastic about my favorite band. During these three months I couldn't take my mind off it. I would randomly break into tears during the day, in the middle of an important event, during family gatherings, while I was at work, ect. It doesn't matter where I am or what I am doing, the reminder (of me not being passionate anymore about the only thing that I loved) would creep in on me and steal all of my joy. I've been grieving it the same way one would grieve the death of a loved one. Because the music was, to me, like the best friend that I've never had. I wake up in the morning and it's the first thing I think about. I go to bed at night and it's the only thing I think about before I fall asleep (especially since I used to fall asleep to their music every night). It's so bad that I just can't escape the thoughts.

Then there's the triggers. Hearing one of their songs on the radio is enough to give me a panic attack. Seeing this band pop up in my recommended on Youtube makes me physically nauseous. There's people talking about the band and discussing their music on social media, since they are a popular band with tons of fans. Even seeing their name mentioned somewhere drives me nuts and makes me cry for an hour (just one hour if i'm lucky). I tried to unfollow all the fanpages, all the groups, subreddits, youtube channels dedicated to the band and so on. But there's always some other source for the trigger. Unfollowed the band's official Facebook page? No problem, Rolling Stone and SPIN have just posted an article about them! Want to spend less time online to avoid mentions of said band? I go outside and see people wearing band T-shirts. Want to hear other bands and listen to the radio? Boom, the radio station decides to play one of their songs. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I hate that such a silly matter is taking up so much space in my life and making me unable to function normally. 

I have already written more than I should have and again, I'm really sorry about the whole novel. I just want to be heard and understood and maybe receive some helpful advice. Due to the nature of my issue, I have never said a word about it to anyone except Reddit. There's people out there dying of starvation, losing a kid, going through a divorce or something and I'm here in agony because of a fucking BAND. I wish I could understand why I'm in such agony but I don't. Maybe it's because their music was all I had. It was my only source of happiness for the past few years so losing them meant, to me, losing my only source of happiness. I'm still trying to understand and come to terms with the situation. But as far as I am concerned, nothing has worked. I am already taking treatment for my depression (Cymbalta and Abilify) and I'm currently tapering because they aren't helping (I've tried countless treatments before). I eat healthy foods (I'm currently cutting out the sugar), I sleep well, I exercise, I have other hobbies and interests (painting, drawing, cooking, playing guitar, video games, reptiles) but I'm not seeing a difference. I am in therapy but I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I am so ashamed of being judged. I don't even know how to explain. Maybe if I do decide to open up about it, I'll just show my therapist this Reddit post, because it would be just so difficult to talk about it. I really need help and since Reddit is such a big community, I am thinking that maybe someone has been through a (somewhat) similar experience and can give me some insight. I would really appreciate some help.",08Apr2020,1

I mean, I feel absurd just writing these down, I feel like I'm going insane, no one seems to even mention an eating disorder, I talked about it one day (as casually as I could, without pointing fingers) and she got upset and called me delusional (which is a thing from my past) for even thinking that anorexia is a mental illness.

529,"First off, I have not yet been asked to resign.

My department of three people were laid off last Friday. Since then, the company has helped us all to find jobs with sister companies.

Of the three of us, I was most loath to accept help. I was proud and hurt and don't care much for the industry anyway. So I was going to do it myself and go in another direction. 

Took three days to realize I'm an idiot asshat, and I should hold out my hand and say thank you. I have an interview this week. 

My colleagues, however, jumped on it and already have offer letters from Sister Company Inc. Of the two of them, one got a letter of separation (whatever that is??) from our current company, and was asked to write a letter of resignation.

The other hasn't received anything, and neither have I, but we both had our alarms raised at the idea. 

The three of us are pretty young, all early 20s, but worked for this very successful company for over a year. We did excellent work, worked well together, and genuinely made the company what it is today. I'm not angry with their decision, I know the pandemic has screwed people and businesses all over the world, but I am weirded out by them asking my team member for a letter of resignation. 

Is this justified? Is this normal? To me, it sounds like, ""We fired you (laid you off, alright, whatever), but we want you to make it sound like your idea.""

This can't possibly be the case, I'm sure. My company's been very good to me (and I'm pretty critical of things like that), and the people there are very decent. 

But I'm confused as to what their reasoning might be, and unsure what to do if the same thing happens to me.

Just turned 23 today and this friend of mine is 27. It's not that I don't like him but I just know he's a bad influence. He lives alone and for the most part just smokes and drinks heavily throughout the day. Now, I'm a fan of both those things but no to the degree he takes it to. Pretty much every time we hang out it's to do either of those things. I find myself making excuses not to hang out with him and I'm getting sick of it. We used to talk daily (we also worked together) but now I try my best not to initiate conversation or keep it going. I definitely want to keep in touch with him because I know he's a good guy deep down, I just got to move on with my life and the constant degenerate activity is holding me back. 

Im not sure how this seems from an outside perspective but ultimately I dont want to keep making excuses not to hang out. He's toxic but has good intentions, sadly I just don't enjoy hanging out with him anymore. How can I slowly cut him out of my life without hurting his feelings?",08Apr2020,1
531,"Hi there, this is my first post in r/Advice because I've run into a bit of an issue regarding my own skill progression and my friends.

They're awesome and they have interests in how I'm doing and vice versa. I get along with them and we're always checking up on each other. A few months ago I mentioned the fact that I had an interest in creative writing, under the impression that I myself would create fantasy or sci-fi stories to share online and with my friends at one point or another. 

Now while my writing is nothing incredible and my friends may not even be too desperate to read what I create, they continuously check up on my progress, simply asking if it's going well every now and again. I respond with the fact it's going well, and it is; but so far I've been able to let them see nothing.

This is because secretly I'm still in the closet as a male in his twenties. I also have a mind-control / rubber fetish. I am currently writing entries on [mcstories.com](https://mcstories.com) under an alias to keep me from being recognised as my real self online. I'm having a blast doing it because it feels like I'm contributing and simultaneously developing my side hobby of creative writing (whilst pursuing an entirely different field as a career).

Now I feel like I'm stuck in this position of not being able to share my work with friends because my sexual secret is very personal to me and I don't feel like I'm ready to share it. At the same time, if I don't ever mention my progress, they may think I'm a failure or lying for saying it's going well but not delivering evidence.

Is it best to give up on my NSFW deliverables and instead produce something that I can show my friends as a solution. It may not be something I would want to write, since I'm enjoying what I'm currently doing, but maybe it's for the best?

On Monday I decided to try to be “tall” for one day and I put socks under my feet to give me a little boost on my heel, and spent the entire day with them. it became uncomfortable after a few hours passed but I kept them on, my feet were basically in a tippy toe stance because of the pressure of the sock in the heel bone. At night I took them off and I immediately noticed something was wrong. My heel bone on both legs was hurting, but I ignored it, promised to never try this again and went to sleep. 

When I woke up I didn’t notice much was wrong but as my day went on I noticed I “feel” shorter. I measured myself and sure enough it was true, I am now 4’10”. I am now worried I may have caused permanent damage to my heel bone in both legs from the pressure all day long. I am very self conscious about my height and I measured myself frequently, in the morning, afternoon, night.

I think she was just being nice, because he was really nice to her and would always listen to her complaints and stuff and shit. She says she says stuff like that to her friends and shit a lot and she was just being friendly to him, they never talked a lot and like it wasn’t everyday and stuff, it was a bit more frequently then every now and again. 

I think my girlfriend just liked that Someone would just listen to her without questioning it or making her feel
Bad or whatnot and jsut really appreciated his willingness to listen to her 

I just think what she said to him is a bit off, he didn’t end up playing guitar for her and or did they like chill

539,"University acceptance question for someone in their late 20s.

TL;DR — can I get accepted into a university based on experience over letter grades.

—————

Hi all,

I have a question regarding university acceptance criteria.

I moved to Seattle in 2008 and received my GED here. From there I took a few quarters  at Seattle central, but didn’t finish getting my associates. That was so long ago, that I wouldn’t even feel comfortable saying I went to college at all. I moved here to come out of the closet, and restart my life. As a bi-racial gay male, I’ve had my share of experiences that have set me up to truly be equipped to deal with a ton of adversity, ambiguity, and I would never change that, because it gave me drive to grow and challenge myself. 

I’ve been working at Amazon corporate now for 4 years. I put in a ton of work and surrounded myself with mentors to develop. I believe I have the mental capacity to learn and retain information successfully, lol. I have received two level promotions and a few lateral promotions during my career there. My roles have ranged from working in AWS as a cloud support associate, a risk manager creating policies/processes for high judgement vetting of 3P seller supply chains, and now a Strategic Account Manger, in Vendor Management Services, handling Tier-1 vendor accounts in the business/retail orgs. 

I have always wanted to go to a university for reasons outside of believing a degree is the only way to make it in the working world. 

My question is, can my life and work experience qualify me to get into the University of Washington, or any university? I don’t want to go to a city college or community college, but would love to enter a program at a university.

 I'm scared of cooking, because then it wont come out right, &amp; it could be undercooked &amp; then i get violently sick. (I'm referencing what my thought process is)

I'm scared of eating meat, because that's ""rotten"", I'm scared of drinking milk, because that's ""expired"", I'm scared of eating fruits that arent in the fridge, because the heat in the house causes it to become ""moldy"" in 3 days.

I also have a terrifying experience trying any new foods. I have, &amp; do, have intense panic attacks when I try anything new. Sea food makes my brain like shut down &amp; I stop breathing because I physically &amp; mentally can not handle it. it makes my whole body ache because I tense up so bad, &amp; I'll start feeling super nauseous, NOT because the food is bad, or gross, because I CAN NOT HANDLE IT AT ALL

543,"So, this morning I (22f) woke up pretty early and decided to make a playlist for my (26f) girlfriend as a surprise for when she woke up. I also sent her a funny card in the mail yesterday, ordered her a shirt she’s been wanting, and I’m working on our 1 year anniversary gift. We haven’t seen each other in a few weeks because of the corona virus—I’m really afraid to give it to her because she has a chronic illness already—so I’ve definitely been missing her more than usual and going out of my way to do little things for her. I love her so much and I love seeing her smile. She’s a really great girlfriend in a lot of ways. 

My girlfriend woke up and FaceTimed me. She looked really happy about the playlist and thanked me, saying she would listen to it later, and we talked for about 2 hours. I finally told her I needed to go because I have to turn in an assignment for school. She then began to mock everything I said in a nerdy voice, snorting and pushing up her imaginary glasses for effect. I’ll admit that it was pretty hilarious and we both started laughing, but a tiiiiny part of me was hurt by it. She calls me a nerd a lot and I know she’s just playing around, but it felt like today she wasn’t just making fun of me, she was also not respecting my boundaries when I told her I needed to go.

I talked with her for about 30 more minutes and finally caved and started doing my assignment while FaceTiming her. She got the hint and was like, “okay, I’ll let you go do your work now baby.” I responded with, “are you sure? I can stay on the phone with you while I work if you just want my company, and we don’t have to talk.” I knew she was having a bad day, and sometimes we stay on the phone with each other without talking as a source of comfort.

She then proceeded to give me a look that I can’t explain. She was kind of rolling her eyes, and a combination of confusion and disgust flashed across her face. “Yes, I’m sure. That’s why I said it,” she replied. I was a bit shocked, and responded, “oh, okay.” We said bye and I love you, and hung up.

After the call I felt super weird and started to cry. I seriously don’t cry easily but for whatever reason I just couldn’t stop. I’m not PMSing or anything. I don’t know why, but I kept replaying that face she made in my mind, and even though she was clearly just trying to make me laugh, I don’t like that she called me a nerd. 

A few minutes later, she called me back and said she sampled the playlist and she absolutely loved it. We talked for a few more minutes, she said she loved me very sincerely, and hung up. I thought that would make me feel better, but I still feel sad and weird and kind of sick. I’ve been ignoring her texts; I’ll reply when I feel a bit better. 

Could anyone give me any insight on why I’m feeling/acting like this? Am I being too sensitive? I don’t understand myself today. 

TL;DR: today my girlfriend gave me a weird, disgusted look and mocked me in a playful way over the phone and I can’t get it out of my mind. I’ve been nothing but kind and caring to her especially lately because we haven’t seen each other in weeks (corona virus). After the phone call I couldn’t stop crying, even though she’s said and done worse to me before. What gives?",08Apr2020,1
544,"I’ve been in a LDR with my boyfriend for over 8 months now. I’m 16 almost 17 and recently he was invited over to stay for a week at my house (he lives in Florida). During this week we had sex for the first time but failed to hide the condom wrapper and my mom ended up finding it the night before we were supposed to drive him home. Mom went ballistic on us in the car during the drive after we had repeatedly asked her if she was ok (because she clearly wasn’t) and she basically pulled the “if you have something you wanna tell me you better tell me now”. So out of fear I told her that we had sex and she... lost it. She was yelling at us and telling us we wouldn’t see eachother again for a very long time. She handed the condom wrapper to his parents when we got to the meet up point. They were very understanding of our side but don’t want to go up against my mom in fear of making things worse. 

Anyway on the trip home she wouldn’t let me sit in the front with her and was on the phone with my dad completely screaming about me and what I did. She even hit the consoles of the car in anger it was horrifying. 

I understand we violated my parents trust but honestly if I felt like I could talk to them about it before hand I totally would have but sex has never been something that could be openly talked about. I never even had “the talk” so asking for birth control was so far off the table. 

It’s been a week now and mom threatened that if I didn’t stop talking about the situation she would get colder (I’ve been on house arrest, forbid from seeing him, and lost a lot of privacy indefinitely). According to dad she wanted to take off my door but he wouldn’t let her. Currently she seems to be doing much better and my boyfriend wrote them a letter but I just want to talk to her about it but I don’t feel like I can.

545,"Im gonna try to explain this the best i can. Basically, when i was 13(im 16 now) my parents brought my to a therapist for fucking vaping out of all things. Well long story short, we didnt talk much about vaping but we discussed my other issues and she said i have depression, anxiety and adhd. I already kinda knew about this but never had it confirmed by a theripist/doctor until this point. So she told my parents and my mom told me that im not allowed to have mental illnesses and wouldnt let her put it on any sort of record or tell my school. So i asked her if she was gonna do it anyway or at the very least tell my parents that they were wrong, and she said ""well your parents are the ones paying me"". I stopped going to her a few months after this and havent gone to a therapist since then. I dont know if other people would consider me saying i have depression, anxiety and adhd as self diagnosing since its not on my medical record but either way im gonna go to a therapist when im an adult to get the situation straightended out. But i dont want to go around saying i have a disorder if i dont have it and thats what im worried about. I know without a doubt that something has been wrong since i was around 8 or 9, its just my parents try to deny it because im ""not as bad as my brother""(he has autism). Ive tried to explain to them that comparing his issues to mine are like comparing apples to oranges but they somehow cant comprehend it. Im not even allowed to say i have any mental illnesses /symptoms of mental illnesses, so i cant talk to people at my school and/or chuch about this and i try to take advice that i get from my friends with a grain of salt. I really dont know what to do at this point and dont want to risk getting punished for months or kicked out for trying to seek help, but im worried that leaving everything untreated will affect my future mental health and college since i struggle to do schoolwork.",08Apr2020,1

549,"Yes I’m honest about that crazy part. I’ve been dumped by my ex in December 2019, two days before Christmas. It was done in an extremely cruel way by her. Literally invited me to her place and lurked me into staying the night only to dump me once I showed up and then blocked me on all social media. I didn’t even get an explanation nor heard anything from her after that. She was my one and only and she was literally the closest person for me an everything seemed alright.

Later I got sued by her and I think I deserve it. 

Why you might ask? I wrote a book since mid 2019 and she knew. 
When she dumped me I finished it and wrote another version of it only for me and gave it to her. It was a nice and kind book tho, really nice tbh.

My dumb ass thought that would give me closure. No it gave me cancer, a cancer that won’t go away until this thing is over. Why did she sue you, one might ask himself? Out of ridiculous reasons and it will never be successful in court but the fact alone hurts.

And what’s wrong with you mate? Well she recently started stalking my stories again even though our lawyers are fighting I still day and night only think about how sue could contact me, we would talk this out and be a couple again.

I‘m literally obsessed with it, I think I’m crazy. I check my Instagram every minute and I’m depressed when she didn’t watch my story.

It all started after I founded two help organizations for corona in my country. Both quickly became extremely successful and I was in TV, newspapers and radio. The only reason why I did this stuff was A. I wanted to do something good and help and B. I’m so lonely since this crisis. I’m extremely lonely. I can’t see my family, can’t see friends and Videocalls don’t give me the same as interacting with real people. My company has also shut down and is about to be bankrupt.

The strong emotions in my head right now are making me tired and they make me suffer. I feel extremely anxious and I tried everything including talking to my best friend, taking long walks alone, music, alcohol, cigarettes and even sleeping. Nothing helps.

I received a surprise bill from my Doctor's Office which I would like to dispute. Last November I went to the physician to get my annual physical exam done which is free of charge under my insurance plan. I didn't have any other issues to discuss with the Doctor.

He didn't tell me that there would be a charge for this little procedure.

Deep inside I hate society, I feel like we were born to get a job, work most our life, and die. That's how dull i see life. I still live at my parent's, I have no idea what to do, I don't want to be a burden for them, but at the same time i'd hate myself for doing a shit job to earn money. 

There's nothing that drives me when it comes to a job. I seeked for a long time what I would like to do, but i never find. I also don't have passions.... Yet I've tried everything. It's weird, I like discovering something new, but I hate the hustle of mastering something. I liked music, bought a guitar, learned how to play a few songs, then stopped and got bored. 

I played video games, got to a basic level, then I stopped. 

I played sports, got to decent level, then I stopped. 

I draw also decently, but it's just sometimes when i want to.

I can't seem to ever stick to something, I really don't know what to do. I always end up getting bored, and want to stop that thing. 

I just feel trapped in this ""Be born, go to school, get a degree OR not, get a job, die"" Process. That's how I see life. I'm litterally on the verge of crying writing all of that.

I’ll give you an example. My mom was making lunch today and I told her that I am going upstairs to put my contacts on. After I put on my contacts a friend called me. My mom called for me multiple times but I had my AirPods in so I couldn’t hear. When I Walked downstairs my mom and dad asked me why I couldn’t hear them calling. I pulled my AirPods out of my pocket and said that I was on a phone call with a friend. My mom said sure in a sarcastic way. I said how am I lying I’m telling the truth. Then she says “because you lie often and you need to regain my trust.” I told her that I never lie and showed her my recent callers to prove to her that I wasn’t lying. After I showed her she was a loss of words and it felt so amazing to prove her wrong. Another example is when I was reading my book for an English class. Just after I had finished reading my chapters I went upstairs to tell my parents so they wouldn’t think that I was doing something else the whole time.

I’ve managed to report most of the pages and get them removed, but I’m still worried there might be more out there. I’ve reverse image searched all the pics I found that were from my profiles, done username database searches to see if my name is used there, and checked countless sites like pipl, spokeo, etc., but I’m still worried there might be more fake profiles of me out there. I’m obviously not still applying to the position I was several years back, but this whole experience has left me feeling incredibly unsettled—I don’t like the idea that there might be fake profiles pretending to be me somewhere on the internet. I also dated an abusive douche canoe a while back (though due to the timeline I know he isn’t involved in this issue), so I really don’t want him looking me up and finding any of these things. Do you have any tips for further stalking I can do to find more profiles if they exist? Are there any other subreddits I should post in? Also, I want to lock down any photos of mine that may not appear on my profile on fb—do you know of any graph search alternatives so I can look into that as well?

Thank you in advance!

I have a friend who I've known my entire childhood and still today. His mother just got off a phone call with my mother and told her that his father passed away early today. My mother told me after and recommended that I send my friend a text or call him to ask how he is. I figured that it would be best to leave this until later this week as it didn't seem appropriate to having just found out. However, he recently just texted me the news as well  (his mother did not tell him about the phone call). I have no idea what to say. I have already sent him a few messages expressing my condolences and how I am here for him if he ever needs anything. Yet, I don't feel like I'm doing enough. What else am I supposed to say?

568,"Our lovely daughter has come home to stay with us during these troubling times. We are of course very glad to have her back. She has really come out of her shell a lot and we are very proud of her for that. We are concerned, however, that she has maybe come too far out of her shell.

You see, our daughter is now very in touch with her spirituality. She meditates regularly and sticks to a strict vegan diet. This is great and we support her 100% but she also goes about a lot of her daily life completely naked.

The first time she did this, my husband and I were obviously taken aback. She explained that this was her expressing herself and apologised if it caused us any discomfort. She offered to wear clothes around the house if we wanted but we did not want to discourage her newfound sense of self confidence and told her there was no need.

My husband and I figured we could adjust to this. What we didn’t factor into this decision was our teenage son. Is having a naked girl around the house the best thing for him at his age? As I mentioned earlier, we didn’t want to outright ban the nudity. It’s her body, right? I gave her a little nudge about this, asking her how she felt about this. She told me she approached him about this herself. Apparently he thinks it’s cool.

What do you think we should do? She is family after all and we love her. I’m not too fussed about this and neither is my husband. She may have flown the nest but we like to think this is still her home and we want her to feel as comfortable as possible.

Are we okay to let this behaviour continue? Or would that be irresponsible of us?",08Apr2020,1

Including the ones about us sleeping together. She flipped out. She started calling me a whore and said that she raised me better and she didn’t know who I was anymore.

589,"I didn't know where to post this so I guess I'll do it here.

I'm 16. I would consider myself a pessimist and realistic, more mature for my age, I look at things in life differently than people my age, I'm not sure if that's a good thing. This is the first time I feel the death of someone very close to me, someone I never thought would die the way he did.

This morning before I got out of bed I was notified of what happened.

I was in denial the first few minutes then I understood the full extend of the situation.

And when I did I felt like it wasn't real and like I didn't care but tears were going down my cheeks.

I don't know how to explain it, I was crying but didn't care or didn't believe it.

After about 45 minutes I continued the day like it was just another day in the life.

But I kept on having these thoughts about me having a dream where that happened and then I would remember that it wasn't a dream and in these few second moments I would force myself to think of positive things to not get myself down and not to feel depressed.

My Grandfather had a surgery and was diagnosed with stomach cancer, but wasn't notified of the cancer, after waking up and for the rest of the day all he knew was he had surgery.

He was always a happy man, if the world around him just disappeared he would still be happy and thankful for what he's got.

But his brother died of cancer, so if he knew the diagnosis he could't live with it.

He is a very smart man and isn't afraid of death.

He was having a very hard time breathing so he was hooked up to a machine that kept him alive.

The worst part of this is I think that he knew about the cancer, and didn't want to live with the fact that his family and friends are going to feel horrible having to know and expect the worst if he were to live longer, so I think he decided his fate that night and died peacefully in his sleep.

So the fact I felt the way I did this morning and still am makes me feel like I'm a horrible person.

This morning and now I still don't know how to feel or react about this, and I feel like I should talk to someone but don't want to.

So I thought posting my thoughts as a anonymous online user would be the best thing to do knowing the person that I am.

So I guess my question is how should I feel about this?",08Apr2020,1
590," I'm a 23 year old guy, I started full time job in a retail store right after my high school as my family couldn't afford my higher education. I was very good in studies, like always in top 5 in my class as I have the ability to learn things faster. The retail store I worked for specialized in baby products &amp; garments and was the biggest in the city. I started my job and worked very hard for which I was being paid ""x"" salary. In 6 months, I was as good as other guys in sales who were being paid ""5x"" salary. It was my time to ask for increment because I was being underpaid and my boss agreed to pay me ""2.5x"" which was still less than the work I did, so I decided to join somewhere else.

Now I have joined a wholesale store which dealt with retailers like the one I worked for and it dealt in same items. This time we didn't finalize the salary first as I wanted to show them my potential and I was confident about it. I worked equally hard as I did for my first job. After 3 months I asked my boss what he thinks of my work and now is the time to finalize the numbers. Without much discussions he offered me ""4.5x"" salary. I was happy and continued working there for around 18 months after which I was being paid ""6x"" now but I got bored of this job because the work became easier for me and also I had no future in this company as it was majorly managed by its family members who didn't want anyone else to succeed.

Now all of a sudden I got a job offer from a new company with ""8x"" salary where the workload was very high and I had to manage all the staff aslo I was the head of sales, but I took with job because I knew I could learn a lot of things and also I was earning more money than I already did. For a year I worked very hard, 14 hours a day and seven days most weeks after which my salary was ""16x"" but now exactly the same thing happened like my last job, I started getting bored of it because it was getting easier for me I was getting used to it. But I continued to work there with the thought that this is a good thing and I should not let this go. After a year my salary was ""25x"" which was two times the average salary of a software engineer in my country with same amount of experience i.e. around 4 years and 4 additional years of education. I was very bored with the job and I just didn't want to do it even though I was being paid good money. The reason I keep mentioning money is because it was always about money, as I started my job because we needed money, so it was and is definitely important and still this keeps happening.

Then I wanted to start my own business and I managed to find an investor through my contacts while working here. I discussed everything with him, showed him the business plan, he was very impressed and he decided to invest my business. My business has started since last 4 months and it is all going good but I am very scared that I might get bored of it soon, what do you think I should be doing to avoid something like this from happening?

This happens to me with almost everything.

For example, if I start reading a book, I will complete only 40% of it and will start reading another book. If I start a new hobby I get bored of it very easily. Does it have anything to do with my age? I mean I started working full time very early like around when I was 18 years and I'm still very young. Please suggest me something.

The reason I want to break up with him is that he's like a child. He's very very sweet and tries very hard, but he's incompetent at basically everything except gaming, and gets very hurt when I correct him. A few days ago, he started crying when I tried to have a serious talk with him about our relationship. I was still unsure back then, but now I'm completely sure. I don't love him and I never will.

We've only been together for 5 months, and over a long distance, we live in different cities, but he's... very committed to me.

I can't take this anymore, but I do care about him, and I'm really very worried, because he seems like a very fragile type of person... he does have his family though, and I'm hoping they can help him get through this - if I break up with him now, he can spend his birthday with his family.

We are not even close to quarantined in my state. Pretty much business as usual. They are still having a huge farmers market today right down the street. Girlfriend asked me if I wanted to go.

Maybe I could have been softer, but Im working at a grocery store full time, and while Im not a nurse or doctor, Im seeing the fear in hundreds of peoples eyes, wearing a mask, a little more worried with every 100 items I touch. I said it really upsets me that they’re still having a farmers market with 400,000 cases and 1000 new deaths in the last 24 hours.

Told me I was a buzzkill and shes gonna stay with her mom for a couple days. I feel so alone. I know some people believe in the threat. Reddit has been a sanctuary for me, because for all the cat memes and fucking bullshit on here, theres a lot of people who are scared, and smart, and sharing information. 

I dont know what to do. Im way beyond scared. Im kjnd of over being scared. Im just sad. Love you all.",08Apr2020,1

605,"Hi all - anonymous for obvious reasons. It’s not even really my place to do anything about this, but it’s become obvious enough of a situation that everyone else in our friend group is aware and finds it weird and off-putting. It also leads to  this friend having issues in other parts of their life in terms of lack of self confidence and self-awareness. He will readily say things like “he just works on a different level than other people”. He even began to dress like him. It’s healthy for people to be proud of their family, but it has reached pure idolization. His brother has had a decently successful career and this friend has yet to have his career take off given his field, but his worship has created a strange dynamic.

Here’s the question: how do we even broach this topic? We don’t want to have an intervention or anything. It’s not our place to stop him from loving his sibling and appreciating him, but we are concerned for his well being and psyche. The brother also seemingly feeds on this and encourages the behavior regardless of the impact on our friend. We don’t believe it’s a particularly healthy relationship, and we are worried it’s damaging his social life.

I do realize we are very limited in options and plus things we even should be doing, but as a group we want to essentially tell him it’s weird but do it in a tactful manner.

How would you go about this situation?

Thanks in advance.",08Apr2020,1
606,"As children, my sister and I used to read all the time. However, as we have gotten older, she has fallen off from reading while I have continued. From time to time I lend her books so she can get back into reading again, but she always takes too much time. 

For example I gave her my copy of The Disaster Artist around two years ago, and she still hasn't read more than 50 pages, stating that she's just too busy with college and doesn't have any free time. Now that all schools and colleges are suspended and she's stuck at home with us, I see that she spends all her free time chatting to friends online and doing anything but study.

A month ago she came to me asking for my copy of The Catcher in the Rye, stating she wants to get back into reading. Almost 30 days later and she's only read 50 pages. I haven't hounded her to finish the book as it says she feels more motivated to read that way, but I feel this is getting too ridiculous. I wouldn't mind if she did this with her own books, or a book I've gifted her, but for some reason I get annoyed beyond belief when she does it with my ones. I personally find it very rude when someone lends you something and you take way too long with it.

My question is should I refuse to let her borrow any of my books anymore? Should I only let her borrow mine if she starts reading her own books at a consistent rate? Should I just let her keep borrowing my own books with no criticism and bottle in my frustrations? If you have any better suggestions than these please let me know.",08Apr2020,1

610,"Some context, when I was younger I was constantly praised by my parents. They told me I was smarter than most kids, kinder, etc. I’ve been homeschooled my entire life and throughout it all they’ve always told me that I had it better than kids who went to brick-and-mortar schools because I didn’t have to deal with the drama, other people, and distractions. Because of this, I never got to interact with other kids my age, I never got picked on, I never got corrected. I had a deep seeded belief that I was a “better” person, and although I never spoke it out-loud, I always compared myself to others in a way that made me look superior. 

I was eventually put into programs like Taekwondo and piano, and lol you can imagine how socially inept I was. I was a good student, but I was awful at conversation, I didn’t know how to make friends, and because I always got compliments for not even trying, I always did just enough to get by. You can imagine my surprise when It became painfully obvious when I realized I wasn’t the best. I didn’t even get my black belt because of one word of criticism from my teacher, that’s how fragile I was because I never had to deal with that kind of stuff before now. I felt like dirt.

Then my brother was born. I love him with every fiber of my being. I hate that I constantly compare myself to him. He’s just everything I’m not. I’m quiet, I struggle at make decisions, I’m painfully shy, and lack motivation. Meanwhile, my brother is passionate, he’s quick to make friends, he can make jokes, he can speak his mind and can actually get mad at my parents from time to time. He grew up in the same environment as me and despite this he so outgoing. 

I started taking every little gesture towards him personally. When my parents smile at him, or laugh at his jokes, or praise him, or hug him while passing me by. I feel so jealous and it hurts because I love my brother to bits and he doesn’t deserve that kind of jealousy from me. I always ask, what’s wrong with me, I’ve lived a good life, I’m alive, I have a loving family. Why do I feel so awful? Am I that entitled??

Now I compare myself to everyone. I think how minuscule and worthless I am, and how my little achievements and my own feelings are, and how they can’t compare to what other people go through, or achieve. I know that it isn’t healthy, I know everybody has their own talents, but even so I still feel so terrible. How can I stop feeling this way?

611,"So I’m in college, and signed a lease to an apartment a few months ago. At the time, myself and two of my friends at school all signed the lease, but the apartment has 4 rooms, so we were stuck with a “random.” However, one of my best friends from high school (who’s also really good friends with another one of the guys I’m living with next year) was trying to transfer, but since we had to sign the lease so early, he wasn’t sure if he was comfortable with committing to it at the time. A few months later, the apartment complex emailed, saying that they had filled the vacant spot with a random roommate.

My friend just got in yesterday. However, he is on the fence between my school and another school. I think he would lean towards coming to my school if he was able to live with us, but I’m not sure how that could work. We haven’t spoken to the 4th random roommate yet, so I was wondering if he would just be okay with switching units, since the complex still has open spots. I don’t want to do that if my friend doesn’t come to school with us though. Thoughts/advice?

612,"So me and my boyfriend have gotten into a bit of a fight over phone. For a quick over view he was taking part in a quiz that night and was quiz master for general knowledge. One of the questions being about the Yen exchange rate from UK currency. 

Now I am autistic, and an autistic trait is basically complety changing the conversation to something that you feel more comfortable talking about. Now I also have Dyscalculia, so talking about money (especially exchange rate) is something I'm VERY not comfortable talking about. At the same time he was talking, I flicked onto facebook and saw that my dad had uploaded a picture of him and my mum when they were both 21, it completely distracted me and I interrupted him, talking about how cute it was and how I loved my mums hair, and he rightfully got annoyed that I changed the subject and said I wasnt listening to him.
 Now that isn't the problem, the problem is that I now don't know how to explain to him that I changed the conversation without considering his feeling, becasue I'm autistic. It sucks that I did it in the first place. I'm just really struggling to find a way of saying that to him without sounding like its an excuse. I'm usually really good with masking so whenever I have slip ups I'm always worried that it just looks like an excuse.

616,"I don’t know what’s going on really, we started off in a really funny happy online gaming relationship and we talked through everything. And then suddenly we would fully go for it, she would shout at me for not doing what she wanted and would somehow turn around my argument to make me seem like the bad person. I would get mardy over her playing with other guys and adding them on facebook and social media. Eg on her bday she was paying more attention to another guy and pushing me out and fully buttering this other guy up and i spoke up that i didn’t like it and she straight up said ‘I would rather play with him than you, why would you start this on my birthday’ and actually left me on read so she could sleep and then the next day act like it never happened. 

Usually we spend a lotta time together gaming or watching films, shes not much of a deep conversation person like myself but we enjoy eachothers company. We even stay on call for days on end unless one of us has to go out. But recently shes been staying off the calls and going to bed earlier. I asked her last night is something was wrong and she said no even though i said ‘you’ve been acting a lot more different and angrier towards me’ and she refused. Then today we had an argument over an easter egg! She asked me if i bought her one and my typical humour is to send a gif saying ‘i cant hear you’ as a joke and she has a go saying i make everything a joke and im never serious. 

She then told me its because shes been dreaming about having kids and she knows i cannot give her one bc I’m unable to make a baby genetically. She says when she thinks about us thats what upsets her. She knew this would be a long journey from the start i just didnt think she would start to resent me for it. 
The last thing ill mention is that she said her not being on call to me was her way of having a break from me, she told me she missed me a lot and wanted me there but would distract herself with planning birthdays for her friend.

623,"I was a depressed kid. I remember I had depression all my life and I had started thinking of killing myself by the time I was 11. I feel that most of it is my family's fault, my emotionally absent dad and my physically and verbally abusive mother. It's kind of normal in my country for mothers to hit their kids but I think in her drive to make me a normal human, my mother overdid it. 

She also would constantly appreciate my sister and my brother on front of me but I don't remember her saying a nice word to me till I was in 7th standard when I got the fifth position in class. Now that I look back on it, it is because of that that I started doing really well in school and I kind of developed a need for everyone to praise me. I think I associated being praised to being loved.


Well, after that, I became really competitive. I would compete with my siblings too. But after I knew that my mother would compliment me after I did well in school, I started doing well at home too. I would finish all her chores and do my homework diligently. Tell her about how I hated my friends because it made her laugh. I started becoming her version of ideal. That made my sister hate me a lot too. She used to live with my grandparents till she was 14 and came back home and lived with us till she was 18. She didn't feel loved by my parents either because she felt abandoned by them and me being the 'ideal' child of them and getting all the 'love' even when she was back didn't sit well with her. So she hated me with all her heart and would constantly tell me in different words how worthless I was and how everyone apart from my family didn't like me at all. That kind of shattered my self esteem too.

I went to college when I was 16 and literally made a fool of myself. I would hate on everyone and everything and be rude to random people. It was mainly because I really didn't know how to act around people other than my family. It is kind of because I was never allowed to go out either. My usual schedule till I was 16 was coming back home directly from school and watching tv till my parents came home and studying and that's it. My personality didn't develop at all.
I am still very socially anxious and can't make friends.

It changed when I finally moved out after completing my undergrad at 20. I got a job and made a few friends and life was fine. But I just became more and more selfish. Right now, I have huge problems in being considerate and keeping others needs even slightly above my own. And it makes me feel really guilty because I was not raised to do that.

Also, my mom mellowed out after I moved out too. She tried to control me and still does but when she realised that she couldn't control me anymore, she stopped trying and became a normal mom. Just like everyone else's. She still tries once in a blue moon to stop me from going out and sometimes she succeeds too but it happens very rarely now.

But another mechanism to cope with everything that I have developed is blaming her for every wrong thing in my life. Like I literally put the blame on her for everything. And I consistently tell her that the reason I am such a socially inept loser with no real qualifications is her.

Everyone around me feels like I am an asshole for doing that. I am talking about everyone. But that's somehow become my coping mechanism. I don't know how to stop either. I usually start blaming her when I am feeling anxious and that's about atleast 5 times a day.

She once said that she was sorry for being a bad mother and that broke my heart because I know she was trying her best too. But that's still not enough for me to remove my toxic ways. 

How do I stop?

625,"Context:
23 M graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a good University with 2.92 GPA. Can't find job (over 400 applications since December, 3 interviews). Best opportunity I had was cut off because of COVID and the company requires in-person interview (already had 2 phone interviews with them).

Living with parents right now, and they are willing to continue to support me while I'm looking for a job/further education. Parents both have PhD and sister is currently top of her class in medical school.

I would have liked to go into research at a graduate school, but during college I hit a big depressive episode that wasn't diagnosed for a long time. Ended up getting poor grades in multiple subjects. Attempted suicide (twice? not really, since I stopped the second time to get help). Got some therapy finished school, but damage had been done. 

I feel like I'm in this shitty stasis where I both can't get a job in engineering/manufacturing that I think I'm completely capable of (proved as much during internship at manufacturing company), and don't think it's worth my time to even apply to grad school because I won't get in (low GPA, but my parents really want me to try).

I would like to go to therapy right now, but COVID is raging. Feels like no one really wants me and I don't know what to do. I could in theory commit to my 3D art which has won some awards/competitions in the past, but I don't want to do it professionally.

I've grown up with both parents together since I was born. My biological mother is my best friend in the whole world, absolutely love her and we have such a healthy relationship. I feel I can talk to her about anything, however my step mother is the complete opposite. My whole like she has called me fat, freak and useless. Constantly have undermined my mental health, saying I should just get over it. 

For the past 9 years (I'm 20f) she has mentally abused my mother, telling her she can't see our family, wear certain things or talk to certain people. She gets angry and throws things at us and screams the house down calling me every name under the sun. I also have to severly disabled brothers (who don't live with me) in which my step mother has called them disgusting things to me and how they shouldnt have been born (we don't have the same mother). She's always called my family names and said how they're scum. I love my family dearly and am so close to them. She's told me family secrets that I was too young to understand in order to make me resent them. 

She constantly states that she doesn't like me. And before it used to upset me that id cry, but now I just get angry and burst out.

627,"i feel excluded from the privilege of being loved and despite how attractive i may be (some people say i'm super hot while others say i'm average), i don't know if this exclusion will end. not being loved by the girls I love, although no business of mine, reinforces my social exclusion from a precious resource called love. social exclusion is one of the worst feelings that a human can endure. having not loved a single human being in my entire life, my situation is strange. although incomparable to being denied food or shelter, realizing that you've been denied the privilege of love is the next worst thing you can realize. in this way, this may be the third worst social emotion that a human may feel. i am pressured not to fix it, yet have no escape from it. i have to fix it. this makes me come to the conclusion that despite being excluded from a much more convenient resource, core feelings can be substituted via being outstanding. i don't feel excluded from them although there were and will be days that i may feel this way. this includes the day where i lost the mathematics prize to a friend. i was excluded from being part of the people receiving that award. obviously, all of these exclusions sum up in more abstract feelings like regret and ambition. all the girls my age now are already experienced (be it good or bad experiences) and aren't as interested in dating as me. i feel regretful that i didn't meet any girls beforehand. other people my age have already started studying university math, yet i haven't. i feel regretful that i didn't study enough math. i'm ambitious in trying to meet more girls. i'm ambitious in studying more math. since the reward i get from the former is being able to kiss a girl I love, i'm more ambitious in doing it. but, those are just emotions; aren't they? what do you make of all of this?",08Apr2020,1

629,"Hear me out. I feel stupid posting this, so obviously this is a throwaway account.

My boyfriend (21m) and I (20f) have been dating for about 1 1/2 years. We go to the same school, and we took a small break for a few weeks this time last year when he was studying abroad because we couldn't properly communicate. At the beginning of the (academic) year, he broke down and told me he didn't think it could work because his profession would require him to travel. By the end of the conversation, he wanted to join me and go to grad school, thinking he would actually prefer the structure. We have been happily together (for the most part) since then.

The problem I'm facing is my boyfriend and I are both going to be moving to a city (\~10 hr drive) to pursue grad school. I got accepted into a great school with a scholarship (he got accepted to the same school today!). He wants to move in with a study abroad friend he met, and told her we would consider it before even consulting me. This friend has caused problems in the past and I've never met her before. We also won't be saving more than \~$100 a month since we will be going from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom apartment. My biggest concern is I don't know her besides her name. She has a boyfriend of about 4 months but she doesn't want to move in with him because she hasn't ""known him that long"" even though she's known my boyfriend for the same amount of time. We also talked about the fact that we were excited to not have roommates (we live very well together considering the days we'd spend together in the room at college and the few weeks of quarantining together at school). Everyone I've asked about it says this is a bad idea, and that we should decide after we've gotten to know her more.

He's also been apartment shopping for the past 3-ish weeks. He's been planning on living closer to her school to make it easier, though I expressed I'm uncomfortable signing a lease with someone I don't even know. He's very adamant that it would be a better solution, and we'd be able to save a lot of money (again, \~$100 a month) doing this. I feel like he's not listening to me and wants to do a favor for his friend instead. The friend also has a full ride to grad school, so paying for her housing should be less of an issue. He's also never been to the city - I've been there on two different occasions, the first being a stay with someone who had lived there most of her life and the second being a trip to tour grad schools down there. He feels he knows the area much better because of the things he's seen online.In an admittedly very selfish way, I want things to go really well because this is a dream I've had for years and grad school is going to be tough.

I know I can't move to Philly without him. My dad doesn't want me moving by myself and I don't know if I'd be able to find a roommate in time. I really love him, but I feel like he's been planning things behind my back/around me rather than with me. I feel really left out of the conversation even when I say things to him. This is the first time something of this nature has really happened.

Obviously with the COVID-19 situation going on, my college shut down. Before I left (rather, was forced to leave), I hung out with some people (at appropriate distance, this is when they were saying groups of &lt;10). One of them I always had a bit of a soft spot for, even though I didn't really know him. Obviously I never pursued it because I met my boyfriend. I thought it would be nice to say goodbye to this person and tell them it would have been nice being friends, since we ended up having a lot in common. Turns out the feeling was mutual, and we decided to keep in contact via email.

We've been emailing nonstop since. We've even had a couple of Google Meets, which is nice having human interaction. A couple of times, we've accidentally stayed up all night (2x in 3 days) and it honestly felt much closer to 4 hours instead of 12. Nothing ""inappropriate"" has transpired between us. He wants me to pursue my dream and push to stay in the conversation, even if it's hard. He doesn't think I should stay in-state because it's been the dream to go to this particular city (where I've toured the grad schools; I haven't seen the ones in state yet because I was holding out for the city). Even if we can't be more, he wants to remain friends and he wants me to push myself to do what's best for me. I really appreciate that. I feel like he makes me a better person. He's been a fresh breath of air, honestly. I think I might even be falling a little. Thing is, he'll have one more year at the college (he's 21, so he's still older than me) and I'll be far away (that is, if I can still move to Philly without my boyfriend).

Tldr; My boyfriend of over a year has been trying to call the shots about housing in the city we're supposed to be moving together; I'm starting to like someone else. I can't move to the city by myself for financial reasons. Should I pull the plug on my boyfriend and my dream?",08Apr2020,1

I want out of the business, I want to move out of the house. My father is an alcoholic who won’t admit it and won’t listen to me or my other siblings I have 3, a sister age 22 another sister age 13 and a brother age 10. He drinks all the time with his girlfriend who is 25 and he is 52 and they absolutely hammered and we all agree it’s like walking on eggshells the whole time we’re around him, constantly anxious and quiet because if we say the wrong thing he explodes. And she’s even worse me and all my siblings can’t stand her when she’s drunk. Working for him is terrible, he’s not drunk when we’re at work but he’s so egotistical and is never wrong about anything, he screams when he doesn’t get his way or we don’t do things right, I was promised (sold a dream) that I’d be making 6 figure a couple years after starting so I believed because he’s my father but 2 years in and I make dirt and I started right out of high school I didn’t go to college, Im kinda at a crossroad here and I don’t know what to do any advice would be extremely appreciated!

637,"My mother had a international flight booked prior to the travel ban to visit her mom who is at the end of her days. She obviously cancelled it after the announcement and did not go. Today we received news that her mother likely only has a few days left and she is distraught at the idea of not getting the chance to see her before she passes. 

Of course my mother has been following COVID guidelines and takes it very seriously, but I know the idea of not seeing her mom before she passes is eating away at her.  

She wants to know if it is even possible to travel at this time to go see her?

She is in the position to where she could isolate immediately after returning to the US for the recommended 14 days, and she is also in the medical field so she understands the risks and what precautions to take to minimize infection and transmission. She would take precautions when arriving to prevent infection as well.

638,"A few things of note before I continue. I have a great relationship with my mother and father. I tell them everything, and go to them when I need any advice. I'm blessed with such thoughtful, and understanding parents as them. And I love and respect them both. 

I started showing symptoms about 3 days ago. And it's entirely my fault. I made a stupid decision, and now I'm paying for it. I knew there was a quarantine going on, but I didn't care. I invited my cousin over, knowing full well that his girlfriend, who he lives with; was sick with something. He stayed over for 2 days and went home because his girlfriend had gone to the ER. I still don't know if it was because of Corona, but it's probably safe to assume that it was. That was all about 5 days ago. Shortly after, I start showing symptoms. And today, after talking over the phone with a specialist, I went in to be tested. And came back positive. 

For reference, I'm 22 years old, male, and have no preexisting medical issues. So, I'm not really in any danger. However, my little brother, mother, and father has a slew of medical problems. And my parents have to take medication that lowers there immune systems. So, this news is more catastrophic for them, than for me. I like to think I'm taking all the necessary precautions to avoid infecting them. But there's no avoiding the harsh reality that I live in the same house and have Corona. 

Ever since my diagnosis, my mother has been frantic about my brother. As well as for her, and my father's safety. Which makes sense, I'm extremely worried as well. But she won't even talk to me. I feel like she blames me for bringing this into the house. I made a post on our family's group chat. Telling everyone about the situation, and telling them to avoid me, and I'd be self-isolating myself. And my mother's reply to this was ""No shit."" 

This has been the only thing she has said to me since. Everyone else is being super supportive and helping me out. But my mom is being so cold, and distant. Maybe I'm just imagining it. But it's really starting hurt. What do you guys think about this?",08Apr2020,1
640,"So this year I’m due to go to university and study Biology - with the sole purpose of completing the degree and obtaining either a 2:1 or 1:1 in order to then study Medicine. Problem is, despite wanting to become a doctor virtually my entire life, I’ve lost all motivation to do so. I’m not particularly intelligent, I’d say that I’m slightly above average, so competition on getting a place will be high. By the time I even start my Medicine degree, I’d be 22 years old, and am unsure as to whether I’d like to spend another 5 years of my life studying and not earning. 

My father served in the army for 22 years. I can say with confidence that he’s had the most interesting, exciting and successful life of anyone I’ve ever met, and he now owns a successful company. 

I’m not sure that he’d necessarily dissuade me from enlisting, it’s more my mum that is dead-set on me becoming a doctor - and I don’t want to disappoint her. 

I’m still juggling my options around at the moment. Should I join the army this year after getting my a-level results? Should I join after getting my first degree? Or should I not join at all? 

I’d really like to follow in my fathers footsteps and live an exhilarating life, not tucked indoors studying all day. But I’m not sure how to do it.

644,"Last week one of my (20F) old tinder matches (22M) from last year started texting me again. I really liked talking to him last summer (we used to text and call everyday for a while), but he said that he had just gotten out of a relationship and just wanted to casually hook up with girls which wasn’t what I wanted.  He made it clear that he liked me but didn’t want to pursue me because of the just getting out of a relationship thing, and the fact that he was moving away at the end of the summer. We have a lot in common, similar political views, backgrounds, and sense of humour.

When we started talking again last week, I told him that I was still not looking for hookups, but was open to having consistent fun together this summer after the lockdown ends (Were both moving away again in the fall), which he agreed to. I said I wanted to have sex but also do other fun activities and dates too if it goes well. I want sex, but its also important to me to have some kind of connection with someone to sleep with them.

We ended up sending each other some dirty texts a few nights ago, and he asked me to send him videos and pictures which I did. After sending them on Snapchat he just kept on asking for more and more (probably like 10 or more pictures/videos) without anything else back, so I got kind of upset and told him I wasn’t feeling it anymore and was going to bed. He then started immediately questioning why I was going to sleep, and I just didn’t respond. The next morning he texts me again asking why I did that, and I tell him it’s because I’m getting the feeling that he’s just using me for nudes and not doing anything for me in return. He then tells me that what I did turned him off and it’s not going to work out.

I’m feeling kind of sad that he told me it’s over, but at the same time I was feeling used. I’m looking to get some insight from an outside opinion. Was I overreacting? Did my instincts that he’s just using me seem right? Is it worth fixing and how would I do that?",08Apr2020,1

649,"Since I was a kid I loved reading and watching movies with a passion. I was always surrounded by books and often times I would starve (please do not do this, I was young and did not know any better) to save up my allowance to buy books. They were my escape, my remedy from the seemly toxic and controlling parents I had and still have. Movies too would make me dream and plan a future where I would do things I want, go places I want without having to be controlled or questioned. To make friends of my own choice, to fall in love, build a life without being judged or controlled constantly. Don't get me wrong my parents tried their best to provide me with a good life and make sure I got the education I needed but it does not erase that the environment I had to grow up in was toxic. I was under constant scrutiny and if I had my own plans or goals for the future that wasn't according to what my parents planned for me, I was a bad child. A terrible person. I could not have my own opinions nor thoughts. Everything they say is the law. It still drives me insane but I'm an adult and I stand my ground, though I still get told I'm a horrible person who will die soon just cause I did not same the same thoughts as my parents and they hope I never get what I want to cause I don't deserve it but I really think all the time I spend reading the books I did, watching movies and shows I did, really did encourage me to become the person I am today. In my family people are pretty conservative and have those old-fashioned typical rules for girls. Girls should do this, girls should do that. If I did not have those moments to myself to ready books that were like guides or friends I would have been a completely different person. But what do you guys think I should do?

I told my parents I'll give it a shot but they keep forcing me and it's getting exhausting. No matter how many times I tell them this is not what I want, they should respect what I want, they refuse to listen. They keep telling me I don't know what I want they do. They need to get me married or else what will society say, how will they pass on peacefully. What should I say or do? They just refuse to hear me out. I come from work she talks about marriage.

655,"Small context, a month ago I went back home from the city where I study (and live alone) to spend the quarantine with my family, initially it was two weeks but nows gonna last until almost june (and I cant travel back). 

Thing is, I have a little brother, 12yo, a bit childish, extroverted and with adhd. With the quarantine hes constantly bored, cant talk as much with his friends, so he gets very attention-seeking, wants to spend as much time as he can with me. Lately its starting to drive me up walls. We already have a routine, between the time we finish lunch (2pm to 16:30 some days cause my parents come very late) to around 6:30 pm is strictly me-time, and from after dinner (as late as 10:30 pm most days) to around 10 in the morning, when he wakes up.

This doesnt sound so bad but I cant really relax when hes constantly around. I just really need to be alone and knowing exactly when hes gonna come and want to do something with me gets me anxious. This morning I had a meltdown in the shower while he was having an online class and cried for a while, I just need to be alone and theres no way to truly be at peace til at least june.

659,"Some background: my friend group goes  back 14 years  when we met in college. There are 11 of us (female early 30s). I have always had anxiety about my role in the group and have felt like an outsider. I go through stages believing this is true or not and sometimes my anxieties bubble up in emotional ways when we are all together and have a few drinks (which is not very often considering we all live in different parts of the state). Minor ways - cry a little in a bathroom. Tell a friend how much she means to me. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and with meds and regular therapy I am doing fantastic. 

Fast forward to late January. We all meet up for a reunion weekend and the drinks are flowing (as they always do at these reunion weekends) I have never drank that much while on my medication and it resulted in a pretty emotional breakdown later that evening. It scared some people - understandably.  I did not hurt anyone ( myself included) or anyone’s property. I cried a lot and was a bit erratic. The person who helped me through it the most gave me a very detailed account in case I had some memory gaps. Of course I was extremely embarrassed and made sure to give each an every person there a sincere and heartfelt apology. I felt that the apology was well received but decided to give everyone some space for a while as a kind of penance. I deleted Instagram. Removed myself from the group chat and didn’t speak to anyone for over a month.  

In the recent weeks I have felt comfortable enough to “rejoin” everything and I felt like things were back to normal (but still knowing Id have a lot to prove the next time I saw everyone) . I have breen communicating with my closer friends in the group regularly (texting and social media) and felt pretty good about things. 

Last night I saw an Instagram story of all of them on a zoom call. Without me. I’m hurt and extremely anxious. This only verifies all of those thoughts I had about being an outsider. Two of these people were in my wedding. I’ve been to every single baby shower, wedding shower, wedding, funeral, driven across state in one day for many of them. Sent care packages. Hosted reunions. I always send things that remind me of them to each person individually. I’m a good friend but I feel like after what happened they are throwing the good away with the bad.  I had a very human moment that weekend and I don’t know what else I can do to prove I am sorry. I learned a very valuable lesson about drinking and pills.

Me (34), taking a course sponsored by the government. It's very technical and there's a lot of reading. I'm having trouble understanding the material, focusing on it, and I'm not really enjoying it. 

This is my fifth or sixth time in higher education. I've mostly done well, because there was a higher ratio of hands-on learning &gt; theory. This course is the opposite, almost completely theory &gt; small levels of hands-on. I learn by doing, not reading.

I don't want to go back to my last career (health-care), because I was having trouble dealing with it long before the pandemic. Now it would be very hard on me, &amp; I don't want to get sick, or get my family sick.

And I don't want to quit this, because the government put trust in me with the sponsorship. It would be really s\*\*\*ty that I took a seat in the program &amp; then bailed out.

669,"I don’t really know where to start, I was with my ex boyfriend for about 3 months. We broke up about 3 weeks ago. He wasn’t my first ever relationship but I felt very differently about him. I’d never felt so in love with a person before like that. I was his second girlfriend, for a bit of backstory about his ex, she was emotionally abusive and manipulative, ending up cheating on him with several people. Long story short their relationship was toxic, not only to an outsiders point of view but to him when he realised it. He broke it off with her after being on and off for about 8 months. In the middle of their relationship he was going through a rough patch with mental health and also drug addiction which when I met him, he was clean of and also his mental health had improved. However he’d always said it was really hard to open up to someone as the only person he’d ever opened up to compleltey manipulated him even though he thought at the one she understood and he felt like he couldn’t trust anyone again. Coming to the end of our relationship, a couple days before infact he had said to me his mental health was getting bad again and he was having bad thoughts, he said he was going to get help. He was going round his friends for a couple days and started to take the same drugs that pushed him off the deep end again, he was distant over the phone and didn’t see me for these two days. On the third day, I found out he’d met up with his ex girlfriend a couple times and had slept with her also, I read messaged from her on his phone where she had been pushing the idea about having sex with him. This is the same person who had spoken to me on a night out when my friends had run into her and said she’s happy for both of us and that there’s nothing between them anymore. he said that he needed help and that he felt like she was the only person he could talk to which would understand. I broke up with him immediately and after kind of spiralled into my own heartbreak, I met with him and we talked, I said it was unforgivable but hat I still wanted to be there for him as I didn’t want him to fall back into her grips as she’d ruin him completely. He said that he wanted to be alone for a bit and had realised he wasn’t ready for a relationship and the commitment. He also had said I shouldn’t give him a second chance, and I realised I shouldn’t so I blocked him on all social media. The day after he realised I’d blocked him  I found out he had met with her. I’m not really sure what’s going on with them but I’m pretty sure they’re starting something again. I know it’s sounds stupid and I feel like an idiot talking to my friends about it reason why I’m here, but I do still care about him and I know that I can never be with him, I wouldn’t be able to trust him but I just want to know that he’s doing okay, or even reach out and give him a call.

Which is totally fine, I love being alone and it doesn't bother me at all, plus I have my husband who is my best friend. He recently started a new job and he was telling me about a girl who works there and I really think we would get along, we like the same things, even a YouTuber that I thought no one would like in this town. Id really like to try to be friends with her but I don't know how tbh. I don't want to come off as weird.

671,"Hey everyone. Im a manager of an essential retail store. I’ve noticed the past week my staff has been getting irritable, grumpy, and totally hating coming to work. We are a tight group and we have a blast at work most of the time. But now during this pandemic we are shot from the panic buying weeks and now mentally drained from the slow period of business that gives us too much time to think about how much risk we are putting ourselves in by working. I totally get that and I haven’t been thrilled either but I try and remain positive!

I’m looking for advice on what I can do to make the workday fun again? I tell them I appreciate them but this isn’t cutting it anymore. We are a group of 9 employees in a privately owned business we sell pet stuff if that helps. 

Any games? Ideas to make the day better? Something fun I can do for them. More of an intrinsic reward than the money they’ve been getting. I just want everyone to have fun at work again!

Now because of the quarantine we started to talk almost every day and we will meet again once it all is over, it has been so nice and all friendly, we both are busy sometimes and I understand he taking time, but sometimes he takes like 10 hours but still watch my stories and like/comment my pics. 
We aren’t super close just talk about general stuff so would be it too stupid me telling him i don’t like when he takes so long to reply? I feel like I’m boring and he doesn’t want talk to me but maybe he’s just not in the mood so like what should I do?
Ignore it, start to take lots of time to reply him too (I mostly reply straight way if I’m not busy), talk to him about that or just unsend my last messages and not talk to him anymore??

Sorry it sounds stupid, but I have no friends to ask about these silly things.

i used to be really good at writing and maths. if there wasn’t a time limit, i could write really impressive essays and i could easily solve math equations and quickly understand new formulas and topics. however, when I had to put my skills to the test where a time limit is involved, like in an assessment, i would almost never get good marks.
i don’t know what happens to me when i’m in a test. my brain just forgets everything. it doesn’t matter how much i studied beforehand, my brain struggles to comprehend even the most simplest sentences. so many times during exams, i’ve just sat there with my mind empty. i can’t think of any words and i can’t remember any formulas. i just stare blankly. my brain feels empty, yet so overwhelmed at the same time. i don’t know how that works.

i feel like my brain has been ‘deteriorating’ ever since i began 10th grade this year. i can’t focus on anything now. i can’t write for fun or even do math homework, let alone get decent marks in an actual exam. just, every time i try to do my homework, my brain gets so overwhelmed. i struggle to comprehend sentences and questions.. and i struggle to produce answers to simple questions. this happens when i engage in social interactions as well. even right now, i’m aware that most of this post reads as an incoherent mess and i apologise for that. it feels like my brain is slowly forgetting everything i learnt. i forget simple math formulas and i can’t remember the meaning of a lot of words. i get confused and distracted even reading books. i feel like i’m going crazy. my brain just feels so overwhelmed all the time.

681,"22 y/o female here. I have Asperger’s syndrome and so developmentally I’m behind and often people are surprised that I’m autistic when I tell them because I’m high-functioning. I mention this because maybe it’ll explain why I am where I am at this stage in life. 

I still live at home but I’ve been working for the past year and I have plenty of money to buy a used car. I used to drive and I even had a car but in 2015 I rear-ended someone and it was totaled. It was totally my fault but in general I wasn’t, and am not, a bad driver. We lived in a small town and I would get kind of anxious when driving but I was still able to get from here to there. However, I understand my parent’s concern of letting, (yes “letting”) me drive again because now we live in a big town with lots of traffic. Anytime I mention me driving, I either a: don’t get a response or b: the subject is changed. I have explained why I’m ready to drive again. (I’m 22, this is my main goal in life right now, I know how to drive, etc.) My mom says she isn’t trying to control my life, that there are other responsibilities that need to be taken care of before buying a car. I get that and we’re almost finished with them. And she says she wants me to drive again but I feel she doubts me and my ability to drive and to be independent. For the record, she refuses to ride with me and leaves that to my dad who ignores me when I say “hey, maybe I could drive to so-and-so.” 

I’m tired of having my parents take me to work like a teenager. I’m tired of having to ask coworkers to take me home. I’m tired of not having the freedom to leave the house when I want to go where I want. So, since I have no idea how to buy a car and don’t feel like I’m getting the support I need from my parents, how do I buy a car? I think I’d prefer to make a monthly payment (I don’t know what it’s called) rather than paying the entire thing at once. 

I’m just frustrated and angry and if I buy a car without “permission” I know my mom would be infuriated. People don’t understand why I need permission but for my entire life she’s been my advocate and the person who helps with all of the adulting but if she isn’t willing to help me buy a car then I guess I’ll have to buy one on my own, with of course, advice and tips from you all.

So I have scoliosis, was treated for it as a child but since it was mild they didn’t do anything except have me wear a corset to bed for a year. I stopped wearing it when I was 13.

684,"So I was laid off from a job I've been working on since october as a business developer with no notice 3 weeks ago.

I am aware that my job isn't really very important or relevant at this time so I'm looking for advice from an outside perspective.

They said it was nothing personal and they would be back in touch in a few weeks (3 weeks ago,) and told me the door was still open.

Now the issue is that in the past I've often been told they will do x by x and never seem to so I'm concerned I'll never get an update on this as it's been 3 weeks now.

Do I either :
A) let it go indefinitely until they get back and risk never getting the job back ( also assume they dont want me back if they dont get back to me )

B) follow up and ask how things are going at say 5/6 or 7 weeks.

685,"I guess it would be good to say that I'm not suicidal, I don't want to die, I just cannot be bothered nor care about anything. 

Like my Mum will come into my room and tell me that xyz amount of people have died in Italy due to Covid-19. I genuinely don't give a shit, it's very unlikely that those people will give a damn about me, so why should I give a damn about them? I piss most people off with this attitude, but I genuinely believe it to be true. Most people don't give a fuck about you. A good example of this is when I left my old college (I got badly bullied) and all my friends said ""we'll meet up and stay in touch."" Sure we DM each other from time to time, but we never met up. It's all bollocks. 

I don't give a shit about anyone outside of my family apart from my best friend, who shares the same opinion as me. Nothing makes me happy apart from motorsport. I don't care about what's going on in the world regarding Covid-19 as I'm an 18 year old kid and it doesn't really impact my life in any way at all. I don't go out and earn money, we have enough money to be comfortable for a bit if shit hits the fan, at this present moment in time we have enough food and it's still relatively easy to access. So all in all I don't really care. I have more time to sit on my PlayStation and play Dirt Rally 2.0. 

I genuinely don't give a shit if my actions annoy you. If you don't like me, that's your failing not mine. Most people see me as being arrogant when I'm not. If anything, I see myself bellow others. I guess the reason they think I'm arrogant is because I'm quiet and quite frankly, harsh. If you're a cunt, I'll tell you. 

So to wrap everything up, I have no real interest in other people, I don't really give a shit about the outside world and I take very little enjoyment out of anything unless it's to do with motorsport. I can't be bothered with doing anything unless it's to do with college (as I realise I need to do well in order to get a job.) But in terms of making my bed, taking plates downstairs and looking after myself, I don't care. 

Quite frankly as long as my family and friend don't die, I don't really care.

But I want to change this, what do I need to do to become more positive and happy within myself. I think I'm so negative that being positive feels alien to me. Its almost as if I'm addicted to being negative. I hate how positivity feels.",08Apr2020,1
686,"Because of Sexual Harassment Awareness Month I felt like I had to do something to clear some weight off of my shoulders. This is also going to be a long post, I'll put a TL;DR at the end.

First of all, TW: sexual harassment/assault, rape. Secondly, if this isn't the subreddit for these kinds of posts please do point me to another subreddit. Thirdly, english is not my first language, bear with me. Lastly, do forgive my formatting (I'm on mobile + this is my first post) and any spelling/gramatical mistakes. (It's 2am) Thank you. 

Hi, I'm a female, I won't tell you my age because someone I know may see this post and it's for privacy reasons. I'm sorry if the story gets confusing. 

I have two exes, both of them were very emotionally and mentally abusive; they both would gaslight me, they would always put the blame on me whenever we fought and tell me they were going to kill themselves whenever I tried to break up with them. I had broken up with my first ex two years ago at the time this had taken place and my second ex just a few months prior to the assault.

I'm a forgiving person and I like to look past people's mistakes whenever I can and like to think that they've changed. When I broke up with my second boyfriend (let's call him James), my first boyfriend (let's call him Kyle) was immediately there to comfort me and started messaging me everyday. Kyle and I also had the same class so we would see each other almost everyday and he made it a point to sit beside me and talk to me whenever we can, always cheering me up. After that he had started to be more sexual with me in chats and wanted me to send nudes to him, and so I did. In my head it was all okay because I've already had sex with him in the past and I needed some kind of outlet. We had then agreed to be fwb, no strings attached. By this time I was still talking to James, trying to smooth some issues out due to our break up.

Kyle and I had sex once, even then I wasn't so sure about having sex with him, putting him off because I felt uneasy about the idea of casual sex with my first ex. (Context, sex is considered taboo in our country) I still had sex with him but only had one round and I immediately left after that. It was apparent that he was becoming more attached to me at the time. I still talked to him &amp; laughed with him in class because he still felt like a friend to me. After a few days I told him that I wanted out of our arrangement, because I didn't like it anymore. He was okay with it. 

A few days later, this was after we had decided to stop the arrangement, he invited me to his house to watch some Netflix (not Netflix &amp; Chill) and also discuss a group project in his house. I told him that I was fine with hugging while watching Netflix and he had offered to pay for food. I obliged and went to his house, knowing we were the only people in there. We did watch Netflix but moments later he was starting to make moves on me. I was uncomfortable but I could not move. 

(The next paragraph is going to be slightly graphic so don't read it if you think it's going to trigger you),

He had inserted his f*nger in me and I tried to laugh it off and tell him to stop. He didn't. He then told me he wanted to fuck me I told him no and that he should stop. I couldn't move because of shock. He told me he was only going take a few seconds. He fucked me but he didn't come. After that he said, ""See, I told you it wasn't going to take long.""  


After he did what he had done I started to cry. He cried with me telling me he was sorry. He didn't want me to leave until I had accepted his apology. I had to text James because he was the only person I could think of that was near the area. I told Kyle that James was actually waiting for me and had to show him some of my texts and Kyle eventually let me go. I met up with James but didn't tell him any of what had happened because I didn't want him to worry about me.

A day later I found out that Kyle actually had already told my whole friend group about it before I could get the chance to and said that he was ""drunk"" during that time, I was wet when he f*ngered me thus me liking it and that I was fwb with him. Two of my closest female friends actually sided with him and most of my male friends sided with him, even the ones that I was most close to, that messed me up.

Here's the part I do regret though, I tried to laugh the whole situation off and a month later Kyle had messaged me and said sorry. I told him to buy me this expensive hoodie I had wanted for months as some sort of sorry gift or compensation, just so I wouldn't feel as depressed as I had been, I know that it's stupid and I shouldn't have been materialistic at a time like that. He didn't buy me it though but he promised me for weeks he'd buy me it. We were called to the dean's office because the news of my assault had been circulating around the school. I denied what happened to dean because I was afraid it was going to reach my very religiously Christian and conservative parents. I was also afraid Kyle would spread more rumors about me and my reputation is one of the things I treasure the most. 

Months after that had passed and I had finally gotten the strength to (somehow) cut him off of my life. I blocked him everywhere, but seeing as we went to the same school it still haunted me. Now, it's been 10 months since that happened. Only 3 months ago had I started to process everything that had happened and only 3 months ago was I breaking down and crying at random times. I didn't even speak to my friends as often as I did and I had a lowered sense of self-worth. Only 3 months ago had I jumped everytime I heard his name or heard his voice. 

It seems really off putting to me that I had only processed everything 3 months ago and had only started to not talk to him in November. I hate it. I hate how I had still talked to him and was like everything was fine. Now, I don't think he knows the weight of his actions. Now, I'm very confused if I was the asshole in this story and if it was my fault or not. I need advice please.


TL;DR: I agreed to be fwb with my first ex boyfriend after a break up with my most recent ex. I cut off the arrangement after having sex with him once. He invited me to his place, I thought it was going to be innocent, he raped me. He spread rumors about what happened (that I had liked it and he was drunk/hungover). I still talked to him after that. I only processed what happened 3 months ago and it's been 10 months since it had happened. I had only cut him off in November. Now I'm confused because I still talked to him and asked for something even after what he'd done. Only now am I traumatized &amp; had processed thee events and feel like what had happened was my fault and I am an idiot for still talking to him.

687,"I'm a sophomore. School has been hard my entire life. I have ADD, Dyslexia, and a pretty bad hearing loss. 

In middle school I had minimum friends and awful self confidence. I cried probably almost ever day, and probably every time I had to do math home work. 

In high school, it got better and worse. I stop wearing my hearing aids. Which dramatically helped with my self confidence, and I made some friends I actually liked. I also started a 3 year emotionally abusive relationship. Because my high school was a boarding school, I did much better in all of my classes. I wasn't a straight A student or anything, but I never had to worry about failing. 

I then switched high schools to a different boarding school. Things got better. I found even better friends. I broke up with my girl friend. There were other issue which I'm not ready to talk about, but I was mostly happy. At least, my senior yest I was happy. My grads slipped a but, but I was doing ok. 

Then I starter college. My first term I had an awful teacher for my favorite class. It was a class I had spent the last 3 years waiting for college so I could take it. This teacher was known for ""weeding out the weak"" and I was weak. I did awful, having to take it as an upgraded option. The stress from it made me loose alot of weight. 10 pounds, which is a lot when your only 105. I still haven't gotten that wait back. 

Though elementary school, middle school, and high school in was told time and time again ""all your problems will go away in college. Once your doing what you like you ADD with help you hyper focus"" etc. That hasn't happened. Ever term there at least one class I'm doing badly in. This term there two, math and bio. I just found out I got an 52 on my last bio exam. I studied for it. I thought I did good. I thought it would be fine.

What I'm trying to say is, because I am neuro atypical, college has been really really hard for me. When I try to talk to people all I get is ""man that sucks"". My roommate is convinced that most of the people who fail are just lazy which hurts me to core because that's the classic thing teachers say to undiagnosed dyslexic. And now I'm being told ""everything is off because of corona virus I'm sure you would have past under different circumstances"" but that's 100% BS and I know it. I know me and I did the best I possibly could on that test. 

Every day I loose more and more self confidence in my self. The accommodations I have dont help. I just can't learn. I feel like an idiot. How do I keep doing this? How do I pass my classes instead of just curling into a ball and giving up? How do I get my self confidence back?",08Apr2020,1

691,"So yeah, my brother died a few weeks back in his sleep while staying at a friends place. On his last night they decided to invest their betting wins (200€) to a new bet, which payed off and they won 1000€. The match was in the nighttime, so they couldn't go claim their winnings until the next day, but it was the night my brother died. 

Now, I really don't care about the money myself, but I wonder if I should tell my family about it. 500€ would surely help my mother and little sister out, especially in this situation. But I am not completely sure what has happened to the ticket. It could be with the friend, or it could be in the pocket of his jacket that the police are supposed to mail us sometime soon. Some of my brothers other friends picked up his other stuff, and it wasn't there, tho it could be that they threw it away thinking it was trash. Plus, I don't think I want to start any more drama. My mother already blames the friend for my brothers dead (he was a bad influence for sure, but he is not to blame imo), and I don't want my mother to possibly start harrassing him with calls and such (not that we even have his number).

i've been sharing the one I have with my sister (17) and I'm 15, and I'm tired of it

we have a spare room which we use for our computers (we each have our own) and we have a bedroom which we share and have one of those bed-on-bed with wood between (idk the word, bunk bed if I go by google translate? english isn't my first language I'm sorry)

my sister and I would like to have two separate bedrooms instead of this bedroom-computer system, and we talked about it a while ago to my mother, and she was against us having our computers in our bedrooms, and since we're ""a little grown-up"", ""it'd be a lost effort to move beds and furniture just for some years we're here until we leave the house""

the thing is, I didn't mind it until then but I'm becoming very sick of my sister, I'm 24/7 with her and she has one of those angry personalities, she's always mad at me for whatever I could do, even if it's not my fault (if i type at my keyboard, if I talk ""too loud"", if I laugh... I basically can do nothing without her being mad at me)

I can't stand up to her because I don't know how to argue, I always mess up everything and I just end up not fixing anything and overall making myself angry, so I just gave up on that

and the quarantine isn't fixing anything, I'm becoming more and more annoyed and kinda sad, because everyone's just angry at me all the time (I'm kind of hard of hearing, so I can't hear what they say when they talk to me, and they become angry at me because I don't listen to them for example, when it should be them to make the effort to speak louder instead of whispering to me)

so I'm coming here to have any advice, like how can I manage to get my own bedroom, or at least bear with my sister at all, or stand up to her.. i don't know

am I being silly or wrong about all this?

696,"Hello all. This is the first time I have ever posted on this platform and this is way outside of my comfort zone, but I really need advice and I feel like outside opinions will really help right now. 

I'm  a 21 year old male and I have a problem with being alone. Ever since I was 14 I have either been in a relationship, or I have been talking to someone. At age 14 I met a girl and we dated for 5 years before she broke up with me. This was around April of last year. The heartbreak was devastating, but instead of coping with my loss I quickly moved on to the next one. We talked for a little bit before she told me that it wasn't gonna work out, and I felt terrible, but again I moved on to the next one. This is a cycle that has repeated since I broke up with my long term girlfriend.

I started talking to the most recent girl about a month ago, and I was incredibly happy. We had so much in common, we planned future activities together, and overall we had an incredible amount of chemistry. But last night she told me that she had lost all feelings for me, so you could imagine how I felt. 

The reason I'm typing this up is because I was talking to my friend and she said that I need to stop connecting my self worth to if I'm talking to someone, and I genuinely don't know how to do that. I can't stand being alone. When I'm alone I get consumed by my thoughts. Thoughts that I'm not good enough for anyone, thoughts that nobody loves me; and I don't know how to stop that. Being stuck inside during this quarantine isn't really helping either. 

So I'm just wondering what everyone thinks, if anyone has any advice. How do you guys cope with being alone? Should I pick up a hobby or something? I genuinely don't know what to do and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I love you all and I hope everyone is safe and healthy.",08Apr2020,1
697,"***What's wrong and what's right?*** *Please give me some advice. If you want to help, please take the time to read my post or at least the TL;DR. Thank you for reading my lengthy post &lt;3*

I've (22) been with my boyfriend (23) for about two months now - not that long, I know. But I love him, I wouldn't be with him if I didn't love him. My ex (22) and I were together for two years, and I loved him dearly, but I don't have any romantic feelings towards him anymore. It's been almost three years since our break-up.

The thing is, my ex and I broke up in **very unusual circumstances**: we lived together and he got into a psychosis and he kinda drove me away for no reason. It took me a long time to recover from that, it was quite traumatic and I still go to therapy to cope with the thoughts and the unhealthy mannerisms and the trust issues that it caused me. I knew he wasn't being himself when we broke up, so it was extremely hard to accept. I tried to contact him, multiple times during those two years, but he was still very ill. I was really scared that he'd end up killing himself.

My ex texted me a few days ago, asking me how I'm doing, and he finally seemed to be completely normal. I was so happy to hear from him and it felt like I could finally relax and not worry about his wellbeing. I felt relieved that he was doing better. Because I don't like to conceal things in a relationship, I told my boyfriend about my ex texting me and that I was kinda shocked about it. He went absolutely nuts. I just wanted to have a calm conversation about it, but quickly it turned into an argument since my boyfriend is coping with his own trauma and trust issues from his past relationship. I was disappointed of him dragging his past-relationship-issues to our current one and I was disappointed that we couldn't have a decent conversation about it.

I understand him being a bit jealous, since he doesn't know the full story about me and my ex, but he has never even asked about it, so many times I felt like it would be weird to start talking about exes out of nowhere. I did try to explain the situation to him, but he didn't really understand why I wanted to be on good terms with my ex, he even expected me to block or ignore his message. He can't really open up about his ex or his past relationship to me, either. I told him that there's nothing he should be  worried about, since it clearly seems that my ex is not wanting me back; he just texted me to apologize and to ask me how I'm doing.

My ex has told me that he is feeling really alone, and I feel sorry for him. We've been texting a bit, I've been giving him some advice on how to get help with his depression and some other stuff. I told him that I currently have a boyfriend, so he know's what's my situation in life. I told my boyfriend that I'd only text my ex to tell him that I'm doing great and that I have a boyfriend, *which was my intention*, until I realized that I want to help my ex and started hoping we'd possibly be friends some day. He is a really good person, **I do not miss our romantic relationship**, I just miss his company. I feel like my boyfriend would never understand this.

My boyfriend sees my ex as a threat to our relationship, while I feel like telling him that I'm still in contact withy ex as a fact is the threat to our relationship. I don't know what to do. I don't want my boyfriend to control who I'm allowed to be friends with, but I do understand his jealousy since he doesn't know all about my past. I've been trying to tell him, but he doesn't understand and it feels like he doesn't want to talk about exes. My boyfriend has a very traumatic history with his ex.

Please help me, what's wrong and what's right? Am I a bad person?

**TL;DR: My ex texted me after years, and my current boyfriend is jealous of him (in an unhealthy way). I want to be friends with my ex because he's been through a lot (I want to help him, and he's been asking for my advice) and I miss his company. I do not have any romantic feelings towards my ex, I just think he is a good person.**",08Apr2020,2

701,"So after university I wasn't able to get a real full-time job. I was pretty depressed upon leaving university as I felt directionless with my fairly undesired humanities degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I picked up some contract work, but it only lasted a few months. After that I was unemployed for a significant amount of time. I applied relentlessly to positions for which just a degree was needed, so I met the requirements, but never got calls back. The rejection hurt. The lack of any contact from almost all applications also hurt. I felt more lost than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from a few small gig work types and an equal or greater number of scams, I've basically not been contacted despite continuing to apply. This really ground me down into a heavily depressed rut. This period of my life has lasted 4 years, and I feel I am essentially out of energy to continue trying.

&amp;#x200B;

When I reach out to those around me for support, the advice I get is basically to just not give up. It'll happen for me eventually. I don't think it will. The egregious gaps in my employment after university have rendered me unhireable.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I have run out of money. Despite spending just enough to eat basically only enough to keep me alive and on rent, I have nothing. I am a burden to those around me that are trying to help me keep going, but the guilt of being a burden outweighs the alleviation of stress they offer through financial and emotional support. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved somewhere less expensive to try and clear my head (and work through what is obviously mental illness) to reinvigorate myself so I could keep going, but \*surprise\* the apartment I moved to has an infestation the landlord swears they didn't know about, and now with COVID-19, I feel my situation is even more hopeless. This area doesn't have mental health resources.

704,"EDIT: 22 years old. MtF Transgender.

I'm doing everything right, I feel. I have a job. I'm trying to get more real world friends. But my timespan has decreased. In 2018 I was a never-employed high school dropout at 20 years old, no drivers permit, repressing gender dysphoria, and morbidly obese.

The past couple years I've made decent progress. I have a job (not great paying, and I'm lucky to get 18 hours a week now, but it's still work). I've made lots of progress mentally. I used to browse sites on the incelosphere (8chans /pol/, r9k, the usual stupid bullshit) but I think I've tackled lots of my toxic viewpoints.

But my issues still stand. My familys raised my rent to $100 a week and with this virus going around, it's very hard to work and save money.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to 2020. I'm 22(23 in august). I'm ""out"" as in I'm taking estrogen and experimenting with makeup once or twice a week with a greatly improved skin-care routine but still present as a man to the outside world. No GED. No drivers permit. I only have $150 in savings or so (and i'm about to spend $60 of it on a videogame in two days). I still have a BMI of nearly 37.

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely need to get out of this predicament ASAP. I know the steps required. Eat healthier, study for the GED, and apply for other jobs out there that might pay me a bit more now that I have a couple years of work experience under my belt. I don't wanna be a millionaire in months or anything, but I need to be at a point where I

1 - Have a GED

2 - Can at least pass as androgynous and somewhat conventionally attractive

3 - Have $2500 in my bank account as well as a car

4 - have moved out of my mothers house and have an apartment or something of the sort of my own

5 - A more respectable job than a grocery bagger.

6 - Long term, I'd like to possibly go to school for biology/botany. I've grown fond of growing cannabis and with the industry exploding I think there's lots of potential there.

7 - Sustainable income for two people, so I can move my girlfriend here from the netherlands.

&amp;#x200B;

I know all the steps I need to take, and I know that it's VERY doable. Other people have managed to ""pull themselves up by the bootstraps"" so to speak. But I have a very self defeatist mindset. Every time I encounter any resistance I give up. Any time something doesn't go my way I have a fit of rage and ruin all my progress or find a way to self-sabotage. I've been so close to success so many times over the course of the past 2 years. There are lots of time I just procrastinate or don't put in the work. I will always take the path of least resistance. Even though it will never lead me to happiness.

How do I defeat this? I've used every tool I can think of. My post sounds cold and objective but I feel like I'm dying on the inside and my lack of progress is making me suicidal and exacerbating my pre-existing mental illness. I'm so scared. I don't want to loathe the world again. But I see myself falling into the same traps that made me into an ""incel"" in the first place. I hate this. I hate myself. I want to be saved, but only I can save myself.

I want to be a better person. I want to be a respected person. I want to be beautiful. But so does everyone. How can I once and for all kill that lazy, self-sabotaging demon in my head?

&amp;#x200B;

I talk about my progress and improvements all the time, but it's all talk. I basically spend all day sitting on discord talking about how great I'm gonna be without ever taking action.

I have been in the hiring process for a decently sized well known tech company (Data Science) for about 6 weeks now, and have been looking for a new job for like a year+. After making it through the recruiter screen, hiring manager interview, and technical interview, only the final interview remained. They asked me to wait a week so they could schedule a way to do it virtually (no travel because the apocalypse). I said sure, and then last week they scheduled my 5 interviews for the final and sent me a take home dataset to prepare a presentation for. I took the week off work to prepare and ace the interviews. I probably put ~80 hours into prep plus the prep I did for the other interviews as this is my dream company/role. Yesterday, less than 24 hours before my final, they emailed me and cancelled my interviews and said the job had been filled, but they'll keep me in mind if something else comes up. What do I do?

so my friend (M16) calls me yesterday and tells me he has a crush on one of my friends. He asks for advice on how to handle it, etc etc, all good. I did tell him my friend was in a delicate placr and had just gotten out of a 1 year relationship, so it wouldn't be a good idea to just drop this bomb on her, especially since they've only been talking for a few days and I doubt he's even 100% sure about his feelings yet.

today he texts me asking if I said anything to her, and I said ""no, why would I?"" 

then he tells me he talked to another friend of his and this is moreless how the conversation went.

Her: I'm pretty sure Joan (me) already told her.
Him: Why would she do that when she told me not to tell her yet? It doesn't make any sense.
Her: Trust me, it makes plenty of sense. I'm telling you as a woman. That's us.

He told me this and it pissed me off because 1) she generalized and accused women as untrustworthy 2) she immediatly assumed i had betrayed him, and 3) he believed her. I told him I would never do that, and that would be very shitty of me, and how sad it was for women to ve generalized that way. He then said ""fine, i believe you, but please don't be mad at her. I don't want any drama."" I haven't replied. 

I have barely talked to this girl, so I don't really care what she says of me, but it does hurt me that my friend would assume I would do something like that and just confront me about it. I know this isn't very important or much of a big deal, I just don't know what to do.

He is a very caring gentle kid and honestly I'm so worried what this is going to do to his mental health. He loves my sisters new partner but his father has previously told him not to talk about him near him.

Advice: Should I just drop this guy as a friend or try and rebuild our friendship?

Context, this guy has been my friend since 6th grade. Like, my first friend to actually come over. 

Our main hobbies together as of high school was mainly smoking a lot of weed and playing video games. 

Post high school, it was much of the same for 3 years. Shortly after senior year Mike got himself a pizza delivery job and a renovated garage/apartment with everything included for an absurdly low price for the area. 

Into the recent context.

Me and two other mutual friends, we'll call Dave and Scott.

Mike got a beater car that broke down(engine seized), and for around a year he was borrowing Scotts car 4 days a week. They worked at around the same time, in different places. Scott would come and pick him up every day, and let Mike use his car all afternoon and pick him up after Mike got out of work. This went on for years. 

Mike's girlfriend left him, leaving him to pay rent on his own. The initial breakup and having rent to pay on his own was tough on him.

This went on for a long time, with me, Dave, and Scott giving Mike rides wherever he needed. Mike was adamant about not spending money. Any activity that the boys wanted to go do would be met with criticism and on the rare occasion we could drag Mike out of his apartment, he would constantly complain about the bar(pretty classy place, not a dive), complain about the food, and generally just give off the vibe that he'd rather be back at home playing video games. All of which I attributed to him desperately saving for his own car.

However that was the norm for years. We'd all go to his place and smoke and play video games. 

Mike was also borderline narcissistic. Any time a rift or discussion was brought up it would be about how much he sacrificed for us and how many times he smoked us up. Because I knew him for so long, I never really realized it until I actually started thinking about it that I was basically in a toxic relationship. Mike could do no wrong because if Mike did wrong then he would implode. 

I vividly remember the quotes ""I'm the type of person to never fuck up, because when I did fuck up I'd get beat"" or ""Think back to every time I told you about someone or a certain place and I was always right about them/that place."" Always finding the opposite of a silver lining to everything. Even a walk down the street. 

I guess to cut to the chase, present. 

The boys got split up because one night Mike called me up and was basically screaming(venting) over the phone about how Scott wouldn't drive over to another friend's house(less than 5 minutes away) and let that friend borrow 25 cents to catch a bus to hang out with Mike. ""I know theres a quarter in that car im in that car every damn day."" 

Dave calls me later that night while I'm three sheets to the wind after a night out asking what mikes so pissed about, he's posting on facebook with rants. So I tell Dave about the Quarter incident not realizing that Scott is also listening on speaker.

Scott is pissed. Doesn't pick Mike up the next day for work, cuts all ties and is just totally done with him.(Issues building for awhile)

Push comes to shove and me and Dave are having a discussion about putting people on speaker, because this isn't the first time this has happened. We come to an agreement and it's a buried hatchet. Me and Mike also have a discussion, where I opened up completely and let him know everything that happened. Face to face I told him that I got left on speaker and so forth. Again, I assumed it was another buried hatchet. 

A month or so goes by and due to certain reasons I stopped going over to his house or seeing him as often due to starting college and work. After much consideration I decided to send Mike a message telling him how I feel about how he's been acting and how weird he's been lately. How I still value our friendship and all the history we have, dude is(was) like a brother to me but how he talks and how violent he is when he vents is not putting me at ease. I put it all out on the table. 

He responds with an essay length message about how I'm only focusing on the negative, and how he can too, lists off everything negative that I've done, even mentions me spending time with my girlfriend and Dave rather than him. He goes OFF on Dave. So, I just sort of leave it at that. I'm feeling pretty shitty and down about the situation and myself, so I meet up with Dave and ask what he thinks of the message, letting him read both sides of the conversation and trying to blur out the part where Mike calls Dave every name in the book. One way or another Dave sees and is pretty pissed off now too, since Mike has long winded angry violent rants. I ask him to please keep it under wraps as it was somewhat confidential and he replies that its the same with me telling Mike that Dave was the one who had me on speaker.

I know that I'm the reason that Dave and Scott don't associate with Mike anymore. The catalyst to the whole situation. I've been focusing on school and just don't have the desire to go sit in a small dirty apartment and sit and play his video games(dated) when I can do that at home, or even play games together if he were to get internet again. I feel terrible that the guy was abruptly left alone but ultimately I saw this coming. Theres a bit of bitterness in me that feels like he earned it with how he acts, constantly talking shit about everyone behind their backs. 

Now if you're living at home and aren't completely independent than he feels like he is so much superior than you and is all he ever talks about. He is always talking down and saying that he's the happiest, the most content, the most fit, and got the most money. It's always about him in a positive light and while I respect it and everything he has for himself I know its not him being normal. There were many years of great times and laughs that we would have together. 

He doesn't want to do what I want to do, even now that he has a car and lots of money saved up, and I don't want to do what he wants to do. I'd rather go to places, events, and experiences rather than sit in a small, moldy, cat piss smelling apartment just for ""Old Times Sake.""

Everyone I talk to about this, and even everyone involved has told me to drop it and move on. 

I guess if strangers on the internet tell me not to bother after reading through all that, it might be worth it to listen.

720,"My Sister-in-Law's sister's husband and I are friends.  He immigrated here from a Latin American country and I am one of the few of my brother's circle who can somewhat speak Spanish.  He moved here to be with his wife and their baby but has had a tough time.  He's young (22) and his paperwork is being delayed with everything going on.  I helped him get a job and lent him some money when he first got here.  

He knows I am gay and we occasionally joke flirt but we were chatting on whatsapp and he said he wanted to thank me for everything I have done for him.  I jokingly said ""Denada.  Solo dame una selfie desnuda.""  He said, ""ok"" and sent me a near nude photo.  I laughed it off and the next morning he claimed that he was drunk when he sent it.

I honestly don't know what to do.  I could just ignore it.  It was likely a joke.  But, what if he was hitting on me?  Honestly, I definitely find him attractive but I wouldn't do anything to compromise my SIL's sister's relationship.  He might also be struggling with something and what I thought was play flirting was something else.  What if she finds out and asks me?

721,"I´m currently being forced to learn from home due to coronavirus, but this began before then.  My conversations through text with them have been curt and cold, no longer filled with smiles and memes.  They haven´t been answering my calls or texts.  I am constantly forced to see my ex during class calls as well.  One time I joined a call and it was just me and them.  I attempted to make conversation, and they just kept shutting me down, saying, ¨No¨ over and over.  We were on relatively good terms before this, but that hurt.  I asked them why they are angry at me, and they told me that I know why.  I don´t, and it hurts.  I attend a small school, and am not really like most people around me.

723,"So, it all began a few months ago when I found something I absolutely loved doing. I worked my butt off and studied as hard as I possibly could to achieve a certification (I failed once, retook it and passed) just before the syllabus for the certification changed. 

During the same time last year, I graduated with my master's in business with background in IT but I found my calling in the Networking field.

I got an amazing opportunity to be a part of this internship program for one of this big Multinational companies in Networking department with a possibility to turn it into a permanent position. I knew I wanted it since the day I got in and I did everything possible by me to achieve it. This is one of the reasons why I worked so hard to get the certification as it would have given me an upper hand over other candidates applying for the same position since the competition is very tough. 

Last month I took the interview and it went well. A couple weeks later, I found out I was shortlisted. I was so excited and happy knowing I'd be doing something I love and also be close to my partner. However, a few days after, I was told that based on my profile, I would better suit another IT position related to programming. It broke my heart. I have nothing against programming but it's something I absolutely dread and don't enjoy doing at all. 

I politely told them I'd be a better candidate for the position I applied for and worked really hard over the last few months and it is my dream place to be working at. I was told that's not possible anymore since the circumstances have changed due to COVID19 and even though I cleared the interview, they can't promise if I will be offered a position in Networking. So I set an interview for the programming position, even though I was very reluctant to do so. 

Now, my problem is, I don't know what to do here. I want to work at this company but not in the position they're asking me to interview for. The position I initially applied for and worked so much toward achieving seems to be slipping away from me. I was so motivated every single day working towards achieving my goal and even though I came so close, I feel like I lost. 

The job market is really bad at the moment and I don't know if I'll be able to get another offer for the same role since I have no prior experience in Networking. I would have done well in this position as  that was something I thought I'd be good at. I enjoyed studying every bit of it. I would have worked harder than every single person on the entire team to show I earned my place.

I come from a third world country and this opportunity would have been great going forward. I guess sometimes you need a little bit of luck in your favour besides hard work. 

I feel like even though I'll take the interview for the other position, I won't have the same motivation anymore and I'll get rejected. 

I'm so confused on what I should do from here on. Should I take the interview seriously and give it my best shot? Or should I email them and explain my situation? I feel like sending them an email might leave a wrong impression as to them, I'm disposable and they can easily find someone else.

730,"I don like to do this but im on my last straw. I can't keep it in anymore. My father has ruined my entire life, let me explain. I was once a young kid(not anymore im an adult now) with full of character i was funny, i was well liked and I loved my life up until 8 grade (many years ago) where i got into a huge fight with my ""father"" where he ended up  pulling me up and throwing me on a wall where i got my t shirt ripped I was only 13 at the time but that wasn't the worst part. If it was just that i could've forgiven him however my ""father"" then proceeded to not talk to me for a full year basically was neglected by him not one word. He muted me out. I don't know who does that to their 13 year old son I was still a kid. That obviously ended up destroying me emotionally and mentally. I lost all confidence in myself, I lost my friends, I became socially anxious as i thought i was a good for nothing since even my own father gave up on me, I also became extremely depressed and was suicidal. My chance of having a normal teenage life was done at that point btw all these he caused I am still dealing with them many many years later what also bothers me about is wich kind of parent stops talking to their own little son and how do you not think of the negative mental effects it will have on him. My life became hell at the point. The worst part is that my ""father"" never apologised to me about this as i was pretty much forced after a year to apologise to him. We then started being ""okay"" with each other after that however the damage was already for about 2 years we went on like nothing happened but i wasnt the same still struggling with everything he caused me. I decided to cut him out tho after about 2 years and stop speaking to him due to what he had done years passed. We still live under the same roof tho sadly as i cannot afford a place of my own yet. That's not the only thing that i hate about my ""father"" even though i cannot if he was mentally abusive when i was younger i definitely he would sometimes hit me a bit too much and would scream at me too much. Another thing that cannot ever forgive him for is that he cheated on my mom even though she does everything for him. She cooks, cleans and is borderline his full time servant while he sits and watches tv and gets mad often. So my mom gives her all for him and that loser cheats on her. The only thing he does is he has a hardworking job where he works like 80 hours a week but that doesn't matter as i barely any of the money makes and anyways i want nothing to do with it. He is a good breadwinner tho i can't lie. As of march 2020 i am still dealing with everything my dad caused me mentally my life has been because of him and i've also been suicidal imagine killing myself cause of everything he caused me.

My girlfriend and I are having a child together, she’s being induced on the 24th of this month and it is all very exciting. Due to this we have moved away from university early and are living with her nan. Her nan is in her early 60’s, same age as my dad, is a lovely lovely woman who can’t do enough for you and she also believes in ghosts, spirits and star signs. 

Often we will watch shows about ghost sightings where my girlfriend, who is mildly superstitious, and her nan will be engrossed and love it. Tonight I was asked by her nan “what do you believe in?” My response is what it always is “I don’t really. I’m not superstitious, I’m not religious, I don’t believe conspiracy theories, don’t think aliens are visiting us. My belief is that what you see is what you get.” Her response was to say that “you will find as you get older that a lot of this stuff like ghosts and especially star signs make sense. Not believing anything for your entire life is quite an ignorant way to live.” 

She did not say this maliciously I want that to be clear. She said it in a way that was encouraging conversation. However she had just told me that my belief and outlook on the world is an ignorant one. I don’t think what I said was offensive to deserve such a retaliation but maybe it was. I am going to have to live with her for the foreseeable future and due to Covid-19 am stuck in the same house 24/7 anyway. I feel genuinely offended and have voiced that, she stands by what she said claiming that not believing anything can be ignorant. I genuinely feel she is a loving caring fantastic woman, anyway to advice to keep the peace please?

739,"How NOT to quit? How to keep myself motivated? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I chose a wrong high school for me, I'm doing good so far but I'm highly positive about failing in the near future. The school is a source of negativity in my life. Should I quit (change curriculum/""major"" by that means) or hope things work out? 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to clarify, I'm not from the US, the school system here is slightly different, such as there aren't optional subjects, all classes are mandatory. One can only decide between what type of high school they want to study  (eg. business, medical, musical - oh yes XD, normal hs, ICT/IT and what not...)

&amp;#x200B;

I chose a high school that is ICT (local cisco academy) oriented and I've been studying  here for 2 years so far, but somehow I feel like I want to quit (not to drop  out completely obviously, but to find some ""normal"" high school with  more appealing classes to me). It all started with me being super enthusiastic, but my motivation is somewhat growing old, I've been demotivated by my teachers so many times, I even feel kinda sad. I just feel like I don't stand a future  here, I think that I'm wasting my potential into something I was not  meant to do. I excel in all the school's subjects  and I've been nominated for the best student 4x times in row (each  semester basically).  I'm no way talented/smart/high iq or whatever, I believe that the only reason for my success is my hard work. I come home from school, I study, both for school but also do extracurricular activities - all forms of online courses/foreign languages and stuff that I find useful and do sports (I count sports solely as amusement though). The point I'm trying to make is, that I don't think I could push/extend my limits any further. See, the problem is, our school has this mandatory class called ""practice"", where we bring our knowledge of theory into realization... And that's where I totally suck. Funnily enough my classmates who are struggling with every other subject usually don't have problem in this one, but I'm totally useless. I would usually end up getting the worst mark (F) or the 2nd worst one. I spend overtime in the lessons, I'm here about 30min after everybody else left, sitting here, trying to figure out how to do it, my teacher would usually either give me F right away (like after the end of the lesson) or let me struggle a bit and give me F anyway. Thankfully the practice is like divided into 3 teachers/3 parts, so I can balance these bad marks with good ones so I end up having a good grade as a final result. Yet, I know that I'm going to face much tougher challenges in the 3rd and 4th grade (junior/senior year) - the practice won't be divided into parts anymore (ironically they'll keep the parts where I'm good combined and the one where I'm bad will be independent..) + add other subjects that are of area that I'm literally antitalent in, so there won't be a chance for me to balance it. I fear that I'm going to fail, or end up with a super bad grade that is going to prevent me from getting into college...

&amp;#x200B;

The school also often limits me from extracurricular activities and things I would love to learn!

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of negatives to the school. Most of the teachers are totally incompetent, fixing their broke ego on us, the students. Before you judge me as a teenage punk, please hold on, more than anything else in my life, I would wish, that I could say about my teachers that they are great and they taught me something, it hurts so bad inside me that I have to say this, but as someone wiser than me once said, it is what it is :-( !!! Most of them are not actually interested in teaching us something, rather than making us fail. We've agreed upon that with all of my classmates. Every one of us is considering going to different schools. The school is hard as hell, we're flooded with tests, homeworks and what not, and the worst thing is that there isn't a proper recognition for our hard effort. In the end, we're going to leave with the same leaving certificate as anyone else who got through high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached the point that I consider my current school to be my greatest enemy and source of negativity in my life. I'm constantly worried, because of my life plans...  I think that quitting till it's time is the best strategy. My school results are great so far, so hopefully I could get accepted to any other HS and won't even have to repeat a year. I would be in a way worse situation if I was forced to leave the school the next year --&gt; I would like to see another school to accept a student that is a ""failure"". I'm also a bit worried about the reaction of my parents, I honestly tried to bring the topic up once and they kinda laughed at me: ""Why, jeez, there's no reason, you're doing great, aren't you?""... 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I should be honest, another thing to keep in consideration are my classmates. It's incredible that there are 22 of us all alike! We're a great group, thanks to the hell we went through, we share an awesome camaraderie, we try to help each other whenever possible, often risking a bad mark for the good of the group.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Endure and pray that things somehow work out? Or quit till is the time to prevent me failing, and getting my life dreams and goals screwed up.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone that bothered to read it all the way to the end!

743," 

Hi guys!

I’m really conflicted on what to do here and can’t work out what the right course of action is.

Myself (22F) and a friend (21F) booked a 3 week interrailing trip to travel to 12 cities in Europe. We booked and paid our deposits before Coronavirus was about.

The deposits were £340 ($421) each. My friend had some extra cash so she paid a total of £500 ($619) towards her part when we booked it. The total cost of the trip is £1818 ($2251) each. We have to pay the rest of the balance on 27th April.

We are paying for this with our student loans. (Don’t judge about this pls, we get given a loan based on means testing and don’t get to choose how much it is. This is our final year at uni and that’s our final payment, but at that point we are able to work and earn extra money because we have already finished the course) so we get the money to pay on 27th when it is due.

Obviously due to coronavirus I don’t think we will be able to go, as the trip starts 6th June. I asked the company if we can cancel and they said the trip is non-refundable, and they think it will still go ahead. If they cancel it, they’re offering to postpone it for up to 18 months no extra charge or reroute the trip.

Postponing it is not an option, I will be starting university again late August and won’t be able to go in the next 18 months, neither will my friend. I don’t think I should pay the extra money, just cut my losses and accept that I’ve lost the £340. My friend doesn’t want to cancel, thinks we should pay the full amount and hope it can go ahead, or that they will refund us if they cancel the trip.

The problem is if I cancel, she can’t go because it’s a 2 person trip. She doesn’t have anyone else that could go with her, so I couldn’t sell my part. If I decide to cancel I lose my £340 and she loses her £500 even though she doesn’t want to.

What should I do here? I don't want to lose money (especially that amount), I don't want my friend to lose money, and I don't want to lose her as a friend!",08Apr2020,1

I don't do anything for anyone. My parents like me but our relationship is more like roommates instead of family. 

I have friends but I'm nobody's best friend. I'm the second option. I tend to come off as over excited so I think it repels people.

For example: Today is my best friends birthday. I had spent 2 months trying to plan the perfect day with her squad even though they hate me due to previous events. But obviously because of Covid-19 it wasnt possible. So I dropped her presents off yesterday and wished her happy birthday through a window. I asked her if I could video call her today to say it on her actual birthday. She said ""sure"" but has been actively avoiding my messages and calls. To the point where she replied to my 11 year old sister and still hasnt texted me back.

Hi! Before, I start, I would just like to make it clear that I know no one knows someones intentions unless you ask. I just wanted to get an idea of what you guys think.

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (I really have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I'm confused: did he just put in all this effort throughout this year just to hook up with me? Or did he want an actual relationship with me? It's weird cause ever since freshman year we would keep in contact through some sort of social media, but now we haven't talked at all since the quarantine (like 4ish weeks).",08Apr2020,0

After the encounter I contemplated on contacting him but was really bogged down with my exams so I set it aside. After a few weeks I tried searching for the business card and couldnt find it. I tried to get his info from my uncle but he was in transit. So I left it there and totally forgot about it.

772,"This is my first post on this subreddit so apologies in advance if I mess up.

The title pretty much says it all. I have a really high sex drive and some weird kinks which I sometimes act on (by that I'm talking about masturbation and letting some scenarios play in my head when I'm alone. I don't watch porn), on average about once a week.

I've been catching myself thinking about sex almost every day for the past five or so months, and I often get that feeling of wanting to act on them out of the blue (although I usually don't).

I know that my kinks really aren't that uncommon and that I'm literally at the age when my body is screaming ""PROCREATE"". And I suspect that the main factor could be the way I was raised and brought up regarding the topic of sex (My parents are really serious and being disciplined with your thoughts and emotions and that kind of stuff, and said a few things in the past about sex that sort of distorted my image of what's healthy and what wasn't). 

But even with that awareness, plus knowing that this is a normal bodily function, it's so hard for me not to beat myself up for it. For example I'd pretty much silently yell at myself stuff like ""I'm trying to do my math homework. I shouldn't be thinking about sex!"" And then hate on myself for not concentrating hard enough and letting my mind drift to something so inappropriate and provocative at such a wrong time and place. 

And the more I beat myself up the worse it gets for me, because it's really been building up and interfering with my ability to live my life to the fullest. 

I have the knowledge that I need to lead myself to a better place in this situation, but I don't know what to do with it anymore.

774,"Hi all,

Received some tragic news this morning. Two months after my partner's father died, her older brother took his life in Taiwan last night. (My partner and I are currently separated across town from eachother due to lockdown - we live in the UK). 

Her mother lives in Ireland and there's been some discussion about the funeral today. We believe her brother's body will be repatriated to the UK and the thinking with her and her siblings is that they will travel across to Ireland (her siblings are in the Manchester area) via ferry with the body and take him through Northern Ireland to the Republic for him to have a funeral there.

My question is... How will any of this work with the restrictions going on?

- My partner's mother is in her late 70s and lives on her own in the Republic.
- Are funerals allowed people from abroad at them in ROI? Can her mother attend? 
- Is my partner allowed to join her siblings up north to then travel across together?
- My partner's sister is just getting over Coronavirus. Is this wise for her to be going in a few weeks, or for my partner and her other brother to be around their sister? 
- Can my partner stay with her mother? Will she need to quarantine beforehand or when she arrives in Ireland?
- Will she be able to get home?

We're trying to figure out the best course of action at the moment...",08Apr2020,1
775,"So my little sister (11) is suicidal, and possibly schizophrenic (were getting her to see a psychologist to see if she does have it because she finally told us that she has been seeing and talking to friends that apparently aren’t real but no voices I don’t think). That’s a really hard thing to come to terms with, and we are getting her help. 

The issue that comes with that is that now it’s out in the open, ANYTIME we get into a fight, she tells me that I am the reason she is suicidal, and accuses me of things I absolutely don’t do, such as hitting (which is a big no no in my house, and calling names, another thing that both my parents won’t allow in the house). 

Both my parents are deaf so they can’t hear what she says to me or me to her, so I voice record EVERYTHING so I can show my brother (if we voice record stuff as proof I guess we have to show one of our siblings that isn’t involved so they can be a witness), and it pisses my sister off because she doesn’t like feeling like she’s in the wrong and doesn’t like admitting it or apologizing for anything. 

She has panic attacks anytime we try to calmly talk to her about literally anything, if it’s something personal or if we try to tell her she can’t be as physically and verbally violent as she is, but she’s so delicate because of her mental disorders and because she’s suicidal that my parents rarely ever punish her for anything because they don’t want to upset her. I’m not saying that’s wrong, I’m just saying it has made her feel like if she wants to get out of a situation where she KNOWS she is in the wrong, she avoids it, and if she is going to get in trouble, she will tell my parents that she feels like killing herself because of something I didn’t do and then they get mad at me. 

No matter how perfect I try to be to absolutely make sure there is no way I was in the wrong, EVEN with the voice recordings as evidence, my parents don’t look at me the same, and believe I’m at fault for why my sister feels suicidal because of me. I’m not gonna lie, I am kind of strict with her for good reason, because I don’t allow her to bend the rules with me (if it’s a panic attack she’s having, I give her space because she always gets sensory overload so if I try to help her it just makes it worse so I have to give it time before I can approach her again and try to comfort her). 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I’m exhausted from trying to watch my every move around her, walking on eggshells, and it sounds so assholey of me, but I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to give up on her but I really can’t do this anymore. 

The way my parents look at me like I’m the bad kid even though I’ve tried to be perfect for them, trying not to have the same explosive anger as both my siblings, trying to get the perfect grades, its degrading my mental health. In a few months I move out for college anyway, but how do I approach my parents, because I feel like she’s taking advantage of them subconsciously, and I don’t want to worsen her mental health.

780,"I am going to preface this with this is my last semester of college for a very long time, possibly ever. I’m going back into the military. I am also a veteran, so my income right now is 100% based on the GI bill, so I need to stay enrolled in classes. 

So with the pandemic, of course my university has chosen distance learning for the remainder of the semester. My professors are doing the best they can with what they have. I am currently taking three science courses and a religion course. Two of my courses, Immunology and Organic Chem II, I am not doing great in. (I didn’t go into this semester with the heart to really push myself for good grades). 

I’m at a crossroads. I’ve fallen quite behind in these classes, and with my already bad grades, I can probably squeeze out a C or a D in these classes with maximum effort. 

My problem is, I don’t care. I just can’t find a fuck to give about these classes or these grades, and school makes me miserable. I can’t just drop the classes as the VA will remove my living stipend, so I need to continue. 

Another point: since my field of study is relatively competitive, a “C” grade and below is grounds for the university to cause me to repeat the class anyway. 

I know this is all very confusing, but basically, if I choose to fail these classes, the next month of my life would be amazing. I would focus on the other two classes I have, enjoy the rest of the time I have home, and relieve me of anxiety. But I would leave with two F’s. 

Alternatively, if I choose to continue the classes, I will have a lot of work to do in something I really don’t care for, and the chances of me receiving a good enough grade for it to count would be very slim. But I wouldn’t leave with any failing grades. 

So, what would you do? Choose freedom and happiness, take two F’s and move on, or choose to buckle down and salvage whatever GPA you can? 

P.S. If I do fail two classes, I will not owe any money to the VA, as I will fall under an academic forgiveness program where they will forgive 6 credit hours, or two classes.

Well due to everything happening right now, we had to furlough one of those coworkers who I supervised with one part of her job. I was working remote the day she got furloughed, and I immediately reached out when I received the news to ask how she was doing...crickets. I thought it was strange but figured she was overwhelmed. Then I had to ask her questions regarding a project she was supposed to have completed, still no answer. Eventually, I go in to speak to HR and ask if they have heard anything from her. They said they received an email from her that morning, stating that she would not be available to complete the assignment, and that she “requests to only speak to her other boss at this point, because Suzie* (name is made up, but that is me) does not give clear instructions and can be confusing with projects.” 

Thankfully, both my supervisors thought it was ridiculous and to completely ignore it. They know how hard I worked to help her with every assignment, but I can’t help but feel extremely betrayed and hurt. She missed a deadline earlier that week, which I had been telling her she needed to get on. She also didn’t even start a major assignment that her other boss gave her 3 months ago, which I am now taking care of, on top of my usual roles. 

She has never once brought this problem up to me, and if she had, I would have worked on this issue 100%. It is my first time supervising, and I basically fell into this role. I really wonder if she will return in a month, and if she does it’s going to be so awkward! I definitely lost my trust in her and she still has yet to respond to a single message of mine. 

When and if she returns, should I mention this to her? I can’t imagine just acting as if it never happened. And I find it interesting that she decided to say this to them after the fact of her being laid off, not before. For her to know that they are laying people off, and criticize me, is horrible considering I *could* be next.

I didn’t know where to post this so I though this would be a good place to start.


I’m a student living in Toronto and can be considered as an essential worker. I work at a Starbucks in Loblaws.

Recently, I have been having stomachaches and sharp, brief chest pain and I’m sooo scared because I feel dangerous and unsafe at work. I have to take orders and make drinks for the customers who sometimes don’t respect the 6 feet rule.

My roommate has a weak immune-system and every day I come back from work, I feel scared that I may infect her. Along with the brief sharp pains I’m experiencing in my chest, I would much rather stay at home.

I discussed with one of my boss and explained my situation (I’m also on my 3 month probation) and he told me to fill out a form for a covid 19 related leave of absence, reassuring me that I won’t get fired. The form required me to included my estimated return date. Personally, I would have my return date at the end of August but my family and friends said it’s too long.

I have always been driven everywhere I need to go my whole life by my parents because it has been relatively close to where we live and I am not much of a social person to have a reason to drive.

However, The University that I will be attending is much more farther than we had thought. My parents had told me that they will not be able to drive back and forth and that I will have to drive my self from now on when I start University. I have never driven an actual car and the only thing I have driven closely to a car would be a golf kart. At the beginning of this year I told my self that I would get my license but now it's April and I'm still beginning to study my driver's hand book and I will start Universities in the Fall. I'm sorry if this post seems very obvious to some but this problem has been bothering me almost everyday since the beginning of the year and need some advice or insight on how to properly achieve my goal.

Any tips, help, or advice is greatly appreciated from anyone!",08Apr2020,1

For so content my boyfriend and I have been dating since freshman’s year and we are seniors now so that’s 4 years and it’s been going good but lately it’s been rocky. Ya see my boyfriend is really poor like so poor that him and his mom don’t live in the same house somebody took them I when they were down on their luck, but now those people that took them in treat them horrible like they live in the basement and they only eat 4 day out of the week and the chores of the house is theirs, my boyfriend even missed days of school because they made him and his mom clean the house. But I told my boyfriend that since it’s so hard for him to get a job maybe he should join the military or something like that because I think he really would succeed there. And he said no because he has a problem with authority and he just assumed that he’d live with me forever and work only if he really had to, he wants a job yes but he doesn’t think it’s worth it since the family he is living with takes away all his time. I’m trying to convince him, I’ve given him job applications and he keeps getting mad and upset with me that I’m trying to help him. I told him I don’t want a deadbeat boyfriend and that he needs a job or some type of work that isn’t free labor but at this point idk what to do.",08Apr2020,1

I'm a fluent English, Swedish, and Japanese speaker. I have an opportunity to get scholarship and go to Japan to pursue doctoral studies. I really don't know whether I'm too scared to go, or if I don't want to go. I feel that I could just stay in Poland and work as a translator, but I'm afraid that if I stayed I would waste my life and regret it later.

792,"I've known for a long time that my mental health was deteriorating (Based on what I've read, the symptoms point towards depression and anxiety but I'm not about to self diagnose), but I only realized just how bad it was getting this past Saturday when I found myself exploring ways to take my life to get options. As I was doing so, it's like a switch flipped and I went ""Holy f\*\*k, I need help NOW."" It was a wake up call and, thankfully, I was not about to go through with anything. It was more just intrusive thoughts pushing me closer to such a decision.

My problem now is I'm not sure how to find someone who can help me overcome this. I've looked and there are several people in my area that can help treat the problems I might have and also take my insurance (Thankfully, this kind of treatment is covered by my insurance, so the only worry is finding someone who takes it). As I'm sure it's obvious, I've never looked for this kind of thing before (And I admit I've waited far too long to come to this conclusion). What are some ways I can narrow down who to make an appointment with? Most of the ones I've looked at have online or phone alternatives given current events, and honestly I feel like I'd be more comfortable with that right now. Obviously, whether or not they are even seeing new patients right now is a big thing, but what else should I consider?

One other thing, is it wrong that I want to keep how bad things have gotten from my family until I can show them that I am getting the help I need? My parents are both worried about the pandemic (I'm also very worried and I feel like that's worsening some of my symptoms, particularly my anxiety and the intrusive thoughts). They're high risk and work in essential industries (My dad specifically because he works at a hospital and just today they put their first patient on a ventilator). I'm going to tell them that I am seeking therapy and I'm not against telling them how bad it has gotten by any stretch. I just don't want to give them something else to be worried or afraid about, so I'm hesitant to tell them how bad it got until I can show that I am getting treatment for it.",08Apr2020,1

794,"I'm kind of concerned here. My place of business is apparently essential (even though we produce cardboard boxes and inserts for firearms, training toilets, Wi-Fi extenders and other nonessential, non- medical, non-food items) so we're all working. About 20 of us or so. Recently however one of our workers was sent home due to violent coughing which had carried on for a couple days and not feeling well. We(myself and a few others) found out later from her that she was feverish, developed breathing trouble, she ended up getting tested and after a hand full of them she was confirmed to have the virus. After coughing and hacking. All. Over. Everything.

My boss and the big boys in charge have made no attempt to inform us of the situation. The only reason we even KNOW she has the virus is because she told us via Facebook. Now there seems to be a bit of a cough spreading from worker to worker. And I'm especially worried because she worked closely with me during the days she was first getting sick. I haven't had any symptoms yet but I'm concerned for the safety of myself as well as everyone else i work with.

798,So here is what happend so last week I asked my friend if we could hang out together after she asked if we could date. She left that message on read and when I asked to play a game on iMessage a few hours later she just left that on read to. After that like a day later I asked her to play Minecraft and she also didn’t responded until a day later and just left that on read to then a day later after that I said sorry if I had upset her for asking her to hang out and texting her a lot and by that I mean the other to texts I sent then I few days later after that I sent one final text saying that at the risk of this being spam she was awsome and that I hope we can play Minecraft again soon  and I just don’t understand why she’s been ignoring me I don’t see how 5 texts that didn’t say anything mean could make someone mad it just bothers me a lot because we had such a good thing going but she won’t even talk to me anymore and I don’t understand why it sucks because I didn’t even do anything as far as I know I’m there’s nothing I could have done to upset her it makes no sense.

So I need some advice how to reject men online without being too much of a bitch. So I am a 23 year old girl and I recently made an instagram, I have set it to public because I play music and want others to find me and see my covers. Now I have guys (some of them from Tinder I think) sending me messages, normally I just ignore this and don't respond if I'm not interested  but now this guy I recognize from college and from on the train started to follow me and liking stuff. That's fine but now he has sent me a dm saying that that new picture of me is beautiful. I once came across him on Tinder and he superliked me back then but I swiped left because he really really isn't my type. What should I do, should I just say thank you to his message, ignore it or what? I don't want to hurt his feelings too much, but on the other hand he really doesn't know me, I have never talked to him.. has someone some advice for me how to handle situations like this?? I'm a really empathic person and I hate situations like this.

801,"This is the first post I've ever made on Reddit, ever. So please bear with me. I have no one else to ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, I \[29F\] met my boyfriend \[31M\]. I thought, at the time, he was the most effervescent soul I'd ever met. He was absolutely teeming with life. I've always been more of a background character. I'm quite quiet and I don't socialise much. So I was blind-sided by this man, who professed he loved me and I was the love of his life, his soul mate. I felt like we balanced each other out. 

But then he removed all the affection. He stopped telling me I was beautiful. He didn't make any time for me, would shrug me off if I asked him. He ended up having to work every day for 7 months, and didn't call me once in those months. I waited up for him every night and weekend, but he never called. It was always a maybe. It never happened though. And if I would question him, he would say ""Well I'm autistic/an only child/tired/busy"" and get mad enough at me that I would apologise for wanting his time. 

I started doubting myself and losing weight because I felt that maybe I just wasn't attractive enough to warrant his attention but I caught myself before it became a real problem.

When he told me it was MY fault he drank (my mother is a fairly abusive alcoholic so that was a dagger in me) I didn't stop crying the entire day. A couple days later, I left him.

&amp;#x200B;

It was going well. We had no contact for weeks and I left him alone. I was feeling better. 

But now he messaged me again and I just... break. I love him. He doesn't value it or want it, but I do. and I know it's pathetic but he showed me one little flash of affection and it dragged me right back to where I was. Lower, even. I've had self destructive tendencies before and I've noticed I've lost yet even more weight. I can't see my friends, or family. I'm not able to open up about this to my IRL friend because they'll see how stupid I am in even talking to him. 

I don't know how to get my head back on track by myself. I've stopped contact again but that isn't the fix it was last time.",08Apr2020,1

804,"About a year ago when I first started dating my bf, I was home alone one day and walked into the office that had a closet door open. The closest consisted of a blowup doll,  teenage girl like panties, that could also be women panties, silicone boobs and other sexual little toys. I confronted him about it when he got home and he gave me a fair answer and insisted that he had this stuff because he didnt want to go out and have sex with girls who he didnt have chemistry with. Today I was listening to a podcast that talked about pedophilia and psychopaths and mentioned some things that I dont know if I am presuming on him. He has a close relationship with his 12 year old niece. She always wants to hang out with him and thinks of him as the cool uncle. I know that they have slept in the same bed and they always innocently play and tickle and overall have a good rapport with each other. She thinks the world of him.I still think of  him as a wonderful man hence to why I refused to believe he is something else. And have overlooked alot, such as him not expressing his sexual desires or kinks. I did notice a couple of months ago young  niece sent nudes to her bf and my bf told me about it because he found out through his mom and sister which they also shared with me. His response was I'm not surprised. That slightly made me feel uncomfortable. I was listening to a podcast the other day that made me go back to the day I found that stuff in his closet.

809,"I am currently 20 years old, male and a sophomore in college (junior next semester). I am still undecided major wise, and unless I want to take 5-6 years total for my bachelors, I have to decide before I schedule next semester (which I was able to do months ago now)

I go to a school with a very large and well respected fashion program, and that’s what I for sure thought I was going to major in (fashion merchandising specifically) I love fashion, I own a small resell business for a very niche market of fashion, and I make a few sales a month, usually profiting.

After research though, I learned salaries for fashion related jobs tend to be low. Also, jobs are mainly only available in NYC and LA, neither of which I am from. I wouldn’t mind moving, but this restricted range and limited opportunity caused me to drop out of fashion. 

I have been taking required core classes, but the time has come and I have finished them all, And it’ll be major-related classes from here on out. I am so scared and lost and confused about what to do.

I have looked into an Information Technology major. I play a lot of PC games, I’ve built my own computer, I’m somewhat familiar with programs and troubleshooting. I think it would be something I could tolerate at the least. But it wouldn’t compare to my passion and love for fashion. 

So I’m basically balancing these two choices. Fashion— id love what i would do, but I’d possibly be upset if I didn’t land a good paying job. IT— is probably somewhat like what I would do, and chances are well I’d get a good paying job with flexible hours.

I have done research and I still can’t come to a decision. I don’t know any professionals in either field. Advisors have helped me research, but can’t make the decision for me, same goes with my parents. They honestly just want me to choose.

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated, especially as I am being pressured into scheduling for next semester ASAP to get into the classes I will need to take.

Thank you",08Apr2020,0
810," 

So I am a 23M and have been seeing my 24F girlfriend for about 6 months. When we met, we were basically having sex daily, every time id ask her to come over it was met with zero resistance, and we would always hook up at night and sometimes mornings. We never fought and she never brought up any issues with me, often saying she felt intimidated by me having a lot of women in my life previously (I had a bit of a player past but was open to monogamy). Everything was great, never pointed out anything she disliked in me.

Eventually, she tells me shes shes pregnant and the kid is mine. This was maybe 4 months into dating. She was really emotional and scared about what to do, saying she wasnt keen on abortion or adoption so I figured shes a really cool and agreeable chick, I find her incredibly attractive, seemingly good upbringing and family. I offer to let her move into my place, which I was sharing with a couple friends to save money.

Her close friends even congratulated us.

We start to get closer, and she tells me things like how her parents are really well off financially, and they always told her they'd help her and her future husband purchase a place, and maybe take over her fathers business. How her parents owned a nice house with a pool, and they were an oldschool chinese couple very much in love.

I never actually met her parents or went over to her place, she'd usually get herself home after leaving my apartment.

Over time, she starts to get a little annoyed by my roommates and their lifestyle, since we were all around the same age and accustomed to partying now and then. She kind of hinted at the fact that me and her wouldn't really work out unless we got a place together at some point. I was pretty emotional over the whole pregnancy thing, and figured this girl and I could potentially have a great future. So I began looking at condos for just us two.

Eventually, I secured a place after a lot of looking, but the catch was I had to pay 3 months of last months rent, as well as the first month of living there. And then the place was ours. I was pretty hesitant, because that would cost me like 8 grand. But I had a very high credit card limit and good score. And this girl was literally pregnant with my child. I know this because she hadn't had a period at all while living with me for about 2 months now. Every hour of every day I would basically be by her side, as I was working from home.

I decided to get the place for us, for march 1st move in. $1900 a month, but I figured she would help me split that since she was starting a new job soon with her dads company.

As we got closer id notice some weird inconsistencies in her stories to me that didnt really make sense or seemed a little unbelievable. I got curious, and started messaging a girl she and I both knew, but her and that girl were only acquaintances who briefly went to high school together.

I found out her parents weren't well off, they lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of the city. Her dad didn't own a car dealership, but a lawnmower repair shop. By the sounds of it, they were maybe lower middle class. I freaked out at her, and she came clean hysterically crying and saying everything was a lie because she wanted me to like her. As we fought she started swallowing anti anxiety meds she had in her bag, and drink alcohol in front of me as I freaked out and tried to make her stop.

Like a dumbass, we talked it through and I told her id still love her if she wasn't rich. She seemed so keen on starting a family and expressing her old school values and desire to be a mother.

The next morning, I wake up and she has this look of shock on her face. She tells me she went to the washroom and brown blood stained her underwear, and her symptoms of pregnancy began to disappear. Turns out she caused herself to have a miscarriage. The next few days she was incredibly depressed, and I didn't know what else to do but console her. I was really emotional, and this clouded my rational thinking. We both agreed we could probably try again down the road.

So a few days later, we move into our new place, and I took a huge financial hit to secure it. Because I convinced myself i'd do anything for family. And I considered her family.

For some reason when it came to sex, she kind of shrugged it off saying later, later later. I figured shes been through a lot, thats pretty reasonable I guess. At this point she doesnt have that much to do except apply for jobs really. We're both home a lot, and aside from work I was just with her. Eventually the topic of when shes going to start pitching for rent came up, and she starts arguing with me saying ""I planned on pitching in towards buying things for the condo here and there. I didn't know you wanted to keep score and split everything 50/50. If it was going to be like that, we could've just remained friends or roommates."" At this point im losing my shit in complete disbelief. It was heavily implied we'd work together to pay for this place, I didn't care if she paid me maybe down the road a month or so later but she springs this on me weeks into moving in.

I tell her thats fucking insane and I cant pay it all by myself. So she begrudgingly caves and says ""Fine, ill help you once I have more income coming in soon."" Not to mention, even after I drop all that money, she has the nerve to ask if her mom can borrow $1k from me, and here and there ask me to cover costs of things I have no obligation to pay for.

I kept getting all these promises of soon, soon but never saw anything.

She always called herself a princess, and how she expects to be pampered because thats what her dad would want for her from a man.

If I told her I couldnt afford to do something for her, or told her no or asked why she needed something so bad, it would be followed by a temper tantrum like she was a 4 year old and accusing me of not really loving her.

But she would always preface her questions with ""It's okay if you can't, but do you think my mom could borrow $1000 from you? Ill pay you back...Also dont tell your parents I asked you for it. I dont want them interfering with our relationship."" She knew she could guilt trip me by saying ""Its ok if you cant""...

Id often ask my parents for advice on my relationship with this girl, and whether they thought certain things she did were sketchy. They would beg me to drop her. And she knew my parents were onto her bullshit so she convinced me not to share details with them.

She was really good at being affectionate at the right times, and making me feel good about myself. But maybe a couple weeks later, her problems with me start to arise ,and she begins nit picking little things that seem so stupid. ""Why don't you help do dishes, you barely do anything and Im left cleaning your mess"". It honestly wasn't that messy, and I figured being the primary breadwinner of the household was pretty big.

She became more and more distant, and i'd still try to hint at sex, making it both obvious and subtle at times. Still i'd get resistance and some excuse for why she couldn't that day. We started to fight a lot about it, with her yelling when I try to ask about it calmly. She would get offended and personally attacked, saying all I want is sex, and why don't I go find some other bitch who just wants to fuck all the time? Keep in mind like a month has passed since we did anything. I would try to calm her down which seemed impossible and ended up being the one to apoligize everytime, even though her outbusts were insane and there were threats of punching me or calling the cops if I don't get out of her way from trying to prevent her from storming out of the condo.

Chronic masturbation became my norm, and i'd discover she would be masturbating or looking at porn in the washroom. (We were also isolated together during the corona virus). Id confront her saying its offensive that she is willing to go jerk off and look at porn, but cant even touch me. She loses her shit at me saying how im a controlling piece of shit and to fuck off, because im telling her she cant look at porn. Which wasn't at all what I was saying. Every time id try to discuss an issue calmly, it would end with her being personally attacked and insulting me/berating me saying I think too much, and am overly paranoid. I'd ask her if she would prefer to be open, she said no. I asked her if I was doing something wrong or she thought I was nasty, she'd get angry and say no.

Her response became ""Sex isn't even that important to me. I can go a year without it and feel nothing. Not even me and my exes had sex that often. I told them It wasn't important to me too.""

(Her exes, she claimed, ended up cheating on her or ending the relationship stating that they didn't feel love for her anymore. Even though she told me she was the perfect girlfriend and always stayed loyal and valued monogamy.)

It got to a point where I would always look though her phone when she slept to find some dirt. All her messages, anything. I wondered if maybe she would cheat on me and delete messages before i'd come home or she would come back.

I even once asked her if she was cheating on me, and her response would be ""I wouldn't even have the time for that."" which was an incredibly sketchy way of phrasing that. Not even a direct ""No"".

She began going to her parents house on weekends because she kept saying how much she missed them, and i'd go with her to the front of our building as her mom would come pick her up. And drop her off a few days later. I'd always meet her downstairs to come get her. So these were my first encounters with her mom, just a quick hi and bye.

Her visits to her parents became longer and longer, with her saying her mom misses her a lot and wants her to stick around. Eventually I get fed up and text her asking when she'll be back, after like a 5 day visit, saying I got this place for us and I assumed we would live there together. She gets pissed off, yelling at me saying Im controlling, and trying to prevent her from seeing her parents and how her parents always come first, and she doesn't care what I think about that. Again I try to talk calmly, and am met with anger and hostility, followed by making up and pretending nothing happened. But she keeps resenting me more.

Then one day, while shes at her parents house she says they're willing to have me stay there with her. April 1st, they actually moved into a shared house 45 minutes away, with her aunt and uncle. There was enough room for me to stay, so I decided to go. We shared an air matress upstairs (I paid for our air mattress and her parents air mattress). There wasn't much inside the place yet, no internet or tv. But I was fine with that. Everything seemed normal for a couple days, but I decided to go back to the condo to grab a couple things and clean up, and it was agreed id come back 1 or 2 days later and stay with them until this corona virus stuff cleared up.

a couple days pass, but she keep saying shes busy with something and has to help her mom take care of this or that. So I tried to keep my cool, but I knew I was supposed to come back soon. This girl even started getting upset that I was going to go back to our condo for a few days, telling me to come back ASAP and saying she misses me already. Another day goes by, and her text messages to me are fewer and fewer, with one word replies and very indifferent tone like I was some aquaintence of hers or something. Half a day goes by, and then all she can say is ""wyd?""

I ask her why she hasn't asked me to come back yet, considered she told me I should live there with them, and have been bored by myself in the condo I got us. I ask her when I should come back and her reply is ""I don't care."" Again more indifference, completely different from a couple days ago. Then starts telling me ""Just come back once we get a TV here"", and I tell her I dont care about the TV or internet, I just want to be around her. Asking why shes so distant, and putting off when I should come back. Almost sounding like excuses to push it further and further back. She gets angry at me and says we're done, and she will come with her dad to collect her things from the condo in a couple days. Saying im too much to handle and too paranoid and psychotic.

(Keep in mind, this is now the 2 month mark we had every opportunity to have sex too, even being quarantined together. Met with excuses and disinterest.)

All in all, with this girl I noticed, the more distant and nonchalant I was, the more affection she showed me. (Still never initiated anything no matter how i'd act). The more I was clingy, or wanted to cuddle her at night, the more closed off and bitchy she would become, just staying on her phone next to me in bed telling me to keep myself occupied. One night she even would sleep on the couch in the living room telling me she would come to bed when her shows were done. Even though I didnt care if she watched her shows on my laptop in bed.

So here I am right now, sitting in the apartment, her having ignored me for 48 hours despite my best attempt at fixing things. Despite trying to bring up issues calmly, and being called named and told im walking on thin ice every time. Threatening to break up with me, until now she finally did.

As she continues to post passive aggressive stories on her instagram of her looking kind of slutty in a crop top and tight yoga pants, which were obviously intentional to make me jealous. She never posts stories.

Where do I go from here? By myself, forcibly celibate for 2 months straight, and feel extremely betrayed and used. I feel like after the silent treatment is done, she will make some half assed attempt to get together again. Followed by no sex.

The funny thing is, she stopped shaving her legs since the quarantine, but before would always have them shaved. Does this mean maybe she was having sex with dudes before this quarantine while I was out, but now that she is unable to see anyone, decided to stop? Because if her shaving was for me, wouldn't she keep doing it even during the quarantine?

Anyways, sorry I know this post is incredibly long and most wont read it, but just needed to get this out there. Very depressed and alone right now.

**EDIT:** *(Here and Just some more details to our relationship, i posted in a reply. To give better context)*

It was never a situation where I gave her ultimatums or tried to force sex. When I met her it would come naturally, either she would initiate or I would. There was never a problem with her libido, even in the beginning she told me how much she loves sex and we would share kinky stories and things. My problem was mainly that, when I would lightly bring concerns up, it was always followed with name calling and belittling. I've never raised my voice or said anything like ""If you dont fuck me you have to leave."" Ive always been very understanding and never pushy. I drop it, and dont take it to heart.

But when you are rejected every single time, with the excuse of ""Lets do tomorrow, im a little tired"", and tomorrow rolls around. Again, not being pushy, im always making an effort to be loving, tell her how beautiful she is, maybe make raunchy jokes or innuendos, kiss her neck, etc, she very obviously curves these advances. Even a month of this I could understand.

Approaching the two month mark, things start to feel a bit off. Its gotten to a point where im scared to bring it up, out of fear of a yelling match followed by ""Fuck off you little bitch, I dont owe you shit. Go find some bitch whos just going to fuck you all the time""

I calmly explain its not even the act of sex im looking for. Im not just trying to get off like a degenerate. I crave the intimacy, the affection, the post-sex cuddles. The thing that separates a platonic friendship from a loving relationship.

I never offered her an exchange of ""Oh well ill pay for all your shit, so you better fuck me."" Id do dozens and dozens of things, without expecting anything. Regarding moving in together, I expressed concern telling her maybe we should wait until we save a bit more money, and she would reply ""No, no lets try to find a place right away.""

She would outright tell me ""I want a life where my husband kind of takes care of me, and im more of a stay at home mom type. I like being a princess and being pampered."" This was never a role I tried to force upon her. This was what she told me prior to moving out. And so I said cool, and had no problem with that. I was more than happy to take care of her.

She wanted to keep trying to have a child, even after the miscarriage. She outright told me ""I want to have a kid. I just wasnt sure if you did. I want marriage. I want an oldschool kind of family life.""

I think you might be a bit biased, based on your experiences with narcissistic men. There was never a point where I expected anything of her. Even despite lies being told of how her family were these multi-millionaires, and her parents would have no problem with even taking care of everything. How her parents might even buy us a condo. (Things that I didnt even care about. Things that she just mentioned without me even asking)

Even after confirming none of that was true, I still saw qualities in her that I liked, and felt no different. But her reasoning for moving in together so quickly was so we could start a life together and have our own privacy, away from others just me and her. To begin having a kid, and lining things up to make that possible. I was on board. Most of these ideas were brought up by her, and I was on board even thought I probably should have reevaluated what she was strongly convincing me to get into.

Now, regarding me noticing her shaving/masturbation/social media habits. I was in no way telling her she cant do these things or should feel bad for doing so. I could honestly care less. These were simply out of character observations I noticed. I would just ask questions, not trying to interrogate but to understand better. I dont care about porn, I dont care about slutty selfies, I dont care about whether she shaves or not. I care about the reasoning behind sudden changes in character.

Telling me shes just not feeling it, while going off to hide in the washroom and masturbate compulsively. After like 6 weeks of rejecting literally every subtle and playful advance id make, made me feel a bit upset. No different than a wife initiating sex with her husband, only for him to tell her ""Maybe tomorrow"" ,and go off to masturbate. This happening now and then is understandable. But when it is the sole alternative to having sex, all the time, that raises questions.

The social media incidents were often because we would have a big fight, followed by her posting an intentionally provocative story of her showing off her physique minutes after this fight happens. Neither one of us posts on social media at all really, she knows I barely touch mine and she doesnt touch hers either. She's admitted in the past that she sometimes posts things hoping I notice, when shes angry with me. So I know to expect that this is how she feels when she intentionally does this. Followed by giving me the silent treatment even when I extend an apology and beg her to talk this out and work through this because she is the love of my life.

The shaving her legs thing, probably just mild PTSD on my end from being traumatized a bit.

Shes made remarks in the past ""Jokingly"", that she would actively try and fuck my ex best friend who betrayed me (By trying to sleep with her while we dated) if I were to ever fuck her over. There were many little manipulation tactics she engaged in, to fill me with fear. Little remarks here and there that I ignored. Social media posts to instill a fear of losing her to another guy. I believe that is a form of abuse because I would never do that.

I would find myself apologizing for triggering an emotional outburst in her, every time I calmly brought up a boundary or thing that I didnt understand. What I was saying and how she interpreted what I was saying were different. For instance, me saying ""So I dont care if you want to stay at your parents for a while, but do you have an idea of when you want to come back? I have no problem, just as a courtesy thing so I know when to expect you.""

For instance, if I felt like I was going to be gone a while running some kinds of errands, Id tell her in advance ""Hey listen ill probably be gone about 6 hours but ill be back soon sweetie.""

Her responses were often vague and would change. ""Ill be back whenever the fuck I want. Stop trying to control me.""

But my tone was never ""Hey you better come back soon, or im done with you. I got us this fucking place, so you better hurry up.""

But this is what she heard when I talked to her.

The problem is, I cant condense 6 months of a relationship into a single post, so a lot is being left out just because I either forget things, or there are only so many words I can type.

But I think your idea of me is slightly biased, and youre filling in the blanks of my character with the qualities of past abusers youve come across.

I would always try to discuss boundaries and specifics with her. Specific times. Specific things she wanted in her future. Specific amounts we would each pay. Her reasoning for getting out of splitting rent was that she was a princess, and as a man I should be taking on the role of being a good provider boyfriend.

She didnt want to talk specifics or boundaries. She was a very vague person, and intentionally put things off a lot. And put off discussions simply because she didnt want to hear about it.

I was never confrontational. I always addressed issues in a loving way, telling her ""I just want to know how you think and if we're on the same page."" And I would be dismissed and yelled at until I desperately apoligize and basically beg her to stay and not cut me off.

But if Im talking to you calmly, im sorry but I dont deserve to be yelled at and called a little bitch and told to fuck off. And I definitely dont have to apoligize for making someone react that way, even though I always did.

I also had no problems giving her time to herself, but over time this alone time kept increasing. Fewer text messages were exchanged. Suddenly we stopped doing movie nights or going out the the bars. Suddenly she wanted to do her own thing on her phone for most of the day, every day. And the more she pulled away the more I found myself wondering why and asking her about it.

The double standard was, when I would request time to myself, or pulled away attention from her, she would say ""Babeeee Im bored. Entertain me"". It was really weird behaviour. She would tell me she thought I was cute and would want to chase me until I started opening my mouth and talking. Then she wanted to run away. All in a half joking way ,but this is how she really acted. The more I acted ""Too cool for school"", the more she pursued me I found. But I couldnt take these not stop head games. Every night, maybe Id want to cuddle, and she'd squirm like an angry cat trying to get away. Things we used to do every night no problem. She became a different person the minute we got a place together and progressively got more distant. I didnt know how to deal with that. It hurts when you have to start treating ""Wifey"" like shes an aquaintence, and you dont have deep conversations anymore. And your text messages go from passionate with endless heart emojis, to dull and one or two words spaced out in the span of hours.

If I didnt initiate a text first, suddenly shes gone for 12 hours.

If I dont keep the conversation going and keep asking her questions trying desperately to create some back and forth, she puts in no effort to do the same.",08Apr2020,1

So I started a work ready program and I’m 2 years in but I don’t like what I do. I think I’m more of a “white collar” type person that a “blue collar” worker. I’d rather work in an office and make good money than sweat my butt off all day long. I find myself stuck, I want to quit my job so that I can go to college and do something else, my job now pays $17 an hour, I know I can find another job that pays decent and will provide enough to survive.

My wife wants me to keep the job I have now and go to college through the same college I take my work ready classes through. I don’t know how to go about this. Whenever I talk to an advisor and tell them that I want to take more classes for my associates they are going to figure that something is up. 

I think I just need some advice on what I should do. I don’t like my job, I want to do something else, possibly in accounting or business related, I’ve always been very business oriented. I’m 21, so I’m still young and can change my career path very easily. But I also need a full time job that pays decent to get by and pay for some of my classes.",08Apr2020,1

My parents have trusted me to be responsible enough to get my work done on time, and have even trusted me as far as letting me move my computer into my room. My mom receives weekly reports of what I do on my device, that aren't very accurate. It claims that I spent over 80 hours on my computer from April 1-7. That is rather accurate since I would turn on my computer when I woke up, and usually sit on it until I went to bed. The difference is, she's only focusing on the time on games and ignoring the time I spend doing schoolwork. 

Because of how much time I've spent on gaming, she wants me to actually spend time with my family, which neither my mom or stepdad enjoy. All they would do is play on their phones or their computers. My stepdad told me to read a book, which I've been doing for a school project. I'm on break, with nothing else to do, and they have a problem with this. Two of my other friends stay up late on their consoles and get up around noon. Their parents don't care. I understand that my mom cares about me and my health, and wants me to be able to have a good sleep schedule going back into school next week, but I can't handle the fact that she trusted me to be responsible, and all of a sudden has a problem with how I want to spend my free time.

818,"Hi, 

So yesterday me and my fiancé went to the hospital for what was meant to be one of the happiest days of our lives our 12 week baby scan, instead we walked into our living nightmare! With the whole country on lockdown due to covid-19 she had to go in alone whilst I sat in the car, after about 45mins I get a message saying that we are going to have terminate our baby. I quickly call her and she’s in bits so I said I’m coming, got to the ward and explained what is happening and they let me sit in a consultation room with her and the chief midwife. She tells us our baby has Acrania which is where the skull does not form around the brain, thus the brain being exposed. She gave us three options 1) have a second opinion scan. 2) carry on the pregnancy as normal (but nothing will change the skull won’t grow so baby will die within hours). 3) terminate our baby! 
We went home had a think and we go for a second opinion scan, today we had the scan with a consultant he confirmed what we got told yesterday Acrania which has a 100% mortality rate! 
We decide the best thing to do is terminate as much as that destroys us both! We know it’s the best thing to do.
FF to this evening and she now drops the bombshell that she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me whilst going through this she wants to be alone. 
So the advice I need is basically is she doing this through grievance ? Do I leave ? Do I stay ? I’m just so lost! As if the loss of our baby isn’t enough I’m about to lose my whole life! 

TL;DR me and fiancé have to terminate our baby due to Acrania, now she also wants to end the relationship what do I do ?",08Apr2020,3
820,"Hi please disregard the throwaway account, TL;DR included !

So I have been struggling with getting things done as soon as I get them assigned to me (mostly to do with university work) for the past 4 years, I am now graduated from my undergrad degree and now I am over half way through a Master's degree, yet in my 5 years of college I have still not learned how to do all the stuff on time and cram everything whilst still passing and doing decent on exams and assignments so I never learn from my mistakes even though I promise myself I will do assignment properly the next time.

I am usually really good with doing things that have a short deadline, for example at work things have to be done during the day that the task was given in, or even in college when we are given work in our research labs I am quite good at getting things done on time, its just that when I am out of college or work and have to work from home I run into the issue of being distracted, unmotivated and end up having zero willpower to do anything. I am not sure if this is some form of avoidance, but I end up doing small chores around the house instead of doing my assignments when I actually decide I need to do my assignments.

I don't know if I have an actual videogame addiction or if its just something I do instead of college work related stuff or I am actually in denial and I have an addiction to playing games and wasting time ( though I don't see it as time wasted because its fun ). So this whole videogame, internet, youtube, porn, reddit etc etc life cycle especially under quarantine might be the cause of this complete break in motivation but all those things could also have to do with me avoiding facing the real issue which I can't seem to pinpoint.

I always had a lot of practice being productive and good at academics at a young age but I think at this point my parents don't have the energy to push me anymore and I seem to have grown accustomed to the freedom (not their fault). So I am very stressed and now I have finally tried to ask for help even though I have been stubborn about asking people for help.

There are plenty more details that aren't necessarily coming to mind, so please feel free to ask me anything as this is a throwaway account and I can answer most things. Sorry if this is badly written I just got through a long cram for an assignment that was given 2 week ago.

823,"So, that’s my story. 
Hi, I’m 18. And I’m the worst daughter in the world. I know that parents can live through with any shit that there child do, but I hate myself about my living. 

It started in the high school (yep, standard story, fuck this). I was dating with someone guy (maybe a 1,5 years), who I loved with all of my heart, but he didn’t answer to me the same thing. “Okey” I said to me, and began move on that situation. 

One year later, I was still suffering by my ex. That was the summer before graduation. I was trying not to think about him, but I couldn’t, such a stupid girl. Finally, in the end of holidays, I met a guy (Daniel). We stared dating. I was feeling that I found someone who I can trust, he was like a bff for me, I really enjoyed that. For place where I’m living the virginity is tabulated theme. And so, I LOST IT, fuck that, but I was drunk with Daniel in the friend’s house. I didn’t vary worried and my loss, but I was feeling awful before my parents. They can not stand any relationships, why? I don’t know, my parents still thinking that I don’t have any idea what is sex...for me that was fail. 

Okey, I moved on. I was dating with Daniel for 10 months. That was the happiest months in my life. But I graduated and I must to live abroad. My parents DID’N ask me about moving, just said “U will live with ur grandparents in Saint-Petersburg”. I HATE THAT PLACE, I HATE EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH RUSSIA (I’m russian, but living in Kazakhstan). We broke up because of my college. 

“I move on again” - I was just thinking...
I was raped by random guy, who was a stalker. Every morning I went to college at 7:50. One of this mornings, I just went out, and that guy just grabbed me. He said that if I start scream, he kills me. He got me to his flat, there was nearby my house, and did that. I didn’t scream or cry, I was just laying. I said “I don’t want that, please, don’t do that to me, u r a good person” but he didn’t listen to me. 
No, I can’t move on. I have an emotional issue, I started drinking and smoking weed (I used to do it, but I was for fun, that was not for leaving the reality). I hate everything in that place: college, faculty, people (sorry russian, but I can’t understand u), city, flat with noisy grandparents. 
I didn’t choose my life. I was chosen by my father. He wanted me to be a doctor. I don’t want that. I wanted to be a writer. He never listened me. 

When I was in SPB, my mind was cursed, I had to go to the psychoanalyst. For 6 months, I visited Margaret, my doctor. She said that I have a deep depression. 

Now, because of virus, I came back to my family. I don’t know what to do with my fucking life. I’m just 18 years old, but perceive on 60. 

How to get over? I don’t wanna live. I need help.",08Apr2020,2
824,"So, I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

So I have this neighbor, let's call them D. I met D for the first time when I was walking back to my apartment and they were outside so I sparked a convo. We ended up getting along pretty well and I thought D was a cool guy. 

Then I started to feel that D was a little more eccentric for my taste. The first indecent was when we went out for dinner and he was being kind of rude to wait-staff, and he told our server, who was just trying to help, to ""back up"" and that they were ""in their space."" I thought that was a bit rude and could tell it made our server visibly uncomfortable. The second incident was getting a call from D while having my bf and friends over. The call consisted of D sounding a little distraught talking about how uncomfortable he was with his roommate having girls over because he could ""feel what they were doing"" and that he didn't feel comfortable hanging out with a friend because they gave D ""bad thoughts."" At that point, I was a little put-off by D but I brushed it off as he might have had too much to drink. 

D would also send me messages about having a rough day and I would always ask how can I help, or what can I do for you and I'd be met with him saying nasty things to me then apologizing in the morning because he wasn't ""thinking straight.""

I'm also a double major and I'm super busy, I'm hardly on my phone, and tbh I'm kind of a homebody. D isn't one of my closest friends so it's easy for me to forget to check-in regularly but I still make an attempt. D will send me back to back messages of ""hey"" until I respond. I'm talking like 6 hey's in a row. He'll also send really cryptic texts that I just simply can't respond to. 

My roommate and I are moving out in a couple of months and I was planning to just ghost him when I leave the complex but I feel like that's too mean, but I'm also kinda nervous about telling him that I don't want to be friends anymore because D is intense and intimidating and sometimes seems to be a little unhinged.

I’ve tried gathering mucus from the back of my throat and spitting while closing off my nasopharynx and still get blood. It does not come up from coughing either, so I am not coughing up blood.

832,"Long post warning. I appreciate any help. 

Firstly, I hope you all are staying safe in these surreal times. Day by day. 

So let me begin with a bit of background:
I (28F) recently (about two weeks ago) moved from having consuming roommates to my own spot, and a great place at that. I knew from the moment I toured the space that it would be wonderful to which is has exceeded my expectations. The only issue is my overly friendly neighbor (30F-32F?). 

The apartment is within a quadplex. I live on the second floor, while the neighbor I'm speaking about lives below me. When I first moved in, she was (not surprisingly) nice &amp; even helped to accept a delivery as I was out running an errand. Great, awesome - thank you. But then what came next was a little off. 

After I arrived back, she popped her head out of the entryway door, joking (semi?) that I owe her one. A shot of liq or something like that, I don't fully recall. But I shot back a 'yeah, maybe one of these days.' Next thing I know she's out the door, telling me about her life. I'm very personable but I do become a bit wary when strangers quickly open up to me. 

Anyways, later that night as I was unpacking my things, trying to get my life together after a tiring move, I receive a text from her asking if I needed help as 'it sounded like I was struggling up the stairs earlier.' Shot her a text back with a chuckle &amp; an 'it's all good, thanks though.' 

Then she replies with a 'are sure you don't need help? I could use some company anyway.' Maybe it was because I was tired but this was the first point where I felt quite weirded out. If I reply that I'm all set, what more is there to try for? 

After that happened I started keeping my distance. She texted me again late last week 'checking in' to see how I was settling in. Then voices some conspiracies about a COVID-19 hoax (which I have taken very seriously) and that's where the convo ended as I told her I'm all for the quarantine. 

But a few minutes ago was the real kicker. For the record, I love to help others when I can &amp; for those that I'm closest to, it's a no brainer. But I do not know this person at all, outside of the life drama she vented to me randomly.

I receive a text from her, asking if I'm working or out &amp; about. Shot back I'm working, and ask what's up. Then she tells me she had an accident and needs a ride home from the dealership. No ask, nada. Just that she *needs* a ride home. 

She told me prior that she has lived in this city for years, knows people, etc. So I know this isn't the issue. And I mean Uber? Honestly if it wasn't Coronavirus season (she was out and about earlier, hence the blowout) I may have. But something feels off... my gut is kicking me.

Again I don't know her outside of the 10 minutes she spent telling me about herself nor do I at this point want to know anything further. And not that this matters at all but she is fond of the lady folk - I'm not trying to make it that but it lowkey feels like that. 

Any insights would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading.

I only have a couple of other female friends, but I've never gotten close to them, so I felt as she was kinda special. Anyways, we got into a bit of an argument at the end of last year, and I just recently started talking to her.

Now, I haven't done shit with my life in these past months, but she's been much busier and has been in multiple relationships. I wasn't too surprised I guess, but supposedly she started talking about one guy, who I guess she must've gotten really close with, and yea... supposedly it's a FwB sort of thing, but I feel kinda hurt/sick thinking about it (don't mean to sound like an incel lol).

I understand that we aren't kids anymore, but I feel like I'm getting left behind. Everyone is out here adulting while I'm just here. I do think that I could definitely get a girlfriend and do the same, but I feel like I'd be doing it because of social pressure, and not because I actually love someone.

I don't think I would feel the same way with a guy friend if I'm being honest. I don't know what to do. We still get along well together, but I just feel more lonely now, as she's become more mature in a sense. She's the same person personality-wise, but for reason knowing this makes me feel like she's a completely different person.

I feel wrong for thinking this way, and I know it's not right. I don't want to become like a simp (hate the word, but lack of a better word) who sits around listening to their friend get action while I'm like the friend she goes to when she's bored, but I don't want to be some incel type figure who's pissed that (nearly) adult women fuck.

837,"Hi! 

So I was hoping someone would help my friend and I with her current situation. It concerns her family, specifically her dad. So once a week her dad gets together with his co-workers to play floor-ball. Today when he went home, he discovered that he had 8 gun sockets in his bag which he didn’t have before. He texted the group chat with his co-workers, only one other  of his co-workers had also found 8 gun sockets in his bag. All the co-worker’s responded to his texts except for one person. There are 8 people in her dad’s work department, which is why we believe there are 8 guns sockets

We were wondering, how you guys would interpret this and what they should do? Her dad’s plan is, to go to his boss and talk about this and contacting the police tomorrow.

838,"Tl;dr university residence is $9,990/school year. Is it worth it to take on the debt for $1300/month living expenses or should I try to get a job and make it on my own? 

So, I live in Nova Scotia. I'm going to be attending university in the Halifax area, which is one of the highest cost of living places in Canada (top 3). 1% rental vacancy. Average cost of $1,113. Canadian dollars for all of this of course.

I have a few friends attending universities in the area and one had just offered that if they find a room if I'd like to room with them. Nothing is set in stone -- but it's the principal of the question I'd like to consider. 

I'm going to be in my first year of university, moving to an area that I will need to get a job in. I need to buy a used car before I go, which will take a total in the ballpark of $2,500 out of my pocket. Currently I have $2,400 in savings and am working part-time until the end of August. On average, I make $230-$430 per paycheque. Minimum wage is $12.55/hr.

With all of these expenses and numbers in consideration, university is $9,990 for a dorm, meal plan, etc. Would it be worth it to try to make it on my own? I keep hearing about people talking about the ""university experience"". Meanwhile I, the anxiety medicated introvert-extrovert transgender communist gamer girl, don't really feel equipped to make any friends. I'm mostly hoping that the half-dozen friends I've made so far in the area will be cool hanging out once a month or something. I don't know if there'd be any benefit to this ""university experience"". I just want my degree. I also DO NOT WANT TO MOVE HOME IN THE SUMMER. AT ALL. I'm from a village with less than 700 people, my mother is a bipolar neurotic mess and I cannot cope with living with her anymore and, with my transitional history, everyone knows who I WAS here and I don't feel comfortable with that at all.

Should I consider apartment/roommate searching or is the cost for uni actually good comparatively? Would it be worth it to try to get a job and live off campus or take the guarantee and suffer through the summer(s)?",08Apr2020,1
839,"So im gonna get straight into this... i very much dont like my dad. 
REASON ONE;baseball: im forced to play....i very much dont like the sport and its just not my thing but i have to play my dad forces me to play and it really sucks. He doesnt make it fun because every time i mess up he gets super pissed and screams at me like screams and i cant do anything about it. Or else he says “do you want to die... say it one for time i swear to god ill beat the s*** out of you”   And keeps going. I can remember one time i messed up, he screamed, i talked back “stop im trying!” And he got so pissed he started chucking the baseballs at me and doesnt stop until i finally hide in the back yard where he cant see me... while my mom watches the entire thing. But baseball games... suck... cause lets say i miss the ball he gets so mad saying “ YOURE AN EMBARRASSING TO THE WHOLE FAMILY” while i cry in the back of the car. No.... sob... this has been going on since i was 7... im 12 now and nothing has changed. There are tons of more stories but thats just one. Oh and did i mention that i had baseball and i want to quit. Oh well yeah he knows i hate the sport but simply doesnt care what i like or not
REASON TWO;scaring me: i once woke up to this psychopath screaming at me giving me a lecture “YOU SHOULD BE SCARED OF ME” this isnt a really big reason but he believes that i am nothing more to him then a puppet
REASON THREE;dance: look i love dance and acting however he doesnt care ive had countless recitals and shows that he says “why would i want to go to those *laughs* youre not that good anyways” ive had many many lead roles and have gone to more than a few broadway autions that ive gotten callbacks to. 
REASON FOUR;my mental health: this man has single handedly ruined my mental heath by calling me fat, pig,idiot,piece of s***, daily, no more like hourly...and has called me names much much worse that im not allowed to say here i now have such a low self esteem thats its just a joke now.. that ontop of the drama of middle school (im 13 btw) is just too much and have pulled chunks of hair out of my head from stress. And ive tried going to the school therapist until my dad found out and started making fun of me for it
REASON FIVE ; last reason; favorites: i have a younger sister one year younger that has never experienced any of this and my dad defends her when my mom gets mad at her for smaking me so hard in the face that ive had a hand print there for three days  if my sister screams my dad immediately runs to where i am and beats the s*** out of me even tho she stubbed her toe
FINAL; im sorry for making this so long but i cant wait to move out cause i hate this guy so so so much. Please tell me what i should do with this i just want things to get better thank you so much for reading. Sorry for spelling errors im typing fast.

840," 
 I am currently a Masters's student in Engineering and due to family problems and anxiety issues that I kept bottling up have reached a point that it has blown up in my face. I've become too anxious that I've performed poorly of the majority of my courses in the foreign country I am studying in (Germany) and I am now in a deep state of panic of what will I do for future job prospects. I come from a developing country where there are not many opportunities for Engineers (basically any highly educated profession mostly pack up and leave to Western/developed countries).  

Now, I have a deep-seated fear that after graduating I might not be able to secure a job here and end up back in my home country, with no prospects at all. I was a good student as I was performing well initially but the anxiety and family problems have really messed up with my mental health and my academic performance.

I am at a complete loss what to do, I can't sleep, I can no longer concentrate on even doing the simplest of tasks (writing this down is taking a lot of effort). I just feel like this is an enormous hurdle to tackle and there doesn't look like a way out of this ditch I am",08Apr2020,2
841,"I know I sound clingy in this, but I’m talking about someone that was my best friend.

So I met this girl freshman year and we became best buds, right?  Well she moved to another county but we were still able to text and keep up.  And we did keep in contact a lot for most of sophomore year.  But the beginning of junior year I  took extra classes (more credits = easier senior year) so I wasn’t able to have that much of a social life at all, including texting people.  

The first time I felt like I was losing her was when I had all my classes done so I was like “I’m gonna check up on my girl” so that’s when I checked up on her but she didn’t reply like she usually does. I asked how she was doing and she just went “good”. No I don’t need people to ask how I’m doing in return, but when it’s someone who usually does, it’s odd when they don’t.  And all of her answers were short and I even asked, like what’s up, you seem short with me.  She said she was just tired and then every sentence that came after that she added a ! and maybe it’s just me being sensitive and paranoid but I felt like she she was mocking me when she was doing that because again, she has  never done that before (texting all perky like).  

And in my mind I was like, okay, maybe we’ve just grown apart and we should hang out one last time either to repair or find out what our friendship has become.  So I asked her, can we hang out and she said “Sorry! But I’m busy!”  And then I said oh maybe next week and then she said “Oh, I would but unfortunately I’m booked every week this month!  I’m so sorry!” 

I concluded this:  She’s  mad at me (duh ik) and maybe  it was because I was always busy.  And it would make more sense to me if I replied to her in that same “sorry!” type of way and I always blew her off but we didn’t talk at all.  Like no words said. Maybe she’s mad because she thought I would only talk to her when it’s convenient for me, but she never tried to talk to me during this.  No I’m not trying to tell you a story of “i did this but you did this”.  That game leads no where.  I want someone else’s perspective so I know what I did wrong and what to ask her or if I even should.  I don’t want to keep messaging someone that’s mad at me, because I’m not trying to piss her off more.  I want to know if I should just leave her alone for good. Or at least say something first.  

I messaged her again when lockdown started and All I did was say hi, but it was the same thing.  Short answers.  What do I do? I don’t think I can ask her specifically what I did because I have a feeling she going to pull the “I’m just tired” and use the ! to show she’s “not” mad.

851,"So basically I’m a Media and Communications double major and I was at a good university my freshman year that was away from home. However I became unmotivated (despite having above a 3.0) and with not being fully happy I decided to withdraw after my first year and come home to Los Angeles. When I first got back home, I was going to CC for Media and on the track to transfer to a university while having a production internship and PA freelance gig. However things became more complicated and it has now been two years since I’ve been back in LA and I know find myself working 40 hours a week at a dead end job due to family moving away and living on my own, struggling in school (my CC transcript is full of Fs and Ws and I’m now at a 2.0),I lost my financial aid, and have not worked in the industry for two years. 

With my current GPA and transcripts I’m worried that my future of transferring to a  university is bleak. I’m basically almost done with most transfer requirements but do need to retake some courses. Staying in LA means getting any type of degree may take years longer than I hoped for. And being a double major after transferring could be an issue. 

However, looking at the classes I have passed at CC, I have basically finished most  of my GE and Pre-Major stuff for my former university. And since I withdrew I can apply for readmission and more than likely be welcomed back. There, my financial aid covers rent and my other bills (however in loans) but it allows me to fully focus on school. I also have a better chance at double majoring in Comm and Media which is something I really want. But if I go there I essentially have to give up everything and move there as I would no longer have a home in LA, making summer and internships harder. 

So my question is, do I stay in LA, try and turn around my grades/life here and transfer or do I go back to my former university and finish what I started?",08Apr2020,1

857,"Hi! I’m a girl in my mid/late 20s and got engaged to my bf of several years a couple months ago. We live together near where he grew up and we spend a lot of time with his 3 best friends (all boys) from growing up and I’ve gotten really close with them over the last year or so. it's become a tight 5 person crew where I'm the only girl. One of them has a pool and we use it a lot, and there have been a couple times late at night after a lot of drinking where we didn’t have bathing suits and skinny dipped in the dark. 

Quick step back - I LOVE my fiancé, we have an amazing relationship and he treats me incredibly well. He’s by his own admission has always been really turned on by seeing me in minimal clothes in front of other people. In the past I wasn't willing to do much but once we got engaged I have for some reason have been much more into the idea. I've recently gone topless at the beach (only in front of him and strangers) and wore tiny thong bikinis, or walk around in my underwear in front of other guys when I probably shouldn’t have. Honestly it’s been really fun! I love the look on his face when he watches me and surprisingly it’s been exciting for me too, and the ring gives me a sense of security I didn’t have before. Also I've always been confident in my body but these experiences have given me a new level of confidence. And his friends have became the best guy friends I’ve had, they’re all cute and funny and have been incredibly nice to me, I trust them a lot. He’s openly told me that the first couple times we skinny dipped with his friends it was really exciting for him, but I knew it had always been really dark outside and none of them really saw too much. A few months ago the idea of swimming naked with four guys in the dark didn’t feel like something I would ever do but I feel totally different about it now because I really trust them. Then I had this crazy idea that I never thought I would actually follow through on...but a few weeks ago we were back at that house after drinking a lot and decided to swim again. We were all naked in the dark, when we were done everyone put their clothes back on but I didn’t and just started walking behind them to the house...still naked. At first only my fiancé noticed bc the others were ahead, and he looked at me like I had three heads. I asked him if he would mind if I kept my clothes off, and he paused for a second but then said he didn’t mind if I wanted to. So I walked into the house behind these boys BUTT ASS NAKED and when they turned around they at first were like woah! But after a few mins things kinda went back to normal aside from a lot of staring and some jokey compliments :) which I was not expecting lol But I was glad they were cool about it they actually handled it pretty well. The look on my fiancé’s face was totally priceless like he was so excited but kinda acting mad about it but we both knew it was an act. I hung out with them wearing literally nothing but flip flops and my engagement ring lol in a fully lighted room for like 20 mins and honestly it was one of the most exciting things I’ve ever done. My heart was pounding. I had never even been close to being naked in front of a group of boys like that...and there I was... But it was so much fun honestly. When I walked away down the hall my fiancé chased me into the room and we had the best sex of my life.

The next morning he showed me pictures he took and I was mortified, like my vagina was so exposed I felt like a huge slut but the boys have treated me like a sister ever since. They are so nice to me and protective of me, I feel 10x closer with them, plus my relationship is better than ever. So I’m kinda into it now...

Given the current quarantine I haven’t had a reason to get naked in front of them since but I don’t see a reason why I wouldn’t do it again. My girl friends think I’m crazy and I realize it’s crazy but it was seriously very very fun. Hope I’m not insane!

Let's try to organize everything shall we?

Boyfriend (M, 21)
- has a heart condition and is blind in one eye
- also has PTSD 
- has a controlling, over-critical mother who MUST always have the last say

Me (F, 22)
- diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and some other stuff
- deep insecurities and self-loathing
- currently having family problems atm

Problem:
I have no idea how to help my boyfriend of 3 years. From the beginning, we knew that we had our own issues, but we always managed to pull through. 

My BF's heart condition has gotten worse (his angina turned unstable) largely due to stress. His mom treats him like a child (refuses to let him do stuff because she claims he can't do it properly) and guilt trips him for not having a job (he recently resigned because his previous company basically overworked him). 

It's gotten to a point where his self-confidence has worn down. She even goes to the point wherein she says he should stop being passionate about his dreams and that he's wasting his time, he's sick and because of that, he shouldn't dream big. And that he doesn't have any potential.

Now, let me just brag about my boyfriend right now. He has an IQ of at least 160+. He loves writing papers and doing research. He dreams of being a Forensic Scientist. He has a brilliant mind that doesn't stop until he's truly understood what he's studying. 

Before, he didn't let any of his conditions hold him back. He wanted to prove to himself that he could do the things he wanted despite everything. 

But because of the quarantine, he's forced to spend a lot of time with his mom, who takes out her stress on him. He just takes it because he doesn't want any problems. (By the way, his mom tended to get physical when he was a kid).
The way I see it, she's projecting a lot on him (she's a cancer survivor as well).

As a result, he's getting depressed. We don't talk much, it often turns sour when we do. We clash and hurt each other most of the time.

I feel helpless. I tried what I used to do - encourage him, distract him, etc. I know it's no excuse, but I regret that sometimes my own mental illness gets the better of me. I try to calm down and soothe him, try to see things in his perspective, but I become impatient and snap at him most of the time. That or I become overwhelmed with helplessness and cry myself to sleep.

At the moment, I'm a whole slew of issues (grandmother just died, anxiety and bad sleep cycles, etc).

I know love is supposed to overcome struggles, I love him, I really do, but I'm not able to give him comfort when I don't have it myself. I know it's a selfish way to think, but I just can't. 

Treatment's not an option for both of us right now. Our country's healthcare system (especially for mental illness) is shaky at the best.

I'm asking help on how to help myself and my boyfriend in this time of crisis. I feel like nothing's working and I'm at a loss. Sorry if this is too long and disorganized, I typed this in lieu of sleeping.

Tldr; BF and I are both sick, idk how to help him without making things worse.",08Apr2020,3
860,"I apologize for any spelling mistakes. I have also marked this NSFW due to any references to sexual assault.

TL;DR I was the only White person at a party of 8 people. One of the guys there went into the bathroom with me, after me asking him why he was in there and tried to pull my pants down and then tried to look down my underwear. My friend doesn’t believe me and thinks I’m being shitty because me making a false claim can get a black man imprisoned/murdered. But I know what happened to me and believe that he did harass me. 

Around Christmas time, I went to a party that my friend invited me to. When I say party, it was 8 of us in total. I’m a lightweight but liquor has never affected my ability to remember things and I have never blacked out from liquor/beer. Wine is the only alcohol that messes me up. There was a guy there that clearly liked me. I’m going to call him Tom (not his real name). He hugged me as soon as we met, asked me for my phone number and snap. I didn’t really think he was that cute. He was nice, but that was about it. Fast forward a couple hours, I was hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend and I said that I had to pee. Tom said he would go with me, to show me the bathroom because I didn’t know where it was. He then started walking into the bathroom with me and I asked him, “why are you coming in here with me?” I can’t remember his exact response but I was drunk and I don’t know how to say no even when I’m sober, so I let him in the bathroom. I was very uncomfortable. He sat down on the side of the bathtub and tried to pull my pants down. I pulled them down myself because I had to use the bathroom. Then, he tried to look down my underwear. I will never ever forget his face and his hands touching my body for the rest of my life. I told him to stop. He did stop, thank God. In retrospect I could have been assaulted very badly. What he did to me went over my head that night, although I did text my close friend about it because I wasn’t sure if what happened to me was wrong or not. I didn’t tell my friend that night because I didn’t want to ruin her fun or make a big deal out of something without thinking it over.

I told the friend I was partying with what happened the morning after. She laughed at me, said that he wouldn’t do that to me. She’s known him since 1st grade, why would he do that to me? I was hurt but I let it go—we don’t talk that much. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my friend brought up what happened and I told her that I knew she didn’t believe me. She laughs at me again and I sat there and I said it’s not funny. He harassed me. She said she wouldn’t call that harassment. She said I asked him to go to the bathroom with me (whether I did or not, I don’t think it warrants pulling my pants down). I asked if she believed my story or not, she wouldn’t answer. 

Here’s the dilemma: everyone at the party was black. I was the one white person. She’s upset because black men get murdered/incarcerated for crimes in which they’re innocent. I understand that completely. Many times white people make up stories about black people to get them arrested. However, I would never ever lie about what happened to me to get an innocent person in prison. I believe what happened to me is 100% the truth and I can see what happened to me in my head. It replays over and over. I don’t plan on pressing charges. I don’t want an apology. But my own friend doesn’t believe I’m telling the truth. She says that she told Tom what happened and he was “scared shitless.” She was scared of what was going to happen to him. But, am I not the victim? She excused his behavior and what happened to me in defense of him.

Am I being an asshole for not apologizing to her? Is what happened to me valid and considered assault?",08Apr2020,1
862,"A relative of mine and her husband are both in the severe stage of covid19. 

They are both nurses and they have a daughter aged 12 who they’ve been trying to isolate as so far she isn’t showing signs too. 

They have asked today if we could take their daughter in as they believe he (the husband) is going soon and she (my relative) is only a few days behind him if that but they felt the need to ask us now alas they have no other family / relatives over here in the UK. 

I guess we will effectively become the legal guardian.

My wife and I do have 3 kids. All 5 and under as we wanted them close together. Everyday is a learning day. How can we, should the worse happens incorporate the 12 year old into the lives of our children? All I remember from that age is being a pain, wanting x y z and getting worse through my teens till I “grew up”. 

Financially we are aren’t starving and at same time, not rolling in it. I’m the sole earner with the wife looking after our 2nd child which has a life long disability. I think we will be ok with the addition, but worried that I haven’t thought of everything that’s needed to take care of them and be able to provide what they need. 

I don’t really know where to start besides I know I can convert my home office into a bedroom and would need to buy furnishings. I can try and get a shed outside to do my work in. 

What do we need to do when it comes to the legal guardian side? Do we need paper work before hand? 

How can we prepare for the worse case scenario.

864,"Hi there. I’m stuck in a pickle. My boyfriend and I currently live another couple. The boyfriend of the couple has been best friends with my boyfriend since childhood (they are 36 now). When I moved in with everyone, I was told multiple times that the lease ended in the end of June. With that information, I set up a condo for my boyfriend and I to move in together starting June 1st. We understood that we would pay double rent and we were okay with it for ONLY 1 MONTH. The owner of the condo is my friends grandmother who was kindly enough to hold the place (RENT FREE) for us with our security deposit for 5 months, as she has the property paid off, 5 additional properties that are generating her income &amp; wants reliable renters. 

HOWEVER. When setting up the lease agreement i was told by the other couple that the lease of the current place we live at ends the end of July. My boyfriend admits he told me misinformation, but I know he got that misinformation from the other couple. I feel a little bamboozled at the moment. But two things


1. With the already really generous act do we just bite the bullet and pay two months of double rent. I am extremely blessed that I work two jobs at the moment.

2. Do I hold the other couple accountable for telling us misinformation

3. If the answer is to ask for an extension. Do I make my boyfriend do it? I feel like I’ve done a lot to coordinate this and he should have to call our landlord based on his misguidance.

4. If we do ask, how do I ask expressing sincerity and assuring the landlord that it’s only another month and expressing how stupid I feel too.

I met her 6 years ago at school, for someone shy as me I gladly can remember how easy to me were talked with her since day one, having someone who I can talk for hours without feel the time, was pure magic.

Of course, I quickly found myself in love of her, at first I tought that she only saw me as his friend and I convince myself that being his friend was just enough. Then three years passed, it was time to graduate and go to the uni, I remember being afraid, not only by my future buy mainly because this meant not see her every day again.

A week before our graduation, something happened, she sent me a long letter were she confessed me her love for me, she was giving up about me, believing that I didn't feel the same, so I ask her out, and I just couldn't do it, at that time I felt that she deserve more, so I wasted my opportunity with her.

After that we never losed contact, I still asking her out, talking via message, etc... Of course we had our ups and downs, but we found the way to stick together, even when our paths are no longer to tied because school and other responsibilities. About love she had a pair of relationships in the past years, that hurt me (lol), you know that phrase that says ""you don't know what you got till it's gone""?

But this actually don't have a sad ending, across this years she often hinted on me, that she still have feelings for me, until a month ago she kissed me and everything finally started.

So, returning to the question of the post, what really means being with someone in that way? Beyond the sexual part of course, cause in a way it feels like nothing has changed beyond that we are happy to not having to pretend anymore, to finally kiss each other, etc...

871,"I'm (F19) a varsity athlete at my university, and after the quarantine's been announced I've taken to working out in my backyard. It's really nice to do since the weather's been pretty great lately, and I live in a really small house so it's the largest open space I've got.

However, for the past week and a half, my neighbours love to come out and watch me workout, making commentary about my form, my figure and kind of just catcalling me in general.

They can easily see me and (the entirety of my backyard) from their newly built deck, that's about 7 feet above the ground. Keep in mind the fence is only about 6'4.

It's gotten to the point where even headphones and loud music can't always drown them out, and I'm really not sure what to do.

I've told them to stop, but the most that's resulted in is for them to stop talking and just stare at me for the duration of my workout. 

I've thought about putting up a privacy fence, but by city (Hamilton, Ontario) guidelines, the largest I can build my fence is 6'6, which isn't really that much of a difference in this situation.

Okay so... I know I’m young, I know I’m still figuring things out, but I genuinely have no clear path in life. I am a university student, and I am studying graphic design. I go to school about 8 hours from home, in a small town with not much there. All my family is at least 4 hours from me, and I have no interest in staying in my college’s town or even nearby after I graduate in 2022.

I have some passion for graphic design, but it’s clear I am not at all up to par with my peers in terms of ‘passion’. It’s always been just school to me, I have never taken interest outside of school for graphic design. Sure, I appreciate it, but I’d never do it for fun or personal joy. Which then makes me think I’m not even cut out to be in the industry, if I don’t hold that personal drive for it.

I really have no interest in any other field, though, so I’ll have to utilize my degree somehow. Okay, fine, but where? How? I don’t have interest in leaving my state, I don’t have a ‘dream job’ or even any kind of job I’m after, &amp; I don’t have any plan for after graduation.

I don’t have a boyfriend, and I genuinely do not foresee myself finding one at any point in the near future. All my friends have a boyfriend, and at least have loose plans to settle down with down with them in a living arrangement after college.

873,"Edit; 21 y/o. Southern USA

Backstory; me and my family have never had a dog or cat. One parent is pretty allergic to both (not enough to need medicine or EpiPen or anything) but enough they would be uncomfortable living with pets. 

We grew up without anything but that's ok!! Love my parents (as much as we joked about getting a dog and renting a separate apartment as a kid 😜) 

I live at home, but we have a 'mother in law suite' in the backyard. I have my own little house there, totally separate building from the main house where my parents live. I've lived here for a couple years, as I attend a nearby university, and will be here for a couple more years. My sibling is also home from college because of Corona, and is staying at the parents house until next semester starts back up. 


Here's the question, I haven't really thought about getting any pet before, but I do have my entire house to myself. Financially stable to afford one / care for it / food, etc. And recently have been thinking about adopting something. A dog or a cat. 


Here's the problem though; I am a full time student. And an architecture student... If you don't know any architecture friends from university, it's because of how much work our degree is. I wake up at 7 every day and work at school until 9 or 10pm most nights of the week. On a bad week of assignments, I get home usually around 2 or 3am every day of the week. This is the main reason I haven't gotten a pet before, because it's my responsibility (I'm not making my dad come over daily to feed it or something) and I'm scared I won't be home enough to care for a pet! 


So my question is; are there pets not social enough to do ok in this living enviornment?? I know cats are really good at caring for themselves, but I assume I am not home enough to keep a pet healthy? What do you recommend? Are there any animals adequate to live ok with me? 


I'm not desperate for a pet, but could use a companion some long nights of homework or especially through this Corona and all. I would 100% be willing to work less at school, but I would still be out of the house 50 or 60 hours a week minimum. Is this a deal breaker? Do I have any options? Or should I forget about a pet for now

876,"Hi, 

I hope you all and your relatives are staying healthy during these trying times. I'm 19M and struggling to handle my parents at home during quarantine (or rather, they're struggling to handle each other) and I need advice on how to act or help them. I'm very scared of a rupture between them as my stepdad is the main provider at my home. 

Here is some background. My parents are lower-middle class living paycheck to paycheck. My stepdad is the main provider, bringing in about 90% of our home income, and my mom has been with him for over 10 years after getting divorced from my dad. They don't struggle to put food on the table, but times have been tight for a while and we have to move to a 1-bedroom apartment next week because they can't pay our current rent anymore. They have debt and don't own a home. I attend college out of state, blessed by a full ride at an excellent school, which they are very proud of.

The university sent us home for the current quarter and is conducting all classes online, which means I have to work from home. However, it's a bit difficult when my parents keep fighting. I don't remember them fighting this much when I was in high school and I'm a bit scared about what could happen if this continues. Ever since quarantine started, my mom has been extremely anxious to the point where she doesn't listen to reason. She doesn't let us leave the house for any reason, not even to ride bike, see our family (who all live 5 minutes away and constantly see each other), exercise, etc., even stockpiling on food to avoid going to the grocery store. Hell, she doesn't even let us walk in the house with socks, insisting that we wear slides because we could ""catch the virus from the floor."" When either me or my stepdad suggest anything, she gets very anxious and starts screaming at the top of her lungs. I've never seen my mom like this. Even the smallest things turn into an argument. For example: Just this morning, I received a package containing a jacket that I ordered 3 weeks ago with my work-study money. When my mom saw the package, she started screaming outside in front of the whole neighborhood because she thought we would all get infected from the postman. My stepdad then tried to tell her to calm down and it turned into a huge argument between them. Another example: Yesterday, my mom and my stepdad started fighting because our microwave handle broke and she got stressed that our landlady would charge us for it when we move out, even though it was an easy manual fix. Little insignificant things like these happen 5-10 times a day, provoking unnecessary arguments between my mom and my stepdad. 

This has been going on for 3 weeks. I'm in sophomore year, taking difficult classes, and it's so difficult to even think about school when there's shouting every 2 hours at my house. But above all else, I'm worried that this quarantine is going to cause a rupture between the two of them. If this happens, my mom will likely get very depressed and be in financial ruin. She doesn't have a job. We'll have to go live at my aunt's and I'm even scared that she could have a heart attack in the near future. My stepdad constantly complains about the way my mom screams, and my mom always yells about how my stepdad shouldn't ""lecture her."" 

In addition to stress caused by COVID-19, I just can't handle the stress from school along with the stress from home. I've been suffering from some substance withdrawals (which my parents don't know about) and have pretty heavy anxiety since November 2019 as well, and I'm trying my best not to break during this situation. I want to go back to campus and self-quarantine there to get away from all of this and concentrate on school but when I suggested that, my mom completely lost it and we had a huge fight. My stepdad said that if things keep going like this, he doesn't know what he'll do, which was terrifying to hear. How can I make this better for them? How can I prevent them from getting irrationally mad about insignificant things? It feels like a long time since we went a day without arguing. How can I prevent arguments from spiraling out of control between the two, like they always do?

Again, I hope everybody is staying healthy. I recognize that people are having bigger problems than this during these times but this is really affecting my performance in school and it's so unsustainable it makes me scared.",08Apr2020,1

When I had a therapist I told her and she told me that it is something I could report to Child Service but she also said the noises are something that can't be helped.

I talked to my mom about it before and it ended up as her playing the victim card, acting like I am trying to ruin her and my dad's marriage.

Idk where to begin but I reckon this is probably at least help get my thoughts in order so I guess I'll go through one thing at a time.

So it's just hit me that I'll probably never properly perform on stage again. I'm in year ten rn and by the looks of it, the school production won't be happening in October, we were supposed to start it right about now. I did ballet for about a decade until my chronic pain stopped me from enjoying it, and to be honest I really miss it. I used to do competitive gymnastics as well, but again I had to stop due to pain. Writing about it now makes me realise I miss it so much. Even before I completely quit, I missed competing. I miss the adrenaline and the butterflies in my stomach. I miss standing on the podium and feeling *good* about myself and my abilities. But now those abilities have all gone.

I suppose this ties into another thing that's bothering me. I'm really scared of getting fat. I'm even more scared of getting an eating disorder. But I keep sucking my stomach in because it's not flat anymore and weighing myself. Well I guess it's to be expected that I won't be in as good shape as I'm getting pretty much no exercise, but I don't think I'm gaining weight. I'm pretty consistently at 50-52kg and I know that's perfectly healthy. I try not to weigh myself that often, but I keep doing it more and more and I'm really scared of getting obsessed.

Another thing bothering me is my future. I'm so fucking scared for my future. I know what I want to do, but I feel embarrassed so I don't really tell anyone the truth. I tell people I want to be a therapist, which isn't wrong I think. I do like helping people, and I think the way our brains work is really interesting, but I don't want to do that my whole life. I want to be on stage. I want to sing. I want to be famous and I know that's really selfish but I can't help it. I want people to look up to me and admire me. It's never going to happen though. And I need to accept that, but I can't. I feel embarrassed by my dreams. Perhaps even more embarrassing is that I want to go into the kpop industry and be an idol. I don't tell anyone this because I'm not Asian so I'll just get called a Koreaboo. But, as brutal as it is, I see why the industry is successful. They take potential and turn it into talent, and I want to be a part of that. But I'll never be and I need to accept that. But I can't and thats a problem.

 I'm not really sure where this post was going, but here we are I guess. Well this is an advice subreddit, so I guess this is me asking for advice?

Since then he walked by my bedroom window (I have the bottom floor) and noticed I was taking a nap. He asked me if I wanted McDoubles from McDonalds. Imagine a homeless looking man looking into your window and waking you up from sleep. 

A few days later he was pounding on my bedroom window late at night because he locked himself out so I unlocked he back door and told him to retrace his steps. 

The next day he knocked on my bedroom window again (while looking in the blinds) to tell he was grateful for me telling him to retrace his steps and how god loved me for helping him. I said that was great he found his keys and told him to stop knocking on my windows and he fucking lost it. 

Since then he's been harassing me. He will hover outside of whatever part of the house he thinks I'm in and deliver a sermon and sing hymns. He also talks about my dead body and how I'll find grace when I'm ""cold""

The cops have been called to the house 5 times in the last 3 days but they can't do much right now. My landlord is aware and is working on getting him to a different property.

898,"Throwaway here. (Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile)

Some time ago, I enrolled into a new school, tiny, only ~200 students total, and in September, I fell in love with this girl. I still do. She's emotionally sensitive and has an enormous amount of pressure around her, whether its from family or for herself, and has very little self-confidence and refuses to show it to anyone, at least in person. She has had several breakdowns in the past from pressure and gone to counseling. (I don't think has gone for some time, however)

She discovered I love her through a classmate who pressured me into the conversation (although I didn't love her at the time, only referring her as the one if I had to choose) and I think that made an impact on how she perceives me as a friend and I think she feels uncomfortable talking about these topics.

Despite that, we have become friends and we talk somewhat within our small friend group of 4 people, and there she (I believe) feels safe enough to talk about her insecurities. Even when she's talking about things like her mental state and how she feels, she tries to keep a lightheartedness to how she portrays it like it's no big deal.

A few months back, she texted me she wanted me to stop talking to her all of a sudden, and that I made her feel insecure about herself (I don't know what makes her feel this way, only guess is that I maintain my positivity and carefree nature) and that if I could stop talking to her. I stopped, but we stayed in the same friend group as if nothing happened for the two others.

Our relationship as friends has slowly healed as she started talking to me more again and we've begun talking to each other normally again. Now, since the quarantine came out, I've noticed it has really affected her. 

Apparently, one of her close friends family has caught the Virus and as far as I can tell, taken a toll on her mental health. I've noticed she talks differently and tries harder/more desperately to sound casual. She tells us (Our small friend group) that in our recent Zoom calls, she responded to the question of ""how we were doing in Quarantine"" by saying she felt Lonely, and in reality she felt depressed at the thought that she didn't have close friends and instead simply just ""talks to everyone"". 

I have tried asking her if she was doing okay and if she wanted to talk about it. She has only said yes to the former. Ever since she told me I made her insecure, I have been holding back on talking to her and I don't want to push the conversation. What should I do?

TLDR: Friend of several months I am in love is insecure and after some time asks me to stop talking to her- friendship mends but quarantine put more pressure on her and she is unstable with her friend being infected",08Apr2020,1

906,"So to give some background, me and the ex have been friends since freshman year of college. She went through a rough time where she was cheated on multiple times incl when she was in the hospital for a suicide attempt(she has BPD in addition to a history of severe depression). Fast forward to this year and we moved in together as roommates with two of my friends, about a month in we started dating as we've had a mutual crush but the timing never worked out before.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately she cheated on me with her ex that cheated on her. Idiot that I am I eventually agreed to try again in part because the living situation would suck if we werent together. One of the reasons it sucks is because she is very attractive and has been on several tinder dates in the last few days since we split again after she cheated again. We have another four months left on our lease and its going to be a very shitty situation living together, in general living with an ex who cheated on me, and especially since I'm going to have to see her move on (she hasnt brought anyone here yet at least). I think due in part to the BPD she alternates between coming to me crying about how sorry she is for ruining it and how shes never had a bf she wanted to have a future with so badly and being openly toxic and essentially flaunting her new people and seemingly being proud that she cheated because she thinks its 'empowering' after she had to go through with it. So its just a volatile toxic situation

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this really sucks for me and I dont want us to live together anymore, we are all on the lease but I am the point of contact with the landlord and he really likes me so me and my other two friends will be renewing the lease for next year. Since we live with my friends and I am going to be in this spot long term I do not want to be the one to move out, but my ex is refusing to do so until the lease is up and since she is on the lease I don't think think there is anyway to make her do so unless she wants to. She's unemployed and not in a good financial spot and that is part of why she doesnt want to leave since finding a subleaser may be hard (also its her fave living situation so far in college but she doesnt get it wont be going forward since everyone else isnt really going to be friendly, not that I'm forcing my friends to pick sides but they arent going to like someone who cheated on their friend) and I am considering literally paying her to move out. My other option is to try and find a friend to switch living situations with me for a few months but I dont know how likely that is.

907,"         I manage a fairly tight working space. We do aircraft maintenance so I have a few mechanics spread throughout 2 good sized hangars, and 2 office workers in a really small working area next to my office. The whole office interacts a lot with each other, it pretty much has to. And we do airplanes for flight schools. But we do have employees constantly thoroughly disinfecting the planes. So I doubt that anyone would get it from the airplanes, but I suppose it is possible.
         We’re not a large company so we don’t have a lot of money we can just offer to sick employees, but we’re pretty much forced to and we don’t want to be one of those evil corporations during a time like this. And 3 employees over at corporate are already taking 2 weeks off to self quarantine because of how scared they are, and it’s been creating a pretty big domino effect in the company. More and more people are wanting to or already demanding paid time off, and we can’t really afford that.
            Our most important office worker is older, not elderly but nearing 60’s. But the big problem is she is an alcoholic and a smoker, so she is really vulnerable. And I don’t think she has the virus, neither does she but she has an on and off fever every three or four days. Based on other things she described it doesn’t sound like the virus but just to be safe we made her get tested. All of our other workers are healthy, middle aged men with no super young kids except for an older one in his 60’s who’s wife has health issues. Corporate told me not to tell anyone she’s getting tested, but I feel like in a few days they’ll know something is up, and it feels wrong to not tell them. But I’m also very worried because now we have 4 people not working and still getting paid, and some might take it as an opportunity for paid time off and others might genuinely be scared.

i sort of feel bad for it, and I do not hate its people. this is very stupid. but i had two relationships in my life and both men were jewish (im not , so I do not know why I randomly found them).

&amp;#x200B;

they were not related and both were not even that drawn to religion at the beggining but they ended up dumping me to go live in israel and do aliyah and whatever. In the second time, i just could not believe it.  It is obviously due to a very flexible inheritage or ancestor line that allows pretty much every jew to return, and so.. my ex did.

I know lots about politics and I historically felt more alligned with the palestine cause itself, but i do not want to not visit a country due to the hurt it made me go through, two boyfriends going to the ""promised land"", I do not know how to shake this feeling of rejection to jews now, I do not (of course) act on it, but I feel bad just thinking this way, I am not a nazi nor I want to ever identify myself with hate to any nation or people but truly...

how do i get over this? why is my life so unfair? I mean two... 

do know I never influenced them on not going, but I just cannot believe my luck. any anecdote that feels similar and you'd like to share? the second boyfriend and its departure specially hurted me.. all with the promise of great jobs and a great life... he asked me to go there but did it lowkey so I do not know.. I just never see myself there.

919,"My partner and I started dating in November 2018. an issue came up with her birth control less then a month into our relationship and was causing her problems, I thought it would be a good idea to throw out the rest of her prescription without her knowledge, when she discussed she would like to renew her prescription first before disposing of the previous one, before she could get a new prescription, she was already pregnant. She bought condoms but I refused to use them at the time. We then talked about having kids and I said I had always dreamed of having 3, she had never wanted kids but recently started considering if it was important to her or not. not expecting any of the complications I've been in denial of seing for awhile and she told me she would have a child but not alone and doesnt think she can do so on her own as she knows she is lacking some core values to properly raise a child, also would need a partner to be majority parent because of her harsh upbringing. At the time I thought it would be okay and that I'd be capable, but I was barely able take care of myself.. just didnt want to see it. She brought up having an abortion.. all I could say at the time was to never bring it up again because of my Christian faith. Which I strongly regret, now that I know I am not capable of taking care of a child. Most nights during the pregnancy while sleeping I'd apparently wave my arms around or physically punch her in the stomach, when she would bring it up to me I'd always deny her claims or take it as a joke saying I'm sorry. I'd always come back home from work and would just become an uncooperative zombie and that is no exaggeration. I was mentally not there most of the time spent most of my time rather high or zoned out while sober. When she bring up concerns about my behavior I would turn it on her and pretend like there is no possibility of anything being wrong with me or would suddenly get angry for no reason and walk away having a childlike tantrum described by my family and loved ones. Whenever she would bring up that she'd like to do something in memory of the pregnancy or our childs first milestones.. I acted like it wasnt important and it did not matter by always prolonging things or showing absolutely no interest in everything &amp; most activities involving our child. I had a job making the majority of the money and would somehow never have any money left to pitch in to getting anything baby related or anything important that was absolute need. I coerced her into having a child that she was not ready to have because I thought that would make her happy, but in reality it is what I wanted the whole time not her.

921,"Sorry for the long post, but I just needed to put this somewhere before I go insane.

So me and hubby lives in a small town. Hubby has kids from previous marriage, but the relationship with his ex-wife (the childrens mother) is really broken, and we are recieving help from our countrys version of Child Protective services (among other institutions). This will be important later.

Last fall we decided that we wanted to hire a cleaning helper, as we both never seem able to keep up the house chores do to job, kids, dog, life etc. In addition we both have ADHD and are total scatterbrains, so we though help around the house would be the key to a more orderly life. Oh, how naive we where...

Long story short: we hired a woman that seemed nice and she did a good job for a couple of months.

One day I could not find my Adderal anywhere. Now remember, me and hubby can be forgetfull and misplace things, so I am extremly carefull about where I place important things like cards, passports, medication, keys etc. That is why I am CERTAIN about where the medication was placed, and when I could not find it I got a really bad feeling. However, I was hoping that maybe hubby or the kids, for some reason or another, had put my medication in different spot. I talked to all of them, told the kids that I would not be mad or punish them, but I really needed to know if they had taken the Adderall. The suprise and relief in their faces when they realized what I was asking about, gave me assurance that it was not they who took it. This is also the first time \_any\_ medication in our house has dissapared, so I had no reason to suspect them. Neither did I suspect hubby as he has his own medication (same one), and he knows that if I don't have mine I'm just useless - which means more work on him.

That left only one person - the cleaning lady... Now, I just want to make clear that I did not want to believe that she took it but she was the new element in our life, and after searching through literally everything we own, I could not see any other explanation. We confronted her, and she became irate and denied everything, somewhat unconvincing. We also found out her boyfriend is a drug addict, so we thought that maybe she had stolen it for him. As Adderall is highly restricted in my country I felt I had no other choice but to report the loss to the police. I told them who I suspected, but also told them that I had no evidence. The case was of course  shelved do to lack of evidence.

We still wanted to hire someone to help us around the house, but where reluctant to welcome any more strangers in, so we hired the newly unemployed girlfriend of a close male friend. Let's call her ""Kelly"", and we will call our friend ""Brian"". Kelly and Brian had been together for about a year and we did things together ALL the time. Not just us grownups, but also with their and our kids. Kelly have one kid from a previous relationship, Brian have two. We really liked Kelly, and she seemed to make Brian happy, so we did everything we could to make her feel welcome in our lives and home.

After the first incident of the missing Adderall, we bought a small safe to store our medication in. We didn't think anybody would be able to steal the whole safe from our home without us knowing it, but one day that too was missing. In retrospect I feel extremly naive and silly for think this, but I actually thought the kids had played with it and misplaced it somewhere (they did think it was super interesting and wanted to play with it). Of course I looked everywhere for it, but I could not for the life of me find it anywhere in the house. I jokingly said to hubby that the only other person I could think of was Kelly, but we both agreed that is was impossible - how would she have snuck it out with both of us being at home the same time she was cleaning?

One month passes and as usual me and hubby go to the pharmacy to collect new baches of Adderall. I'm not sure how prescriptions work in other countries, but in ours it is all digital. The doctor sends all prescriptions directly to a register that (in theory) only you and the pharmacies have access to. However, it is possible for other people to claim your presecription if you give them  authorization through a form or a special app. We both use the app, so that we can collect for each other. That day the clerk at the pharmacy told us that hubby couldn't recieve any more Adderall as he had already collected his batch the previous week. We where both flabbergasted! We told the clerk that neither me or hubby had been to any pharmacy in a month. The clerk said that the only thing he knew about this was that the Adderall had been claimed at our towns only other pharmacy - a pharmacy we never use unless the first one is out of anything we need. Of course we went straight to the other pharmacy.

Upon arrival we explained the situation to the new clerk, and she became confused. As mention at the start, we live in a tiny, tiny town - we all know who pretty much everybody else is, and the reason the new clerk was confused, was because she was the one that had processed and handed out my hubbys Adderall - to Kelly! Turns out that Kelly had stolen a ID Card from hubby, brought that and a forged authorization written on paper with hubbys ""signature"" on it. The pharmacy had luckily made a copy of it, and it was no question about what she had done. We where in complete shock, but finally everything that had happened made sense.

We went straight home and called the police. They told us they would confirm this with the pharmacy, but that we must not contact Kelly. We where enraged with her, but we knew *we* would be fine, the real worry we had was towards Brian. Hubby and Brian have been friends for 15 years, and we both care for him - it would be awfull to tell him that his live-in-girlfriend was not only a thief, but a forgerer, identity thief and a drug fiend/drug dealer. News like that is pure destruction. Hubby called Brian and told him he needed to tell him something important, and they met up the next day. According to hubby, Brian was quiet and sad when presented with the news, but promised that he would look for hubbys ID and the Adderall.

Days went by without hearing from neither the police or Brian. Hubby called Brian to check how he was doing, but Brian was evasive, and the call ended after only few minutes. We assumed that maybe Brian was holding out hope of us being wrong or that there was a misunderstanding. Although it was frustrating that he did not seem to believe us, we though that he just needed some time to work out all this terrible news.

Police called a few days after that, and told us that the pharmacy had confirmed our story, and that they too wanted to press charges against Kelly also. We told the police that we where concerned that she still had hubbys ID in her posession, but the police said that they could not bring her in yet and we where forbidden to collect it ourself. Then, just a week later, after hubby had his prescription for Adderall refilled, Kelly went to the other pharmacy and claimed that too! She had managed to fool a brand new employee to handing her hubbys medication.

The anger I felt when I recieved this news was unparallell to anything I have experienced before. Our only luck with this is that Kelly might be cunning, but she is also dumb as bricks. You see, Kelly has really long hair, all colored in a non-natural color, so she is really easy to spot and remember, and the newly employed clerk could easily describe her. That pharmacy also pressed charges againt her.

Then, last week, we recieved a phone call from Child Protective Services (CPS) - they had gotten a  concern they need to check up on. The content of that concern was the worst thing I have ever heard... The person who had reported us to the CPS told them that hubby was abusing his medication, that we where living in what can only be summed up as crack den and that we did not care for neither our kids, house or other people. It said that hubby was mentally ill and unstable, and that he went around town telling everybody that he was going to commit suicide. The accustations was so vile, and it was glaringly obvious that Kelly was behind this too. It is no secret that Hubby and his ex have problems, and that CPS is helping them figuring it out. Kelly knew that, and she tried to exploit that situation to cover up her crimes. My theory is that she was trying to sow doubts about hubbys mental state, so nobody would believe him if he tried to reveal her wrongdoings. Fortunatly the CPS-lady seemed understanding, and luckily that we had already pressed charges against Kelly before we got the call. We also told the CPS that they are welcome to check out any of the accusations, at any time. I felt that they took that as a good sign, but we will probably revisit the topic next time we see them.

And that is it... That is where we are now. We don't know if the police have brought her in for questioning yet, but we know they will (they told us). Kelly is apparently visiting her family for the easter holiday (saw it on Facebook) without Brian. We think that maybe she is trying to escape, but all borders are of course closed due to Covid-19, and the police can leagally collect her from anywhere in the country for questioning, so there is no escaping that.

We have not heard anything from Brian, and hubbys ID is probably still in Kellys possesion. Hubbys ex will most likely use this against us somehow, and my faith in humanity has been deminissed. Hubby is a wreck, and we are very isolated because of Covid-19. We have also suspected an innocent person of her crimes - which she lost her job over. I have tried burying myself in work, just to stay sane, but it only helps a little. I just don't know what to do anymore... I really want to exact some revenge - like really, really destroy her, because I'm not sure if she will have to own up to everything.

I feel really helpless, stupid and gullable... How could I not have spotted that she is a complete psychopath/sociopath? Why was I so unwilling to suspect her? Did Brian know? Are they still together? Are we still friend with him? Will CPS believe us? What did we do to her to  make her act this way? We are not perfect but I can't believe that we deserve this in any way. I don't think we have ever said one negative thing about her... 

Has anybody experienced anything like this? What did you do to recover? Any perspective or advice would be very much appriciated.

924,"Hello everyone, hope you're all safe and well. I'm keeping gender vague for privacy reasons.

I'll just jump into it. I was abused for 7 years (from 2011 to 2018) by someone in school who was supposed to be my friend. We'll called them G.

G made my life hell, to the point where the last three years of the ""friendship"", my mental health was absolute shit and my mind went into real dark territory. This person;

* humiliated me in public, constantly
* undermined me and my achievements, constantly (like, my self confidence was non-existent)
* spread embarrassing and untrue rumours about me (anorexic, gay, mis-quoting me, you get it)
* made everyone, even the most soft spoken people in our friend group make me the butt of all their jokes
* talked crap about my deceased father who ended his life nearly 4 years ago, two times I'm aware of
* attempted to frame me for theft
* tried to get me involved with this group of criminals and tried to get me to date one of them (they laughed at me and then spread rumours of me being gay when I refused, nothing wrong with being gay but a few guys started to harass me for it)
* laughed at every little mistake and kept bringing it up... I could go on for a long time.

This is just the tip of the iceberg in what they did. Of course, I tried ending the friendship once, only for them to threaten to commit suicide and blame me in their suicide note. There was also the fact that I felt bad for them as they were neglected by their alcoholic father after their mother's passing. Of course, there was also the fact that they love bombed me a lot after they upset me.

Anyways, I finally ghosted them in 2018 and the rest of the friend group only a few months ago after they tried to vouch for G. Everything is a lot better, I've better friends and I'm more successful than I've ever been.

The only problem is... this virus. And now that I'm stuck at home, I think about them all the fucking time. My friend said that they were intrusive thoughts.

It used to be real bad after I ghosted them but then it improved as I went to another part of the country to attend college in a city and I was always doing something and I'd only think of the abuse at night. Be it whilst I drift off or in a nightmare. But of course, I'd manage it.

But now that I'm stuck at home due to Covid-19, I think about it constantly. It takes me an hour to stop thinking about G and my sleep has been crap as I've a lot of nightmares about them now and I've been having headaches and nausea to boot. Stress induced, as I know what they're like. Even my brother said that I seem a bit off and am more moodier than usual... ~~thanks~~

I've tried distracting myself with studying, chatting with my friends online, my hobbies, walking around the perimeters of my house (I can't drive and I live slap-bang in the middle of nowhere) and whilst that does help and it encourages me to be productive, G sometimes just pops into my head outta nowhere and won't go away for a long time no matter if I just let my thoughts happen or try and force it to stop. I thought I could handle it, until today. I was speaking to my brother about his online classes and I just heard G laughing in my head, as if they were beside me and then I remembered a rather upsetting incident. My stomach just completely tightened and they were stuck in my head for at least twenty minutes, perhaps half an hour, only going away after speaking to my friend on the phone. Then I thought of them again. Like, it's 1am here and I can't sleep because I keep thinking about what they put me through, how dumb I was to not end the friendship sooner, what I should've said and done... etc etc ad nauseum.

Perhaps I'm overreacting or crazy even but what do you think? I was considering looking into online counselors. But again, I think I might just have nothing else to think about. Any advice on hobbies or dealing with these thoughts or your own thoughts is highly appreciated. Thank you.

TDLR: This person who mentally abused me for 7 years has been stuck in my head for the past 3 weeks, I keep remembering certain quotes from them and events that really upset me. I keep trying to make it stop but nothing is really helping. I want advice on how to deal with intrusive thought or your two cents.

EDIT: I went to counselling before about G twice, last time I went was July, I didn't have much issues until now.",08Apr2020,1
925,"I’m 29 years old, autistic and I suffer from ADHD. I feel like a liability to my family because I can’t find a job that fits my personality type.

I have poor concentration and social skills, I struggled through college and barely passed. I’m worried I’ll never have a career or make a decent wage to support myself.

Currently I’m working a remote job for a major company doing data entry type work. It fits my personality because I hardly need to work in group efforts but it doesn’t pay great but I get decent health benefits. I don’t bother with a 401k because I know I’ll be working until I die.

Right now my only goal is to be able to move out to live somewhere cheap and affordable. But I’m at the point where I recognize my limitations.

I’m sorry if this sounded like a rant but I needed to get this off my chest.",08Apr2020,2
926,"I’m going to cut to the chase here. I made a nasty comment about a close friend- we talked about it and we’re fine again, but I pissed off her friends and I don’t know how to apologize to them. Up until this point everything between all of us was neutral. What should I say? I’m scared they won’t take me back. Can y’all help me?",08Apr2020,1
928,"My wife is turning 40 in a month. Since a trip or party are out of the question I'm trying to compile a book of memories. I'd like to send questions to her old friends (many whom I don't know). What questions could I ask to make this a fun book for her? Open ended or survey questions everyone could participate in. 

Thank you!!!",08Apr2020,2
