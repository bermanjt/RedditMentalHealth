0,"My boyfriend was buying shrooms, and said that we would do them together. He said that before he bought them. 

Now, without even mentioning it to me, he is planning on tripping with “the boys” and not me. I am good friends with the boys. I smoke with them all the time.

I am always super respectful and patient with the fact that they need time to be guys. But shouldn’t my boyfriend have mentioned it to me? Explained why, instead of hoping that I’d forget? Or, because he was gonna give me drugs for free, is it not his job? 

How should I approach this without seeming whiny and like a fiend? I WANT to do shrooms.",23Jan2020,1

After a while, I felt guilty for hinting it, so I backtracked and they fell for it.

He’s had declining health for as long as I remember. He was born with a heart condition, had a bad fall when I was a new born ruining his lower bodies nervous system(it’s a miracle he can walk), and on top of that he’s overweight, overworked, and a diabetic.

My dad gave me and taught me everything I know. He crawled out of a youth in deep poverty with a broken family to make a strong family and give us a better life than he had. I don’t know what I’d do without him and recently he’s just seems worse, more sick, more tired, just worse overall and I know he’s gonna die young and I don’t know how to cope.

9,"tattooers and tattooees of reddit, my friend just turned 18 and got her tattoo on her birthday, and it turned out great! I think I might want one, but I’m not sure? So I need some advice. 

I’m not turning 18 til May, so there’s no issue of me rushing it. Plenty of time to mull it over. 

here are the things I need advice on: 
the idea of me getting something permanently done to myself makes me nervous—is this a sign that I’m not ready, or is being nervous normal? how do you know when you’re ready?

and is it bad to get a tattoo on the back of your neck? I’m thinking something that starts on the back of my neck and ends between my shoulder blades, but something that a collar could cover. I was reading that the neck is a bad place to start, but is it true? I figure I can’t get tired of the tattoo if I can’t see it. 

for those who have had tattoos for a while, does dark blue fade faster than black? my inspiration is blue and white porcelain pottery (imagine nikita dragun’s tattoo, but blue [and smaller])

10,"So I had a job that made me depressed back from August to November (broke my foot and got out) and a couple weeks ago, right before I applied at a job I wanted (night stocking $15 hourly a mile away), my friend called and said he had a job for me that was better than the last one, both pay and fun wise. I was excited and told everyone. However I learned I’d be making less than the one from before and it’s nearly an hour from my house. It made me depressed because i was one of the only few who spoke English (everyone else spoke Spanish), everyone was rude and disrespectful, and lots of them laughed at me because I didn’t lose my virginity yet which hurt even more (at the last job. Some even offered to bring me to a place where there’s girls for “pleasure”) and it made me uncomfortable. It’s 12 hours everyday and the job sucked for me. It was always outside with heavy equipment and I just got pushed around (I’m 19m and very kind and people took advantage of it) and I just don’t know what to do with life. 

Fast forward to the applying week. The office for the company is 30+ mins away and had to go back everyday for a week straight for something new then had to go do classes, a physical, a drug test, all far apart. Yesterday they told me to bring a direct deposit paper thing from the bank and for me to leave my papers with her and I said okay. Well I went back today and they lost the papers and told me either I “lost them” or I have to go to the same places and wait in those long lines again to get copies. Each time I went to any of these was at least a 3 hour wait. I had it today when that happened and I left. Now I’m depressed because my mom is trying to force me into it for the money but most others support me on this and I’m to the point where I’m wondering why I’m alive and having to deal with this. I’m 19 and one of the sweetest people ever but I just don’t know what I want to do with life, but I definitely don’t want to do this. People there made it miserable and I need serious advice please.",23Jan2020,1
11,"My mom runs her own quilting business making memory quilts for people who have lost someone. The quilt she's currently working on has been the biggest challenge of her almost 40 years of quilting. 

To get to the point, there was another problem with the quilt that made her have to wash it before sending it off, which she usually never does because it changes the look of the stitching and not everyone likes it. Sadly, this time, the dark blue fabric bled onto the lighter tan fabric. She didnt notice until she had already dried it. She's trying to wash it again, but is there anything we can do to get the stains out? She feels so incredibly bad for this and it's never happened to her before. 

TLDR: my mom's dark blue quilt fabric bled onto the lighter tan on the quilt. It's already been washed and dried once. How can we get the stains out?",23Jan2020,1

i want to die. i really, really want to kill myself. but i won't do that now, i need to wait. i need reasons to do it, more than those i have now.

 i love my girlfriend but i just don't know how or why she gets mad at me every single day, i don't like that, nobody likes that, but she gets mad at me so many times, most times she does not even have a reason to be mad, she just is. and she thinks she is right. 

she gives every other man a priority over me, it doesn't seem like a big thing, but when you message 10 guys before answering something that your boyfriend asked, when you give short answers to everything your boyfriend says, when you simply do not want to talk to your boyfriend, but want to talk to other men... that hurts. more so because it has been like this for months now. when.. when you ask a man to be less emotional, when you humiliate a man in front of his friends, when you say you do not love him... do not expect him to thank or forgive you.

 i will not tell her, i will let all my feelings trapped until the day i simply cannot take it anymore. that day, everything will be fine for me.

14,"I feel like I’m in a really tricky situation and I’m too confused to know what I even want to do now. I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 2 years (he is 25 and I’m 22), and he is buying a house soon. Our plan has been that we would move into this new house together once we find one, and I would help pay of course.

I recently moved out of my own apartment to my parents house for now so I could save money while I’m in school. Here is where my issue lies; my dad has started to really not like the idea of my boyfriend and I getting a house. I know this sounds like a typical parental thing, but he’s always liked my boyfriend until recently. He says he is worried my boyfriend is way too focused on other things and doesn’t seem to be focused enough on me (there is a lot of details to this but I don’t want to write a book here)

My dad isn’t completely wrong, My boyfriend isn’t always very affectionate towards me and he gets very focused on certain things (like his dog, this whole house buying thing, etc) I really wasn’t too worried about this until my dad has been bringing it up a lot since my boyfriend and I have been going to open houses and going through this process. 

At this point I feel nothing but confused. One day I will be super excited to look at houses together and think about our future, and then the next day I don’t know if I should live with him at all. I also worry that if I end up deciding not to live with him, that it will negatively affect our relationship or eventually break us up since this is a pretty big turning point for us. 
(Just adding that he will be buying a house whether I am involved or not. We have just been planning to do this together as a couple).

Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense, I just feel super lost right now and don’t really know what to think or what I should do. I don’t have anyone I can really talk to about this, so any sort of input is very appreciated!",23Jan2020,1
15,"Hey guys and gals,

I recently lost my job due to ""unsatisfactory work performance,"" I think it was political due to a past event but I digress.

So I absolutely hated this job but you know, it was my first job out of college. I did not realize how depressed working in a bad job can make you. I would like to avoid falling into the same trap.

I don't want to stick to finance, I feel like it was the wrong industry for me. I'm going to try to not be super picky with the job title. I just do not want to sit at a computer all day and I want good management.

So where do I start? I have no idea what I want to do. I can afford to be unemployed for a bit but I don't want to sit around idly for too long.

Any advice?

Recently, we had a sleep over and when I was getting ready for bed I asked if she wanted to wash her face and brush her teeth with me. She said that she forgot her toothbrush, it happens so I didn’t really care.
But what really shocked me is that she said that she didn’t really wash her face.
Just to let you know she has a lot of spots in her face, I don’t know it that’s related to her not washing her face or not.

Also, I have noticed that she has kinda yellow teeth, she is 16 years old so that’s kinda shocking to me. I don’t think she brushes her teeth, and I’ve also noticed that she has kinda bad breath. Sometimes I stop from talking to her just to not smell it.

29,"I just want to get some other people's opinion on what is going on. I am trying my best to be understanding, but it gets hard when tensions rise.

So my sister (22) and I (24) still live at home with our parent (because of financial difficulties and a couple of other reasons), so, as expected, we are to help out around the house and such. What ends up happening is my sister will typically spend all day on her phone watching videos while our parent or I are doing something. She works a total of 24hrs a week and I know that she is going through some health complications right now. I am trying to be understanding, but I am also back at college where I have 16 credits that I am taking and I also work at least 24 hours a week. But I also have my fair share of mental health problems (anxiety, depression, etc.). Because of this, I know that I can get more anxious and stressed when I have a lot to do, which subsequently lowers my energy levels. 

This then leads to me not spending as much time cleaning the house as I would like (Our parent does some of the cleaning, but they are out of town at the moment.) and I would like to be able to lean on my sister to do this. I know that she is not the best at cleaning or just doesn't consider it high on her list of priorities (leaves dishes in the sink, won't do garbage, feed the animals, etc) and I'll ask her if she can do them for me. This usually leads to her blowing up on me and calling me names (f\*\*\*ing b\*\*\*h, etc), which leads to me retaliating and blowing up on her. 

I feel like I am walking on eggshells the majority of the time. Should I just suck it up and do the cleaning myself? I would really like to keep the relationship with my sister and it hurts me to fight with her. 

P.S. We both see a therapist, but it happens to be same one. I don't really feel comfortable talking to my therapist about this so I am asking what you guys think. Family therapy has been talked about, but has not been followed through.

i met this guy on omegle, we talked a lot and we were okay. apparently we live in the same village. he wanted to know me more so i let my guard down and told him my name and which street my house is located. we became friends, but i knew he was trying to flirt with me. he was showing motives.. and he knows about my sex life, he knows i'm open to it. so one time we had casual sex, and it just kept going. we even checked in to a hotel to have sex and that time it was kinda weird because he just said ""i love you"" out of nowhere like??? i'm confused. we just met and he's already in love with me? i got weirded out. i'm the type of person who doesn't want to let their guard down so easily, i don't fully give my trust to people i just met so i just shrugged it off. i think we're basically fuck buddies except i caught feelings for him and i think he did too? because yeah he was giving signs!! i confessed my feelings for him through chat because i can't do that shit personally. he sounded happy about it though. when i asked him if he feels the same, he said he loves me too. i don't think that's true?? i've got trust issues. also knowing he's had sex with a lot of girls too?? i should've kept my feelings for myself. 

here's the twist, i had to meet up with my cousins somewhere but i don't want to go there alone because my dumbass isn't used to commuting. that was too kind of him to come with me, he met my cousins. it was good. it was a fun time. my cousins kept teasing me about him. we're not officially dating we're literally just fucking at his house from time to time. i was just too dumb to confess my feelings. actually, i kept opening up about our relationship to him, i keep asking about commitments and shit. that's not the issue anymore so yeah one of my cousins, the older one, saw him on facebook and clicked that add button in a fucking heartbeat. yknow when i date people i don't really like it when my relatives make a move to get closer with those people. i just don't want people meddling with my relationships. i think my cousin's been chatting with him. idk?? that's just my instincts. we argued about the commitment and shit again and he said he doesn't know what's gonna happen to us. i regret confessing. for real. fuck him. what kind of guy will tell you that he loves you yet he's not doing anything to prove it??? dAmn that's when i realized he doesn't really like me. he just wants to fuck with me he should've made it clear at first??? what a fucking piece of trash. my cousin entered the scene and everything's gone fucked up. i stopped chatting with the guy, he never approached me after that. not even once. i approached him and he said, not messaging me at all is implies that he's given up on me. he said he couldn't keep up with my attitude? but last time i checked i didn't do anything wrong to him. he said being with me is like taking care of a mf baby i never asked him to take care of myself, he only saw my flaws he never saw my worth. he just wanted to change me because i just. don't. fit. with. him. i'm not a bad person but he made me feel like i'm the worst person to ever exist. i asked my cousin if she's been chatting with the mf trash and yes, she is. she doesn't even know my pain yet she's ""making friends"" with that arsehole. i told her everything and i found out that the guy courted him. SHE LET HIM COURT HER. she fucking let her i can't believe she fucking entertained that guy? i'm so disgusted. he's going ALL OUT for my cousin after treating me like a trash. he told me he loved me but after that he never approached me and started courting my cousin? bruh i'm throwing a fit. 

i'm so disgusted with my cous- i can't even call her my cou- she's disguting 🤢🤢🤢 that's just so disrespectful. she knows what he did to me now she's flirting with him. they even met because of me. i'm not taking a credit for that, i regret every single thing. they met up with each other, that guy even brought her food at school, she's 18 now and the guy's 25, and her parents doesn't want her to date anyone until she graduates from college. she still did though. she told me she just broke up with her boyfriend. i saw signs, one time she jokingly told me ""he's my type"" and i just stared at her then she continued ""he's my type FOR YOU"". bitch??? you think i took that as a joke? no way. she's gonna be out here telling me he won't entertain my ex fubu even if he courts her because i am her cousin and she respects that? but hell yeah they're still in contact, she doesn't know we've been fucking before they met though. she doesn't need to. she thinks it's okay to just flirt with a guy who gave me so much pain because ""we were not dating"". she just turned 18 recently and i saw her post saying ""my (name of the guy)'s birthday gift 😍"" (with the stuffed toy he gave her???) wow, so there's ownership now??? it just kept echoing in my mind like i wanna bump my head onto something just so i can forget everything i saw. it hurts even more because i'm doing kinda okay now but i saw that post, unintentionally, and now the pain is back. i wanna ignore everything but still i wanna tell my parents about what that mf guy and my cousin🤮🤮🤮 did to me because it just hurts so much. i feel like my pride has been stepped on.",23Jan2020,1
35,"I (f21) was assaulted s/exually by an acquaintance (m24) after a night at the bars with a group of friends in November. There are a lot of details to the story but the condensed version is after the bars we went back to a friends apartment where I was blacked out and violently throwing up. This man was sober so he volunteered to drive me to my apartment. 

Two weeks later he told me over text that he had sex with me until I “couldn’t handle it anymore” and passed out. He asked me if I even remembered it happening because I was so drunk and then kept asking if I was okay that this happened. 

A week later I went to the police and they started an investigation and I’m currently waiting for the DA to tell me if they’re taking it to court or not. He lived near me and knows exactly where I live and I know he must remember my exact apartment unit because he without asking me sent two of his dangerous friends to my door (building is huge and has locked lobby) to get something if there’s I accidentally took while drunk that night. 

I want to continue with the case even though it’s painful to go through so he doesn’t this again. He has a very lengthy criminal history, many incident including violence, especially to women (they’ve also dropped their cases). He has two no contact orders against him and two restraining orders. He may be gang affiliated from what I gather and also has access to weapons. I’ve heard from two girls that he’s made them feel scared unrelated to this (just creepy or harassing them). 

I don’t know if this case is worth it anymore because this man is very unpredictable and dangerous. He’s threatened to sue me after the trial for “distress or whatever”. I’m scared he’s going to retaliate. I also don’t even know if I’d win the case since the DA can’t bring up his criminal record and because I don’t have DNA evidence. He’s using all of his money right now to pay for a really good lawyer and freeloading off of his girlfriend. Knowing how bad of a person he is and dangerous to me and other women I also feel wrong not doing anything about this. 

tl;dr a dangerous and unpredictable criminal hurt me once and I filed a report against him now I’m scared to pursue the case out of fear of him physically hurting me.",23Jan2020,1

The things I said back being “stop” and “can you please stop” (I know cringe but I get very panicky when this stuff happens and I’m a very emotional person and I don’t want to have a voice crack or get teary eyes.) The kid even reached over to sign me out of my chrome book (just to be an ass) and I gently moved his hand away and then he said, “don’t touch me.” Like bitch??? Are you not touching me rn??? But I didn’t say that ahaha I just stayed quiet. 

I want to ask the teacher to move seats but I’m afraid she’ll ask why and what to involve the dean. I just want to move seats and not deal with them.

Stuff like that happens pretty often. Kids stepping on my shoes, whispering about me, calling my friends fat, talking about how I’m quiet. Just stuff like that. 

I dread going to school everyday. Like seriously. And some teachers suck too. I have a teacher who thinks she’s helping me when she calls me out during class because I’m scribbling on my paper and that must mean that I don’t care. (Scribbling on my paper keeps my hands busy and helps me focus. I’ve been called out during class multiple times by the same teacher for doing it. I just do it to help focus and it’s hard to just stop) 

I want to defend myself but when it comes down to it my throat tightens up and my eyes get teary and my face gets red. I wish I just didn’t do that!!! 

I used to be better. But I also used to be worse. I guess these things may coincide with happiness or whatever.

I’m asking for any advice on my current situation or even just people who experience the same thing. I feel like I’m the only one that gets mocked everyday at my school.  

Thanks for taking the time to read my vent friend",23Jan2020,1
37,"Hello Reddit,

I am in need of advice.

My dad was just diagnosed with early Dementia and possible stage 4 or 5 Alzheimer's. We do not know where to even start with trying to prepare for this.

He is already getting his living will together and appointing executors of his estate and who his medical proxy will be.

We need advice on how to help pay for medical care when the time comes. 

Does he need to set up an account that he can funnel money into until he is no longer able to work? 

Besides Medicaid is there other insurance that he can get?

&amp;#x200B;

Any Advice would be greatly appreciated.",23Jan2020,1
38,"I'm not entirely sure how to ask this question. Yesterday I started a monthly budget for myself and I got side tracked with a separate monthly budget with added (future) expenses. One thing I realized quickly was that I really don't know a lot about how the world works.      

At first I was just staying home for college, then until I found a job using my degree, but now it seems like I'll never find a good job and I should just go full time at one of my part time jobs and get my life jump started.   

&amp;#x200B;

  

For utilities, internet, phone, and insurance(s) I really didn't know a good placeholder number to put in. I could look up what a phone plan with \_\_\_\_ company would cost but I don't know a good price to look for.   

As far as rent goes I was just hoping to find a studio/1 bedroom apartment for somewhere between 500-700 - the lower the better. I've looked for apartments before and that seems to be the low end.     
  

While I generally feel completely unready to move out, I also don't really know what I should know when living on my own. Over the past year I've taught myself most of the life skills I thought my parents would teach me. I don't know everything obviously but I'm a lot further along than I was and a lot closer to what I think someone my age (23) should be.  (Like cooking and doing laundry. I don't want to get into it but my parents were really weird about teaching/letting me do certain things.)   



Just to be clear - my parents don't completely baby me. The only things they do for me are cook and do laundry, along with a couple bills they pay for all my siblings. (older and younger)   

My problem is I don't have experience doing things on my own. Like they still wake me up for work. Even if I'm awake and in the bathroom getting ready they will bang on the bathroom door to make sure I'm up. Usually though, they start waking me up before my alarm even goes up so its hard to judge how independent I could be.",23Jan2020,1
39,"So I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months. I've been counting since I haven't been in a long term relationship before. He's also been a first in a lot of ways for me and we've been talking about our future together since the beginning. All our friends told us we were like newly Weds and his family loves me. Since I know I love him it was so hard to hear recently that he's lost the spark. He told me tonight that things have been sort of at ease for him lately. He doesn't feel romantic attraction to me anymore. It's so hard for me to hear this since it's never faded with me, it's only gotten stronger. He also has sprung things on me throughout our relationship. Sometimes he'll get carried away and text another girl. He's done this three times, of course not taking it too far but whenever it seems like we're going to separate he leans over to a new girl. I've told him each time not to do this if he cares about me because it's grounds for me ending our friendship. He doesn't want to break up with me and he also sometimes suggests we spend less time together. I feel like I'm being manipulated because on one hand he wants me to stick around and on the other he wants to have the freedom of no consequences. I'm so upset because we genuinely thought we were each other's soulmates but he can't keep his word. My friends say he's selfish but there are lots of things I'm not comfortable with them knowing because I'm afraid they'll think less of me.",23Jan2020,1
41,"Just a heads up before I tell my story, english isn't my native language and I'm also on mobile, so sorry in advance for any inconveniences.

There's this girl that I like. We've been talking essentially non-stop for the last 2-3 months. We're both roughly the same age (only a few months difference). There's been a couple of late nights of us just talking over the phone or playing games. I've loved every single moment of it but, a week or two ago, she essentially stopped talking to me completley.

I don't wanna mention her name, even though I don't think she's on reddit. We've known each other since we were like 10 (both of us born 03, so that's like 6 years). She was the one that really got me into cs:go and we played every single day. For at least 2 months.

We used to sit up and hang out over discord. We even made plans to go out and grab something to eat/watch a movie. We shared what was going on, and with school just starting, I helped her out with her maths (or I tried at least). We shared cool conspiracies with each other and she told me stuff she said she'd never told anyone else before.

Those months have easily been the best few in my short time on this planet. But now it feels like we're drifting apart. We suddenly stopped talking like two weeks ago (we went from literally talking every single day to just noticing the other one's presence). She also started talking to this other french guy (mind you we're both from the northern parts of sweden). It just feels like she went from wanting to spend time with me to just acknowledging that I was there and alive.

I don't know what to do. I mainly just wanted to get this off my chest, but anyone that has something to say is greatly appreciated. These last two weeks have left me feeling very alone and it had me rethink alot if things in my life (ik I'm only 16 and all but still).",23Jan2020,1
42,"My dad has always been a problem for me. He has done a lot of questionable things that make me think abuse. Here are some examples from over the years:

- Directly caused three stress attacks of mine. One I had to be hospitalized for vomiting too much. He would be unhelpful, asking me if I did drugs (no), and poking me repetitively mid attack.

- We have got into numerous fights over tedious things: Who killed Batman's parents, can berries be composted, can you cut plants with a razor blade. Once I used a chisel of his and he screamed at me because it wasn't perfectly flat at the edge. After telling him to sharpen it and finding out I used a different chisel he suddenly didn't want to talk anymore.

- He lies to me a lot specifically if it involves him changing. ""I won't yell, I'm not yelling, I will go to therapy, I will respect your boundaries."" Other times he lies mid argument where a sentence he just said never happened and he actually said something else.

- Never admits he's wrong, never says sorry, and is a hypocrite in general.

- Just today I was trying to fry something to eat and he got a fire extinguisher out because ""It's going to overflow and catch fire."" I told him it won't happen, it didn't, and I told him he insulted me and my cooking ability. Cue a random argument about whether or not fire extinguishers expire (they do).

Yes or no? I just want a clear answer.",23Jan2020,1
44,"So I have been friends with a girl from work for a while now, lets call her L. She started as a Christmas temp the year before last, and after sharing a pudding together at an Xmass party I invited her out bowling with some of my friends a few weeks later and she seemed to have a good time.  
I tried to arrange for us to hang out more but our txting kinda died off after I kept getting one word replies so I stopped messaging first, and she left the work place to move on to another job.  
A few months later another work colleague invited me to the movies and invited L as they are close friends, and we grabbed food before the showing and I caught up with L like no time had passed.  
From then L often called to catch up with me rather than txt, although I prefer to txt her, and would often invite me out for drinks, which I usually declined since I live with two off my best friends and if I'm working then I'm hanging out with them or other close friends (my core friend group is 7 who have known each other for nearly 15 years).   
While talking to L shes always quite forward about her previous relationships and sex life, where I am almost glacial in opening up, something I could work on. She often says shes quick to fall for people and ends up sleeping with them and I said she should probably slow down on that and get to know them more.  
As I got to know more about L I found out she doesn't get on with her mother, who tries to rule her life, and even marry her off while they visited the country shes from, and ended up moving out and living in a hostel. Shes come to accept her mother is a narcissist, but still has close ties to her. And although we have a lot of common interests she looks down upon my more nerdier hobby's which I dislike although I feel like its her mothers expectations speaking rather than her.  
Over the course of the last year we occasionally visited the cinema together, and I invited her to a comic convention which she really enjoyed and we have planned to do another together this year.  
Shes also stayed over a couple of times after hanging out and watching movies at mine, the first time she came over and I had a free house she had complained about having a bad back and I said I gave great massages.   
I whipped up a homemade natcho cheese, and made salsa too, and had tortillas, popcorn and haribo ready for the evening, and when she arrived at mine she was wearing a low cut black dress, something you'd wear out rather then just lounging on a sofa imo, and the film we had chosen was Avengers End Game, which she said she had seen all of the other Marvel movies, but needed a short recap of the end of Infinity War which I put on so we could recap on the ending. Throughout End Game she spent most of it on her phone and even took a video call off a guy she told me she had briefly dated but wasn't interested in any more. All the constant phone use kinda annoyed me, but I paused the film while she took calls and patiently waited eating snacks until she was ready to resume.   
Through out the film I moved close to her and we ended up sharing a blanket but she showed no interest in my except towards the end of the movie she started complained about her back and asked me for a massage, which I started to do and noticed she was wearing a thong. I hesitated and stopped after thinking about how I got no signals from her about anything else and asked to continue watching the movie which we did, and after it finished we talked and watching netflix until it got late and she asked if she could stay over and I offered her the couch and went to upstairs to my room. The next morning she woke me up and said she had to leave and I saw her off. After that messaging was slow between us, I have more success with sending memes which became more sexual in nature. Last weekend I asked if she wanted to catch up over lunch, and we met on her local high street and I accompanied her while she finished some shopping. She then drove us to a restaurant together where we had food and she started talking about relationships again and I said I wasn't really looking for one atm but I mentioned I had a free house and I invited her over to watch some movies which she accepted.  
She drove us back to mine and I lit the fire and we watched Into the Spider-verse which is one of my favourite films. She loved the animation and we ended up watching Youtube videos on how it was made and discussing animation which she is a huge fan of then we started watching The Witcher together. It got late and she asked if she could stay over again, and I got her a some PJs and I hit the shower before bed, once I was out of the shower she came to my room, and I asked if I could get her anything and she said she was just having a look around, I have a small room and it was kinda awkward and she left after that. Once I was in bed she sent me a memes, but it was late and sleep took me quickly and in the morning she stayed until Lunch as we finished off the Witcher, now we're back to barely talking.  
I'm sure she's where we stand, I'm just after some insight as I know that as much as I enjoy her company she's not a person I'd consider dating as I feel she doesn't meet my needs as a partner, however I'm not sure about how to be FWB with her either?",23Jan2020,1
45,"I (18M) just started university last fall, but since this university is in my city, and I do not have money for living on campus (I am paying for all my tuition, textbooks, resources and more), I stay at home. 

I really wish I could live on campus tho, I wish me or my family had the money but we simply do not as we can barely afford car payments and rent, it makes me jealous of those who’s parents and grandparents have the money to pay, as I have to work to pay my bills. 

Whenever I see the schools party accounts flare up on a Friday night with people partying in their residence rooms, people making new friends and new relationships, I just sit there alone wishing I could have been there. I’m missing out on the time of my life, for many people this is the best time they’ll ever have but for me it’s not. 

I have not made any friends from university, I sit alone all the time as many of my friends moved away, or have girlfriends that they’d rather spend their Friday nights with. I’ve tried making friends but they don’t really care as they care more about their friends on their floor who they happen to see every day rather then me who they see once a week, and it doesn’t help that I live a 2 hour commute away from the school or they simply don’t like me.

Asides from my lack of friends, it’s also romantically, I am lonely. I had a relationship end in the summer because they were moving away for school, and ever since then I have not met anyone, I just wish I could have an emotional bond with someone again, to go on dates and more but I can’t find it. I’ve tried tinder and bumble but get next to no matches, and if they do match they don’t answer, most likely because I’m 240 pounds, I may be very tall but no one wants to be with someone my size. I just wish someone would just give me a chance tho. 

To sum it up, I am jealous of those who live on campus, have their schooling and boarding payed for, and can form both friendships and relationships with others, because I’m just so lonely at this point, I won’t get notifications for days at a time and people don’t answer if I ask to make plans. I just wanna feel a part of something again. 

I just need advice on how to feel better because I cry myself to sleep every night, and can’t handle the loneliness anymore.",23Jan2020,1

between enlisting and now, I decided to break up with her as i didn’t see a future with her and I wasn’t enjoying the relationship like i thought i would.

However she told me as of yesterday she is pregnant. 

Neither of us are even remotely prepared, financially, or emotionally, to have and care for a child (Im 20 shes 19). However, after some discussion she seems to be against the idea of an abortion, although hasn’t yet made up her mind. I don’t really blame her, its just a child would complicate things dramatically.

59,"I would like to preface this by saying I met my best friend October of last year and we immediately clicked because of our personalities being so similar: she made me feel loved and heard and we laughed about memories we made together. It was like a part of my became complete. 

Over the course of the year, she’s gone from extroverted to completely introverted due to her extreme social anxiety, a side effect of her increasingly worse depression. Now when I’m with her there’s nothing to say without me feeling like I’m forcing and holding the entire conversation because she feels sad and drained. 

She used to go to therapy and a psychiatrist but her insurance won’t cover it anymore so even if she wanted to go, she couldn’t. 

When I look at her now, she’s nothing like the person I met a year ago. I comfort her when she’s sad and she comforts me but it just feels like a burden. I’d feel guilty ever leaving because I know she has no one else and she tells me that. She doesn’t have a good situation at home and lack of love from her parents. 

I know she’s a good person deserving of love but a friendship is constantly just sadness and consoling each other. I don’t know how to laugh or have fun with her anymore because she isn’t the person I became best friends with. 

I can’t possibly hurt her or tell her that I don’t connect with her the same because that will shatter her into pieces and she tells me herself how now she feels as if she has no personality and isn’t worthy of love because her depression changed her and my heart aches for her and I don’t know what to do.

72,"Let me begin by saying I'm a senior in highschool. For awhile now I feel like I haven't been myself; for lack of a better word I feel like I'm in a daze. I constantly feel exhausted wanting nothing more but to sleep during class. I have no motivation to do school work or get out of the house. I've never really had many friends but now I  dont even care about the ones I do have. To top it all off, I feel lost, like I'm drifting away from the person I used to be. I feel as though I'm becoming someone who I do not recognize and it is frightening. At first glance these symptoms may seem like depression but I've battled with depression throughout my life and this somehow feels different. Before I would feel hopeless and empty but this is more like a dull nothingness; I feel like I cant think or feel emotion and nothing matters. I feel numb to the world. For a time, I convinced myself that it was simply because I had given up. I have given up trying to do anything meaningful since I'm going to college so soon. I've convinced myself that I should just wait till the fresh start of college to make new relationships and improve my life. However, I've tried to change this attitude but every time I go to sleep with a plan when I wake up I say fuck it because I'm too exhausted. In the end, I simply continue my daily rut. No matter how hard I think I cant explain why I feel this way; maybe it's a different kind of depression I haven't experienced before; maybe it's just a part of growing up; whatever it is I cant see what the cause is, maybe I just wont let myself see. Regardless, I dont know how to stop feeling this way and I'm terrified that if I dont stop soon I will be irreversible changed.",23Jan2020,1

75,"**TL;DR Chase gave me an incorrect itinerary (with proof) that made me miss my flight, then told me I'd have to buy same-day tickets home at my own cost, no refunds. How can I get them to own this?**

My original plan was to visit my family for the MLK holiday weekend and fly out Monday. I bought the tickets in September through Chase’s travel portal. There were some flight cancellation/updates in October, which I called Chase to handle (or so I thought!).

In the beginning of January I requested an itinerary from Chase and shared it with my family. In Chase's email, the itinerary said my return flight was Monday night at 9:40pm, which was the flight I had thought I confirmed during the October phone call. So everything looked good to me. 

On Monday, January 20th, when I tried to check-in for my flight home, the airline (Alaska Airline) said there was a problem. When I called them, they said the flight was actually for January 19th! We had missed the flight.

After speaking with Alaska, I called Chase's travel support line to request assistance. Twice, Chase called the airline on my behalf and attempted to get the tickets reissued for the proper day. However, Alaska refused to reissue the tickets and marked us as “no shows” for the day before.

Chase rolled over for them. 

Chase tried to defend itself by arguing that in my October phone call I was unclear in my preferences regarding the flight changes. Whatever they thought I said, *I* thought I had picked the 20th, but their system “shows no record of a decision.” Regardless, up until the week before our trip, the itinerary issued through Chase’s travel portal showed the flight home on the 20th.  Sounds pretty decisive to me! Well. it turns out the itinerary they produced was wrong. Alaska rescheduled us to fly home on January 19th and Chase never updated the itinerary to reflect it.

Chase informed us that they weren't going to do anything for us. No new tickets, no refunded money, not even refunded points. We would have to buy new flights home at current prices. We were trapped. To get home, we would have to shell out almost $1,250 and, after 4 hours of back and forth (with the travel window closing), that is what we had to do.

We feel robbed. It's bullshit that Chase wants to put this on us. Their system kept telling us that we were booked and good to go and I have the emails that show it! I bought these tickets with the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card and the Ultimate Rewards, thinking I'd have protections in case something like this happened. Indeed, something *did* go wrong the very first time I used it, and they shrugged their shoulders.

Is there any recourse for us?

84,"I'm currently a 21yr computer science major and in the tail end of my sophomore year of college. The reason why I'm such an old sophomore is because i decided to work rather than continue on with college, and i didn't have a way of paying for college without going into debt. I managed to save around $10k that is hidden safely in my roth ira.

I would prefer to graduate from college as early as possible with my CS degree and working in the field. My first choice college is around 20 minutes away from my current location, and i can take the bus there. My place of employment is about 3 minutes away from my home. Although the School's CS program is limited, so i would need to both apply to the school and the program. Moreover, i would also need to complete some prerequisites before joining the program, so i would be enrolled in classes winter or spring quarter,and that is if i were to get into the program.

If i don't get in then i can work and save more money, and reduce any future debt i may find myself in while attending university. The School is also on the pricey side, although i am able to make around 5k from working while attending uni.

My second choice is the cheapest public uni in the state. They don't require you to apply to the program and i can finish my DTA while taking my CS classes. If i went down this path, i wouldn't work at all in my last two years of University. Although, i had planned not to work my last two years. This is the fastest path, and i would get my degree 4m-1yr faster. I've already applied, and it highly likely that i will be accepted. if don't, then i have my first choice to go to after I'm done with my prerequisites.

I just don't want my savings wiped out even a future bad economy even if my degree is good. so please give me your advice",23Jan2020,1
85,"This is a very weird situation.

I won’t go into it but I recently had to leave a job in a remote community. I have been home for a few weeks and am unemployed and very depressed.

Yesterday, a salesman knocked on my door. When he started speaking, I was very unsure what on earth he was selling.

He asked me which car was mine in the driveway, what I do for a living, commenting on my badges pinned to my cardigan, my travel experience, commenting on my appearance and that I’m very slim and beautiful etc etc. 

The first few minutes were just salesperson talk, but I had no idea if he was selling car parts, cardigans, or asking to donate to a charity. After the comment about my appearance I politely asked him if he was trying to sell me anything.

He said “oh some roller doors” like what on earth, you’ve been speaking for 5 minutes in this salesperson talk about random things and you’re selling me roller doors.

I told him I was renting and he should speak with the home owner. He apologised for bothering me and said something along the lines of “I only get to speak to old people all day it’s very nice to get to speak to a lovely young and beautiful girl” I laugh weakly and say thank you.

He then says they need a new secretary at work and I would be a perfect fit because “you’re so bubbly and attractive and we’ve gone through 6 in the last 8 months” hmmm wonder why 

I was a secretary for 3 years so would be very well qualified. 
I’m also very unemployed and they pay $26 p/h and it’s full time with benefits.

94,"I work a dead-end job that pays the bills, but doesn't provide anything beyond that. I can live on it but there is no avenue for career advancement, growth, with nominal wage increases. Basically it's very boring despite it coming with some various pros.

For many years I've desired to do something more with my life, to find fulfillment by creating, with a goal of being able to live off of it. I've dabbled in a lot of areas over the years in terms of design/art/writing/animation, but haven't ever put enough focus on any one thing for it to be ""my thing"".

Really what I want is a creative platform to tell stories. I read a lot, every night, and I watch a lot of shows, so I'm always brimming with ideas that I sometimes jot down to explore. But the problem is finding an area where I can tell them. I kind of enjoy writing, but at the same time I find it difficult to visualize in words what I want (or at least I think the reader won't be able to visualize it due to my writing). And drafting a novel feels daunting, with the prospect of failure even more so, which really drains my passion in it.

The flip side is some sort of comic art. I find it strange to sort of want this, as I don't really care much for story comics. I've read plenty but eventually find myself wanting the meat and finding the art more of a hurdle. But at the same time, I'm a very visual person and the thought of being able to illustrate my mind's eye is incredibly appealing.

The problem is that I haven't really drawn much at all for 10 years or more. Life got in the way, as well as easier ways to pass the time after work. Wanting to start a comic of any sort would be a large undertaking in trying to remember how to draw, and trying to get passed my own poor drawing habits born after years of not practicing. (I actually find this very stifling, and I don't know how to break it.)

Both roads (or other roads, for other mediums), is work, I know. No easy answer here, but I'm just at a massive impasse on which to follow... As well as getting passed my crippling self-doubt, anxiety, and fear of failure.

I don’t know, I’m just not like that. I don’t need to text other girls like that. I’ve never been like that. Also I’m into astrology and I’m familiar with the idea that Libras are notorious flirts. I’ve dated many libras and have Libra friends and they admit to harmless flirting. But for me man, I don’t like that stuff.

 Every time I visit she asks me to get the mail from the box on my way in. There is always a tremendous amount of mail, mostly garbage. 

Inside her house she also has piles upon piles of mail that she just cant handle.

It mostly consists of obviously junk mail. Lots of political mail asking for donations,  catalogs,  ads... generic b/s.

111,"So, to be completely transparent, I really did mess up in my friend group. I hurt a lot of people. In the tail end of September and throughout October 2019 I found myself in a sexual relationship with one of the males in our group who had broken it off with one of the females in the group. They've been very on and off again in their relationship for years at this point - to put it simply. He has a reputation of finding other women to fill his time, and she wasn't sitting and moping around the house either if you feel me. Still, in respect for her, I should have never let it happen, or at least stopped it before it went any further than one mistake and let someone know.

What started the whole affair was a wildly drunken night and as I was just on the verge of blackout we were in the garage making out. I literally remember opening my eyes and our faces were amidst our passions. The next day I woke up not even knowing how it ended as I was passed out on the couch. I sincerely thought it was going to be an isolated incident and that was the long and short. Booze, coke, and a passionate mistake.

Well a couple weeks pass by and we found ourselves isolated again and well... I'm sure you can take it from there. Neither of us stopped anything. I hadn't felt my body touched like this in a VERY long time as I had been basically abstinent for the better part of roughly 10 years. My ""relationship"" that I had before that left me really jaded and distrusting of men and I just let my introversion drive. While my loneliness would sometimes eat me up at night, for the most part I just didn't think about it. The energy in my depression was often fueled by other things. I'd occasionally be on dating apps but I just never put much energy into dating. I say all this because I'm sure it has something to do with my subconscious logic.

Well moving forward, I just couldn't handle the guilt I felt after our nights and I started to draw inward and behave strange. I couldn't look my friends in the face other than in short bursts. There were situations where I would just summon all my strength to ""act normal"" and man it felt so awful but I was so afraid of just telling the truth. I didn't want to hurt anyone and I knew this was going to be terribly upsetting. I was afraid also for my own self because my mental health just isn't great. Point blank. He became my only place of comfort as shallow as it was. Even though he would tell me about how beautiful I was and how much I made him laugh, I never mistook his actions for love and I knew he wouldn't fight for me.

Well it all comes out and it's just worse than I imagine. He called me and asked me to deny everything and I almost did. But I messaged him back after a few minutes and said no I'm coming clean. Here's the part where my question in the title comes in.

I am feeling all of my suppressed guilt and shame completely on the surface at this point. All I can think is about how sorry I am and how I just couldn't understand how I could be capable of that. I have never in my life made someone so angry at me and here I've let down all of my friend group. I'm told by the girls best friend that I shouldn't reach out and that all trust is gone. 

Meanwhile two weeks pass and I learn that she took the guy back with conditions of couples therapy and other things. He got to step right back into his life and I'm about 98% sure he just expected her to do so. He told people he was sorry and stuff but I just don't know. I tried to talk to people fairly early on but nobody would hear me other than two of the couples in the group. But these two couples are the busier ones in the friend group and I hardly see them. I spend all of my time basically isolated because I feel bad about going and enjoying myself. 

My roommate won't even talk to me and neither of us use our living space anymore. I asked to talk and apologize to him fairly early in this, but he said he wasn't ready and needed to make some peace. I haven't reached out since other than things I've needed to tell him as we live together. I reminded him when his dogs birthday was and he's never rude to me, but he is short with me. He never reaches out first which is understandable. To make matters worse, it's actually been him my heart has been crushing on for a long time, but when I told him, I got a very kind ""no tank you"" in so many words. We were fine for years and I just wanted to give up because I knew he'd never reciprocate me if he hadn't by now (then).

I'm hurt because he and all the rest of them still hang out with the other half of this affair. I know I was wrong but so was he. I can't speak to what conversations they've had but it was apparent I wasn't given the same chances and understanding. I know what I did was insanely out of character so does that somehow make me WORSE for it?? I just sit here in my room and cry nearly every day because I don't know what else to do. Everytime I think I'm showing some signs of, ""no it's ok I can move past this"", I fall back into my self hate talk and it even goes into suicidal thoughts at times. 

I don't know if I should be feeling slighted about that or if I've lost all right to feel any type of way about the situation. Am I just grasping for some sense of control? Am I just trying to flip blame and get my turn to point some fingers? I mean I'm not really like that either so I don't know.. I'm very sad and very confused.",23Jan2020,1

113,"Hello, I am not sure but I think I may have a problem with intrusive thoughts, mainly one's of a specific theme repeating itself.
 
I've been feeling really guilty about something for a while now, and I have random thoughts related to that topic. Sometimes they will come out of nowhere, other times I will feel like I'm about to think something bad which results in me trying to distract myself ASAP, and sometimes I feel like there is a thought in the far background of my mind that's bad, but as long as I don't focus it won't come out.
 
These thoughts have been fairly consistent over a short period of time since they started, with varying degrees of how serious in content they are. A few times it has also lead me to think terrible things about family/friends, which I would never want to say to them, or anyone else for that matter.
 
These thoughts have also caused me quite a bit of guilt. Sometimes I'm able to pass them off as just a random thought, but a lot of times I feel terrible for having something like that go through my head which causes me extra guilt.
 
I'm not sure if what I am experiencing is what is considered intrusive thoughts. I don't think these thoughts are my own since they are of things I would never want to do/say, but the fact that things like this are even going through my mind weighs down on me pretty heavily.

I suffered a lot of trauma as a child, with people in and out of the house, abusive father figures and the like. Mom has always loved me and always will, has never shown her weaknesses.
I don't know if that matters. Ever since I was little (7-10) I've known i was different; withdrawn. It wasn't until i was ten i killed my first animal, a  bird. I ran it over with my bike.
Sorry if that's disturbing. I just need you to have a full picture of what is happening. In the later years I've developed a compulsion to move to something bigger; people. I cant answer if I would be able to follow through with it, but I derive a satisfaction of taking one's life.
However,  I am not proud of these thoughts. They yell at me, and in my most lucid moments I understand they are wrong. 
I cannot deny merging these fantasies into my sexual life. I've never had an interest in sex. All my sexual fantasies do involve or end in murder and I feel guilt afterwards. 
After a mere few minutes of research, I do have early onset symptoms of schizophrenia, but they may be arbitrary. I do have OCD and general dysphoria, or an general satisfaction with my own life.
I do have a lack of empathy/sympathy its very present. I am able to fake it very well in everyday life.

119,"Hi there,

So me (24m) and my girlfriend (23F) live alone with our two kids. My girlfriend's mum and younger sister (16) regularly come to stay with us to see the kids etc etc. There is no issue there.

What my problem is, is that my girlfriends sister is so rude, entitled and spoilt. She seems to have anxiety and depression (which I suppose can be blamed for her behaviour to some extent) but what really gets me is how she treats her mother. She gets everything she asks for (not even asking, more like telling tbh), she treats her like absolute shit and like a slave (she wont do anything for herself, doesn't know how to cook, doesn't have ANY life skills whatsoever. If there is no food readily available to eat, she simply won't eat). 

She spends most of her days on her laptop playing games and whenever someone says something to her; e.g. - ""do you want to make yourself something to eat? You haven't eaten all day and I don't want you to starve yourself"" or ""can you please go and have a shower, it's been a while, etc etc"" or even if she is fussing over her food that she is given, for instance like she doesn't like the mayonnaise on her sandwich, so we say to just scrape it off and/or just put a new sauce on, we are always met with a tantrum and her screaming stuff like ""why does everyone bully me?! I hate you! Stop talking to me!"" Before storming to the guest room.

I just don't know if it is my place to say something to her because I really despise her lack of respect for everyone, but mainly her mother and my girlfriend. 

I also don't want my very impressionable young boys to learn that her behaviour is okay.

The worst part of it all though is my girlfriends mother does absolutely nothing to help the situation. She will tell my girlfriend off for saying anything to her.

I just don't know. I feel so lost in my own house when they come and I hate sitting back, watching it and constantly biting my tongue. It's hard to get it all into words because it's one of those situations that you need to see for yourself to understand.

I apologise about the formatting. I'm on my mobile and I am kind of just venting too, but I just want to know what I can do or if I should just continue to let it go because it's not my place.

120,"I work for a small company (about 10 people in the office itself). It is mostly an open space but a select few have offices with doors. You can hear most everything that people say no matter where you are. 

About a year ago, (Sally) was hired who works directly for the CFO (Norm), eventually to replace him after retirement. She’s done great and is loved by the higher ups and will definitely fill that role well. She is well liked by everyone and has a positive attitude. I definitely don’t dislike her.

HERE’S MY PROBLEM: Sally does not stop talking. If she’s not talking to Norm, she’s taking personal calls on her cell right at her desk. If it’s not that, she’s inserting herself into whatever conversation is happening around the office. She constantly interrupts others to talk about herself “well I” or “MY” or “I....”. You can’t have a single conversation about anything with her turning it to be about her. 

So here we are a year into it all, and I feel like there’s nothing that can be done. Norm participates in the constant blabber for over sixty percent of the day as he stands at her desk and talks about HIMself as well. He knows she takes personal calls constantly and does nothing about it. The CEO and COO love her and have no authority over her as Norm is her direct boss.

Also, note that Norm is not only the CFO, but handles all HR responsibilities (aka we have no HR department or anyone to help us with such issues). He dismisses every problem with an “I hear you and feel your pain.”

I use headphones to listen to music, but can still hear the talking through it and I have to constantly take them out anyway to tend to my job responsibilities. There’s no option to move elsewhere in the office and I don’t have a door to shut to block out the noise.

A useless merit? Sure,  but for me it means something.   


It's gotten to the point now where I see where my life is heading and it's just not going to change with so much depression. My mindset is simply fried. No amount of self help books will do any good - this absolutely has to be something chemical in my head. I am constantly told book after book to read ""Have you tried to read - Why I keep smiling by Jackson Jackoff?"". No, no I haven't.   


The best way I can put it is that the gears that get you going in life are not well lubricated enough for me. I cannot get the gears of happiness, desire, the future - to turn. I don't see a day a head or a week ahead. Just the same day over and over again.  


I've wanted to try medical marijuana but it is just such a gray area. Sometimes you'll read ""No, you'll get fat and it makes you tired!"". Other people said it cured them, and then they took DMT and realized they'll never touch another drug again. I don't know.  


I wanted to try Zoloft but my brother who was an ex-heroin addict told me ""Please just smoke weed instead of that shit"". Effexor (However you spell it) seems to have horrid withdrawal symptoms and I'll never touch Benzos either for that reason.

131,"So, I technically almost died three weeks ago. I say technically because... well, I wasnt shot or hit by a car or anything like that. I have three pulmonary embolisms (one in one lung and two in another) and two deep vein thrombosis in my leg. So, 5 clots altogether.

I was feeling sore all over for a few days. I had just suffered from the worst bout of depression I had ever had. 5 am I woke up with this awful, stabbing pain in my back. I could only take short, wheezing breaths because the pain was just so bad. I put an ice pack on, propped up my pillow, and went to sleep. The pain. Disappeared and I dismissed it as random pain. I went to my moms that day for christmas (we had to celebrate it a little late) and I was sore the whole time. I went home and was fine until the stabbing pain suddenly came back. I tried to power through it and started some chores. I went to pick up the laundry basket and the pain was so bad that I could neither sit, lie, or stand. I was screaming because every couple of breaths made the pain worse. My mom and fiance convinced me to go to the hospital (which i avoid like the plague and I recognize that they saved my life) and the drive there just intensified the pain. I sat in the ER for 2 hours before I was seen. 

I had nearly 24 hours to die. That probably sounds dramatic... at least it does to me.

But, that's the thing. Saying I almost died sounds dramatic even though its technically true. I was lucky I wasnt rushed to the ER in an ambulance after ignoring the first pain. I was lucky to survive. So, why doesnt it feel like a big deal to me?

We got into a huge fight and I didn’t see him for almost a year. 

Then he came back with a hugeeee apology text and we talked it out. Basically he had really strong feelings for me and pushed me away. We decided to be friends but he flirted with me every time we hung out and then I started to flirt back and we hooked up. All of our friend hang outs were paid for by him (which he never did before) and he would plan while little days for us. He also told me that he told his mom about me because he was so stressed he hurt me and said he had wished he “cuffed me” soon after we ended things. 

When we started to hook up again we were drunk and I asked him what he wanted from this. He told me he wanted something serious. I felt guarded because of our past and told him I needed to wait until I talked to this nice guy who I had been flirty talking to who really liked me. We were due to go on a date in a few days. He was super understanding and said that he would be supportive of whatever I decided. 2 days later I decided I wanted to be with this guy. I was too scared to tell him in person (I’m very very nervous about confrontation which he knows) but I kind of opened up the convo as he was leaving my house. 

I texted him and said I wanted to try to be serious with him. He said he wanted to think about it more. We talked a few hours later and he could barely look me in the eye and said he saw something serious with me but wasn’t sure if he was ready for a relationship right now. There was no doubt in my mind that he wanted this. It was such a shock. He said he was down to keep hooking up until we knew for sure. And I told him no fucking way. I blew up at him and said it was messed up to say all of the things he did after what we had been through. 

I started dating the other guy shortly after that and told my ex-whatever that we should be friends as originally intended. He gave me some bullshit but never tried to hang out and he avoided me.  

He unfollowed me on everything recently. I asked him about it and he said it was complicated but didn’t represent what he thought of me. He looks at my stories sometimes without following me. His friend who I don’t know (from his hometown) recently followed me. 


I need honesty here. Thinking back.... I’m feeling like maybe I made a mistake by trying to rush the relationship. Did I act crazy? At the time I felt as though I was standing up for myself. But now I feel embarrassed. Is he the asshole or am I the crazy ex? I still think about him often... what do I do?",23Jan2020,1

142,"This happened one week ago, I am now back home in the states. I was in India for a friends wedding, but wanted to go to a wellness resort beforehand. I was traveling to India alone and wanted to do something that was safe to do by myself. They are also known for practicing yoga and meditation, which is something I’ve been becoming passionate about. The resort also has a spa center with several different types of massages. They have you meet with a doctor about any health concerns you have, give you a customized diet and all, to give you a holistic wellness plan. Very fancy place in the mountains, with great yogi instructors and friendly staff. 

Anyways, I was only there 3 days, and they said they could only get me into one massage session on my last day, as the rest were booked. They asked if I was okay with a male masseuse. Told them yes, it doesn’t matter. 

Fast forward to the day of my massage, I was very excited as I talked to other guests about it, they all said great things. I also got scheduled a 90 minute massage, which I’ve never had before. So I go to the changing room and change into a robe keeping my thong on. (I always keep undies on for massages). He takes me downstairs to one of the rooms, he puts a towel up covering his face and asks me to remove my robe. I didn’t know whether to face forward or on my back I was confused, and was a little taken a back he didn’t initially leave the room to do this on my own. 

He saw I was uncomfortable and then said I’ll leave and come back. The massage started with me laying on my back. It started out totally fine and normal. Although when he was working his way down and massaging my thighs, he got very close to my vagina several times, massaging my inner thigh, I was thinking at least I’m wearing underwear - whatever. 

When I moved to laying on my stomach and he got to massaging my butt, at first not a big deal. I’ve had full body massages before. But then he asked if he could move my thong. I was assuming he meant move it out of the way so he could massage it fully or something. I said yes. But then he moved it all the way down, and was starting to massage between my cheeks touching my anus several times. I didn’t expect this and was uncomfortable and kinda froze up. He moved to my vagina and moving back and forth. He said this okay? And I softly said yes... I regret this but I was in shock. Then he put his finger in me about 6-7 times. 

He moved back to massaging my butt, jingled it a few times, keep massaging then went over and watched his hands. Then he massages my back for another maybe 5 minutes. After he asked me to sit up and put my robe back on. I tried to do this elegantly but he was still in the room of course.. 

He gave me a head massage with oil for a few minutes. He asked me to move my robe down to massage my shoulders. I tried to do this without exposing my breasts and tried to cover them, but turned out pretty impossible. He asked can I massage? I said yes thinking it’ll be over soon. 

He walked me out and asked how it was a couple times. I just said good and kept my head down. Went to the changing room to shower, headed back to my room and stayed there the rest of the night. Missed lunch and dinner and didn’t want to leave my room. I felt angry and confused. I said yes so I consented right? But I feel like he took advantage of me in a vulnerable position.

I told a couple of my close friends and they think I need to call the resort and tell them what happened. I haven’t gotten the courage to do it and I also don’t know exactly what I would say. I’m basically looking for advice on what to do and I wanted to write out the full situation to get some input on what happened.",23Jan2020,1

149,"Hey everyone, 

So I'm starting to drive again and for the most part I'm pretty comfortable. However, merging lanes and onto highways makes me extremely nervous. I find it overwhelming sometimes doing the various mirror and head checks quickly and being able to determine If there's enough space or not. I have a habit of spending a bit to long doing the check and losing focus straight ahead of me.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips for merging (or advice for new drivers overall) and how ways you overcame your fear if you had similar feelings",23Jan2020,1
150,"I'm looking to reddit for advice since she doesn't post and I'm all out of ideas. So here goes...

My girlfriend works as a veterinarian for a pretty big animal hospital chain in a major city. She loves the team at her site and it's a major reason she commutes over an hour one-way to her clinic. Unfortunately, for real estate reasons, the site she works at is getting shut down in just a few months. All of the vets and techs have been told to disperse to other locations and that they'll be ""taken care of"" by the company. There are a few major issues with this:

The first issue is that, as I mentioned, she loves her team. She's known most of them for many years now, and they work exceptionally well together. If she can stay with the team, she'll do that. One of the problems is that, for various financial or moral reasons, it's not feasible for the entire team to just shift to one new location.  That's not really something in her control, but it's a consideration she's keeping in mind for now.

The second issue is that there just aren't many sites in the area that she can go to - maybe 2 or 3 at most. She's worked at one of the nearby sites in the past and it was miserable and she hated it, and the other site is also in imminent danger of closing down for similar reasons. The third site is about 2.5 hours away so I'm basically sweeping that under the table.

The third issue is that she may not be able to move out of this city for a while. Her current housing situation is a financial jackpot, and moving to a different location in or out of the city could potentially place a huge strain on her bank account. Plus, she loves this city and I don't think she's willing to leave it without a fight.

I know there's no good solution that addresses all of her problems. At this point, I'm really just looking to see what any of you would do in this situation. Any suggestions?

155,"This is probably going to be *the* most stupid post to ever grace this sub, but I genuinely need advice/want to hear what others think.



I am 23 years old. Pokemon has been my thing since as long as I can remember. I remember my brother setting me up with Red/Blue/Yellow because I loved the anime so much.


 Since then, I basically never stopped. I have spent thousands of dollars, and thousands of hours on Pokemon through the years. People in my school knew me as ""that Pokemon girl"". My theatre teacher would give me anything Pokemon related that was donated to the drama department. Family and friends would gift me Pokemon things for any gift related occasions. Basically, what I'm trying to say, is Pokemon has been a massive part of my life.



I have at least one copy of every single game that has come out. I have Pokemon themed consoles. Again, thousands of dollars, and thousands of hours. Now here is my dilemma:



I am one of those people who does not agree with what has happened with Sword and Shield. I'm not really looking for people to try to sway me on this, I simply just don't support what they are doing. Because of this, I am not buying anything Pokemon related, and had asked family and friends not to gift me anything related.



Now though, I'm excited to see a rescue team game. And I also miss being able to get cute plushies and figures. Silly, I know. I don't want to support this company that I've made excuses for, for so many years, but I don't want to miss out on stuff that I AM interestered in. 


I know I am only one person, and my money honestly doesn't mean that much to such a huge company like Game Freak, but I guess it's the principal of it for me. Company I've been faithful to my whole life does something I don't agree with, ignores fans like me, so I don't support them. But I feel like maybe I'm just being silly, and since my money really *doesn't* matter, then why should I not let myself enjoy it? It's not like I'm expecting anything to come out of me not supporting them, so, I don't know I guess. What do others think? Should I just give it up and buy things but just ignore Sword and Shield?",23Jan2020,1

164,"Sorry, this is long, and I looked at the rules and thought this was ok. Sorry if it isn’t. 

So I am the oldest child. My and my brother's lives have been very different because my parents have been in different financial situations raising the two of us. He is 7 years younger than I am.

I'm sort of a first generation college student / sort of not. Anyway, I have really had to learn everything on my own. I also had to work my butt off to pay rent through school, etc. My parents made too much money for me to get pell grants and were not in a position to pay for school either. Needless to say I have spent a long time trying to finish paying off my loans for my almost worthless education. Hopefully, they will be done this year or next year. I have paid off my car, and have worked incredibly hard to be financially stable. I make ok money compared to a lot of people my age but it certainly is not great and I live in an expensive area. I say all this to imply that I don’t have a ton of extra cash laying around. 

Anyway, as I mentioned, my parents were not prepared financially for when I went to college, and somehow did not learn from that experience and still were not prepared for when my brother went, and my brother is not as independent as I am. He is much more dependent on them and used to a nicer lifestyle I would say. 

A couple of years ago they basically emotionally coerced me into cosigning a loan for his school. They treated me utterly horrible for being hesitant and having the audacity to question their decision and loan company choice. Anyway, I was stupid and caved, and did it. They said they would pay it off and I knew they wouldn’t because I know them and know they just aren’t the most financially responsible but I think they do try or say things with good intentions. The loan has since ballooned like I knew it would. Come to earlier this year and my dad lied and basically committed fraud, using my social, etc to add me as a cosigner on another without telling me. I found out early enough to stop the disbursement from a suspicious notification on my phone. When I confronted my dad he said he paid the first one off, he obviously didn’t or he would have told me when he did, and it would be off my credit report. Months later, it’s still there.

The loan will come due early next year I think and I do not know what to do. It is becoming more overwhelming because I am not in a position to pay it off just because I want to, I would have to financially absorb it somehow. My parents said they would pay it off but I feel like they won’t and it is a lot of money (approx. 30k).

I don’t know what to do. I am sorry this is so long but I need advice. Part of me wants to just cut ties with them if they don’t pay it off but that seems selfish because they won’t always be here. At the same time, I feel like they basically sacrificed me for him and then threw my education in my face when I tried to stand up for myself and that is not ok. They took out a loan for my first year housing because they wanted me to live on campus (twice as expensive as off campus). I wanted to live off campus. I definitely would never have even gone if I knew they would throw it back at me like this. I work hard to be financially stable and it is like they do not even recognize how much I have struggled and busted my butt. They act like everything normal and ok when they talk to me and everything is not ok. 

This is a student loan so I think I am stuck with it and my brother is not going to be in a position to pay it off after school, in addition to his federal loans. Opinions or recommendations? Has anyone else dealt with this?",23Jan2020,1
165,"I don’t know a not weird way to say this, but basically I died when I was 5. I drowned in a pool at a cousin’s party, my heart stopped for several minutes before I was resuscitated. I don’t know the exact amount of time I was gone, but I have to distinct memories from that day; I remember falling, struggling to get my head above water, and the realization that I was going to die, then after that I remember the sun in my eyes and a burning sensation throughout my body after paramedics brought me back. After that day my parents never talked about it and I repressed it until recently. I’m currently taking a Philosophy of Religion course at my university, and naturally it’s forced me to think about death a lot. So much so that I can’t stop.

I’ve never been able to maintain a stable friendship, and the one relationship I’ve been in ended because after 11 months I was never able to love him.

170,"I’m 24F, for context. 

Okay so a while back, I went to a new doctor for the first time. He was an elderly man, maybe 70s/80s. I hadn’t been to the doctor for awhile, so they did a series of blood tests, finger pricks, etc. He took my blood pressure, listened to my lungs, nothing inappropriate. Anyway, I’m talking to the doctor about some mental health issues I was having and he prescribed me an antidepressant. No big deal, I had taken them before and they helped me so I figured I would give them another shot. He said he wanted to do a follow-up in 1 month to see how I was doing. Great! I thought he was nice and normal. 

Next month, I go back to this guy’s office and he’s asking me how I’m feeling, any side effects, you get the idea. I said I felt about the same, just a bit tired. He wrote it down and said “okay, and what about your sex drive?” My sex drive had suffered a bit, but I knew that was common for antidepressants and I wasn’t going to bring it up, but I wanted to be honest, so I told him that yes, I had been experiencing a lower sex drive as well. I had had male doctors in the past, and had always had good experiences, so I thought this was no big deal to tell him this.

He wrote this down and I asked him what he thought I should do, what to do about feeling so tired while taking them, if it will get better with time, etc. He kept giving me very short answers to these questions, then circling back to my sex drive. Weird. He says follow me and we’ll talk about what to do about the medication. Okay sure?

Here I am thinking we’re going to talk about a new medication or something, but I follow him into his office, and he takes out a folder. Before he tells me what it is, he takes out a notepad with handwriting that says ‘consent’ and TELLS (not asks) me that the conversation we’re about to have is consensual and safe. Before I have the chance to respond or ask what the ACTUAL FUCK is going on, he opens a folder that contains an info booklet titled ‘your changing body’, a diagram of female genitalia, and what looked to be a dildo/vibrator catalog from 1987. He points to the diagram and is talking a mile a minute. He tells me what everything is, and then says that if I want my sex drive to return to normal, I need to use *this* specific one. It’s one of those vibrating dildos that has a cord. A CORD! He says, “it’s very important that you get one with a cord. It won’t work as well without one. You’re lucky you have someone to tell you this.”  When he’s done mansplaining, he says we’ll up the dose on the antidepressant, then leaves the office and I’m still sitting in the chair. 

I didn’t know what to do. I walked out of the office and didn’t pick up my medication. Since then, I’ve switched doctors and now have great mental health. Looking back, I feel ridiculous for not telling this guy he’s a nut and walking out, but I felt frozen. I didn’t know how to end this because he just wouldn’t. Stop. Talking. 

So, what should I do about this? Who do I report this man to? Do I actually have something to report? Is it worth it? Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR my doctor prescribed an antidepressant, I had a lower sex drive, and he told me the fix for this was to use a plug-in dildo. He also mansplained female genitalia to me.",23Jan2020,1

I do little things during the day such as going to the gym and it does help because I can say I did something, but I feel trapped in this endless loop of feeling useless, while I see people using their day to the full extent, but lacking the motivation to actually find something to work on.

184,"18m here in college with a girlfriend and steady part time job yet I get waves of anxiety and negative thoughts. I'm not gonna self diagnose myself because I'm not an expert but I know there's definitely something wrong with me. I get anxious over nothing and it gets to point of hearing voices in my head screaming at me. All I hear is how worthless I am, what a nuisance I must be, and how everyone would be happier and better off if I didn't exist. According to my dad he has minor anxiety. I'm not sure if that can be genetically passed down but if so that explains a lot. I've also had serious thoughts and contemplated taking my life several times although I have never tried. Unfortunately I still think about it. A good example is when I'm driving I think about how easy it would be to simply speed up and run into a tree.

Needless to say something isn't right and I want to improve. Not for my sake but for the sake of my girlfriend and family. I was going to ask my dad for help but after weeks of building up the courage right before I was about to spill he had long dialogue. It consisted of him telling me about  how hard he was going to work because he's only $4k away from being debt free. My father never went to college and has always been a hard worker in labor intensive jobs. I can't get in the way of this for him. At the point I feel like the voices would only be correct. I want to improve but I don't know where to turn.

TLDR: I show strong evidence of suffering from some mental disease/diseases. Probably anxiety and/or depression. I want help but I'm too scared to ask my dad for help because he's finally so close to being debt free. Any suggestions?",23Jan2020,1
185,"So I'm 16yrs old and go to this outdoor school where we sleep in a big cabin in bunk beds. There was only three out of three of the boys in the cabin last night as a few of them went outside to sleep under the stars. One of the guys, Peter, is dating one of our nine classmates (yes small school, I know) Kat. Peter conspicuously snuck Kat in to the cabin to sleep and cuddle with him, apparently with only pure intentions. Everyone in the cabin knew she was there and we were chatting a bit. Eventually we all went to bed and I ended up waking at around 6am to the quiet sounds of - you guessed it - sex. Peter sounded like he was going down on Kat and I immediately had an oh shit moment when I realized what was happening. I was the only one awake other than Peter and Kat. I ended up drinking from my water bottle very obviously and loudly so that they knew I was awake and would hopefully, you know, stop. I did this 4 times total. I even knocked it over loudly and they still kept going. Eventually, after literally an hour, Kat left.

I had to spend the entire freaking day at school with them pretending what happened didn't happen and I'm still not sure if what I did was right. Should I confront one of them about it? I can't help but hope for an apology of some sorts.",23Jan2020,1

187,"I'm [F] falling for my coworker [M] and I'm not sure on what to do next. *To clarify, dating is allowed at my workplace and this is a temporary job for me so if this were to go somewhere it wouldn't be that big of a deal.* And we're both in our early twenties if that helps. **I made a post a few days ago but I couldn't log in again so adding update here.**


Ever since we met he showed interest in me and we hit it off really well and honestly I already knew I was gonna fall for him but I tried my best not to, since he is in a managing position and I didn't want it to affect our jobs in any way although dating is allowed. As days went by my coworkers picked up on the fact that he was hanging out with me at work more and more. I didn't know about this until my coworker told me he's making a move and asked if I like him. I ended up saying yes but I told the rest of them no since I wasn't super close with the rest back then. They continued to say ""you're so beautiful, of course he likes you!!"" ""You guys look so cute together!"" and kept teasing me saying he's my boyfriend and eventually the word got around. I could not control the smile on my face whenever his name was mentioned and I know I was falling deep. But the fact that he would like me made me become really nervous around him and I fucked up so hard. I thought what if it's a rumor and the word gets to him and he starts hating me. So I decided to basically push him away and avoid him. A month passed and we didn't talk at all no matter how much I wanted to. But little did I know he cared. He confronted me and told me how I hurt him by avoiding him and I fucking felt so so bad but I went speechless. 

I just hate it cause I know I really hurt him. He even told me things he had never told anyone else and I feel so bad that he opened up and I pushed him away. 

Things just haven't really been the same since then and I wanna make them better. He talks like before but I know it's not the same. I'm sure he doesn't wanna get hurt again and I know it's my fault but I don't know how to make them better now. All I know is that I like him but I keep on getting nervous and I know it sounds childish. I just wanna tell him why I did what I did but would it be a bad idea to bring it up?


**UPDATE**

I didn't get a chance to talk to him about what happened but he was he was flirting for sure yesterday and stood so close like hip to hip and joked around a lot in a flirty tone. I think he's quitting soon and I probably am too cause I wanna find another job. I'm scared if this goes any where idk how to go on a date with him. I have the worst anxiety and I hate going out to eat. I just don't know how I would tell him everything even though he's been pretty open and seems understanding. I'm just scared to get hurt but at the same time I don't wanna lose my chance :( I really really like him...

Should I just make my move now and if he feels the same should I just be honest with him about my anxiety?

193,"I am a girl who was raped by another woman. It was my very first sexual encounter, as I was 12. This trauma spiraled my life into a lot of turmoil, obviously. Because of this, among other smaller factors, I developed gender dysphoria and attempted to live as a male, but it was just a suit of armor.

In my eyes boys wouldn't look at me sexually if I was a boy, nobody would want to touch my vagina if I was a boy, nobody would want me to bear children if I was a boy, I could be safe if I was a boy. Nobody would hurt me if I was a boy. 

About half way through my school year I asked some teachers to call me by a male name, but now I've come to terms with my womanhood and it doesn't fit. I'm so embarrassed about my identity crisis and the teachers have already had to get used to a name change. I have no idea what to do. For six months I built my life around transitioning to male and I was public about it, so now I have to take it all back. 

It's humiliating for me. I have absolutely no idea how to approach people about it but I just want to move on.

198,"A bit of a selfish post. If you feel like giving advice, go for it.

&gt;!If you go through my history, you can clearly see I've posted this twice on two other subs. This is for a simple reason. There are few people who comment on Reddit posts, and even fewer that comment something thought out on Reddit posts. With these three posts, I hope to maximize the latter so that I can get valuable insight from multiple people.!&lt;

I'm growing up. As per the experience, as I'm sure many of you know, you have to decide which job field you want to go into. I'm sure many of you remember the stress that came along with this decision. People tell you, ""Oh, you can change majors, don't stress!"" so nonchalantly as if there's nothing to fret about potentially **wasting** a year or more of your life. 

I want to get it right on my first, or at least on my second try. I figure it's easier to spend the time thinking about it now, than stressing about it while I'm halfway down the line, fretting that it's not what I want.

I've always fantasized about being at the forefront of technology. Being apart of a group of pioneers who've made a brand new creation, invention or movement. When I was in grade nine, I wanted to go into astrophysics for this very reason. In my mind, we were on the bridge of becoming intergalactic, and I had this idea that my purpose could be doing whatever I could to contribute to that cause.

And then, I started thinking like a normal person, because I was getting normal person grades and normal person experiences and generally becoming a normal person. Now, for anyone misinterpreting what I'm saying, this is not because I claim to be some sort of super genius. It's just because I interpreted how I lived somewhat extraordinary in comparison to some of the people that I'm friends with.

This lead me down the path of becoming an engineer. And then a software engineer, and then not knowing, and then an Electrical Engineer, then mechatronics, and now right back around to being at a crossroad.

Being an engineer was something that I wanted to do as well, this by no means was only an option because of money. I wanted to be an engineer because I wanted to create. I tried to make a tesla coil, and am in the process of making a nixie clock. 

Going into mechatronics is my primary option right now. Truth be told, I couldn't give less of a fuck about robots. I want to be with the people at the front of science, discovering new things, and doing the first of something. 

There are multiple ways to do that.

Engineering and Astrophysics are the ones that I've mentioned, but they're not the only ones.

And I'm at a crossroads, and I'm seriously considering taking both paths.

Also, I'm aware this seems very much like a bunch of random thoughts pieced together to form a somewhat messy story. If you think that way, that's because it absolutely is. This isn't structured whatsoever. These thoughts are pure, off the cuff, from a somewhat anxious 17-year-old.

200,"This is the first time I’ve posted anything to Reddit, but at this point, I don’t have anyone to reach out to. 

I’m 27, Married, and living with my father in law. My husband is in the military, a few days ago he left for basic training, leaving me here alone with his dad. NOTE: My husband was and is super stressed with me being here alone, but we don’t have a choice. 

Typically this wouldn’t be a bad thing, except that I’m absolutely terrified of saying anything to this man. He’s a felon, and alcoholic, and has no regard for anyone except himself. He doesn’t have a job and gets his income by donating plasma 2 times a week. He drinks himself until he’s black out drunk and sleeps all day. I don’t know how long he has left being a free man because he always finds a way to fuck up. I don’t even know how they haven’t caught him drinking yet. 

My father in law is dating a fellow addict, with prior or existing drug abuse, she’s obsessive. When he decides that he’s done with her, she’ll show up here unannounced, ask for him, call him relentlessly, to the point where he talks about getting a restraining order. Yet he keeps bringing her around. 

The other day, just before my Husband shipped out, he was black out drunk, covered in blankets on his bed. My husband and I wake up at like 7 or 9 pm to someone banging on all the windows and the front door, driving the dogs absolutely crazy. My husband answers the door and it’s her, we tell her he isn’t home, and that she needs to go away. She obviously didn’t take the hint and went back to banging on the windows. We walk outside, I’m dialing 911, meanwhile my husband is cussing her out while she’s saying shit like “I know he’s home” and “I can do whatever I want” my favorite was “you guys aren’t going to do shit”. Cops get here, talk to us and her and basically tell her and us that if she does this again, we can bar her from the property, but my father in law can’t invite her over anymore because that’s just going to cause problems. 

Well not 3 days later when I’m all alone, no way to contact my husband, he brings her back, drunk off his ass, she’s smoking in the house, sending me into waves of anxiety and panic attacks, and I don’t know what to do about it. My husband and his dad are both on the lease. I can’t add myself to the lease without both of them there, and my husband isn’t here to be a voice of authority. 

I’m terrified to stand up to my father in law because last time I tried, he came at my dogs with a hammer, threatening to “fix” them. He also told my husband, his own son, that he could call the cops and lie to them, telling them that I was trying to kill myself and he’d “watch them drag me away in a straight jacket”. My husband warns me to just humor him, his dad is completely unpredictable and even more so when he’s drunk. My husband watched his dad bite a chunk out of a dude’s arm when they fought. His dad went to jail for armed robbery. Even my husband is scared of him.

My options are to just deal with this, pack up my shit and wait to move when my husband is out of basic, the whole time being absolutely terrified, locking my door at night, and hiding my shit while I’m gone. 

Or I confront him and hope that does ANYTHING, which could result in him hurting me or my dogs.

208,"tl;dr at the bottom

I’m a college student and I was dating someone living in my dorm for a while. Long story short, it went terribly so we broke up toward the end of the semester and I asked him for no contact at least until after winter break ended since I was feeling really sad and struggling. 

Despite this, he invited me out almost every day, constantly messaged me, tried to find excuses to meet me, would loudly greet me when we bumped into each other and so on. He kept insisting that I was important to him and that he needed me around even if it was damaging to my mental health. This was a huge red flag for me in any kind of relationship and I felt it would be better to cut him out of my life completely, so I told him I didn’t want to talk at all anymore and to stop contacting me.

He was really upset about this and asked me to reconsider and talk it out with him and asked me to come to his room. In hindsight, I really should’ve just blocked him immediately and left it alone, but I felt like he would ignore my requests again and keep trying to contact me if I didn’t get him to agree so I went over. 

When I got there, he kept trying to engage in casual conversations (ex: how have you been?) and any serious conversations would go nowhere because he would only respond with things like “why?” to everything I said. I realized talking was pointless so I tried to leave multiple times, but he’d grab my arms or wrists so I couldn’t escape. Eventually he pushed me down on his bed and raped me, saying stuff like “it’s your fault for turning me on so you have to take responsibility” or that I “wanted” this since he knew I have a high sex drive. Afterwards, he said he’d leave me alone from now on if that’s what I wanted and I left crying.

I had to take a final exam the next morning so I didn’t have time to process anything until my winter break started. I already blocked him on everything I could think of, but whenever I see him in person, on social media etc, I suddenly become unable to breathe properly. It feels like I’m breathing through a straw and I start gasping for air and gagging/choking on nothing.

Since we live in the same dorm and have many mutual friends, it’s impossible for me to avoid him completely, but even seeing him from afar leaves me struggling to breathe for around an hour and I don’t know what to do about it. After a full month of self-care, emotionally, I’m doing slightly better and can mentally stay calm even when seeing him, but my body’s physical reaction hasn’t changed.

I tried to find a therapist, but none of the therapists in my area who will take my insurance have available time slots for me and after waiting for weeks, nobody has taken me off their waitlist either. Without insurance, I can’t afford it.

I don’t hate him and I wish him well in life, but I don’t know how to cope with living here for another 5 months. I’m doing my best on my own and I think I’ve done well but the physical reaction is something I can’t seem to overcome.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

209,"Ive decided I want to go to grad school to study medicine. I have been studying for the entrance exam. I’ve started early because it’s been a while since my undergraduate studies. 

I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed but I with hard work I managed to get good grades at school and get into a top university and a decent job afterwards. 

But everyone I’ve told about my interest to do medicine has doubted me. My best friend who’s currently in med school was like “have you considered allied health jobs? Like nursing or physiotherapy?”. My parents and the guy I was dating (not anymore), all said that it was a waste of time to try that when I should be more focused on furthering my current career path. (I hate what I’m currently doing). My sister has said that I should “be realistic” which was a nice way of saying it’ll never happen.

As an example, she's now demanding the phone number of the friends I'll be staying with next week. I'm forty years old, ferchrissakes! Besides, she has a history of abusing other people's contact info - often trying to get *them* to get *me* to do something. 

Her fallback justification for this entitlement is, ""But I am your mother! Why would you [maintain boundaries/hold different priorities/think independently] with MEEEE?!"" This justifies anything, in her mind. 

Any phrases I can repeat to counter this? 

Advice doesn't have to me mom-specific, since other people have a boss, roommate, spouse etc. who simply won't accept ""No"" and badger you stubbornly for whatever they want.",23Jan2020,1

I'm not going to go to much into her besides the fact that she is great, I really like her, if I even think about anything like that I begin doubting if I should cut things off with her but I know I should.

I called her the next to ask her why and she said I make her feel bad all the time. I apologised and we kept on talking and then I asked her ""are you afraid"" and she said yes. I asked why and she told me that her boyfriend told her that if she would meet me again he would hurt her, hurt me and hurt himself. And now she's trapped there.

217,"I’ve vented way too many times to my one friend and I hate myself for it. Nothing good comes out of simply venting and having someone just learn all your troubles.

I’m a 17 year old college student, and I’m just barely passing. My parents made me go into dual enrollment to get their disgusting embarrassment of a child out of the school their sibling was about to enter as a freshman. College isn’t for me, and it’s all for nothing since my desired career doesn’t require college. I’m almost failing for nothing when I don’t want to be here and someone less fortunate and with more potential could be here instead of me.

Going from there, I can’t seem to find any information on getting started with the career I want. I’ve reached out to multiple employers in the field and they simply point my broke ass to $200 workshops 2000 miles away, instead of giving actual advice on where to start.

Adding onto that, my desired career revolves around my voice. And that really sucks when you’re a transgender minor who can’t get any information about HRT or getting diagnosed or literally anything besides binding safely. I sound like a squeaky idiot and I hate it, and I don’t know what to do prior to getting my voice fixed, or how to even find the resources I need to do that.

And to top it all off, I’m autistic and I struggle with communications, even the “simple” stuff. If there’s not a script I’m all awkward and unlovable. And when I do manage to meet some miracle person who seems to love me, they yank me into a toxic relationship. Even friendships are hard to find. Everybody around here is racist or homophobic etc and I just want to go away. I don’t want to die alone or with someone who’s nothing like me, and when I do find someone similar to me, they hate me and they won’t even tell me what I said or did.

People who I talk to about this stuff always tell me to be grateful for my privilege, to be thankful I’m not a starving African child. Please, I just want advice. I’m sorry I just poured myself out but I’m tired of life and I want change. I just don’t know how to bring it",23Jan2020,1
218,"I’ve been trying to figure out my sexuality for quite a few years now, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m almost 100% bisexual. But I’ve never had a crush before and I can’t really talk to my friends about this so I have no clue if what I’m feeling is normal or not. 
When I thing about dating someone from the same gender, the thought feels exactly the same as if I thought about dating someone from the opposite gender. Same thing with the thought of kissing someone of the same gender. Or anything regarding that. And now that I’m typing this is realized how stupid this probably sounds, but I just really need a second opinion. 

Basically what I’m getting at: is it normal to be perfectly fine with the idea of doing anything romantic with someone of the same gender just like it is with someone of the opposite? Is this something all straight people feel?",23Jan2020,1
219,"I've always had this problem where people who I either don't really know that well or don't particularly care about or like always tell me about their problems. It's entirely a one-sided relationship and it always ends up weighing me down even if I feel like I'm doing a good thing at the beginning. I feel obligated to listen to people and really it's my own fault for not being able to set boundaries. 

My roommate is one of these people. She is extremely self-obsessed and it frustrates me having to listen to her talk about trivial things all the time, especially when she loses interest as soon as any conversation becomes about me. We get along generally, and I used to like her very much, but her dramatics and attention-seeking have been bothering me for a while now.

Now recently, something very traumatic happened to her, and I don't feel equipped to help her with it. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's well-being when I'm depressed and overwhelmed with my own things as it is (which sounds like a cop out but my mental health is really not that great at the moment). Is that selfish of me? Should I recognize that this is bigger than myself and just help her deal with it? The issue isn't with me not necessarily liking her or caring, I'm just not sure I can handle this right now. Logically, I know the answer is probably to just encourage her to seek help elsewhere, professionally, but it seems so impersonal when really she probably just wants someone familiar to help comfort her and get through this. We have other suite-mates living with us, one who she is very close to and cares very much, but she thinks we are closer than I do and I don't want to turn my back on her right now if she wants it.",23Jan2020,1

Which is odd for 100 plus jobs applications. I found out that my mom went onto my password protected computer and somehow found my password. And the she emailed all of them saying that as my mother, I couldn't be trusted/stolen money, etc. Which is false. I am beyond mad right now.

I always went over to her place, lunch, etc. Well eventually things fell apart, I never told her, and she stopped hanging out as much. 

She recently started hanging with our group again and tonight things got interesting. My buddy and I were talking about how I used to be a huge simp and how I don’t waste time doing that anymore. Well she put two and two together and asked if I wanted to have sex with her before. While I still do, I no longer want the relationship because I see the kind of person she is. It was such a direct question I was thrown off, but I wasn’t going to lie so I said yes. After that my friend thought it would be funny to ask if I still would. I didn’t answer that, but my no answer gave her a huge hint that I would. I feel like this may have given her an impression, but I’m not sure which one? I now have the confidence to open up and tell her how I felt before and what I would still be interested in, I just don’t know if it’s the right move to make.

225,"I will apologize for the super long text and format as I am on mobile.

/r/A little context: my family and I migrated to the US from a Caribbean country after encountering heady economical hardship causing me to drop college, lack of fund to support my brother’s tuition and my parents were almost not profitable enough to even bring food to the table. Some days we would eat nothing but rice and eggs and some days we managed for more that was within budget.

Considering all of our family had moved to the US years ago, we decided to take the leap with my brother still in HS. During that moment, we were already in the F2B greencard process because of my maternal grandma petitioning my mom married and children under 21.

Unfortunately, I turned 21 and lost all my rights as dependant so I got married and was able to get my stuff, but my family is still undocumented and waiting. My brother just turned 21 so his chances are 0. If my parents eventually get their greencard he’ll have to wait forever to get his or he will have to get married.

Now the part where I need advice... I am currently working 2 part time jobs and going to full time college but my parents live in another state with my brother and everything there is extremely far away. Therefore, he cannot meet people, without a permit he is unable to get a job and without a job he is unable to pay for college.

He is slowly crumbling and he cries often, so do I. I am in no position to be able to move him with me as I live with my husband’s parents and we don’t even have our own space (rent is too expensive with our pay). We plan on bringing him one day but he is slowly losing his patience and debating if to take the leap and return to our country (which would jeopardize his life and future in many ways than one). 

My parents do not know how to support him, I am unable to support him. I am afraid, I am sad and I do not know what to do. I am afraid of my brother going so deep down that he can no longer see the light.

What can I do?

TL;DR: How can I help my brother who does not have a greencard cope with the situation of him being 21 and not being able to do what he wants to do?",23Jan2020,1
226,"



I recently just started working as a hostess last week which was my first job getting it myself and in a restaurant aswell. I worked with my dad in his office (he's an art director) as an assistant (i'd make modo/trend boards and even design sometimes but that was rare as i did the work the artists need to design) which helped my dad a lot but i got hired as a host at this resturaunt quicker than i expected which means i've stopped going to the job with my dad but come in when i have a day off. literally my 4th day at work i get a call from this other place i applied to asking if i can come to work i said yes and it's the same position. I'm basically on my feet all day on saturday but i have days off, mwf (days i go to college)  but still i was so drained the first day. Now i think i'll be fine since i've adjusted to it a bit. 

NOW the pay.. i got paid 14/hour at my dads job for being an assistant. while at the american diner hostess job i get paid $10/hour (i'm in southern california for ref) and at the other job idk how much it is as i haven't asked but probably 10 and i do get tips (something i dont at the american diner) but it's 5%of what servers make. 
And at this student worker job (it's a program)at the attorneys building is $13/hour starting and it can go up to 15.80 but all depends on how many units you've taken. Ive done 32 so i would make 13.65/hour ...  and it'll go up as i go to college because of the units. 

Thing is I really enjoy the hostess jobs as time goes by quick and everything i get social skills (are some workers who are rude to me lol) i'm dealing with people compared to my dads office where i only talk to him and 2 other artists and time goes by slower. 

I'm also in college and just need a job that pays good and i feel it'd be dumb to not take the attorney job and keep the other 2 hosting jobs. So it's not like i just want more money (which is nothing bad but i have no time) but i NEED it as i have to pay for textbooks and tuition and parking. But then another side of me is saying i prob should get a job in my desired career choice (want to be a project manager/ software engineer. basically in the tech industry) and have little interest in being in the law field as i haven't read into it. 

I have the interview this friday and i'm nervous but really want the job as the pay is good and i do have some interests. I'd appreciate any advice a lot and what you would do if you're in my position. thank you !!",23Jan2020,1

she joined a club im apart of and i feel chased by her, she has stopped speaking when she gets near me and gives off the most horrible negative vibe. it gives me horrible feelings of anxiety. i cant imagine she feels good to do this stuff either.

230,"This is going to be long, sorry, but please, if you have the time, read it and let me know what you think.

Where do I begin? This will probably be the most detailed reddit post I’ve ever made, but I feel like it’s necessary.

Alright, so I’m 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. I’ve never been in a relationship before. The girl this is about is my same age, but she has been in one relationship before. 

I started at my school last year, it’s an early college high school, and the student body isn’t very large. Last year, on the first day of school, I saw her. She was wearing a brown silk shirt and black jeans. She had light brown hair and glasses. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something about her kept distracting me from class. I kept gazing at her, and for the rest of the day I couldn’t get her off my mind. It was fine, just a simple crush. That was 2018, it’s now 2020, and I’ve had to deal with it every day. The feeling is different now though, it brings me physical pain, my chest hurts whenever I think about her, like my heart is literally going to burst. 

For all of the first semester of freshman year, I only occasionally spoke to her in classes, and I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t really try to make any (the consequence of starting high school with your cousins). I did talk to some people in study hall and in other classes. During the second semester of freshman year, me and her became “friends”. I use quotations because I never hung out with her outside of class. Eventually the summer came, and I still wouldn’t say that we were good friends. I didn’t even see her over the summer. 

This year has been different. I feel like we became close really fast. We started hanging out regularly four months ago, but we hang out every single weekend basically, we text constantly in a group chat with other people, text each other a bit basically daily, and I feel like we’re a lot closer than we were at the start of the year. The entirety of the first semester, she was dating a kind of toxic guy, which she’ll now admit. In December, she broke up with him. I feel like since then, me and her have grown even closer. 

When I hang out with my friends (including her), we usually just watch movies in my basement, lately she’s been snuggling up next to me, and cuddling with me. It’s been a while since we’ve hung out in my basement, but last time we did, she wrapped her arms and legs around me, she even put my hand on her thigh. She also laid her head on my chest and closed her eyes and smiled. I didn’t think this meant she liked me though. She’s a really affectionate person who isn’t afraid to show it. I thought she just saw me as a friend still. I realized however, that the only person she ever did this with was one of my other friends, who I later found out she liked. For a while I was convinced she liked me. 

One fateful day, she came up to me and our other friends after class and told us she thought a kid in our class was cute, and she’s been like stalking him since. This was discouraging, but I think it’s possible to like multiple people at once. Lately, she’s a lot more disappointed when I miss school, which is weird, because I only have like one class with her this term. She also says more affectionate things to me, and tries to get me to be more affectionate. I know this sounds incredibly like teenage bullshit, but she also started using the red heart when texting me. 

I’ve kind of dig myself into a hole. I think I have low self confidence and I’ve been hurt a lot by people before, and I’m so scared of people not feeling the same way, that I’ve forced myself to put on an asshole act. I admit that I can be a huge dickhead, and just put my friends down when I get uncomfortable. She used to just say things like “Why are you like this?” or “Who hurt you?” but now she responds with “Nooo you love me!” or “Admit it, you don’t really hate me”. 

I feel like I should share a recent experience I had with her. We went roller skating for a school event as a group. While we were standing in line, she was looking through a big window at the skating rink. She saw her ex boyfriend with a girl he said he would never date. She froze there, she had just gotten over her breakup. We were at a school event and surrounded by other students, I could see in her eyes that she was on the verge of tears for a bit, but a few minutes later, she seemed fine. We were still standing in line, and I realized that I knew the girl in front of us, and had a pretty embarrassing story about her, one of my friends wanted to hear it, so I went outside with him and told him. When I came back, she wanted to hear it too, so I took her outside to tell her. When we were outside I realized she was crying. Not like bawling, just tears running down. I tried to start my story, but I couldn’t, something was stopping me. Suddenly instinct came over me, and I found myself with her in my arms, bawling her eyes out. I just held her there for a minute or two and asked if she was ok. We went back inside and I stayed by her side the rest of the night, then we went back to my house and took some pictures with a Polaroid camera my sister bought. She left, and about an hour later, she texted me saying “thx for ur support”. 

Since then, it seems like she wants to get closer to me. My issue is, I can’t tell if she wants to become better friends, or something more. I’ve noticed that she likes smaller guys for some reason. Her boyfriend was 5”6 and skinny, and everyone she crushes on is like that or smaller. My issue is I’m 6”2, and I look muscular, even though I’m actually pretty chubby. I also think she asked someone else to an upcoming dance. I think that she either doesn’t like me romantically, and wants to be better friends, or she likes me but feels like I don’t like her back, which I’ve conveyed through hiding my emotions and being distant. 

I can’t really talk to my friends about this, so saying anything at all helps out, thanks if you read all of this.",23Jan2020,1
231,"I think I'm broken. I had this hot/cute friend last year (a perfect mix of both) that I couldn't stop thinking about having sex with. I furiously and I mean furiously tried to cum over his Instagram pic of him diving (his body is perfect to me and I did eventually cum). Funny thing is, I'M NOT GAY. This may sound stupid but I'm not. I watch primarily gay porn and have gay feelings but whenever I go to act on them with another guy it's always grossed me out. If anyone knows why this is then please comment because I feel broken. Is it just the way I am? I have never been sexually abused. Maybe it's a gay fetish?

232,"My BF (Male, 21) and I  (Female,  22) have been together for a little over 3 years. We used to be so cute and had so much fun together. He is a perfect guy until sexcomes up.

 About a year ago he hid an app from me and had pictures from my sisters social media and pictures of me without me or her knowing and was jacking off to them along with social media pictures of others I know. In the first year we were dating he used to get upset at me if I didn't ""finish"" duringsex. He doesn't do this anymore but he has made me feel so worthless and sad. I don't know why I stuck with him but I did. 


This year he has been pretty great until I found some things from a couple years ago on his phone including flirting with a girl in a group chat. I don't know if I can do better or not but he is also perfect in every way other that things like this. He is my first love so I think that is why this choice is harder as well and I know I'm not perfect either. I interrogate him alot over things and have major trust issues. We also live together and own a cat together. I don't know what to do. 


We have had so many great memories from this relationship and are fairly great now but I'm having trouble with the past. Do you think I can work past this or no? I love him so much but hate him at the same time. He can also be great though. Do you all think he can change or will do things to hurt me agian? TL.DR",23Jan2020,1

He calls me ""the vet"" because I know what I'm doing at work but I feel like maybe he's just being nice or talking to other people similarly.... I just think he's soooo cute and I want to try and get his attention. I tried a bunch of flirting tactics, honestly all the subtle ones I could think of without getting myself in trouble and flat out saying hey you're hot I like you. I work at a normal coffee job so I'm not worried about it interfering with work, and I'm looking for a new job... He makes me smile so much at work and I just wanna be all over him.

234,So last night I had sex with this guy. We gave each other oral and we had sex missionary style. He pulled out and came on my stomach. Then he got behind me and had sex and he pulled out and came into my mouth. I know it was stupid but he didn't wear a condom and I don't take birth control. I think the last time I got my period was in September or October; it is very irregular because of pcos and I don't keep track because of it. The last time I had sex was over a year ago in December of 2018. How much do I have a chance of getting pregnant from this?,23Jan2020,1
236,So I’ll just lay it all out. I’m 26(F) caretaking my father who is in his 70’s with COPD. There’s many battles that come with it but I’ll keep it simple. I grew up with a lot of anger in my home basically my mother was great (died when I was 13 from cancer) but my father was a monster growing up. We had all the money in the world but money can’t buy love. He is pretty much at the end and I’m taking care of him. He has 6 kids and I’m the only one willing to take care of him. That backs up my claim of he’s a monster lol. I think what my struggle is just coping with the whole situation. I’m so angry and resentful. I guess I just wonder if anyone else out there has dealt with something similar. Or has any advice.,23Jan2020,1

It started minor enough that I thought I was sleeping on my right side the wrong way. That when I stood up it felt like I pulled a muscle each time. Two months later at a tournament I went to see the sports medicine trainer, who told me I had a partial dislocation. My parents saw her pop it back into place, but the pain remained. It remained the same through marching band which, I admit, I should have dropped from, but I didn’t know it’s effect. I saw a sports medicine doctor, who immediately booted me to physical therapy, who was convinced it was a muscle strain. As soon as school resumed the pain got worse. I spent the halftime of the homecoming football game crying because everyone else had left, and I was in too much pain to leave the bleachers. We went back to see the doctor, who finally agreed to an MRI, which revealed after a three week process some signs of bursitis and a potential impingement. Neither of which we were informed about by the doctor. The pain kept getting worse. Keep in mind that through all of this I was never prescribed anything. I’ve simply been keeping it in check with Tylenol, Advil, and the use of a crutch.

This pain is almost always there. It shows up whenever I’m not lying back or seated, and it always cuts through whatever I use to dull it. And as a result I’m almost constantly in an irritable state that’s driven away almost everyone I was friends with. Even my girlfriend dumped me because my irritability would lead to fights that would always end with me being “the bad guy.”

I’ve been using red light/infrared light therapy on the side in the hopes of some improvement, and have started seeing a chiropractor, who is convinced it’s a congenital cam hip impingement that was worsened by inflammation. I’m honestly praying that he’s right so we finally have an answer. I wouldn’t call myself a truly devout Christian but I’ve spent nights praying for help and relief, and I’ve often wondered what I did wrong to deserve this fate. I’m going through therapy to treat the mental effects of this pain. I’m only 17 years old.

I just need some advice, anything! For people with even worse pain, how do you manage? How do you keep it from consuming you and dictating your daily life? I can’t remember the last time I’ve had a genuinely good day since last May. Just please, tell me whatever you think might help me.",23Jan2020,1
238,"i’m 14f, she’s 17f (ages just for context). she turns 18 in late april. we’re sort of friends, she’s my section leader in band so we see each other a fair amount but don’t have classes. she likes girls too so there’s a shot but i don’t know if i should tell her or not because it could be seen as creepy really fast. if i did tell her, it wouldn’t be for a while anyway. sorry for formatting/grammar",23Jan2020,1
239,"I'm 17, and in 11th grade. And I've struggled with loneliness in 10th grade. I had no friends, no social media, no social life, nothing. I was always just the quiet kid in class, and sat alone at the cafeteria. It was like that for a whole year. I thought there would be no hope for me, until I moved schools in 11th grade and feel like I found my place. Now I've got friends, and am more open socially, and accept myself for who I am, as opposed to when I was in 10th grade.

I also met this girl, we'll call her Rene and I really liked her. I found out she liked me as well, and we eventually hit it off, going out together and all that, but not really officially dating. This was about the first few months.

Though I was more outgoing now, I was still very quiet, reserved, and introverted. I would mostly engage in conversation if I really needed it. We argued about this one time. Rene is my opposite, personality wise. She is very sociable, very dominant in group conversations, not at all awkward unlike me, and she kept insinuating that I would become more ""improved"" if I stopped being so quiet and engaged more, telling me that it would be better for me in my life to be more vocal. I told her that my quietness wasn't something to be improved upon, rather it was who I am, and we both needed to accept that. Though she did tell me later on that she still accepts me for who I am, and respects what I want to do with myself, she told me that this turned her off, saying that I didn't want to improve myself. That also turned me off, because I thought she didn't trust me enough to take care of myself. And I do admit, If I could have just found better words to explain to her, we would have understood each other better. I started to understand that my introversion was not a flaw and has its own pros and cons, just like her personality. But It was too late to explain to her, we became awkward after that and stopped talking for a long time.

I got lonely during that time. She was the only person I chatted with at home, and though I had people I talked to at school, it wasn't as meaningful as with Rene. I missed her, and one night I was so lonely that I decided I would tell her how much I missed her and loved her. And I did the next day, I told her I loved her and wanted to start courting her. She said she was okay and asked me If I wanted to wait. I said yes. After a few days of thinking and coming back to my senses, though, I realized I had fallen out of love with this person, and I should have stopped at ""I miss you."" I realized that I only missed our friendship, not her. And so I felt shitty, and guilty for not thinking about all of this before I spoke.

This has happened before, when I was so lonely I told another girl shit like this without even thinking, and end up hurting her after I realize that my emotions got the best of me. I hate it. I really thought I was better now, and conquered my problems with loneliness and learned to manage my emotions better.

After I had that conversation with Rene, she told me she wasn't mad, but disappointed in me. But I knew she was also deeply hurt by this. Her friends have told me how she really missed me as well, and how she acts when she talks about me. She told me that I really should have thought this through, because this affects not only her, but other people as well. I was well aware of those things, and fully acknowledge how much I fucked up here. I'm disappointed in myself.

We have four days off of school, and I don't know how to deal with myself right now. I know what I did was for the best and will be better for the both of us in the long run, but I really hate that I hurt someone because of my poor emotional management again. I can't imagine how I'm gonna look her or our friends in the eyes next week.

I just want to know how to better manage my emotions. Sometimes I feel like I don't know what I really want for myself. I want to know how I can make this hurt less for the both of us. I want to know how I can be more connected with myself, and how I can forgive myself when I make these mistakes. I don't want to get rid of this guilt, I deserve every bad thing I am feeling and telling myself right now. I want to understand myself better so I can better deal with these kinds of situations when they arise in the future.

TL;DR: I liked someone, and she liked me as well. We argued and stopped talking for a while. I became very lonely and told her that I missed her a lot and wanted to start courting her, but I realized I only missed our friendship and that I fell out of love with her. I told her this a week later, and I feel nothing but disappointment in myself.",23Jan2020,1
240,"I’m currently living in a university apartment with two other guys. I just moved in at the beginning of the semester and things are pretty great except one glaring problem. One of my room mates substance abuse problems (call him S). 

S is prescribed multiple hard medications (Xanax, Wellbutrin &amp; Trazodone) and mixes them with heavy drinking &amp; smoking every night (which is completely legal in my state as we are all 21+). My other room mate and S’s long term friend has watched his whole downward spiral unfold and is obviously extremely concerned about him. I have personal experience in the past on a few of the same medications he is currently taking and know how extremely life threatening the concoction of just the alcohol and Wellbutrin alone is.

242,"Background information: my mother has never had a great relationship with her own mom. It got worse when my grandma got remarried (when my mom was a teenager) to a man who does not treat my mom well.

Her mom and stepdad had their first kid, putting a big age gap between my mom and their new daughter. Her stepdad has always treated his biological children especially this first daughter, better than he has treated my mom. Because of various reasons but primarily the large age gap between the two of them and the fact that they have never lived in the same house or even same town, my mom and her half-sister don't have much of a relationship.

About a year ago my aunt (that first biological daughter of my grandma and stepgrandpa) gets engaged. By now my mom has been living halfway across the country for over 10 years and still has no real relationship with her half sister.
My grandma kept asking if my mom would be coming (from across the country during a major holiday weekend) to the wedding.
There were a few reasons my mom said no:
1) It would be insanely expensive to travel to the wedding location during that holiday weekend
2) my mom and her half-sister don't really talk or have a relationship 
3) her stepdad doesn't treat her well and he only put on a thrown together potluck backyard wedding when my mom got married, but was spending an exorbitant amount on the half-sisters wedding so that would have been hurtful for my mom to go through
There's more if I think but those are the top reasons.
So my mom said no only listing the reasons of the cost and how she'd have to take off work during a busy season (both true)
My grandma kept bringing it up to her through text though.
Fast forward and the wedding happens and a few days later my grandma texts my mom asking if she'd sent a gift and my mom tells her she didn't. This makes my grandma enraged and she starts tearing into my mom about how awful she's been for not coming and not sending a gift yada yada. She then gets my moms full blood sibling to harass her about it all.

I live and work about an hour or so away from my grandparents and had been close to my grandma growing up. This past year however, she has treated me poorly as well in numerous ways that have made me stop spending time with them, even before all the drama between her and my mom. I haven't addressed any if this with her though. I've just kept my distance. 
My aunt and her new husband though, live in the same town as me and I've run into them a few times. Her husband has subtly and not so subtly mentioned what's been going on and has been trying to get me to go visit my grandparents.
My issues with this are:
1) He doesn't know me or my mom and so he doesn't know the full story
2) He's barely been in the family a few months and thinks he can butt his way in to our business and control things.

Sorry for the dump. I needed a rant.
Any ideas on what I should do about my grandparents? Or what I should do about my aunts new husband getting involved in our problems that he doesn't even understand?",23Jan2020,1

I found a couple possible places where I can rent a room for about 6 months or so while I build up my money. 

I haven’t told anyone about this. Until tonight that is. I told my friends my plan and they said i’m being absolutely stupid. I mean sure, but I can’t take the stress anymore. Anything is better than being in my current city, I can’t take it.

I was so excited about leaving. Everything was going smoothly. Am I being stupid?

I know it’s not a lot of money, but it’s just enough to keep me on my feet temporarily. What’s the worst that can happen? I have to turn around and come back to my situation now?

245,"Alittle over a year ago I started dating my ex again after getting out of a relationship that ended rough. I lost my virginity to her two days after I broke up with my last gf. She was kinda like a rebound but after 2 months of talking again we decided to move in together the reason for this was really because at the time I was homeless and she came into alot of money and helped my dad and brother out with money and I subsequently moved in with her. I never got with her for the money. I felt alone and with her I felt comfort well after a few months together I got into smoking weed and that really helped me with my anxiety and stress from dealing with my past I told myself i would only smoke for a few months. Well as time goes on she becomes very aggressive and in some terms mentally abusive it's to the point where I dont have any self confidence and believe that I'm always in the wrong bc of the amount of times I've been bitched at for the stupidest of things At this point i was thinking of leaving but my main problem was that i had nowhere else to go my family(dad and brother) moved out of state and I was 17 at the time I had a job but it was a bullshit check and I couldn't do anything as time goes by all my pain and suffering has built up so much that I have grown to sexually dislike her and even have a hard time getting off. However I am still with her bc she basically forced me to move in with her sister to help her out after she had gone thru a rought patch and needed help in life a year has gone by and I can't take it anymore I feel like I can't leave bc if I do she is gonna explode and off herself or something bc she is emotionally unstable I dont know what to do I dont know what I can do and I'm even considering offing myself just to escape the pain pls I need help

264,"Sup Reddit,

If you don’t fancy reading a long, depressing cry for help in the area of love and friendships then don’t bother reading on because this really quite boring... I’m now beyond the point though where I think I’m capable of helping myself because I don’t know what to do or which direction to travel. I’ve considered taking my own life more times than you can imagine but rest assured, that’ll never happen. I could never do that to my family and never will. I guess that’s where it’s an issue - I’m sorta stuck in limbo and it’s not where I had expected my life to be at age 24. 

My problems started at University. Before that, I was a straight A student with friends coming out of my arse and a family that I bonded well with everyday. I really was high on life. People wanted to be around me and I felt enjoyment being around other people; being a big kid and having a laugh. I was sort of a closet nerd too - loved my tech and still do to this day. Speaking of the closet... you guessed it; I’m gay and I’m not out. You’ll need to know that in a moment. 

I made a few friends at university. Two of which I still speak to and one of which is whom is causing me problems. When I say causing me problems, I’m not implying that he is to blame for this because I’m not naive enough to assume that my undying love for him isn’t a massive part of the issue... Here we go. 

He’s a good lad I’d say. I sorta feel like he’d taken advantage of how much of a nice guy I tended to be at University (and in general), but he made up for that by supporting me when I needed it. He isn’t the most attentive of people and often gave off vibes that were sorta cruel and straight-to-the-point. He wasn’t afraid to speak his mind and sometimes that could be a lil hurtful. Especially when he usually did this in a social setting, around other people. We got on nonetheless and we knew we’d be friends for quite a long time, because we had some pretty good laughs in our time and had similar habits. We smoked a lil weed and experimented with some other drugs, amongst dossing about playing video games and occasionally making time to study! Having said that, we were probably bad influences on eachother in general but not to the point where it was harmful. We knew where the line was and we kept our lives in check. 

Post university, it started to get hairy over time. This is when I realised how strong the feelings I had for him were - we were now 100 miles apart and weren’t in each others faces anymore. I missed that, but I didn’t miss the lifestyle that came along with it. We still spoke everyday though. I think it was more of a ‘comfort’ thing. He certainly wasn’t gay but we text each other daily regardless, even if it was just to call one another a nonce or a c**t. Yep, that was us. Weird. I invited him over a few times and vice versa. I got to know his friends, his family, and they were all pretty fond of me or so I think. He was never interested in knowing my friends too well though; maybe that’s just how he rolls and I didn’t care too much. My friends didn’t think too much of him but never cared to explain why. He tended to come across quite miserable when he was around me and my friends. I wasn’t sure what I was doing that created that atmosphere over time so it always left me to plug that gap in my knowledge with whatever fitted best. Does he know I’m gay? Does he know I like him? Am I just a boring asshole?

Time went on, and things didn’t improve. I just felt like although he was messaging me everyday, he was doing it to tick a box. Not because he wanted to. I didn’t quite understand, because even though when we were on the phone, playing PlayStation online together, or in person having a chat, he’d be quiet and dismissive, he’d be the first to question me if I hadn’t replied or I disappeared for a day. In fact, he’d spam me until you eventually got a response. This is where I became unstuck. I was trapped in what was a really toxic position, where I became more and more frustrated at how I was being treated. He’d keep me in his life, but at often times I’d feel like he was low-key bullying me, especially around his other mates. When I was drunk, I’d bring it up with him sometimes. He’d shun it off and call me weird or paranoid for suggesting it, but know it was f*cking real! None of my friends acted like that with me. If I invited another friend to do something, they’d jump at the opportunity and if they couldn’t make it, they’d be sure to rearrange immediately. This friend though, wouldn’t. He’d wait until he wanted to. He’d wait until he had nothing better to do. But why was he so insistent on texting me so regularly? Did he just feel comfort in knowing that he had someone readily available to him? He didn’t ever come to me for moral or life support though. So, what was it?

In a nutshell, I had a feeling he didn’t like me but wasn’t sure why, or why he insisted on staying so close to me.  This lasted FOREVER until we eventually had a fight after he’d made me feel like shit in front of his family one night around his place. I lost my cool after they went and he immediately resorted to his old tricks - “you’re weird, your head is f*cked, you’re overthinking” etc. Although, I know I wasn’t overthinking. I’m never treated like that, by anyone. The way he looks down on me, the way he insists on lowering my self-esteem in front of his friends, and the rest. By the way, this isn’t banter. I know the difference. He can call me pretty much whatever he likes and I wouldn’t care. It’s more than that - he knows what gets me down and he repeatedly pushes those buttons and looks at me as if to say ‘yep, what are you going to do about it?’

Why do I still like him? Fuck knows. I guess I’m stuck in the past and can’t forget what things used to be like. He used to look up to me. Ask me for advice on Math, Computing etc. Now though I feel like he thinks I’m not worth that and am pretty dumb (I’m not). Either way, something happened along the way that made him lose respect for me and I don’t know what it is for the life of me.

The crux of the problem is this:-

I can’t just ‘disappear’. He’d get suspicious that I had liked him and wonder why I needed to suddenly needed to drop off the face of the earth. He might know I’m gay, but I don’t want to have him confirm that by way of me distancing myself. More so, I’d find it SO hard to disappear. I still have feelings for the guy and worry about him sometimes. He’s going through a tough time, but I can’t help but feel like it’s being taken out on me *sigh*. 

What else could I do? Speaking to him less just doesn’t fucking help at all. He’ll wonder what on earth I’m doing. Usually if I distance myself, he sorta turns into this super nice caring guy that messages me and calls me even more. That, to me, confirms that he KNOWS what he’s doing. He’s not stupid. He’s fearful of me leaving. But why can’t he just be a nice guy all of the time arggggggh! Besides, speaking to him less just makes me annoyed at myself because I have to ACTIVELY put effort in to achieve that. He’s on my mind from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep. In an ideal world, he’d be decent, I’d speak to him whenever I fancied it, and vice versa. Things have gotten really obsessive and petty, and I’m not sure how it can be fixed. I don’t want to lose him; I want to lose the dynamic that has grown so toxic over recent years. Maybe, a month or so of minimal contact will allow him to realise that you can’t treat people in that way and that he misses speaking to me? Sorta like hitting the reboot button? I equally wouldn’t mind cutting ties completely but HOW?!!!! I need to move on with my life and I know that perhaps the obvious answer is to just ignore him. I can’t do that to the guy, no matter how manipulative he can be. 

Ask whatever questions you like and I’ll answer as best I can. Or just keep scrolling and roll your eyes in disgust. I’ll be OK. I probably come across as quite a loser writing this but jheeeze this is a first for me and I can’t be bothered with therapy and all of that. Maybe that’s stupid on my part. I am however going through a patch of depression which may hinder how paranoid I get. I care too much about things I ought not to, and maybe that’s why he knows he can treat me however he wants to because I’m too soft to disappear on anyone. Meh, what do I do?",23Jan2020,1
265,"Hi. Every week I take a photo of my work schedule that’s posted each Sunday. This past Sunday, according to my schedule I was supposed to come in on Wednesday. When I arrived today (Wednesday), my boss told me he had changed the schedule and that I was actually supposed to come in on Tuesday (Yesterday). I asked how I was supposed to know (since I hadn’t been in since Sunday) and why he didn’t call and he said it was because he just assumed I was an unreliable no-show. Then he fired me for not showing up to work on Tuesday - even after I showed him my photo of the schedule. He said that he couldn’t see the dates on the photo (my name is at the bottom of the list so it wasn’t captured in that pic but the date of when I took the photo is still relevant) and asked me to leave. How was I meant to know if I wasn’t at work until my assigned shift and no one told me? Is this legal?",23Jan2020,1
266,"So today in my baking class, my group made biscuits and gravy. My teacher had extra sausage left and asked if anyone wanted to make patties. Me and another guy said yes and she gave us the rest of the meat.

I hadn't made patties like that before so of course I asked question after question to make sure they would come out right. The other guy and my teacher where happy to help. When it came time to cook them, I messed up big time. I didn't know at the time but I turned the heat up to high and didn't fatten the patties enough so the insides were a bit pink. 

The patties start smoking and I take them off in a panic. My teacher opens some windows to air out the room and the outside of my patties are burned, not terribly but noticable. At that point I'm just slightly embarrassed and am kinda joking about it until this one girl starts going on about how I can't cook. 

I start getting really self-conscious about it and ask people if they are willing to try it. Everyone that did, including the guy who also made patties said I did fine. Now I'm questioning if they were just avoiding hurting my feelings or not. 

I then start to be super sensitive over the event and was in a crappy mood over the whole day. I when off on a guy who was also in my class who tried laughing about it, I apologized after immediately after I realized I was being aggressive.

I talked to my friends and my boyfriend and they all told me that it happens and I just have to keep trying. I know that and I will try but they whole ""You can't cook"" line cut really deep. I know one burnt sausage doesn't make me a bad cook but part of me does accept that at all.

267,"Its kind of a long story and im currently crying so pardon me for not writing all the details feel free to ask questions.. but i have a little brother, i believe he is six or seven (as you can see our relationship is very broken, who doesnt know theyre little brothers age?) And my mom had him so he could force my stepfather into staying with her (which he didnt), and just like with us she is raising him horribly wrong, she only pays attention to his physical needs but is a horrible mother when it comes to his emotional needs, she doesnt pay attention to him and always tries to keep him distracted so he wont bother her. This, paired with the constant fighting with my stepfather during his early development years has made him very aggressive and toxic. As for me, ive lived with him all my life and i think i can count with mt hands the times ive hugged him or spent time with him.. he always knocks on my door and enters my room to try and talk/play with me but i always tell him to leave.. i know the way he behaves is not his fault, and its completely my fault for holding him accountable for his actions and therefore not wanting to spend time with him... but tonight was a turning point for me... its currently 1 am over here and i went to take a shower because i start college again tomorrow.. i took a long shower because im depressed and my hygiene hasnt been the best.. and after my long shower i get out and see him touching my gaming console which ive told him many times is off limits for him, i said it in a rather loud tone and my mother woke up.. she came to my room and seeing him up way past his bedtime made her angry, she grabbed him by the ear and dragged him to his room where i heard her take away his tablet and hit him multiple times, it was really weird that he wasnt crying, at that age that wouldve made me scream and cry.. so i waited for my mom to leave his room and opened my door a little and listened for a bit. I heard a sniffle and i hurried to his room because i felt horrible for what i did... he immediately covered himself in sheets and i heard him struggle so hard to muffle and hide his crying... i remembered all the times my mither screamed at him and yelled at him to shut up when he was crying and hit him even more and it destroyed me knowing this is what he did know, that that was the reason i never heard him  cry anymore, god knows how many nights hes spent crying and i didnt know about it... i hugged him so tight and told him that i loved him and that i would let him play tomorrow, he hugged me back with his tiny arms and slowly but surely stopped crying and and gave me a kiss and told me he loved me too.. it took everything i had in me nkt to cry right there, since i told him i would let him play his favorute game he started talking to me about what he wanted to do and stuff but i was on the verge of tears so i tried to hurry it up and tell him to sleep and that i would let him play tomorrow... as soon as i closed my door this pain hit me and i was filled with regret knowing ive lived with him his entire life but ive left him alone so many times... i want to know that theres hope i want to know what to do i want to fix this i dont want him to suffer anymore but my own mental state is an issue what should i do i need help..",23Jan2020,1
268,"Yo, okay, so I know this was a dumbass move and very silly, but hear me out. I just moved into a new apartment three weeks ago, and turns out it's got bloody roaches. I'm only afraid of two things - bugs and cops - so like, this was a big deal.

Anyway, one of them got into my bedroom today so I panicked. I went and bought Raid Max - a bug spray designed to kill roaches and keep killing them with a residual effect for about 6 months. Sprayed the room down on all the baseboards, windows, door, etc. That part was fine.

In my panic, though, I also got this brilliant idea. ""It either got in from around the door, or in the air vent. I should spray the damn vent!"" So yes, I sprayed the damn air vent. Twice. With the lingering-effect pesticide. Like a moron.

I've already opened the window and turned on the air conditioning to air out the room, doing that for a few hours. But this IS my bedroom, and I DID spray the vent. So, now I'm worried, especially because I sleep in there. Do I need to crack open the air vent and try to get rid of the spray manually...? Is this a potential health hazard? Or am I worrying too much?

Any advice appreciated. Any mockery is understandable, thank you have a good day. '-'",23Jan2020,1
269,"Me (19M) met girl (19F) who joined my college. We hit it off and have a ton of mutual interests. We spend most of every day together and I’m self aware enough to know I’m slowly falling for her. I feel really happy and comfortable with her like I haven’t in a long time. The problem is she has a boyfriend back home. 

She doesn’t talk about him much and she’s getting tired of him being too clingy when she’s gone but they’re still a thing. Anyways another issue is our time hanging out is kind of crossing borders. Typically involves mild groping and cuddling on my bed while watching tv. Anyways there’s definitely a sexual undertone, not going into details just hasn’t been anything “direct” yet. Tried to kiss her once she said no cause she had a boyfriend then went right back to being all over me.

270,"First, my workplace is toxic as heck. There is always some dishonesty/mind games happening from management. I just take it for granted.

I'm on a floor I love despite all this, even though a couple coworkers are extremely hostile to me. One I believe sees me a threat to his promotion, and is always bragging to me he can get away with stuff I can't because ""I'm a cis white male"". Because he is friends with the managers, I have been reluctant to complain about him. The female manager he's friends with criticized my sexual harassment claim because I went to management instead of dealing with it myself, and has criticized me for ""being fake nice to men"", which ""causes them to get mad at me"". His aggressive behavior began soon after I complained about his manager friend

A week ago, a few days after I notified management about the other coworker yelling at me and verbally abusing me, all my shifts were moved to a different floor. I was unscheduled for the first week of February, which has never happened before. When I asked the terrible aforementioned female manager  why, she replied, ""I saw you had been accidentally unscheduled for the whole month. The system was saying you took the month off, and I wanted to clarify it with you because it didn't seem right"".

I don't buy this story for a second, mostly because this manager lies like a politician, but also because there's no way for anyone to accidentally request a month off in our system, and the schedules are done by the week a few weeks in advance.

I asked her why I was moved floors and was told ""you're great at customer service"", but customer service is why I excelled and loved my floor because it's what I excel at, not at this new floor.

I ask these same questions to the manager in charge of scheduling: he is completely unaware about the ""accidentally unscheduled"" bit, and when I asked why I was moved, I was told ""manager M and I need to sit down and have a meeting with you"". Both these managers are not the store manager, the big cheese. He was very serious and unfriendly about it, which he never is. This is a different take than ""you're great at customer service"".

I can't think of anything I could have possibly done, especially after months of enduring a lot of aggressive and discriminatory behavior. What on earth is going on and how to go about it? I contacted HR today, and they advised me to contact the store manager to find out when the meeting is and what it's about. But the meeting would be next Tuesday at the earliest, and if the store manager refuses to tell me, until then I have no clear answer on what's going on. It's like I'm being blind-sided.",23Jan2020,1

277,"So. I’m not sure if this is going to sound kind of, like, stupid and insignificant, but I really didn’t know where else to go and I was hoping the people of the internet could help. You see, I started dating my ex almost two years ago and I truly and deeply fell in love. We moved in together in May of last year. And that was truly the beginning of the end. That house, that situation, wasn’t good for either of us. It made us lazy, it made us angry. All in all, it made us terrible. We had some issues with the neighbors so our rental company moved us into a new house. My thoughts were that it was going to be great for us and rebuild our relationship to the strength it once had. I’ve never been more wrong in my life. The day I signed the lease, she and I broke up. Since I couldn’t really afford the bills on my own and she didn’t have anywhere else to go (and because I couldn’t bear to be without her, but I’ll never admit that), we both decided it best for her to continue living with me. Now she’s moving back to her home state of Arizona in two months. I’m happy for her, I truly am. She gets to go home to her friends and family and live in her childhood home. She’s talked for years how much she wants to go home, and now she gets that chance. As much as I am happy for her, I’m also just... not okay. I’m not sure how to be okay with the person I’ve fallen in love with leaving. The person I’ve seen every day for almost two years. The person I’ve talked to every day for almost two years. Now there’s a high chance I’ll never see her again. Not to mention her taking all the pets we have. I’m not sure what type of advice could be given or even what type I’m looking for. But anything and everything is very much welcome and a thanks in advance is definitely warranted.",23Jan2020,1
278,"I don't know this person. My bf hasn't been friends with this person since well over two years ago, and the friendship died out naturally, lack of similar interests, new friends groups emerging, yadda yadda.

My boyfriend is a victim of sexual assault, perpetrated by his uncle and cousins. He knows first hand what a sexual assault looks and feels like and wouldn't wish that upon anybody on Earth. When we so much as kissed in the beginning of our relationship, he asked repeatedly for my consent to do so and I had to, repeatedly, affirm to him that I consented. The same happened with sex not long after.

From my information: They had never attended a party together, Never been in a private setting alone with one another, never been sexually interested in each other. For all intents and purposes, these two not only ever inerracted in the presence of other people, or under a societal obligation to be decent.

What this mounts to is a my boyfriend, who well understands sexual assault as a victim, being accused of sexual assault by an old aquantience that rarely, if ever, had any possibility of being alone with my boyfriend in a way that could have facilitated sexual contact.

I say this to fully establish the fact that I believe, using what knowledge I have available to me, that my boyfriend is innocent. *My advice here is not for a judgement as to weather he is or is not guilty.*

I'm an RA at my university (seprate from my boyfriend's), so admittedly I should know how to handle this, but... I don't. I sucked at these kinds of scenarios in training, and now I'm getting one put on my doorstep. Oh, and by the way, it's one of the people I care most about.

I did some reading and discovered that Title IX doesn't treat the fasely accused very well. There are a miriad of cases where students' criminal proceedings are dropped basically instantly, while they're also sanctioned by Title IX and expelled.

These students go on to sue the institution for lost tuition for the semesters they would have been enrolled had the school performed it's duty to protect them against a false accusation, and most win.

He's a junior, in his spring semester. He has 2 semesters to go after this one. He's considering trying to ignore it, and hoping that the allegations stay rumors.

I don't know where to tell my boyfriend to go for help, or hell, even where I can go to get better guidance on this issue. I'm going to the counseling office first thing tomorrow morning to see what they can do to help me through the stress of this event.

What can I say or do in the meantime to help my boyfriend through this? What can I do to help him?",23Jan2020,1

280,"so some background, i had a group of friends for over 10 years and we all were very close. last year me and another had a big falling out and dont talk. doesnt like my relationship and told me none of the rest of them do either and they all apparently lie to me about not being able to hang out. so i distanced myself a lot from the others. 

throughout the year they've still included me in the group chat and greeted each other on their birthdays and even had little dinners for it which i didnt respond to. i did, however, message each of them individually to greet them. i had also tried reaching out to a few for random convos and did not get much reciprocation.

so one of them is getting married in two weeks and invited me. we've all known the couple since they dated in high school so its a big event. 

i didn't show to the bridal shower (didn't rsvp though) and to my knowledge i was not invited to the bachelorette. despite the fact that i knew it would be awkward for me, i thought i'd suck it up and at least show to the wedding. 

now however my birthday has passed, not one of them have greeted me. i know people get busy but to see them greet each other throughout the group chat (that i am still oddly in) and for me not to get anything, kind of hurts. and now i feel like why even show up when it seems like i'm not even wanted around. 

i really don't think i should go. but i want to be considerate of my saved spot. i just don't know how to say it. i don't want to make this event about me or make any drama for the bride as it is a special day for her. i honestly think going would be less tension and at least i won't have to have anxiety about being there and feeling secluded sitting elsewhere. 

how should i say it without coming off as being salty or dramatic?",23Jan2020,1
281,"So, this story starts with about two weeks ago. I went out to a club with a couple guy friends. I was under the impression that it was a bar, but it turned out to be a club with dancing etc. Anyways, to sum up the situation, a girl showed interest in me and started to grind on me. I slipped away from the situation, and left. I have no tolerance for cheaters and I would never do that. I went home and told my girlfriend about it... she was upset by it. 
Anyways, fast forward to now. I got invited to go out again tomorrow. I told my girlfriend, and the moment I told her, I could tell something was wrong. I asked her, and she said nothing was wrong. Later, she told me that if I decided to go, that I don’t tell her if any other girls hit on me until the next day, because shes going out with her friends tomorrow night too, and she doesn’t want it to ruin her night if I told her. I asked her “is it going to make you anxious if I go no matter what?” And she said yes. I can’t help but feel as if I’m being held back. I don’t expect her to control her anxiety, but I still feel like it’s not fair to me. I feel like getting hit on by other people when you’re in a relationship is a part of life, and it’s just a possibility that both parties in a relationship need to expect... what matters is how you handle the situation, which I have proven to handle a situation like that properly. To be honest, I don’t really want to go out tomorrow, however, I don’t want to feel held back when I actually DO want to go out in the future.

284,"So some context, I’ve always been kind of a huge nerd. I don’t love school but I’ve always done well in it and I just generally love learning and reading and all that stuff. I’ve also (unintentionally) always been kind of a teacher’s pet because I like to participate in class a lot. This is important for the story 

So a month or two ago my math teacher asked me to help him grade some papers during lunch. I said sure because why not (he pretty much just gave me an answer sheet and i graded based off of that). I go in semi regularly to help him grade stuff, no more than once or twice per week. 

After school the first day I helped him I (f) was talking to my friend (m) about it, making “of course I’m that kid” kind of jokes. While we were talking he started making really weird and inappropriate jokes about me and the teacher. Honestly it was making me a little uncomfortable but he’s a very intense and boisterous guy so I was kind of expecting it. 

Well, now whenever I try to talk/joke about me grading papers (like self deprecating “oh I’m such a nerd” or “you better be nice to me or I’ll fuck your grade up” kind of joking) he’ll always turn it into a joke about me sleeping with the teacher. And I hate this because 1) it’s making me really uncomfortable even though I know he’s not being serious and 2) He’s very loud, and I’m worried that if the wrong person hears it then it’ll start something. 

For example, today I noticed he didn’t turn in some of his work, so I jokingly brought it up with him and he literally yelled “How does Mr. ______ dick taste?” In the hallway. It was so embarrassing. 

The problem is, I’m wondering if it’s my fault for bringing up the topic in the first place because I pretty much know that he’s going to say something weird if I say anything about me grading stuff. And the fact that I didn’t seriously tell him to stop the first time might be giving him the wrong impression. Idk what to do. We’re both in HS btw

It would take me about a year and a half. The problem is that my family is struggling at home financially. I am getting impatient about being in school longer. I was pretty miserable during my undergrad years from working full time, commuting and still not having any money to spend. I want to be able to start working and making money.

I've been having nightmares about being raped for weeks, so I think that's what triggered the memory.

Which I could’ve sworn he did, but instead of being truthful, he said he was “texting” someone. But, instead of it being believable, it was hard to believe because the phone was rotated. Today, he made a couple of comments about me that were actually hurtful, but instead I laughed it off. He basically said, “Her vagina is ugly,” which is one of my insecurities. And, talked about how my boobs “sagged,” which is another one of my insecurities. ;( Every since yesterday, my suicidal thoughts has began to increase.

294,"It is my first job after university and, frankly, I'm exhausted. Typical 9-5 has taken quite a toll at me. All my weekdays are mostly just struggling through the day and at weekends I go to doctors or try to forget the fact that I am due to return to the job on Monday, with a whole week of work to follow.

I know these are just basic facts that are true for many, many people, but I just can't do this anymore. I have several chronic conditions which make the day harder. I also have lots of self-harm and suicidal thoughts (yes, I'm getting help, but it doesn't seem to help as it basically tells me to suck it up and go on). I cry in the mornings, frequently having breakdowns.

I live with my parents and they are quite unsympathetic to my plight. My mother who is a stay-at-home mom promised to make my life living hell if I leave this job (she is quite toxic, so, yes, she probably will).

I also can't live on my own, because, well, I barely handle it doing ONLY a job.

Well, so here it is: leaving the job will probably wreak a havoc in my life, as will staying at it. I feel like I'm basically functioning on the top of my abilities. I mean, in these 4 months there were days when I thought that it might be OK, but all in all... I'm just counting minutes all the time and it's exhausting.

I feel like I'm just struggling and suffering for no good reason. University has been tough due to my chronic health conditions, but there at least has been a goal. I just can't go on living my life and after all these years of struggle just get rewarded... with even much struggle?

I'm toying with an idea of remote work but I never tried that before and everyone around me tells me it's not for me as it takes a lot of self-discipline and also that I should socialize at my age. I doubt I could succesfully work remotely from my home.

So, with a fresh perspective, what can I do?",23Jan2020,1

So as the title says, I am looking to get a tattoo from a specific artist who happens to be in Poland. I have absolutely no idea how to get the process going. I’m not financially ready to get the tattoo right now but since the wait times will probably be months long, I want to at least have a plan for the future. I’m still a university student now and I know I’ll have more time at this point in my life to take lengthy trips as opposed to when I work full time.

My concerns are:

1. Whether the artist will even bother to answer me given that I don’t have any tattoos yet.

2. How difficult the language barrier would be on this trip.

3. Whether I would end up likely having to pay in cash

4. Whether the artist would get annoyed if I emailed him just to ask him about rates and his timeline so I can start saving up

5. If there are any resources to help me make this trip less stressful when I take it

I’m pretty soft spoken overall, and it’s nerve wracking for me to just reach out to a tattoo artist, especially since I feel there will be judgment that I haven’t gotten a single tattoo yet.

301,"Hello everyone,

I’m 20 years old. I used to be extremely depressed like near suicidal in my home country for a variety of reasons, so I decided to gtfo and go travelling.

I decided to come to Australia and work for a year to get my head in shape before I went back to my home country to sort things out. However, I had no real prior work experience before going out travelling, and no money saved up, so I From what I read on the internet, I assumed I’d be able to make decent money and end up paying my parents back what I owed them. I planned on doing farmwork (needed to get away from city life and go to the rural parts and do farmwork, I wouldn’t have been able to handle a cafe job in the city for example).

However it has been extremely difficult to find work (worst drought and bushfire season in memory) meaning that my parents have had to bankroll 32% of my trip, resulting in £1500.

Now my mental health and wellbeing has improved *significantly* since I’ve been out here, and no doubt when I tell my friends/people i meet in my home country that I travelled and worked in Australia for a year on my own, they will be impressed and proud of me.

But I feel like a total failure. Because none of this would’ve been possible without my parents bankrolling me.

Other people have been in the same mental health situations as me, but were able to get out of it without bankrolling from their parents. 

I can’t help but think of People in extreme poverty like Eminem or Tupac and how they managed to get out of the ghetto without bankrolling from their parents.

What am I supposed to say to someone who isn’t as privileged as me who’s depressed? That the only way I escaped it was dumb luck that I had rich parents? 

I’ve made posts like this before and people say “stop being so hard on yourself you’re only 20” but then there are 20 year olds with no living family trying to support their own family. How can I live with myself when people like that exist.

I’m sure you get the jist of what I’m saying, I’d appreciate any thoughts or advice.",23Jan2020,1
302,"Hey, Reddit.

So I wanted help with this question as I've been having trouble recently with trust after abuse. As well as the fact ill be in college soon and wanna be better for making new friends.

Below is the full context if needed. I appreciate any and all attempts to help! Thanks so much.


Around 2 years ago I was stuck in an abusive relationship after I had my heart broken by a bad falling out with a friend. Who id even go as far as to say was the first girl I fell in love with. The falling out was caused by my actions, I said really nasty things like calling her a ""stupid selfish bitch"" for not wanting to talk to me in person despite social anxiety being the reason. Although it hurt; I know she did the right thing and maybe someday we'll be able to try again. (And yes, I do realize I messed up bad with the names. And feel horrible, once to a point of a suicide Attempt I barely escaped

The girl I fell out with had a close friend who leveraged me into the abusive relationship by calling me a creep and a weirdo who couldn't be loved. Then telling me she was madly in love with me. Eventually this peaked when she told me she never liked me for the last 2 years. (We'd known each other since 8th grade as we did theater together)  It left me so confused and hurt.

Afterwards I had a really garbage friend who treated me like nothing. Would make fun of and bash anything I was remotely into. My religious beliefs, my favorite bands, even my shyness towards having sex. From which shed tell me constant stories of her and her boyfriend having it. Shed also tell me she didn't care about my problems, then complain I didn't pay attention to hers enough. (Which we talked literally every day about her) She eventually told me she was done with me because I liked her friend. (Who I should note, I INTRODUCED HER TOO BECAUSE I LIKED HER) 

Following this I met someone else who constantly told me they loved me a lot and I was better then all their friends. Until summer vacation started where out of nowhere blocking me on all social media. Right after getting a bf. This made me feel lonely.

Until I finally met someone good. My current best friend, supports me, and loves me, and genuinely is someone I want in my life forever. She'll listen to my problems even if she can't do anything. Just overall the best part of my life rn.

Im getting as much help as I can for her. I cant lose her too. I've also been getting jealous of her other friends and fighting more recently. 


This is the end of the story. So all attempts to help are appreciated! Have a good one!!",23Jan2020,1
303,"So, I’ve posted here on Reddit before about how I struggle with attending high school every day. I have now over 50 absences this year and I can’t bare to attend anymore. Quite frankly, my school is horrible atmosphere-wise, and it drives me further into a depression. I have been diagnosed with MDD and Anxiety, and I have struggled with attending public school for some time. I’m currently working towards recovery, but it’s a struggle.

I am considering getting my GED since I have ~4 months to graduating and I don’t think I can make it that long. I have gotten stellar grades when I *do* attend, and the past 3 years I have gotten all A’s and B’s and made honor roll regardless of my attendance, but it has gotten to the point where I will either be kicked out for my attendance or I need to leave on my own. I would be fine with getting my GED, my parents would be fine with it too, but I worry about what people would think of me. I’m not bragging about being smart, but I’ve seen and heard a lot of people assume that people with GEDs are stupid and lazy. My father has one and makes six figures, and he’s very smart, so I found this to be untrue, but I also worry that it would hinder me in college and careers.

I have friends who say that college is better, and I have aspirations for my future career, and it requires a masters degree in a science field. I worry that a GED would effect this. Does anyone here have experience with this?",23Jan2020,1

309,"I(28/f) went to a travel show with my best friend. The door prize was with Diamond Resorts. It’s a timeshare company and they basically offer you 3 trips and a $100 visa for $250. All for attending a 2 hour presentation on their resorts.

After she purchased it I kept thinking about it as we went through the travel show. So I purchased one too.

Wasn’t given much info besides the first trip for 4 was 3 nights and the seminar trip. Second trip was a 4 night all inclusive cruise for 2 and the third was a 7 day resort stay for 4. My sister found out and immediately sent her fiancé to buy a package for their honeymoon as the resort stay could be used in Hawaii.

I did research and only found horror stories about people doing timeshares(seem like a bad deal overall). Didn’t find out too much about the seminar/presentation besides it’s high stress and they basically try to force you into buying one. You have to convince them to sign off that you came(or they’ll bill you for the trip) and sign off on your trips.

I get an email today stating the cruise is through ICE which is basically a company that book cruises. I found out that they’re sort of a pain to deal with. It’s also possible the trips are hard to book with the places you wanna go not being available when you want to go(if available at all)

I presented the info to both my friend and my sister and told them it could be disputed by CC. My friend is deciding to go ahead with it and basically said she’ll just say no. Said that everyone in those bad positions are just idiots.

My sister basically said she thought that you can’t dispute it with a CC company(people have on the basis they felt they were lied to) and asked if I was canceling. I wasn’t sure. No word if she has.

My mom wanted to use the initial trip as a family trip(combine mine and my sisters) and then we’d use the cruise and take my aunt(sisters fiancé doesn’t want to go on the cruise and my fiancé definitely wouldn’t go). Since my best friend purchased it too I’m totally fine with using them for those reasons. 

I’m terribly torn on what to do. Part of me feels like at $240 the 3 night trip for 4 isn’t a bad deal even if nothing else works out(it’s at a Marriott or Hilton ect.). But I also don’t want to get screwed on the other trips or have to deal with the hassle of places never being available.",23Jan2020,1

320,"Before I start I want to stress that my Dad is not a violent person and has never assault anyone before and has no criminal record. He is a kind man but he suffers from alcoholism. He drinks about a bottle of scotch whiskey a day (sometimes two).

On new years my Dad decided to stop drinking which I was so happy and proud of. After a days of going cold turkey (which I advised against, I thought it would be better if he just cut down his drinking) he had severe hallucinations and had to be hospitalised after one night he was banging on our neighbour's door with a cricket bat. 

He left hospital after a couple days and was given pills to alleviate his symptoms. 

He was fine for about two weeks but he was becoming addicted to the prescription pills now. Then he started drinking again after he was clean for a bit over a fortnight. 

Now for some reason his mental state is worsened. He stopped drinking for a day and now he is yelling at me and my Nan. He kicked me out of the house and thinks I am plotting against him because I was trying to help him stop drinking.

Right now his mental state is not good. He thinks his entire family is out to get him and says he wants to get a plane ticket and move to another country.

Symptoms he is currently suffering from:

Anger (loud yelling), delusions/hallucinations, shaking, red eyes, tripping over.

We asked an AA person but they said they could not help him unless he wanted to be helped.

I am staying with my Nan at the moment. I tried talking to my Dad several times yesterday but he would just starting shouting at me saying I ""betrayed him"" and that I ""hate him"". He won't stop drinking now and since he is taking the pills he is even worse than before.

I don't know what to do. He won't stop drinking. Yesterday when I was in our house while he was yelling at me I saw he had a pair of scissors on the ground. He did once cut his arms (self harm) once, however it was only a single time. I'm really worried about his wellbeing tbh. 

I'll stress again that he isn't violent at all. He's more likely to hurt himself.

I've already spoken to the AA people and the hospital won't take him so I'm at a loss. I don't want him to be put in a crazy place or anything. I just want him to be my normal Dad again and to not hurt himself.

What can I do for him, guys?",23Jan2020,1

Each seat cost about $400 USD and he asked me if I could buy the tickets and he would pay me back a week later.

326,"I recently just started working as a hostess last week which was my first job getting it myself and in a restaurant aswell. I worked with my dad in his office (he's an art director) as an assistant (i'd make modo/trend boards and even design sometimes but that was rare as i did the work the artists need to design) which helped my dad a lot but i got hired as a host at this resturaunt quicker than i expected which means i've stopped going to the job with my dad but come in when i have a day off. literally my 4th day at work i get a call from this other place i applied to asking if i can come to work i said yes and it's the same position. I'm basically on my feet all day on saturday but i have days off, mwf (days i go to college)  but still i was so drained the first day. Now i think i'll be fine since i've adjusted to it a bit. 

NOW the pay.. i got paid 14/hour at my dads job for being an assistant. while at the american diner hostess job i get paid $10/hour (i'm in southern california for ref) and at the other job idk how much it is as i haven't asked but probably 10 and i do get tips (something i dont at the american diner) but it's 5%of what servers make. 
And at this student worker job (it's a program)at the attorneys building is $13/hour starting and it can go up to 15.80 but all depends on how many units you've taken. Ive done 32 so i would make 13.65/hour ...  and it'll go up as i go to college because of the units. 

Thing is I really enjoy the hostess jobs as time goes by quick and everything i get social skills (are some workers who are rude to me lol) i'm dealing with people compared to my dads office where i only talk to him and 2 other artists and time goes by slower. 

I'm also in college and just need a job that pays good and i feel it'd be dumb to not take the attorney job and keep the other 2 hosting jobs. So it's not like i just want more money (which is nothing bad but i have no time) but i NEED it as i have to pay for textbooks and tuition and parking. But then another side of me is saying i prob should get a job in my desired career choice (want to be a project manager/ software engineer. basically in the tech industry) and have little interest in being in the law field as i haven't read into it. 

I have the interview this friday and i'm nervous but really want the job as the pay is good and i do have some interests. I'd appreciate any advice a lot and what you would do if you're in my position. thank you !!",23Jan2020,1
327,"Hey all, first time posting here and finding myself in a predicament. To provide some context, I'm 28 years old, obtained my bachelor's degree 6 years ago (2014) and have been working directly with patients in a inpatient psychiatric program working on exposure therapy for OCD (not licensed as a therapist or psychologist as of now). Not so much in a clinical role as I am an intermediary between patients and their treatment teams should they need personal support, encouragement working on short term goals, etc. Anyways, I've been working this job for almost 5 years now (started in 2015) and have come to the conclusion that this sort of career path just (should it actually lead anywhere decent) isn't compatible with my temperament, long-term goals and interests in general. Truthfully, I'm only still working in this position because of the generous benefits package and fantastic access to healthcare through said benefits. Now, I suppose you could argue that this alone may not be a sufficient incentive for me to stay even if it provides some comfort and assurance, but I'd rather not spend my days concerning myself about whether or not I'll be able to afford my next few vials of insulin (type 1 diabetic). With this said, I've sort of become complacent with my current situation, which in all likelihood isn't healthy. I've been brainstorming ideas on what sort of job might be a decent fit for me and I've found myself drawn to the idea of clinical research time and time again. Ideally, I'd like to spend some time as a research technician or assistant at a different hospital (possibly in psychiatric research??) and perhaps hone in on my research interests as I apply to graduate school. Slight problem though. Almost all variations of said ""research assistant"" positions I've browsed through on job sites require ""prior experience"" (despite marketing the job as entry level in the description, which seems a bit silly). I've attempted many times to reach out to folks running the research studies and I tend to receive the same answers.. ""we don't have the time or resources to train someone who doesn't have the skills needed to succeed in this position."" Apparently, coding is a crucial aspect to many of these positions, which of course I hardly have any experience with... I know the obvious answer might be to gain expertise in areas I lack to make myself a more competitive candidate for these positions, but truthfully, I don't know if I'm willing to invest any more time in this endeavor. I'm just sort of waiting for someone to give me a chance. Aside from this, I'm not quite sure what career path would interest me.  Perhaps I should meet with some sort of professional or career adviser? I don't know. I'm sort of desperate for answers/feedback at this point. I fear it may be too late to make any meaningful changes at this point in my life and I've been beating myself up about this for the last few months now. This isn't where I hoped to be in my life as I approach my 30s. Any thoughts or suggestions here would be immensely appreciated. Apologies for the long-winded, meandering post.",23Jan2020,1

344,"I (17M) am currently contemplating on how to go on in life. When I started highschool, I was positive that I was done socializing and that ""being one of the popular kids at a small town middle school"" was enough for me. As a result, I voluntarily pushed everyone away and for four years I've **rarely** depended on friends (**rarely:** I still asked for information when I needed it, but never to say ""hello"" or hangout). Surprisingly, for four years it somewhat worked out well, as I find myself to be very self-dependent and I'm very close with my parents (they taught me and motivated me through life wanting nothing in return). 

However, in a couple months I'll be going into college with the fact that I know nothing financially about living by myself, I don't have a US license or permit, I don't have a job (I was freeloading off my parents), and without anyone I trust being nearby (moving away and staying at a ""college household"" \[a system that I know nothing about\]), I doubt that I'll survive ""the streets"" by myself from quick google searches on the internet. Maybe this is ""karma/punishment"" for casting away my friends or a challenge that I have to overcome. 

Additionally, I feel like I've lost touch with reality. Maybe this is just teenage hormones or angst, but despite all the advice I read on reddit (ZERO DAYS, ""Just do it"", you make your own meaning of life) I don't feel like I'm growing as a person. I don't socialize nor do I feel comfortable doing so. I don't hang out at restaurants so I know nothing about Wendy's, Chick-Fil-As, or Dunkins. Additionally, I know nothing about the area I live in, (I never bothered to learn the places as all I needed in highschool was the bus stop, the gym, and a nearby Publix) I've been concentrating all my time on school so I know little about current games or trends. I superficially hold up ""one-sided"" conversations (I blab about one tiny detail and ask a question to which the other person responds w/ a story). Should I feel uncomfortable when socializing? I know this this screams ""first world problems"" in comparison to other advice threads, but, I feel like this is necessary in order to function like a human being in the real world because I feel like although I'm competent within the areas I work in, I never take the initiative socially and I don't feel the need to. I feel soulless and very unhappy/unsatisfied with life currently.

TL;DR

Please help fix my social problems: 

\- Is it healthy that I generally feel uncomfortable socializing?

\- I want to repair long dead friendships in order to prepare for the future ahead.

\- How do I use social media?",23Jan2020,1

357,"I just came back from dealing with Emergency Services after my Dad recieved a call about a (what seems to be a severe) panic attack. She had apparently lost her memory of what happened to trigger the panic attack. It was really bad, but she's somewhat stable now, and she will go to the doctor's ASAP tomorrow. 

But, that's not what I want to talk about. It's not what I'm scared of.

I grew up with a Mom with diagnosed depression. It was pretty bad over the years, and our rocky relationship aside, I noticed continuous patterns - people would often say that she's ""crazy"", or ""delusional"", or ""psycho"", then drop their friendship with them. These were people who were very, very close to her, too. Quietly, I wondered if they had a point, and I concluded that my Mom was emotionally unstable. While my Mom has depression, she did things that were, frankly, disrespectful to her friends and family, and somehow justified them because she had depression. She could never take criticism and would always be offended and lash out by screaming. There would be times that I would be crying and upset over something she said, and then she would get offended and say that I'm being ""overdramatic"" and just talk about how her feelings were hurt. As a result, I would always have to end up apologizing to her.

I would also say that she is overprotective. Which is fine, however I grew up with constant surveillance. As in, my mom would spy on us children and ask people discreetly to tell her what we were doing. I've recalled a couple of times where I caught my Mom following one of my siblings to certain places (ex. The grocery store), or asking roommates to tell her what they've been doing and to not tell them that she was asking. The icing on the cake was when a close friend admitted to me that my Mom convinced her to convince me not to move out when I was considering doing so, which I found really creepy, as I had no idea that she was so against the idea. She would justify these actions, saying that it was because it was a ""mother's duty"" to do so and that this was normal.

What sealed the nail in the coffin is that finally, I told my Dad how I felt about my Mom. He admitted that he agreed, but he ran into the same issue - if he tried to say anything, she would blame him and get angry at him. I felt reassured about my feelings towards my Mom, I felt bad for my Dad, who had to live with years with having to deal with this.

One blunder is that I currently live with my parents, as a result of my going back to school and not being able to afford rent. I just graduated and am looking for a job, so I plan to move out as soon as possible. 

Another thing I want to point out is that I'm not hating on depression. I have it myself, and the way I react to it is also what scares me because I'm scared of turning into her. But I'm not hating on it, or anyone who has it. It's the toxic behaviour my Mom exhibits, behaviour that she justifies because she has depression. And I get that she needs help, and I try my best to help, I just... it's so bad, the toxic behaviour, that I don't know how to explain it here. And I don't know how to help her, either. I try whenever I can, but at this point, I can barely help myself, and that's not helpful to either my Mom and I.

I'm sorry reddit, for the lengthy post, but I really don't know who to talk to about this. I'm snappy at my friends, and I'm constantly negative and grumpy. I'm so sensitive that I can't even talk about certain topics without getting upset, and I complain a lot. I do try to reduce these habits as much as I can, but they keep coming back, full force and then I snap at someone. I think I'm starting to be a toxic person too, and I desperately want that to not be the case.

359,"Okay, so to set the context I recently switched my job and started working at a 8 year old startup company. The compensation is great and the benfits as well. But now, after a month I have one more offer from one of the big four companies. It pays a little less but its okay. 

I am actually trapped in this great dilemma. 

First part: My new office does not have this policy to be present in office everyday so not a lot of people come in. I want to go to office but no one is there so it is just a waste of my time and effort. Right now i dont have much work assigned to me so I am literally bored at home and I just dont know how much longer I can keep up with it. Basically i dont have a life and it really makes me feel sad 

Second part: I live in a city which is quite far from my home. The culture and people here are completely different and I just couldnt find a reason why I am here. My company has an office near to my home and I think i could ask for shifting and they wouldn’t deny my request. I actually I think i would feel pretty good if this part goes well.

Third part: Okay, so here is the third part. The new offer that I have is actually great but offers a job in the same city I currently live in and I dont think I will have any option to shift. The company is great and everything about the offer is good except it pays a little less than my current company.

I am in great confusion on what should i do and where should I go. Am i having problems because i dont meet enough people at work (I had a lot of people around in my first job). I mean I am not able to figure out what exactly is the problem. The point is I am not happy in my current state. Please advice me what can i do to actually improve my situation.

Thanks in advance :)",23Jan2020,1
360,"I’ve been trying for a long time to build my friend up for the longest time, and it seems no prevail. It’s starting to become draining but I just try to remind myself that people have emotions and are human so it’s ok to feel down and such. But no matter what I say or do, it’s like they disagree and have no confidence about anything whatsoever and just self destruct by saying “I’m a sad person”, “I’m a terrible person”,  “no one wants me” etc. 

I’ve noticed a lot of manipulation tendencies and also selfishness, but I just give the benefit of the doubt because everyone needs some one in a way.

361,"My high school experience has been rough to say the least. 

Going into gr9, I had no friends from elementary school to start with. I was alone. Eventually I made some rly good friends in my class. We hung out all the time and I really felt close to them. I was finally feeling like I was part of something. Then, they just gradually flaked and stopped talking to me.

Same goes for women. Every single person I’ve ever had a shot with has entertained me for a few weeks, then moved on to the next guy. They never speak to me again. It makes me feel like I’m not worth it for others to stick around.

I’ve chickened out of so many experiences in high school and it makes me feel so regretful. If I had played my cards differently I might’ve been happier.

Sometimes I just lay in bed and cringe over some of my past experiences/missed shots/mistakes. How do I overcome this? I’m going to university soon and I feel like a huge chunk of my life where I’m supposed to learn and have fun has gone down the drain.

362,"I have been a thumbsucker pretty much all my life. I had started masturbating when I was 14 years old. I am pretty sure that if I wasn't thumb sucker I would not start that habit of watching porn and masturbation. I have never enjoyed sex without sucking my thumb. I just cannot imagine masturbating without sucking my thumb. I am having a very difficult time quitting PMO. I have also checked out other other subreddits about thumb sucking and there are boys like me in the same situation. But none of those subreddits offer any concrete solution. I was diagnosed with ADHD 1 year back . Watching porn and masturbating only makes me more dependent on medication. Meditation helps but only to control the urges to watch porn. When I start sucking my thumb again, I feel aroused again and I want to masturbate. I don't know what to do?  All my savings are over and I cannot go to a therapist again. What do I do to quit thumb sucking ? Tragically enough assume I meditate 10 minutes in the morning, I can easily control my sexual urges and talk to girls without hesitation. The same day if i start sucking my thumb for say in the evening. I start to feel aroused again and I start watching porn. I just cannot fall asleep without the thumb in my mouth its a 23 year old habit that is leading me to other bad habits like watching porn even when i am just bored.

He asked a second time not long after, somehow expecting a different answer but I again told him no, that I wasnt comfortable with it. Today, he asked a third time.

it sounded so genuine and wholehearted coming from him, and seemed like he truly liked me and even implied he may be falling in love with me. anything else he said was mostly unintelligible and made no sense because of how faded he was, but when he talked about me to his coworkers and to me he wouldnt stammer and talked like he knew what he was saying, very sensibly and almost sober. i asked him as he was coming down a few hours later if he meant what he was saying while he peaked, and he said he wouldn’t have said it at all if it weren’t true. he’s not one to lie to me about things, however i feel like its too good to be true. maybe it’s my insecurities projecting but i truly find it so hard to believe someone really feels this way about me and i honestly didn’t know what to say but ‘thank you’ in happy tears to him. i know when i’m also on mdma i say what i’m genuinely feeling and tend to be more open, but i want to know if it’s the same for most people and would be for him. do you think he meant what he said?",23Jan2020,1

I can stand up for myself but I can't stand up for her too.

One of the things that happened then is the fact that someone stole from that good friend. there were only 4 left in an apartment at that point, me, a girl, the good friend and her bf. I am vehement about the fact that I wouldn't ruin a friendship for a packet of cigs and 30$. I've known her bf for 3 years at that point so I'm vehement he didn't steal as well.

but today after noticing some backhanded comments from one of the girls that were in that group I snapped and told her to tell me what the fuck is her problem and she accused me of the theft upfront.

we are all in the same HS class, I should add(around 17 all of us). I don't really hang with the other classmates so now that I'm not friends with them anymore I feel really alone and I do not want to suffer through passive aggressive attitudes all year.

I shut up for so long and I worked so hard on these friendships and now I'm heartbroken cuz I really tried to manage my anger issues and all my mental stuff for them and to ignore shitty attitudes sometimes.

any advice? I have ok grades and stuff but I can't transfer right now and I can't stand this situation anymore. school has started for 2 weeks already and the only thing I can think about is how I want to kill myself when I see them whispering between themselves.",23Jan2020,1
378,"I'll give a little backstory I am a 27 year old male living in Australia. I was just recently diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking Concerta (Ritalin) to help improve my focus. I currently work in IT even though I have no degree or previous experience in IT. I just lucked out through people I knew. Most of my previous experience has been labor work. Used to work in the oil and gas industry before the price of oil crashed in 2014. I have had my current job for almost 3 years now. Throughout most of my schooling life I had never had interest in school. Could never learn properly in a classroom with pen and paper. I found myself that I could only learn through practical work, did well in physical education and chemistry when it came to the practical side of it. I had huge issues with focusing and talking to friends during class time. I could never concentrate on what the teacher was saying. I got yelled at a lot and told I should never bother going to Uni. The teachers told me my parents a lot that I didn't have ADHD, so I never went to get diagnosed. My psychiatrist was surprised that I wasn't diagnosed at a early age when she read my report cards. 

So pretty much failed all of high school Dropped most of my subjects in year 12. I think my best grade was D. I was mostly skipping class or pretending to be sick. Went straight to work after year 12 and have been working since. After being diagnosed with ADHD I had the idea to go back and study. Throughout all of primary school and highschool I have always wanted to work with animals, particular marine. Was always interested in doing marine biology. I retained information really well when learning about animals. I'm probably rambling on too much now but I'll get to the point. 

I want go back to Uni to study marine biology. I'm really determined to try this time. I'm just scared that it will just end up like high school again. I have my family and girlfriend both supporting me to do it if I really want to but they both have the same concerns. I don't want to end up quitting my job and then dropping out of Uni anyway. I need to be 100% sure that I can do this. What I'm asking is what are the best ways for me to keep studying and stay focused. The ritalin I take does help a little but there's still distractions. I also have bad social anxiety so the thought of going back to a school like environment scares me.

Start off by saying thank you for any help and advice.

In my personal life I have been subject to abuse from a partner and it has also become apparent that my child is also subject to abuse. I'm not going to go in to any details surrounding the abuse of both me and my child.

Social services are highly involved with mine and my ex missus life because of what she's has been doing to my child. Some of the things what are coming to light are very distressing, along with coming to terms with my own abuse. 

I am struggling to wrap my head around everything and I am seeking therapy. This is all having an impact on my work. The sheer amount of visits from social and doctor's appointment is also having an impact.

To my absolute shock work are being extremely supportive.

I had a meeting with them yesterday regarding my time off. They have asked me to come up with a plan on how I could better resolve my time off.

I have to find a new place to live and losing money is just another worry for me.

Does anyone have any idea how depression and low moods a long with time off for social services and therapy could be worked around my time at work?

387,"I’m not sure if there’s a better venue for advice involving kids, but if there is, please let me know and I’ll direct my inquiry there. 

A few months ago, my nephew and niece came to live with me and my wife. My nephew (15) is a varsity athlete, he likes playing video games and watching sci-fi movies. My niece (14) is an artist and spends her free time reading comics and listening to music. They are both well behaved and hard working. 

They’ve been living with me for a few months and each have their own rooms, my nephew has moved in to our guest room and my niece in a room that used to serve as my office/comic book room. We eat dinner together every night, have regular board game night and movie nights, and everyone helps out with the chores. 

There aren’t any severe family issues that caused them to come stay with me, just that their parents are having some financial trouble and asked if we could take them in until their finances are back under control. They have two other kids that are staying with my mom for now. 

At an alarming frequency, maybe once or twice a week, my nephew wakes up screaming. He quickly recovers, and when he does, he resists talking about the episode, although sometimes it keeps him up at night and makes it hard for him to sleep. 

The first time he had an episode while living with me, he sat up in his bed so quickly that he knocked over an end table and a lamp in his room. The commotion woke me up and I ran into his room, irrationally thinking someone was breaking in. He jumped out of bed when he heard the door open and grabbed me and when I turned on the light, he calmed down. When I asked him what was wrong, he said “I’m fine, how are you?” 

Most of the time, he’ll start screaming in his sleep and I’ll go in to check on him and ask if he needs anything. He’ll sometimes ask for a glass of water or for an extra blanket, but not much else. Other times, I’ll wake up in the morning to get ready for work and I’ll find him asleep on the floor in his sister’s room. He’ll tell me that he couldn’t sleep, and she’ll tell me that he didn’t want to be alone. 

Whenever I ask him about it, he’ll tell me that he’s fine. It doesn’t seem to me like he’s refusing to talk about it, but rather that he’s refusing to acknowledge that there’s anything to talk about. We have a pretty close relationship and he’ll talk to me about nearly anything, ranging from issues with his first girlfriend to anxieties he has about getting into college and pursuing a career in athletics, but about this one topic, he seems too embarrassed to open up. 

I’ve been feeling bad about not being able to help him, especially on the days that I can tell his lack of sleep is hindering his performance at school and in sports, but I’m not sure where to start if I can’t get him to open up about it. I’ve been mindful not to badger him about it and to let him know that I’m here for him if he decides to talk about it, but so far he’s preferred to stay silent on the topic and I’m not sure what to do.",23Jan2020,1

I’m a 19yo girl, and I went to the gym 3 times a week for about half a year before my knees started feeling weaker and weaker with every session. They were always inflamed and they hurt for weeks by April.
Turns out I have an autoimmune disease, which now makes it hard for me to even take the stairs, so I had to say goodbye to squatting and anything that has to do with knees. I had to give up gym because of this. (Unfortunately, leg and booty days were my favourite...)

The only solution would be for me to get pregnant around 4 times so my body wouldn’t try to defend itself from “unknown” immune systems...

393,"Today my backpack was stolen from me while falling asleep at this cafe around 3 PM. I was not sleeping the night before and was sitting on this elevated ''couch'' working with my studies. A girl in her mid-late twenties was seated to my right and was doing stuff on her smartphone, glancing over at my table a few times as I was studying on my laptop and working with my assignments. To my left, two couples were sitting in front of each other, chatting, while one man was sitting in front of his laptop doing his thing. After some moments, I put my hoodie on and was closing my eyes to maybe rest for a brief moment. My backpack was next to me to my right, and I had my earphones on listening to music  
Where I was sitting was on the other end of the cafe, where there is a staircase to my right where you can enter the cafe and exit it, while the other entrance is on the opposite side of the cafe. Behind me was the wall, to my left and right were the ''channels'' to walk into the rest of the cafe and where you can buy yourself some Coffee and other things.  
People usually walked in from the staircase to my right to walk into the toilet that's in front of me to the left, since this was one of the few public spaces that contained a washing closet for customers and stuff. Some of the ones that come in are junkies and drug fiends, because not far away from this place, people are selling drugs publicly on the streets, considering that I was in a downtown cafe.  
Well, it didn't take more than maybe 20 minutes before I woke up, and my backpack was gone. It contained my iPad Pro 9.7 inch screen along with my expensive textbooks from Uni (amounting to $150), my laptop charger, a bag of pencils that cost me at least $100, a graphing calculator, my backpack that cost me $100, etc.  


I asked the new girls that came and sat next to me to my right about whether they saw my backpack, they said ''No.'' I asked the rest (those to my left), they looked at me strangely and said ''No, I am sorry.'' One could argue that it is a weird question to ask, considering that no sane person sleeps at a cafe. At any rate -- I was gripped by panic and felt anxious as hell when this happened, even asked the workers on whether they have any cameras that monitor the cafe, in which they said ''No, because of the privacy of our customers and their integrity, we can not do it.''  


At that moment, I felt hopeless and distressed; I almost cried. I didn't know what to do. All I had left was the water bottle that I placed on the table in front of me to be able to hydrate while I was studying, along with the laptop that I placed on my lap because the table was not elevated to a satisfactory condition (relatively speaking.)

To maybe answer some questions you might think right now:

**Did you file a police report?**  
I was planning on filing a police report, not that they can do anything about it or retrieve the backpack, however.  


**Could your personal property be covered under home owners insurance?**  
My personal property can be covered by insurance but for a hefty price, considering that it would fall under the category of 'business insurance' as my iPad was bought in by a company. and any insurance deductibles would be around the price of $1200. I would simply not profit from filing a claim.  


**Does uni have textbooks you can borrow in library, laptops, resources?**   
The very textbook that I lost was from a library. So it's a matter of debt now that I have to pay within a reasonable timeframe.   


**How can you be ""dead broke,"" yet afford pencils that total 100?**  
For the precise reason that they are pencils that I have accumulated across the time I have been in High School and some of which were given to me as gifts. Nothing remarkable.  


**Why didn't you tuck your backpack underneath your legs or hug it with your arms while sleeping?**  
I didn't count in the possibility of me falling asleep, but rather, 'resting my eyes'. In the sense that the noise around me and the idea of being in a public place would not make me fall asleep. Alas.  


**Sounds like it's time for you to get a part time job, then.**

Yeah. I have issue with managing my time, so I would need to be able to harmonize that with the fact that I am in a state of desperation and have to work something out before I get buried alive, metaphorically speaking.  


**Are you capable of tracking your iPad device?**

I didn't ever log into iCloud on that device, so there is no possible chance of me to ever be able to track it. It didn't cross my mind that I would need to do that on an device that I didn't ever think I would literally lose at a cafe because of sleep deprivation. It's simply 'shit happens' in the manifested sense, or neglect. I will have to make that money back one way or another.  My approach will certainly be to be a strategist with my personal goods for the future. But what grieves me is that I am in a net loss of \~$1K. The despair emerges in knowing that you're not on track with where you want to be.",23Jan2020,1

396,"My sister has been with her boyfriend for about 2 years. Both are divorced and he has a 5 year old with his ex. 

Recently, my sisters’ ex-husband was contacted by her boyfriends’ ex-wife who did a background check on her, got his contact information, and wanted to know what kind of person she was, if she was a good mother (she was a stepmom), etc. The ex-husband contacted me to make sure everything was okay with my sister (thankfully no bad blood, she recently changed her number or I’m sure he would have contacted her directly).

My question is, while I know this may not meet the requirements of harassment, is there any legal recourse that she can take or anything she should start doing? She’s in Texas by herself, no family or close friends nearby, and I don’t want her getting herself trouble. I  personally am not fearful of her safety but this looks like it has potential to go south real quick.",23Jan2020,1

398,"I've had depression for the past six years and my family doesn't know about it because they think people with depression are just ungrateful, immature and weak people who can't handle the world. It was why I never even tried to tell them. I had a fallout with my parents for 5 years over some big issues and we just recently reconciled about six months ago. I went from hating them so much to loving them to death. During these six months, I would say my depression has gotten better as I don't breakdown or have 'depressive episodes' as often. However, it still does come and during these times, my parents get really pissed at me for being a 'moody' child. They classify me as a 'moody' child any time that I'm anything but happy. It sucks that they never try to ask me what's wrong instead of jumping to dismiss me as 'moody', but I know that they'd never understand even if I told them. I try my best to pull myself out of these 'episodes', but sometimes I can't and I end up pissing my parents off. 

I don't want my depression to cause another rift between us. It's unfair to my siblings who had to live 5 years with the clear anger I had at my parents, and ruining this happy family. I just want all of us to keep being this happy family, but I don't know how to keep my depression under wraps. I'd really appreciate some advice on what I can do.",23Jan2020,1
399,"since i was 12 i was always interested in older men and never interested in guys my age. i think they are immature. thats why ive never had a boyfriend. so i had a huuge crush on my schools principal for a year. he was so attractvie. but hes like 45 and has a kid (hes divorced though) and i just gave up, since i was 15. now im 16. right now i cant stop thinking about my trainer. i know him for almost 3 months.

I really want to seduce him, but im too scared to make a move, because i dont want him to think that im a weirdo. And he is actually really good at teaching, so even if we dont have that kind of relationship Id still want him to be my coach. Anyways I even started a diet just to be more skinny. I did it just for him. I want him SO BADLY but i know i shouldnt. what do i do??? today i have a private lesson with him. Im too scared to face him.

400,"Hey, it’s mike, I just wanted to apologise for how I’ve acted since the accident and explain why I was away for awhile

Once I was all strapped into the chair the conscience control unit began to lower from the ceiling and tighten on my head, after a few seconds the helmet began to get very uncomfortable until all of a sudden I felt a sharp sting on either side of my head, everything got really heavy and soon enough I was in a deep sleep.

Just a moment later I woke up on the floor of my childhood room It was the night of September 5th 2003 this was the first time I had snuck out of the house to meet up with my best friend Tom. We planned to sneak out and meet up at the park just to mess around and from what remember it went well and we had a ton of fun but I wasn't quite ready to see his face again, not yet anyway. You see me and tom something happened between us that changed my life forever on the night of May 15th 2004. That was when my happy memories end and the guilt and endless nights of sorrow and regret begin as I am pulled down the path that leads me right here now.

As I sat up I noticed the odd watch-like device strapped to my arm with the words “enter date and time” flashing on the display. After some thought, I realised that this was the “interfacing control unit” that let me let go when I wanted, god that sounds weird to say.

This stumped me for a while but it wasn't that I couldn't think of a place to go in fact I could think of too many. A little while later I settled on June the 5th 2002, my brothers 10th birthday.

Almost as soon as I the date and time my surroundings faded out of existence and my back garden materialised to replace it. After a few seconds of emptiness, the area begins to fill in with people, familiar people, people I used to know.

Seeing people who died decades ago just stood there as if nothing has happened was really strange like I was walking around people who had died over half my life ago. Exploring the garden was surreal honestly it was kind of scary Can I interact with the people around me? Would it break the dream if I did something drastically different? 

I gazed at my house for a good while, almost completely forgetting where I was for a moment. I wasn't even in my back garden 17 years ago I was suspended in the air by a mass of cables, walking around on a treadmill and being pumped full of drugs. All of this medical crap to fool my senses to believe that I was in my past 

After the initial shock of being around literal dead people, I started to relax and eventually brought myself to go and talk to my brother. This is the first time I've seen my brother happy to see me since Tom died so that was a nice surprise.

“Hey, bud! What’s doing” 

“What's doing? Dude, it's my birthday everything is doing” he enthusiastically replied

He never did know what that meant 

I gave him a tight hug and said “good man”. I left with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye.

At this point I thought it was time to go and see the limits of this thing, I was going to try and change what happened that night just to feel some shred of closure.

The back garden faded out of existence and once again the new surroundings melted in around me, in an instant I was stood in the park with Tom already in the height of the huge argument, Tom looks at me with deep hate in his eyes as I shout those horrible words that would rattle around in my head for the next 15 years of my life.

Tom turned to the road and began to run forward. At that moment I was watching a turning point in my life unfold all over again, I feel my knees weaken and my heart stop just for a moment. Then it happened, I see Tom’s face twist from one of hate to one of utter dread and despair as the truck slams into him launching his frail body 20 feet down the road and I hear his very last words that would haunt me for the rest of my life “This is all your fault” these words echo round in my mind even more than usual and I feel a rush of adrenaline as I rewind.

Now before I carry on I just want to say I don’t know what I thought was going to happen when I did this but I knew it would help me move on and forget what Tom had said to me in his final moments and give me closure on the disaster that ruined my life. 

When I returned to just before Toms death I immediately apologised for everything I had said that night and gave him a big hug, he looks at me startled and confused but then he returned the gesture. Almost immediately I noticed that things in the background began to glitch and warp into unnatural shapes, the ground seems to be washing around like the sea but Tom didn't notice. The truck drove over the glitchy landscape as if nothing was happening, Tom looked at me confused and then began to glitch out himself to the point where I couldn't recognise him. It was at that point realised what was happening, this whole procedure was to relive memories not create new ones so when I had messed with what happened the dream had begun to collapse around me. 

After a moment of dread as I stood in a blank space, I was jolted awake by the same nurse who had strapped me into this thing. I was told that my heart stopped so they had to pull me out and I was on the way to the hospital for emergency treatment and that’s where I am now, sat in a hospital bed after a short surgery feeling happier than I have in years so I wanted to take this opportunity to apologise for everything I’ve done since then and show I’m ready to be in your life again.",23Jan2020,1
401," Hi, so I'm 21, I do waitressing on weekends, but I've been working on this company (full-time) for a bit more than a year, and after the first 2 months I started feeling like complete shit, and started thinking about quitting this job, I still live with my parents, and I've always listened to their advice and I didn't quit at the time because I could see their happiness when someone mentions that I'm an IT for this company where my dad has been working since I was born bla bla bla, and they're just really proud of me. I've talked to them about me feeling like this and they just tell me I shouldn't quit and stay because it's something ""safe"" and I won't get fired. But I just feel like I don't fit in, I get paid the minimum wage. $665 dollars per month, and I'm an IT guy. It's ridiculous, I hate every single task I get assigned to do, when I wake up every morning I feel like I rather die than step foot in that place, It's like I'm in quick-sand and I'm just getting sucked in further and further should I follow my heart and just quit?

411,"Hi! This is my first post so I apologize if it kind of sucks. But, I’ve been having problems sleeping and nothing seems to help. I talked to my doctor they sent me to a psychiatrist who offered non medicinal suggestions such as have a better night time routine before bed. Go to sleep earlier, don’t nap, work out in the afternoon, eat better, do something that is low effort and of minor interest that could make you sleepy so you can put it down when you’re tired and fall asleep. She mentioned meditating, things like this. Well, it didn’t really work for me and it wasn’t for lack of trying. I tried, it just didn’t work and I lied to her about it working because before this she seemed to get frustrated about things not working for me. I’ve also tried zzzquil, melatonin, unisom , several over the counter medications and it helps me fall asleep but am hour later I’m awake. This is even on weekends which sucks. I go to bed at normal times so I have time to get adequate sleep before I get up for work. Last night I took some zzzquil, fell asleep, and an hour later I was up for almost the entire night.

415,"I've never actually spoke about this until now because I guess it was just a weird quirky personality trait. I've kinda come to realisation that it's much more than that. Im 16F and I have had this 'thing' since a very young age. I honestly have no clue what this is. I need to feel change constantly. Not sure if it's a big deal or not but I'll just explain it.

It all started when I was young &amp; I first got instagram. I would post, delete all my posts, post again and then later on delete those. I love notebooks. I'll write in them, rip the pages out, write in them again and then rip them out again. I have so much I want to write, I want to keep a journal or diary but I just somehow cant. I have at least over 30 notebooks in my room that are empty because I keep ripping the pages out after writing in them. I will have a few Pinterest boards, but will delete all of them and then make new ones. Last year I deleted my pinterest boards like at least over 50 times. With spotify, I'll make playlists, delete the playlists and remake them. With reddit, I will delete all my old posts for no reason whatsoever. I have about 8 email accounts, 4 snapchat accounts, 3 facebook accounts &amp; 6 instagram accounts because I keep on having to just delete them and make new ones. I use to change my style or hair colour every month ( as a normal teen girl would do ) but it got out of control that I just cut all of it off so I didn't touch it.

416,"I hoping someone may be able to help me out here because I’m not sure what category to put this in. I’m a 5’ 100 pound 21 year old female. Never really worked out and never played any sports. Been to the gym only a few times in my whole life, however I used to walk everywhere all day everyday. In the last couple years though things took a turn for the worse. At first it wasn’t too bad, but as time went on it got worse and I’d say that for the last year/year &amp; a half is what really did it in. I don’t want to make this too long so I can’t explain fully but I’ll try to include as much info as I can. Anyway, about 2 years ago I lost my job. Went through a drug addiction after that and severe depression and anxiety and it would be so bad I couldn’t even get out of bed most of the time, and it just kept getting worse and then my mom passed in May 2019 and that made me spiral out of control. So I never got another job, and then eventually lost all my friends. So long story short each time something like that happened I got worse and worse. The depression kept escalating and as well as my drug use which added to the depression plus no job or responsibilities so I laid in bed a lot of the time and just waited for my boyfriend to get home from work. After that he’d come home and we’d go hang out with our friends and go to state parks and other places so at least I was getting some exercise. But then in the last year/year and a half I’ve done nothing but lay in bed, only time I get up is to go to the bathroom or go make food. Besides that I’m either laying in bed, sleeping, sitting in bed, or sitting in the car. I don’t walk anywhere now that I can drive. Well it’s beginning to takes it toll on me now. Extreme back pain all the time, extreme trapezius muscle pain which spreads to my shoulders and neck that have HUGE knots. High blood pressure which i never used to have. I used to be able to walk for hours, now I get out of breath just walking up the stairs. No motivation to do anything and depression gets even worse since not only am I sitting inside with nothing to do but also feel worthless and like I’ll never get anywhere in life. Anyway, my question is what are some small steps I can take at the moment to fix this. Eventually I will get a gym membership and stuff but I need to start with small things to build up my muscle strength and whatnot.
I’m going to start taking 30 minute walks everyday and then eventually jogs and stuff, but besides that, what are some stretches and beginners workouts that I can do to get my body back into a healthy state and build up my muscle, joint, and bone strength. My biggest problem areas are my shoulders, my back (upper and lower) and my neck so I really wanna focus on those as those are the most important areas I need to fix, but also would like to hear of some things that will help the rest of my body as well. I know getting a job will help too but the thing is because my body is so used to sitting all day, the last few jobs I had were hell on my body. Even an hour into my shifts my feet, legs, and back would be killing me. So I want to build up some strength before getting a job as well to make it a little less hard on my body.",23Jan2020,1
417,"Recently got a new job at a bakery where I mostly just manage the front counter. I've worked there for a little less than a month and have gotten the hang of things but I still have questions every once in awhile. Whenever I have a question most of the shift leads were quite friendly and willing to help. One shift lead I could feel a little tension from they would usually get rather annoyed but still answered my questions. I would try to have small talk but they wouldn't try to engage and gave one word answers so I just stopped talking to them. One day we got particularly busy and I asked for help up front. SL said they're busy and I start managing the line myself. This customer has a particular request that I dont know how to input it into our pos system, I walk in the back and ask for help and she starts to yell at me for not managing the line up front. I eventually figured it out but people were getting visibly annoyed at how long it was taking. First I just thought this was just how her personality was but I see her make small talk to my other coworkers (who were also fairly new) and I dont understand what I'm doing wrong. I dont feel comfortable telling my manager since I feel like itll only make things worse. I love this job whenever I'm not working with that shift lead but whenever I see I'm on the same schedule as them I feel nauseous and like I'm walking on eggshells.

419,"This happened in late July. I had slept over at my cousin's house for five days (we live like 4-5 hours away from each other), then when we were going to go home, my parents just went into her room and said goodbye to her, but when I went in after them I didn't just say goodbye. My cousin was lying on her bed, then I said goodbye and I reached my arms out for a hug so she sat up on her bed and we hugged, but while I was hugging her she laughed, but I'm not sure why. Was it because she thought it was funny I wanted a hug or was it something else?

Also, when we were in the car ride home, I texted my cousin telling her I miss her, my younger cousin, my aunt and my cousin's dad, and my older cousin told me that they miss me too.

TL;DR Why did my cousin laugh while I was hugging her goodbye?",23Jan2020,1
420,"I'm here mainly to vent and for some advice. Sorry if my story and English seems all over the place.

I'll start with some information about myself: I (F24) work full-time as an beginner assistant accountant, basically live (Netherlands) together with my partner (M25), together we have 2 dogs and some other small pets. I'm diagnosed on the autism spectrum paired with social anxiety. My partner is quite the opposite. My partner has his own rental home in a low-income neighbourhood.

Me and my partner got together about a half year ago. I admit that our relationship moved quite fast, but we are really happy with each other and how things are going in the relationship. Officially I still live with my parents, but due to getting a job a few months ago close to where my partner lives, I haven't slept home in a while. Which feels so liberating btw! Not that I don't like my family, but I am someone who likes her privacy and alone time. Initially my plan was to get a job &gt; move out &gt; look for someone to share my life with &gt; get a house &gt; etc. Life had other plans. 

My partner disclosed with me on the very first date that he has quite a lot of debt, some private and some due to his business closing. Total debt is around 200k. He is getting debt assistance, who leave him €50 per week to live off. The rest of his income they use to pay his usual bills and what's left they pay the debtors. He has a full-time job since this month (which is 1.5 hours away), but he won't get more than the before mentioned €50. So money is tight at the moment. He pays for the house and car and I pay for groceries, gas and stuff that needs to get fixed, ect. **I do not pay his debts!**

My parents wonder why I stay with him sometimes, because even though I don't pay for his debt, they feel like he uses me for money and don't see a successful future for me if I stay with him. Mostly they are still getting used to the fact I'm abruptly not living at home anymore and my relationship moves so fast. They just miss me.

Last week we almost lost the car, because his previous debt assistance fucked up multiple times (that business closed now by the court). This left bills unpaid. His current assistance managed to fix this issue and we are allowed to keep the car. 

We really want to officially move in together, but this can result in even less money to live of, because I have a full-time job and can pay for things. Usually this means I will have to pay halve of his usual bills, but we are not sure how much money he than will get per week to live off, so I probably still have to pay for the things I am paying for now. We are planning an appointment with them to talk this through in the nearby future. 

What concerns me is that I already spent quite a sum from my savings since we are in a relationship and I'm just starting to save some money from my salary again. Living together will mean I can save less and I'm saving to buy a house in the future. My partner will most likely not be able to sign the mortgage or the house, because of his debt, so I have to pay for the house. 

We've talked about money and his debt multiple times, almost daily, and he is very open about it, so communication is no problem. I've set a budget of €800 per month we can spent on groceries, gas, vet bills, food for the animals, etc. which leaves me around a €1000 to save. This includes €100 for my health insurance that I pay in full yearly. We still have to see if we are able to keep to the budget, because we just started with that.

   
 

My mental state and money problems is starting to affect my work a little. I have trouble sleeping, focussing and remembering things. I am getting frustrated, because I feel like I am not getting better at my job. I keep forgetting how to do a certain thing and have to ask my colleague. Now my autism/ social anxiety sometimes prevents me to ask the most simple questions or just to say goodbye to colleagues when I am leave work. (sometimes I take the elevator from our floor to the first, just to take the stairs, so I can avoid the people at the reception) This can become a problem when they want me to visit clients in the future. Overall I am just shy and insecure. 

It makes me feel this job is just not for me. When I cleaned offices for a job a year ago, I felt more at my place, because I worked alone most of the time and had to avoid people who were still working. The problem is that cleaning is mostly not a full-time job and pays less. As beginner assistant accountant I still don't earn that much yet, but I do have a permanent contract, which will help with getting a mortgage.

It hurts so bad and when i use other products on my lips they just get worse and bloodier! People have been shoving their lip products down my throat. Does ANYBODY have ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS PLEASE. Im desperate you have to help me please. I cant stand this. Like they start peeling and then i try to get it off and it tears my whole lip off. Ive got dark pieces of skin on my lips because they bled so much from that. This is so frustrating i cant even put my mouth on a utensil without it burning or lick my lips without it burning. I cant eat anything even slightly spicy because i will feel like my mouth is on fire. ANYTHING ILL TRY ANYTHING THAT ISNT LIP BALM OR LIPS SCRUBS (my lips skin grows back in a few hrs so that never works!),23Jan2020,1
427,"I still feel the same way I did when I was 18, nothing really interests me. 
I could list my skills and experience but I guess that's not really what this is about..

I'm tired of looking for jobs, proving I know what I'm doing and not moving up because of this or that reason.
I want out of food, service, etc. 

And I just dont know what to do..I scroll through lists of ""best paying jobs!"" ""Jobs to look in to!""

But how do I find something for me?

429,"This happened in late July. I had slept over at my cousin's house for five days (we live like 4-5 hours away from each other), then when we were going to go home, my parents just went into her room and said goodbye to her, but when I went in after them I didn't just say goodbye. My cousin was lying on her bed, then I said goodbye and I reached my arms out for a hug so she sat up on her bed and we hugged, but while I was hugging her she laughed, but I'm not sure why. Was it because she thought it was funny I wanted a hug or was it something else?

Also, when we were in the car ride home, I texted my cousin telling her I miss her, my younger cousin, my aunt and my cousin's dad, and my older cousin told me that they miss me too.

431,"Hi there,

My girlfriend (22F) left for Los Angeles to do a semester abroad. We’ve been going out for nearly three years and have talked about our future with certainty (marriage, etc).

We are pretty inseparable. We didn’t mesh well with a lot of folks at our school so we are very dependent on each other. Luckily we finally started hanging out with some good friends some work.

It is getting ridiculous she has loads of money since she has made fake go fund me pages and got rich from that. She has started making lies so he can keep sending her money and saying that it hasn’t gone threw and that he needs to send more and that he doesn’t love her because he isn’t giving her the money she needs. She has cheated on many men and treated my father like shit when he was younger. I need to get back at her and stop this all.

And little 'white lies' like when I ask ""Did so-and-so reply to that message"" he'll say no, but if I were to check, I'd see they had replied and he had seen it. And before you ask about me looking through his phone, we both have free roam of each others phones and always have done.
He also has a drinking problem, which we've been combatting for the past four years, but when he goes out with certain people he always relapses and comes home really drunk and upset at himself. He told me ""I don't want to drink at all at the work awards ceremony because of my pills, and I've messaged everyone to make sure they know to help out."" But when I saw the chat it was just lots of talk about getting smashed and nothing even hinting that he can't drink much or at all.

I'm worried I'm coming across as a controlling, over protective girlfriend, but I honestly just want to help him feel like he can be honest with me. I've always been trying to help him with his anxiety, depression, and drinking issues, but recently it's been going down hill and I'm scared we're going back to square one.

All I need is someone to talk to about it, maybe someone to just tell me I'm being paranoid and it's all okay? I'm not really sure.

437,"Hi All

Just after a little advice. My friends are getting married this year and I've been asked to be Maid of Honour. Their relationship has been quite rocky for a few years and I suspect one of them is manipulative and emotionally abusive. The other has drifted away from all their friends and is always stressed and upset by the demands of the other. I hardly see them anymore. The couple is constantly fighting.

It's been a long engagement and I've thought for quite a while that the wedding wouldn't go ahead but they are charging ahead with the planning. I don't support the marriage and not sure if I can either:

A) grin and bear it and play along like nothing is wrong
B) tell them I can't be involved

The idea of giving a speech is terrifying as my heart is not in it. But I don't want to miss an important part of my friends life and I feel like dropping out would be the end of our friendship, which is something that I'm not prepared to lose

What should I do?",23Jan2020,1
438,"So my Mom is pretty lonely and stuff she has had a hard life. Around a year ago she made friends with a guy (just friends nothing more), and sometimes they would go for coffee and chat, and he would also come to the apartment sometimes as he is good with fixing things and he would help with fixing stuff around the house. However my Mom found out he is an alcoholic, but he was always really nice and kind to me and her, and also my siblings when they came home to visit. He was pretty fine but he started to come to the apartment more and more, and when I went to see my Dad (in Seattle) last summer for a month, I found out that this guy was coming to the apartment everyday and he didn’t wanna leave and he made my mom feel scared and worried. 

Fast forward to recently. He got insanely drunk a few months ago and came to the apartment and starting insulting my mom and stuff. He was also telling people in our city (small city) and people we know that he was my moms boyfriend and stuff which isn’t true. So after this my Mom told him to leave and she didn’t let him in, and he went away. That was in November, and since then he has been stalking us, like waiting outside our apartment, waiting near my moms workplace and standing near the Walmart we go to. He has seen me come from the gym and he has insulted me and threatened me [18M]. He’s also insulted my Mom and stands outside our apartment recording us with his phone. 

What do I do? We’ve already gone to the police they don’t seem to wanna do anything about it. He waits by the downtown he knows we are busy people and always have a lot to do and he is waiting in the places we frequently go to. 

I’m moving away soon and it means my mom will be living alone, as my other siblings are older and moved out already. I’m worried about my Mom and I don’t think I can move while he’s being like this.

My Mom hates him and never wants anything to do with him. I hate him too and I wish he would just die and leave us alone. 

What do I do?",23Jan2020,1

447,"Hey guys, this is an odd one. I have an amazing boyfriend and he is extremely good to me, but sometimes I feel like he should be a little more kind towards others as well. 

For example, we have talked a couple times about how it's polite to respect the elderly for their age and give them your seat on the bus or train. 

He argues against this and says that they're just as capable of standing and that age itself does not make a person more respectable, as there are just as many ignorant and horrible old people just as there are young ones.

I believe that, although what he says is true, we should give the elder the benefit of the doubt due to their worse health conditions and due to the fact that age gives a higher probability of wisdom.

I might be wrong and I am very heavily conditioned by my Asian culture where we are taught very high levels of respect especially towards older people and parents. 

What do you guys think? Should I attempt to change his mind or should we just agree to disagree?

Even if she did cheat on him, she told him and told him he was sorry, I understand that it would be very hard to just trust someone, but the guy said he still had feelings for friend 1, while lying and told her that he had NOTHING with friend 2 which then made friend 1 to think that friend 2 was lying and just wanted her man.

  
  Few months later, I found something again, and told friend 1 AGAIN, they argued, and friend 2 told me that I'm not a good friend because I don't want to see her happy.. with literally someone else's person, he lies to them both and I thought since both of them are being so stupid that I shouldn't intervene anymore.

So when I went to go shower, only the liner was up. He walks in the bathroom and goes, wow I love this view and decided to get in with me. In the moment, it seriously made me so self conscious!

It has started to really get to me on the grounds that it feels like they, themselves, have gotten bored of me but they reassure me that that isn’t the case. This has been an ongoing battle that has sort of drifted into other things. 

I am going to admit that I have severe abandonment issues. We’re talking even the slightest change of tone or even a slight change will put me on edge. 

Things have been slowly getting worse. It has gotten to the point that I am becoming overly clingy to them.  That I have to constantly message them as a bid to not feel like they are abandoning me.  When we get into an argument and sign off of the messenger we are talking on abruptly I rush and panic and try to find another way to get ahold of them because the uncertainty of the situation makes it all the more worse.  There are also other things I do that I would rather not get into right now. 

Over the last 2 days we had a similar argument like those before.  Only my crawling to get ahold of them resulted in them blocking me because I was spamming them and instead of taking the hint I just found a way around it to try again.  

What I want is really advice on how to not be so clingy. To allow them the space they need to function as their own person without me tethered to them and “Breathing down their neck.”  I would like to know how to not take everything they do as a slight to me or to just not assume the worse. 

I love them dearly, and they are someone I want to spend my life with but at the rate we are going I am slowly breaking the relationship more and more by being this way. 

I will also say I am attending therapy, and I am trying to work through these issues. But whatever progress I make in therapy gets thrown out the window when I enter into a relationship romantically with someone else. 

Is this all a lost cause?  I want to direly fix myself because I don’t want to lose someone I care for because I am unable to hold my own or respect their boundaries or wishes.",23Jan2020,1

485,"Has anyone else encountered emails being deleted that were sent using [Palace property management software](https://www.getpalace.com/)?  
Most people today don't even realise that email deleting capabilities have been publicly available since around 2014. With the likes of [Pluto mail](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233088), [started by Two Harvard Law Students](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2015/08/pluto-mail-started-by-two-harvard-law-students-is-shutting-down.html).  
There are also a number of [online companies](https://www.popsci.com/send-self-destructing-messages/) offering this ability such as [Cloudmask](https://www.cloudmask.com/). A host of [mobile phone apps also offering this capability](https://www.mobileappdaily.com/best-apps-for-secret-texting) such as [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/l/en-gb/), many with limited success. The widely used [gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en) accounts now have a similar function called '[expiring emails](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en)' in it's message privacy settings labeled '[Confidential mode](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9381514?hl=en)'.  
[Gmail does provide a warning](https://imgur.com/KHMtZWb) that the emails you are viewing will expire or has expired after a set time period. The deleted emails i have encountered that used Palace software DO NOT do this.  
I came across this blog article on the [ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7540107) website with the Pluto mail creators &amp; from what iv'e read it sounds very possible, using a cloud based mail server system, that the Palace software uses.  
I am no technical wiz or anything, but i have a better than average understanding of I.T than most. &amp; from my research if emails sent by the Palace software using their cloud based mail server were in fact hosting their email files. The email you receive into your gmail account for instance, would only be showing the contents of that email hosted on the Palace cloud mail server.  
The file has not been uploaded to your gmail account like they normally would be. You are just given permission to view the contents of that email stored at another online location, if you provide a valid passkey.  
Where is this passkey you require located? i believe it has embedded java code in the modified image file attachment. which has been disguised as a company footer logo attached to every Palace email message.  
Viewing the Palace software emails on different mail clients will often not even  allow this logo image to display. Most mail clients will block it, or it needs to be virus scanned first.  
But the java code has already sent the passkey code to check if the email contents can be viewed, by just opening the email. If the Palace email user revokes access to it, the passkey code is changed at the cloud mail server end. &amp; the passkey code sent by the attached email image will no longer match the mail sever passkey code, so access to view the contents is denied.  
I have personally had [Palace emails deleted](https://imgur.com/HpCS9qI) that were sent to my gmail account. It is impossible that i have mistaken 1 or 2 or that iv'e manually deleted them myself. As my gmail account still shows the avast scans done on all the missing emails totaling well over 2 dozen. I have never seen this happen on any other emails on numerous email clients before, only the missing emails from Palace.  
I have asked here if others with more expertise were able to expand on this subject, had similar experiences with Palace emails, or if the method iv'e described is actually plausible?",23Jan2020,1

Hi (name)
OK, here we go: I know we haven't spoken much this year and considering you approached me before the Spanish exam I thought id reach out. I know an email letter + en ingles is kinda weird but hear me out posta que casi no se escribi en Castellano and it seemed too long for a WhatsApp message.

I'm aware that I'm not someone who approaches others and don't open up a lot, looking back I don't think I really opened up at all the whole of last year, and I'm currently working on that. I find relationships with acquaintances easier to maintain because they expect less and if you see each other less often - being less transparent is somewhat understandable.

I don't let people in and when I occasionally somewhat do I gradually distance myself from them thinking it's what they wanted and I'm doing them a favor. I would have my reasons for ghosting and just justified it. 

On the other hand, I appreciate your friendship and I consider you my friend regardless of how often we do actually talk but at the same time not talking and avoiding are different and I don't feel comfortable somewhat ghosting you and continuing to avoid you.

Lmao this is awkward but yeah I apologize for appearing cold if that makes any sense and even though I'm aware this is a weird message I hope it will clear some of the awkwardness in the long term because some of this should have been addressed way earlier by me and saw this as the only way atm. Ok, Chau.

However, I’m not only making 4 dollars less than her an hour, she also gets double the amount of hours than me weekly. She claims that she gets taxed a lot anyways and can’t afford much, and refuses to split gas 60/40 even though she clearly uses the car more than me. Yesterday for example, she had a 2 hour shift in the morning, came back home and went back for another two hours. THEN she went to her boyfriends house and drove him all around.

I couldn't find the right words. She brought up how I was toying with her for the past years and my past relationships with people.. I was kinda hurt she would bring that up but she was hurting even more.. 

It opened my eyes on how I was toying with people without even knowing it. Me and my friend have a close relationship. Like close, we give each other kisses on the cheeks and we touch each others thighs and stuff like that. I was toying with her whenever I did that and I didn't even know..

I live like 7 hours from a real city and literally never had joy or anything. My parents were too poor to ever travel or do anything. It was just nothing but monotony. I wake up totally exhausted every day, always miserable, sit in my room alone, no energy to do anything. Not a singe person around. The only 2 people in my town were scizophrenic and would just yell all day and it was miserable. Whenever i hung out with a new group of people someone was trying to steal stuff, start fights, or begging for money.

I fell into the deepest depression. I just drank liquor every night, found a way to get my hand on weed, smoked a blunt. I couldnt sleep without weed. I would spend entire nights looking for scraps of weed and scraping totally empty bowls for just the smallest crumbs of resin so i could just smoke anything and escape. 

And then i turned it all around. Every problem was gone. I magically got rich. Everything was perfect. I had everything i ever wanted every single dream came true i was inches away from being totally happy and never being depressed again.

NOPE!!!!! My life got 1000x worse. I ordered xanax off the deep web for my anxiety. I accidentally overdosed blacked out and didnt even know what was going on. Woke up with a dui. Apparently my state punishes all crimes 10x harder than anywhere else. Got a long as fuck probation sentence and lost literally everything i care about. No license, no freedom, no drugs, cant do anything.

I just wake up every day tired. Every day is a nightmare. I have ptsd. Every day is depression. I just sit alone all day. My life is hell because all my neighbors are retards that neglect dogs all day so i cant even go outside without a dog just staring at me and barking for 8 hours. By the time this shit is over with i will be almost fucking 30. Almost fucking 30, i will not have started my life or felt any joy until i am almost fucking 30. I live with my parents who are extremely poor and I’m miserable every day. I just sigh all day. I just have nothing but the same negative thoughts going through my head all day every day. I just sat alone in my room wasting my life and no matter what i did i couldnt win. I lost everything. I have 0 friends, every person i know i hate, i have 0 escape, 0 chance to better my life, 0 happiness. I just sigh all day and feel tired and want to die.",23Jan2020,1

But the way he looks at me makes me feel uncomfortable. I noticed when whenever we're speaking, either just me and him or in a group, he'll make a lot of eye contact with me whilst smiling (this is just friendly - I realise), but he makes more eye contact with me than anyone else in the group, and I noticed the other day when we were having a group discussion and somebody spoke and we all turn to her he kept staring at me. I've caught him glancing at my body too, at various times, and I get it that men look, but usually it's like a glance then they know better to control their fucking eyes. He hasn't stopped though, and if anything seems to be getting more brazen. I have this huge feeling of discomfort around him because it's clear that he fancies me and he's about twice my age. 

But what am I supposed to do? I can't exactly report someone for *looking* at me, even if it does feel leery. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it. I'm hoping that it's just because I'm new, so it's a kind of novelty for him to have someone who he finds attractive in the office, and soon it will stop.

516,"Throwaway because my main has too much identifying information.

Just start here’s a little background on our relationship:

My dad has always been a good guy, but a less than good father. He is a stand up guy at work, and cares about the world and the people that inhabit it. However, growing up, it never seemed that my siblings and I were ever the top priority. For example, he would miss my sisters dance recitals because he had a long week at work, or he missed my very first homerun because he didn’t want to have to tolerate little league drama. Like I said, he has a good personality, but “was never there”. 

Shortly after my parent’s divorce our relationship got more strained. He would talk poorly about my mother, complain about how BS child support was, or complain when I ask for him to help with school expenses like yearbooks or band fees. Once I got into college, he decided he would give me $100 a month to help me pay rent with the condition that I kept him in the loop with my life. So I do it to keep the peace, and use that money for my monthly expenses.

Onto the story:

I am part of a 4+1 program at a prestigious state university where I graduate in 4 years with my undergrad and then spend one extra year to earn my masters. Well I graduated this past May with my undergraduate degree and will be again graduating this May. Well, shortly after Christmas I receive an email from my dad containing this message: 

“[son],

We wanted to email you about your Masters graduation ceremony and the walk you will be doing again.  We are very impressed with your schooling and we are very proud of all that you have accomplished during your time at [state university]
However, we wanted to send an email letting you know that we will be there in spirit this year, and we can just picture the graduation as we have fond memories of it last year.
Suffice to say that again, we are so proud of you and we know you will have a wonderful day.  Make sure to send a picture!  We love you James and we will be thinking of you on your day.

Dad and [step-mom].”

Based off our previous conversations, he has never expressed any desire to skip my graduation.  The dates for the ceremony have not been released yet, so it couldn’t be that there is a conflict. Like the email said, he was at the ceremony last year so it could be that he doesn’t want to drive 3 hours to my university.

I have worked very hard academically to finish my undergrad and grad degrees with flying colors. I have spent the majority of my life working for this moment, so I guess it just stings that he will once again not be there. 

If you’ve made it this far, I guess I just need someone else’s advice on whether or not I am overreacting to my dad not attending my graduation.

Sometimes he's the sweetest person alive and will yell at other boys for trying to flirt with me, randomly drops really cute lines in front of his friends and is just really protective and a great person. We're not alone very often, mostly on the road with others  (when we're alone he's always like that)

On other days like right now I'm being completely ignored, we don't talk on WhatsApp, we barely see eachother, and if we do he doesn't even pay attention to me. If I'm lucky I'll get a hi and a goodbye kiss but that's it. 
I've talked to him about it last week and he just said he's not much of a ""feelings person"" but he will try to work on it..
 
Right now I've uninstalled any social media to distance myself from everyone and be in peace.

Should I wait and see if it gets better? Should I text him? Should I wait until he texts me? Should I ask him what's going on???? Should I give up? What should I do???? I'm lost",23Jan2020,1
518,"So I was a music major for a few years. I was very good at developing my playing skills after practicing so much that I went insane. I couldn't pass the basic music classes though like music theory and aural skills. I loved clarinet SO MUCH, but failing at everything except playing my actual instrument was taking a huge mental tax on me. The immense pressure I felt from my peers in school was just awful. Everyone in that school was a music snob and it was too competitive. (Except for my own clarinet studio, they were awesome and supported my reasonings for quitting).  I suffer from anxiety and bipolar disorder (yes, I've been professionaly diagnosed). I have always had a huge fear of failure and when I finally faced failure, I did not take it well. So to help my mental health and to move on to a degree I might actually accomplish, I gave up music for good. I still have my R-13 and every time I look at it or try to play it, I get incredibly sad because I did not accomplish what I wanted since I was in middle school. (I'm 24 now). My boyfriend and I are thinking about moving into a new house, and we could really use the money to get into that house. I was thinking about selling my R-13, but I'm having reservations about whether I'll ever want to pick it up again or maybe pass it down to my kids when I have them. My boyfriend is supportive of no matter what I do, but he is also sad about this because he saw how proud I was when I played every day and he misses that. I don't know what to do.",23Jan2020,1

523,"About 2 years ago, in the middle of 7th grade (I'm young I know) I met this guy that I could just go back and forth with for hours. We had amazing chemistry and could talk about anything forever. Of course as a hormonal teen, I caught feelings and grew so attached. 

We were the kind of friends that only really talked in person, never made plans because although we had that back and forth we were both super awkward about 'relationship stuff'. Remember this is 7th grade.

Over the summer we didn't talk. I was so attached I would just lay in my bed and cry about him. I would think about him all the time and dreamed about what it would be like when we saw each other again. 

8th grade started again and we were so awkward, it took us two weeks to even get the courage to talk to him. Fast forward, we're talking again but things have changed. We don't have that back and forth anymore but we can still joke together. At this point all my friends joke about us getting together along with some outgoing classmates. 

We hug at the end of the year, everyone goes crazy wow human contact! Hugging!?

Now fast forward to freshman year we talk for the first 3 or so weeks, but we don't have any classes together. He eats lunch with me and a friend for awhile before completely ditching us. 

But now after we haven't talked for 4+ months, I still find myself thinking about him. Now my best friend has a class with him and she texts me about him sometimes. When I'm in the halls and I see him, I can't stop staring. I miss him, but he's so awkward I could never see us starting where we left off. Even though there's another guy I have my eyes on, I can't stop thinking about the guy from seventh grade.

TLDR; Had a crush on a guy from 7th grade, and now in freshman year I can't stop thinking about him.",23Jan2020,1
524,"Hey guys, so I really need some advice. I just got a new job, a decent-ish part time job, working at a smoke/head shop, making more money that I’d expected working a job like that. After working there for two weeks, I started coming to the realization that I’ve been trained improperly, on purpose. Instead of counting the drawer and my safe at the beginning of each shift, either my supervisor or the manager does it for me. They didn’t teach me certain things properly, and just told me to write down certain numbers on the paperwork at the beginning and end of my shift. Also, my manager, is stealing time (clocking in and going grocery shopping or whatever), and also pulling money out of the safe for a “new vacuum” but never buys it. These aren’t just one time things. My boyfriend is the manager of the same smoke shop, but a different location, and I guess he’s suspected this has been happening for awhile. In addition to that, my supervisor, is 100% most definitely selling drugs out of the store. One day he said to me “I’ll sell weed, coke, heroin, crack idgaf it’s money”, not realizing I can see him making hand offs in the store to customers not buying anything.  They both think I’m stupid I guess, or they just don’t care. 

Anyways, one day after I decided to count the safe and drawer on my own, I realized the drawer is short $45 (out of $200) and the safe is short $75 (out of $500). I told this to my supervisor, he told me not to worry about it and to put down $200/$500. I refuse. I told him he can write it if he wants to but I don’t feel comfortable. He does. So our district manager (everyone’s boss that I’ve mentioned here) comes from two hours away, once a week. She is kind of a hard ass towards them, and goes by the book for everything. She likes me cause I’m the first girl that’s worked there in awhile, and she’s all about empowering other women. After talking to my boyfriend about this, I decided to mention the drug thing to her yesterday, as I don’t want to be involved with selling drugs out of the store, and it’s happening while I’m there. She immediately calls corporate and has them review the cameras. 
Fast forward to today, thank god I have today and the next two days off, because everything is crashing down. The manager (the one stealing the time, not selling the drugs) is texting my boyfriend saying that the DM is calling him, asking why he’s clocking out and leaving, he’s saying he’s screwed, all this stuff. I feel the pressure now. It’s already out of my hands, the damage is already done. But I feel like no good deed goes unpunished. Did I do the right thing? Should I have kept my mouth shut and falsified records like they wanted me to? This is all just a lot. I feel like, logically I did the right thing. I guess I might just be scared that they will somehow retaliate against me. Any advice would be appreciated.",23Jan2020,1

527,"Hey guys! I literally just joined this sub because I’m feeling super lost. In 2017 I (20F now) got into a really good university in my hometown and completely failed out the first semester. I gave into the partying and got sexually assaulted pretty early into first semester, which didn’t help my partying. I only passed my lab class which was one credit so pretty useless. Second semester I was super depressed and didn’t even bother showing up to a single class because I was in the mindset of “oh well i’m dropping out what does it matter”. Well I am completely regretting everything.

I jokingly said we should get married and this back and forth of fake flirting/“marriage” thing has been going on for the past week. She even invited me to go see a lesbian singer with her. She even got fake mad when I mentioned I wanted to meet cute girls at the concert.

Hey everyone! So I’m trying to get some advice on my situation. I’m turning to reddit as a long time lurk because my options are limited so I’ll break down what’s going on. I (29M) live with my girlfriend (27F) in her home and I’ve been out of a job for a month now. I was working a local pizza shop making $10 an hour but I left it due to an abusive environment mostly brought on by the owners son. I decided to go on a job hunt because I want to obviously help my girlfriend pay half the bills. I was hired by staples in another city about 20 min away. The only issue is we’re sharing a car because my truck still doesn’t have tags and I’m short about $100 which I’ll be making from staples in the next week or so. So I’ll be good to go when I get that. But as it stands now, it’s a bit of a hassle going to this job due to the car situation. I was offered a position with Sam’s club in the same city just about the same distance but for $11 an hour and possibly more hours. At Staples I’m making $9 and from the looks of it I’m getting about 20 hours or so a week based on my scheduling. My girlfriend is supportive about everything essentially, but I can tell she’s isn’t too enthused about my working at Staples. She doesn’t hassle me about it, but I can just tell that she thinks it isn’t worth it. To boot, I’m completely left doing nothing while at this job. My training is terrible and I have no sense of direction as to what I’m supposed to be doing there as a sales associate. Of course I speak to customers and what not. But I’m left to figure out everything by myself essentially. I’m writing this to you all because as of today, my offer letter from Sam’s club was rescinded. When I asked HR why it was rescinded, they said that I failed the background check due to having duplicate social security numbers and that I needed to speak to the store manager and for him to reach out to HR to fix it. I called the manager, and she said that she would talk to her boss about it. But this same lady I had spoken to before and she did nothing when I reached out about getting an offer letter in the first place. It was a different manager that I had spoken to that got the ball rolling on my hiring process. My goal is to work part time and possibly go to trade school to achieve a worth while career. But as it stands, I’m officially depressed and I honestly feel defeated. To the point that I don’t even feel like returning to staples because I don’t know that it’s worth it. I just lost the will to try there and I had high hopes for Sam’s club but as i’ve stated, it almost feels hopeless. I’m currently selling my plasma as well to make some cash but I can’t do this forever.  So what would you do if you were me? Please offer some advice or constructive criticism. I’m not trying to seem lazy, but this sometimes is just really disheartening and it’s hard to carry on. I’ve been rejected so many times already after applying to over 100 jobs and for this to be taken away from me over something that isn’t even my fault is depressing.

Hello,

I made an accidental booking of a non-refundable apartment in [Nantes, France](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187198-Nantes_Loire_Atlantique_Pays_de_la_Loire-Vacations.html) on booking.com, which caused them to bill me. Even though i cancelled it within ten minutes, they are refusing to refund me. However they're willing to forward that amount as credit to a future booking i make at the same apartment. I have no need for a future booking and cannot afford to lose this amount.

If there is anyone who is interested in reserving this apartment, I can book it for them using my existing credit in my booking.com account and then have them pay me that amount.

Please help me! If anyone could also tell me other forums on which i could post this, I'd be so grateful. Please tell me how I can fix this",23Jan2020,1

537,"I've gotten a couple of notices in the mail about switching my power source from fossil fuel over to wind/solar.  In order to do this, I just need to fill out a form and mail it back to the power company.  I live in Illinois.

Of course, if it is this simple, I want to do this minor thing if it means I will be helping with the global warming problem.  I simply have a few concerns before I make the commitment that I've been having trouble finding the answers to:

1. **How much more will it cost me, in general terms?**   (Is there a figure like ""on average, about a 15% increase"" or something?)  
The sheet gives me a breakdown of cost-per-kilowatt, but I can't find anywhere on my account where I can see what I am *currently* paying-per-kilowatt, so that doesn't really mean anything to me.  If my power bill doubles, that could be tricky for me, financially.  If it isn't that much, then no problem here.  

2. **How will they be able to solo out the source of my power for** ***just my apartment?***    
Are they truly able to single out my apartment, and make sure it isn't using the old power source?  It seems like my entire complex is hooked up to a main source.  (e.g. when the power goes out, the whole building loses power).  How can they opt *just me* into wind/solar, when the whole building seems to be on the same line?
3. **Is the whole thing truly legitimate in the first place?**  
I'm just curious if this is truly something where switching power sources will make a difference, the way the notices in the mail say they will.  Obviously we know wind and solar are VERY clean, but are the power companies doing what they say they will in these notices?   
Or are they pulling some BS like ""half of your power will still come from fossil fuel"" or whatever - I know this one is very vague, but I just want to be sure I'm not being naive about it, if that makes sense.

538,"My 21 y/o brother has been staying with us since Christmas eve. As time as passed, he has become lazier and lazier. Doing the bare minimum of helping clean up. I come home from work almost every day to him being asleep on the couch, house a mess. Now, he has helped some. Taking out trash. Doing dishes occasionally. Sweeping floors occasionally.

But he doesn't have a vehicle or a job. So he is bumming cigarettes out to the woo wah. Eating all the food. This is the biggest issue. I know I've spent like $300 in groceries this month, idk how much my bf has spent, but we have had to take a trip to Walmart about 3x a week because we cant keep food in the house! He ate almost a whole loaf of bread in 1 day. Ate a whole jar of pickles, that I had for 3 days. A whole bag of ham missing, he says the dog got it off the counter. 

My mom said he could borrow their bike, and work at the gas station across the street (9 minute bike). He said he wont cause they make minimum wage. 

He has been saying things like he is going to jail. He has told mom he was gonna kill himself. He has to pick up a sapina (idk how to spell it), an order to go to court over child support. I offered to take him yesterday and he wouldn't get up to go. 

Idk if this is true but he says when he goes to court he will go to jail, and his bond will be amount of child support owed, and they wont let him out til its paid. If this is true, why would he not want to get a job so he at least doesn't owe AS much. But no. He is expecting his baby momma to drop the child support owed. I dont think she will, and I dont think she should!!!

I've realized that I'm enabling him. My bf has said the past 2 days he wants to kick him out (over the food). 

How do I go about doing this? I also want to add that this kid is ADHD and has the tendency to burn bridges with anyone who ""crosses"" him. Just basically when he doesn't get his way he acts like a brat. I'm borderline afraid of him tbh.

The only person that lives close to me is a total ass hole. They are always bitchy and sarcastic (this is a guy too not even a girl). Like even if i just give them advice and try to be nice i just get a snippy sarcastic response. EVERY TIME. No matter what i do or say i just get bitchy sarcastic answers. 

He constantly fucking brags. He has nothing going on his life but always brags and rubs everything in my face. Like my life is garbage and every time something goes wrong hes like yeah thats shitty I’m glad i dont have that i have this and this and this its so awesome. Like every day.

I tried hanging out with them for a year and this same stuff happened every single time. I felt so much better hanging out with them and not being alone i would laugh and just feel 1000x better not being alone and then they would just do some bitchy sarcastic response or do that weird ass bragging and it would just be so fucking annoying i didnt wanna be around with them.

I dont really do drama or fighting or any of that stupid crap I’m just trying to save up money and better my life and get away from drama so i dont really wanna argue and fight or anything. 

I dont know what to do. I have no way to meet people. They are so awful to hang out with but being alone is constant non stop misery. Hanging out with them was the only relief from non stop monotony and loneliness and it was just even worse hanging out with them. I hung out with them a really long time and was always super nice to them and they were just ass holes the entire time. Like every single time i hung out with them.

It’s better to just be totally alone right? I feel so much better getting out and hanging out with someone but theyre total ass holes and and it just ends up feeling even worse because theyre always an ass hole to me no matter what i do and i feel like i have to constantly fight with them or start drama and argue. 

I even ghosted them for a week and then i hung out with them again and i told him its because hes always an ass hole and then he just goes back to being an ass hole again and then just gives like a fake sarcastic forced apology or just says i cant help it i do it on accident and dont mean but they are like MASSIVE ass holes. I dont know what to do. 

I have just been sitting totally alone for months thinking something would get better id find something new. Nope. Just sitting alone total misery no end in sight.",23Jan2020,1

Alright, straight to the point...I want to start a new merchandise/charity company. The name that I thought of and fell in love with, after a google search, was discovered to have been used by two people in the past. The first person still has the company Facebook page up, but hasn't been active since 2016. The second person(s) has an Instagram account still up, but hasn't been active since 2017. The second one also has a link to a website that goes no where (Shopify actually asks you if you're interested in buying the name). 

I plan on Trademarking this brand and the whole nine yards. I want it to be completely legitimate and iron clad. 

Am I safe to proceed in doing so?

563,"Okay! This is an extension to my previous post titled “My Park.” In which, many of you responded with “go see a doctor”. As I stated before, I already saw one. Please go see that post for more information on my problem. Anyways, to the point of today’s post. My therapist. I went to see my therapist today, the one I was assigned. She told me that I should start taking some pills, I don't quite remember the name. I’ve developed quite the cough in the last day. I also have extreme headaches along with the memory loss. I did take another walk today, to the park. It was earlier, around 3am. I don’t remember how long I was there, but I took the time to walk the trail that leads into the forest. I found something while walking. It looked strangely similar to a piece of artwork hanging in my house. I like to take my work as a graphic designer into traditional mediums sometimes, which leads me to paint. I painted a pretty standard picture of the forest, not modeled after a real one. It harbored beautiful trees, they were gray and worn. It had a misty background and dark clouds. Above it all was a vibrant and bright moon, shining through the trees. It was truly a scene to behold. Someone once told me that it was creepy or bizarre, I think it’s my best artwork to date. Anyways I stumbled upon a photograph of my painting, my signature and all. I was certainly startled when I came across it. I picked it up and brought it with me to the session, the therapy session. Speaking of, I can’t really be too specific with what happend. I do want some amount of confidentiality.  It started with her showing me pictures and asking what a saw, when she did this I let out a laugh. I thought she was joking, after all that’s the kind of thing you see in the movies. Nevertheless, she assured me she was a professional and knew what she was doing. So I did that test along with a few others. She went over a few things, things that I would not like to discuss here, however she did tell me something strange. First off she gave me the medicine, second off she told me to come back every other week. Those seem like normal request and I was happy to oblige, but the third request completely bewildered me. She asked me to record my sleep. She said she had a sneaking suspicion about something. Now i’m not a therapist so I have no clue if what she's saying makes sense or not, but it seemed like I had no room to refuse. Her second statement on that request is what really got me to question this. She said she’d like a live feed. I thought that was bizarre, why would she need a live feed of me sleeping? Then again she’s the therapist. She told me she’d set up a video call on this thing called, discord? I’ve heard of it, but I haven’t really tried it. Anyway, tonight I’m going to do the live feed thing and see what happens, I’ll keep you updated. But until then, any thoughts? I don;t really know what’s happening, however I would like some advice on it. ",23Jan2020,1

Hello, 

this is a bit of a cross-post but looking for advice instead of monetary help

I am usually on disability but my doctor retired and did not send the paperwork in for my reassessment for disability. medicaid will not be approved for up to 6 weeks and I only have enough medication for a few more days.

Things are going to start getting really weird soon.

My father has gone through all the public assistance routes (he is my guardian and representative payee) and so far there has been nothing anyone could do.

we have redone the paperwork to reinstate disability but they said it would be done somewhere around april.

its about $200 dollars for all 6 of them. does anyone have any advice or a place that could help me?

I've had to half my medication to make it last so if this doesn't make any sense i'm sorry

Advice would also be really helpful. thank you for reading",23Jan2020,1

572,"Although I suffer from anxiety, I've never been afraid of being sexually assaulted until just a few days ago. I was walking back into my apartment building and I rounded a corner, where my boyfriend (27M) was standing as he was leaving to go get coffee. He was concerned that I was rounding the corner too carelessly and that even though I was visibly jumpy from his presence, I didn't react by protecting myself. We got into a conversation about me being too oblivious and how I should take more measures to protect myself. I took a self defense class when I was younger, but I don't carry around a knife or pepper spray or anything. Most of the time when I'm going out at night I have my dog with me, which makes me feel safer. He's small, cute, and extremely docile, so he wouldn't do much to protect me, but other people don't know that.

Where I really started to worry was when my boyfriend mentioned that there's a possibility that our relationship likely wouldn't survive if I ever was assaulted. I agreed because a trauma like that obviously isn't easy, but he made it seem like he'd jump ship right away and would not be there to support me. He said I could rely on my family for support and that I'd eventually find another guy to love me, but his trust in me would be gone if it ever happened. He said that if I took measures to protect myself he would be more likely to stay with me, but if I didn't put up a fight it would pretty much be over.

I tried so hard to see things from his perspective, but it's difficult because I don't believe that SA is ever a woman's fault. He eventually agreed to do everything he can to make it work if it ever does happen, but still couldn't guarantee everything.

I'm suddenly terrified to go anywhere alone. This morning when I was walking my dog a guy was walking into the building behind me and I started panicking. I'm suddenly very scared of all men when this hasn't been the case before. It's not that I've been blind to reality, or that I thought it could never happen to me, but never felt it was something worth stressing out about. I've just felt so defeated the past few days, knowing that the love of my life could potentially abandon me if something that isn't my fault at all happens. I have abandonment issues from childhood and I think the root of this fear might be that, not the actual act of an assault happening. I've been in therapy for years but I'm taking a break at the moment due to financial reasons. Help!",23Jan2020,1
574," 

I'm trying to put together an intervention for my (29F) sister (31F), but I have no idea where to even begin. She is extremely volatile, and I am afraid of pushing her away. She is not talking to our father regularly because he attempted an intervention with just him and her best friend at the time, that turned into a screaming match (my sister was doing most of the screaming). Nothing good came from it.

Here's \*some\* of the back-story:

My sister has always been somewhat cold. She used to hit me a lot and make comments about my weight (I wasn't fat) and my chest-size (I'm not completely flat-chested) growing up. I just thought the coldness was from growing up with an abusive father, and that the bullying was just how siblings were. I assumed I just dealt with our family life a lot differently than she did, and that her behavior was justifiable. She always accused me of never getting beat like she did, and she's accused my dad of just randomly hitting her when I know it wasn't true. \*She describes things that I know for a fact did not happen.\* She describes a childhood full of slamming doors and screaming parents, but it's just absolutely not true. There were never arguments that we could hear, and there were never slamming  
doors. Yes, our father was physically abusive, but not to the extent that she claims. If you were to just hear her ""side,"" she makes it seem like we were beat randomly every single day. My father was strict, but when we hit puberty, he would give us the option of being hit or being grounded. She would always pick being grounded, I always picked being hit. And it was always like that.

She accused me of being more devious and manipulative, but she would sneak out of the house to smoke cigarettes, sneak boys into the house, lie about where she was going and what she was doing. Sure, I did my fair share of sneaky teenager stuff, but again, if you listened to her, \*I\* was more more out of control and not nearly as good of a daughter as her. She accused me of being the favorite and being able to get away with everything. But I didn't. I got in trouble plenty.

She got pregnant her senior year of high school, and eventually got an associates degree years later. She's never actually held a job more than a few months, though. She always makes excuses about how terrible the management is, how they favor other employees more, or they aren't paying her enough for all of her hard work. I've tried to explain to her that she needs job experience in order to get a better paying job. She doesn't think she should have to do that.

She eventually has another kid with a different guy. This guy was a long-term childhood crush of mine. I had very lackluster, forgettable sex with him one night, and later found out he did it to make my sister jealous. They started dating shortly after that, and eventually had their first son. When she talks about the fact that I had sex with ""her husband,"" she makes it sound like they were already together, and I should have know he was off-limits. She was married to her first husband at the time, and I openly told her about the crush I had on him years prior to this forgettable night happening. But again, she was the victim here and everyone is out to get her.

They eventually have another son (third son- ages go currently from 14, 9, to 5 years old) together, and this is where things start to get really rocky. I believe she got postpartum depression, as she just completely stopped caring about the children. She calls them all ungrateful and selfish, and that she is going to start doing what she wants to be happy. She gets a boob job with a tax return (constantly telling me I couldn't get one because I don't even have enough flesh for implants to fit under), becomes anorexic (tells me I should follow her dieting plan to lose my extra weight), tans excessively (encourages me to do it because it will ""make me look thinner""), gets a divorce, and is hell bent on making her now ex-husband sell the house and give her half so that she can take her and her sons from South Carolina to Florida to live in a camper.

Their house is ACTUALLY full of screaming and slamming doors and all the awful things she accused my parents of raising us in, only a million times worse. Not only are the boy physically punished, they have no privacy at all. They live in a 4 bedroom house, but she makes all 3 boys share the bedroom right next to the master bedroom, where they get the joy of hearing their parents argue and have sex \*LOUDLY\* next door (yes, they still argue and have sex even after being divorced). She honestly acts like a rebellious 14 year old who wants revenge on everyone for what she perceives as wrong-doings done unto her.

She has accused her ex-husband of raping her 9 years ago, which I wouldn't doubt if it is true, but refuses to move out of (technically) his house (they agreed on the house being his in the divorce because she can't afford the mortgage and has never contributed to the house) because she says she wants to make his life miserable. In the process, though, she is also ruining her sons' lives. She also says that ""her therapist"" (I don't think she actually has one) said that she thinks my dad must have molested her and she just doesn't remember. She accuses my mom of never being there for us (she let my sister live with her when she had her first son, and constantly sends her money for things like getting her microblading license or getting a laptop so she can start doing photography). She accuses my family of helping me more than her (they helped me tremendously when I chose to leave my abusive situation, but they have offered her the same opportunities), and she has cut ties with all of her lifelong friends, accusing all of them either trying to sleep with her ex-husband or being selfish, shitty friends. She's also tried to encourage that I talk to guys she knows, and when we start talking seriously, she'll call and causally tell me how they hook up from time to time, \*but no strings attached\*, as if that makes it better. She says that the cops and her therapist have told her to just stay in the house with her abuser until they can arrest him for the rape, and that she should just keep the peace. She also says her therapist says she's right about everything and the only thing she needs to work on is to stop letting people use her and to stop allowing herself to be the victim.

TLDR; My sister has a history of bullying, lying, exaggerating, and throwing a fit when things don't go her way. She doesn't work and refuses to do so at this point. She is convinced she is going to take her three sons (ages 14, 9, and 5) to Florida to live in a camper. I seriously think she has completely lost touch with realty, and I'd like to plan an intervention.

\- HCOL is not a major issue if the net salary is better than LCOL setting. But perhaps best to avoid hyper-expensive areas such as the SF bay area. 

\- Reasonable visa accessibility. I´m Irish, so Europe is an option, as well as this the immigration process for Australia is relatively straightforward. These are just my own suggestions though. 

\- Young population (places with a substantial population aged 20-40)

\- Good climate year-round (ie around 70°F/ 20°C, no snow, not much rain)

I was walking out of my sons dr's appointment when i saw an old guy at the end of the hallway walk in, stop and look back through the door for a good 20 seconds before he went back outside..when i made it outside i saw people looking at my rear bumper this old guy rear ended my car (and apparently was going to bail from the looks of it if the other people were not looking at the damage) i said whats up guys what happened and the older guy seemed so nervous and even said that might of already been there now as dismissive as i am to confrontation when it is presented to me i welcome it with open arms i snapped back no it definitely wasn't there but its not too bad i eventually said its alright no big deal and he went back inside i left and when i got home i realized there was a small crack in the bumper so i drove back and he was already gone

We see each other as often as possible. but here's the thing. She doesn't communicate the way i do. i'm more of a talk most of the day, don't leave me on read, type of thing. and shes more of the not talk most of the day and catch up at night thing. i understand shes busy with work and school a lot so i'm not complaining about it honestly. it's just that we have two different ways of communication and i can see its already starting to bother her, but shes trying to work with me to help me change so i can have a healthy relationship with her. It's a hard transition for me but i feel like i want it to work. but i really like her and shes so sweet and pretty.

S (23) Is also very sweet and caring. way more affectionate verbally and physically. but makes me very happy. She lives far away though, up north. She has a job and she’s very close to her family and they all are very excited to meet me. She does throw off some mixed signals as well but she’s scared of moving too fast, I get that.  She is also very insecure, more than i am (which at times can be a lot and im trying to be better about it), but im hoping once i see her in person some of that will change.  

Really both girls are super sweet and make me happy.

I am... extremely paranoid. Borderline panic paranoid. I'm not sure why I'm posting this? I think maybe I just need to vent a bit because I'm very scared.

A short summary of me:

&gt; I have recently needed to change my name for unrelated reasons.
&gt; I have recently started a new script of generic adderall (yes, I know paranoia is a potential side-effect).
&gt; The roommates I moved in with a year ago are scaring me with their actions and choices. I'd like to be more specifc, but I know they use Reddit, and I'm trying real hard not to open up a can of worms.

Long and short of it though, it took longer to change my name than expected due to poor communication on behalf of multiple states. I need these documents as I'm currently unable to register my vehicle and cannot attend work without it (although the vehicle is still being operated). I had expected them in the mail Friday the 17th. I called the state office and they attested to as much. I am extremely fearful that my roommate is trying to undermine me and has stolen my mail. Some of it *may* be the adderall, but I believe it is only enhancing a very real fear, plus the fixation. The adderall is doing great otherwise, so I'm not blaming it for the paranoia. It's just a little unmanageable with how scared I am of my roommates right now and I'm really not sure what to do????

Company A is in a niche industry, and works with many top companies in the pharma world. They do consulting. I would be managing 2 junior analysts and paid $75k. The culture didn’t seem to fit what I wanted when I interviewed and the people didn’t seem very happy. This was a red flag but the role seemed great and has a TON of upward mobility.

Anyway, so I finally got the medication and was about to start uni, I moved away from my home and stayed closer to the uni to get the uni life experience. Taking the medication made me feel 'low mode' which was horrible. I locked myself in my room and didn't speak to my flat mates for a month.

The more the days went on I just felt alone and depressed in my flat and cried in my room. My flat mates didn't know anything about me and what I was going through and most of them were dicks anyway. So I kept my distance. I finally opened up to a close friend of mine. She was one of my mates from school. We got closer due to me opening up and ever since then we became best friends. Seeing her really made me happy in such a depressing and lonely time I was having.

It was getting worst for me daily and I opened up to another friend and collectively the both of them told me I need help. I shrugged it off and said ""I can handle it"". Months went by and did something I regretted.

The girl I opened up to was so nice and we got close and she showed signs of 'liking' me, so I told her I felt about her. Ever since then we've been having arguments monthly and she would block me and then a couple of days/weeks later she would unblock me. We talked it over and we would be fine until the next argument. This carried on for so long until one day I took a lot of the accutane pills because I was behind on the medication. I woke up the next day with a strong headache and in such a bad mood. We stared getting into an argument and I flipped out and told her I was killing myself. I went into my car and drove for miles. Just hoping I would have the balls to kill myself. I never did. I drove home and replied to the girl and told her I was ok. She flipped out at me and said she thought I did kill myself and that she broke down crying at work. I didn't realise what I did and she blocked me instantly after that. I was crying for weeks as I lost my only friend who I opened up to and had no one else to open up to. I was so annoyed at what I did and I never took the medication at high dosages again.

Finally she unblocked me after like 3 months or so and we spoke. We talked about that incident and we hugged it out but our friendship never felt the same after that. She told me that she distanced herself from me because I liked her but she would phone every week or so for lifts and would speak to me and then would wanna do something that week. Everything was unbalanced between us and I tried my best to get it to the way it was when we were best mates. It never did for ages. We continued to argue and she would block me for longer and longer periods of time.

So the medication laster 12 months and by the end of it I was so depressed and with anxiety that I never turned up for the test and failed. So I had to resit the entire year.

So when resiting the year I tried to get actual help from counselling at my uni and tried to go to the doctors. I got medication to help with my anxiety but all that did was make me nauseated everyday and told the girl and she said that maybe it's best I stop them. So I did after a week. I stopped going to the doctors and then with the counselling I went for 1 session and then wasn't able to go because I had no money to get into town to see them. So I was stuck at home. I just felt so lost, I had no money, no one to turn to, no one to speak to, lonely that I just broke down crying.

So that entire year basically nothing happened that was interesting except that I failed my uni year again and I'm still in first year and on my last chance of sitting it. I feel so dumb as all my friends and family think I'm doing well in uni but no. I'm stuck in first year depressed and lost.

So, that girl unblocked me and added me. I ignored it until I was having folk round at my house when someone asked if she was able to come round. I said no because she hates me and they said that she doesn't. So I get asked to add her and speak to her. So me and her start speaking again. She said stuff like, ""I'm always here for you"", ""I'm gonna keep trying until we are friends again"" and ""I miss being friends"". I said we can put it to one side and speaking again and she can come round. So she did and it was fine.

Later that week, we spoke again. I mentioned if there is any point to us being friends. We kinda had a little argument and she started crying. She said she was lonely and wanted to be friends again as she missed this friendship and missed me and missed when we talked. She also broke up with her boyfriend and felt alone. So she kept saying to me how much of a dick he is.

We made up and hugged and I left. Those 2 weeks we spoke and meet up where like we were best friends again. But then she got back with her ex.

For context. This guy is an asshole. The things he did awful, within 6 months of knowing her. They got together, controlled what she could do, what she can wear, who she can speak to, was so self conscious of any boy she spoke to even if it was a friend and when she broke up with him he grabbed her hand and then smashed a vase with his bare fists. The girl ran to her car crying because of how he reacted.

But anyway. I messaged her asking if we could speak because I didn't want that guy to come in and ruin the friendship I finally just got back. She said yeah we can speak and then nothing. I got annoyed and blocked her because it felt like the past and how she would always do something and then never. A couple of days go by and a unblock her because it was to rash of me to do that. I spoke to her and she went mental at me and said we were fine and that nothing was the issue between us and that it's got nothing to do with her boyfriend. We argued for so long that she just ignored me. I was upset but I guess it was my fault for blocking her. I tried a month later and no response from her. Then after 4 months of dating. He cheated on her twice and she was upset. Thought about messaging her but my mates said not to message her. So I didn't. She got back with him a month later

And then to finish it off, one of my mates went suicidal. I stayed up messaging him to go inside and tell his mum or dad or go to the doctors the next day. I messaged to make sure he was ok and started sending pictures with his wrist cut and a cliff edge. I told him to not do it and to go inside. I was annoyed with him because he put it on his story on Snapchat. I told him why? Anyway. He spoke to me next morning and thanked me for looking out for him. I said he was a mate and I'll do that for any of my mates. I week later I was out with him and in front of someone else made fun of me for thinking the pictures of his story was a cliff edge and it was in fact a pond. The picture was black and white and just showed his feet at the edge of what looked to be a cliff edge. I tried to defend myself but he continued to make fun of me. I hated how he made fun of me in front of someone staying up to message he was ok.

So I stopped speaking to him and other stuff happened and this post has gotten all ready long. But basically 5 of my mates took his side in a group chat we are in and lost all of them in a split second.

So now I have like 2 friends I speak to daily and now I have no clue who likes me.

I'm so self conscious and with the recent loss of all my friends leaving me. I felt so lonely. I had no one to speak to or chat to about what happened that I just cried to myself like I always did for this past year.

So now to the present. This past month. I've locked myself in my room and hardly spoke to the 2 of my friends who I know like me. I tried speaking to other friends of mine but I get ignored or the convo just dies instantly and I end up even worst because I'm so lonely that I crave a convo that when it ends so quickly I end up worst. So I've stopped speaking to them and only speak to the 2 of my close friends who carry the convo and keep it going.

I still think about that girl I lost, it's so hard because she was my best mate. We did a lot of things together and spoke a lot and when times were rough we would speak and she would make me feel happier. And vice versa. I would help her when she felt shit about herself. But now she doesn't speak to me and I've tried to get over that but every day or so I still think about the good times

So right now, suicide is on my mind. I think about it every so often and think how good it would be. But I'm scared of that.

I've been to the doctors and talked about my anxiety and depression. He's gave me medication for the anxiety and says I have 'low mood' which I think is bull shit but i don't know anymore. I haven't told them about suicide thoughts but I'm not really planning on doing that right now anyway.

I'm planning on going back to counselling but I need to wait for uni to start which is in a couple of weeks time. So I'll need to wait for my meeting with the person and speak to about what I'm going through because I don't even know myself anymore. It's all mixed up in my brain right now

Any clue of what to do? I'm going back to uni to finish my final chance at 1st year, I still think about my best friend who left me who got me through my depressive episodes and I have really no friends to speak to and have anxiety and find it so tough to speak to anyone even my friends at times and I haven't opened up to them about what I'm going through right now and I'm lost and just worried for the future and what to do with my life



tl;dr - I've been depressed for maybe 2/3 years now. Opened up to a close friend and told her about my depression. We got close over that and she was my best friend. Told her I liked her and ever since then we argued. She broke up with her boyfriend and messaged me to me mates again. We spoke and she said she missed me and that she wanted to be mates again. She got back with her boyfriend and I wanted to make sure that the controling boyfriend won't miss with our friendship. Things got out of control and she no longer speaks to me and it's been maybe 7 months since we spoke and I still think about her. 5 of my friends left me because they took his side and now I have only 2 friends. I have depression and anxiety and I'm self conscious and hate speaking to anyone new and I'm on my last resit of my first year of uni as my depression got in the way of my studies and now I'm worried I might mess up my life because I'll be kicked out of uni I fail again.",23Jan2020,1
591,"So on Jan 4th my friend and I had a...”argument” it was just me asking him if he wanted to be fwb at which didn’t go so well. I asked e cause he’s already my sexting buddy but anyways that’s not the point we talked to each other more then just sexting buddies. So anyways he said that we can’t be friends anymore and he don’t know how this is gonna work out and he’s sorry and blah blah. All this drama I confessed to him that i liked him, he said he don’t back. I won’t blab too much cuz I moved on from this but the thing that confused me was 4 days later he texted me responding to my story on snap “I know we aren’t friends anymore but my music in band is way harder😭” ohhh so he’s hitting a convo up with me now? I said that just because we aren’t friends anymore doenst mean we can’t still talk. 
But really 4 days after all that lol couldn’t really hold it together could be? I told my friend about this and she says that he couldn’t get me off his mind. Idk..and anyways after he hit me up we started talking like we didn’t just have a whole 2 hour argument 4 days ago! I like it. She said that he’s catching feels for me. 
Yesterday him and I were in the same room and 
Tl;dr: ex-friend/now friend? texted me after days we can’t be friends anymore. Keep catching him looking at me and copying eveything I do. We would laugh when something funny would happen and we both look at eachother, 
I  was adjusting my sleeve on my hoodie, I was pulling it up. Pulling the right sleeve up. And I looked at him and he was doing the exact same thing on the exact same arm. And we both looked at eachother..and made eye contact. Is that a coincidence or what.",23Jan2020,1

595,"My boss (J) has favorite employees and everyone knows. I’m a favorite and so is my coworker (R). R shows up at least 15 mins late to every shift she is scheduled for. We work at a fast casual restaurant so this can really impact the workflow. She does next to no work when she is there and likes to flirt with J whenever he is there. She messed up around 10 orders one night and J comes up to her saying she’s doing a great job. R has left early without permission multiple times as well. After all of this, R has gotten no repercussions. 
It may be relevant to know that J is twice R’s age and J left his first wife for one of his (younger) employees at a previous job.

597,"She breaks her ass studying, and still gets poor grades. She has a hard time understanding the subject during the class, and still does her homework every day. She's one of the most hardworking people i know, and the results she gets feel demotivating and unfair. While i work half as she does, and get way better grades.

In my country, you have the option to take 2 years of Bachelor's so you can get to college the quickliest. She did that, without knowing what career she wanted to do specifically (very common, it's like the safe bet). Now that she knows what she wants to be when she grows up, she has realized that college isn't the wisest way. We are finishing the second and last grade, so she doesn't want to drop out. If she does go to college, she needs excellent grades if she wants to keep her kidney. But she's not getting them and she's always sad and frustrated because of this. And i don't really know how can i support her.

TL;DR: Friend works her ass off for getting good grades, so she can go to college without selling her left kidney. Doesn't get the grades.

598,"If you've just smoked a joint and you're feeling anxiety or panic, here are some tips to keep in mind. Im 16 and i quit smoking weed because i was starting to not enjoy it, i've had some bad experienceces, so here are some things you may want to know if you're really high or not having fun after smoking. 

1. Drink cold water and wash you're face, do it often. 


2. Tell someone that is not high, or sombody that you trust to talk to you, HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMBODY. You need to keep your mind distracted to avoid paranoia so listen to somebldy tell you a story, ask them questions and have a normal conversation. 


3. Eat snacks, you probably feel hungry later on, so eat small snacks and drink water. 


4. While you're talking to your friend, have small walk, just not to feel cold and do a bit of exercise.

 
5. Don't panic, everything will be okay. 


That's about it, know your limits and be careful, weed is nice and all, but it can be dangerous. I hope this helped you if you've had bad days with joints. Thank you! :))",23Jan2020,1

1: is it normal for teenagers to feel like they might identify as the other gender?

A few years ago, a friend was using the opposite pronouns and using a name of the opposite gender (not telling too much so people I know don't realize it's me) .  (also, people were being assholes to people who didn't use the pronouns/name they wanted, and I kept forgetting, so I almost lost a friend because of people being assholes, but back to the main point. Sorry I'm not staying focused) they eventually stopped and said they *thought* they were transgender but aren't. Could that be the same for me?

So about a year ago, a murder happened about two houses away from mine. 
Didn’t hear much about it as I was away that day. 

Today the police showed up to recreate the crime scene and the children of the guy who got killed also showed up (20-ish f and her younger brother). When I got back home a few minutes ago I found them crying on the door of my house. 

As of now I brought them some hot drinks but they haven’t calmed down. They told me the psychologist/investigator they got close to/whatever won’t be able to show up until night (it’s the afternoon in France). 

I really want to talk to them in order to try and take them away from all of this but as of now I haven’t been able to say too much and would like to avoid to lead them on difficult things to say (the guy was their father, their mother left them when they were young).

605,"I have a friend that I've known since high school. Our relationship has been a tumultuous one to say the least, with many times leaving me with the ""shorter end of the stick"". At this point in my life, I don't consider her a close friend to me, but I still care about her. I don't think she has a very supportive net around her anymore; her family is a bit estranged from her, the friends I have met of hers don't seem to be in the picture anymore, and I recently had an old college acquaintance reach out to me for advice about how to deal with her (i.e. back away from being a go-to person she calls). 

Objectively, I suspect she has some issues with anxiety and maybe some depression. Since college, she started complaining of serious back/neck pains - blaming it on a bad chiropractor; and eventually post-college elected to go through a couple of invasive surgeries to alleviate pain and another to fuse her spine. To be honest, I was never sure if she needed the surgery as it was entirely elective, but felt horrible asking if her pain was something over-escalated by her anxiety (or some other mental health matter). 

Through those experiences, she started accruing a lot of prescriptions; I never really asked what she was taking, and sort of lost touch with her years ago when she started drunkenly provoking me while I was driving her home at the end of a day trip to the beach (ended with me pulling over for fear of both of our safety, and her driving off and leaving me 3 hours away from home). Since then, it's strictly casual for me to stay in touch; she uses me frequently as a reference (professionally and personally). I've gotten phone calls maybe every two-three months or so from a potential hire asking me to provide some background on her. Needless to say, she seems to job hop frequently, but she's in social work so I'm not sure if that's just standard practice in her field. 

Today she called me crying because she is in a tough financial spot, mentioning that she has no one else to turn to and her parents are not providing her any assistance. She tells me she just paid a large sum for late registrations and violations on her car and something about the state needing more money to lift the suspension on her license. She also mentioned being late on her car payments and just receiving two-weeks notice from her current employer. She did say she has applied to another job, but it requires her to have her car, hence the reasoning for her frantic state and needing money ASAP. 

I'm not sure if I should help because there are a lot of red flags for me, on top of the fact that I'm not sure giving money will help her in the long run. I also don't want to open a door that I may never be able to properly close without further injury to all parties involved. But... if anyone has advice or guidance on the matter, please share!

611,"   Me and my ex were together since Freshman year of highscool and dated for 6 years until I moved from community college to a 4 year. My gf wanted to move in with me and attend college with me. Everything was fine, she said she loved me and wanted to get married in the future. About a month before the lease starts she dumps me. The first 3 months we move in she said ""theres a good chance we'll get back together"" then later one night we have a fight and she says ""I was never going to get back with you."" WTF. What a monster.

    Thing is she honestly doesn't care. She doesn't care that she hurt me and she doesn't care that it hurts me everyday to live and see my ex. She told me she completely moved on and that she has 0 feelings or attraction towards me. She told me to ""get over it"". She said she doesnt know how I still have feelings for her. Dont get me wrong I fucking hate her guts but I still have feelings for her. 6 months later she finds a guy on Tinder and wants to bring him over to spend the weekend with her. Okay, so she thinks it's okay after everything she did to me to bring a guy over so they can fuck in her room 6 feet away from me? 

   I confronted her and told her no and a million reasons why it was wrong for her to even think about that shit. So she decided to tell her Tinder date that ""my roomate doesn't want you over"". Then   he ghosted her and she started crying. WTF. She cries over a Tinder date but didnt even care when I was in the hospital and literally almost died a couple weeks after she dumped me. This school year has been awful for me. Because of my health problems and of course living with my ex problems my grades are failing. I'm on academic probation and might get  kicked out of school.

  Heres where I'm shooting myself in the foot. I'm so upset that some nights I'll go out and get shit faced and then come back to my place and roast the fuck out of my ex. I tell her shes a monster and selfish and a fucking horrible person. She thinks my distress is annoying and tries to just stay in her room now. She said she wants to be ""civil"" and thinks shes the mature good person on the moral high ground because she doesnt say anything mean. She's just....indifferent. It's like im talking to a stranger it hurts so much. She can't acknowledge the fact that what she did was wrong and that she hurt me. She never apologized for leading me on and signing to live with me. The most she said was ""sorry you feel that way"". She might be a psychopath.

I already know the obvious. She doesnt care about me anymore at all so why do I still love her that's stupid I'm wasting my life. Yeah I know. But I cant help my feelings. I already know we never would have worked out of she doesnt love me back. But of course I still have lingering feelings after 6 years spent with her. I know I should move out, but I dont want to reward her horrible behavior by giving her a whole empty 2 bedroom apartment for herself to play house with her Tinder dates in. She also wanted to bring her friend over to live here permanently. Wtf. 

Why doesn't she have a conscience or any sign of remorse about what happened? How can you just flip a switch like that and have no feelings at all for someone you spent over 6 fucking years with!? I figured she got over me while we were together but why did she sign to live with me if she was like a month away from dumping me!? She's reinventing herself. She got a whole new nice wardrobe, got a nose piercing, still a bitch imo but has some more friends, is more positive, hasn't missed a single class this semester. I think I was holding her back and I fucking hate myself for it. Meanwhile I'm missing classes, find it hard to get out of bed, cant focus because I'm still putting all my mental energy on my ex. And she doesnt care. As long as shes doing good she doesnt think twice about my mental/physical state.

I'm still looking for answers but she doesnt want to talk about us at all anymore. She rolls her eyes and ignores me the rest of the day. She just wants to sweep me under the rug and act like nothings happened. I'm going to therapy now and my therapist agrees that shes awful. She gets to be happy and shes leaving me to pick up the pieces. I wish I didnt care. I really wish i didnt. What should I do? Revenge? Move out? Both?",23Jan2020,1
612,"Hi Reddit, I'm in some need of advice.

I'm a 22 Male whose just graduated (July 2k19) with a degree in Mathematics at a Russel Group University. I applied for my Masters in January and unfortunately did not get the University I wanted so I decided after university to go and dive into the job-hunt. 

My dream job would be to become a lecturer and teach mathematics at a University, hence why I really wanted this specific maths programme. My parents know this and don't support my decision as they want me to work myself up in a corporate company as soon as possible.

My step-father as long as i can remember has been pestering me to get a job regardless of our financial situation (we're quite a well off family and luckily have never once worried about money/bills/food etc.) I won't dwell on my step-father's relationship but all that needs to be known is that he's pretty much a bully and wants me out asap.

Now since August I've applied to over 200 graduate schemes and maybe around 30-40 regular temp/part-time jobs. I've had around 20 interviews and been unsuccessful in all of them. Which has been a very disheartening process. With a bit of luck and networking, I managed to score a months internship at quite a big company that works with satellites and other engineering related stuff. 

After the months internship I decided why not re-apply to the masters that I initially wanted to do, more than anything. Luckily I managed to get an offer and was accepted to start my masters in September 2020! I was so proud and happy, i was over the moon. I went and told my mother and step-father but they didn't seem to even care the slightest. I remember my mother/step-father replying to me ""what about the job/career stuff?"" and making comments like ""you need to get into the real-world and see what its like!"", ""we've come to the conclusion you just don't want to work"". 

I've been pestered everyday since after my internship with ""i'm a bum"", ""i'm a lazy piece of shit, who just doesn't want to work"", and don't get me wrong I tutor part-time and also have worked in the summer at a local restaurant, and saved quite a bit of money from that. 

Now I'm unemployed and currently researching new topics in mathematics and bettering myself with gym and other hobbies such as music whilst I have the time to before I start my masters. I'm currently in a situation where I do not have to worry about money, I pay for my own meals and any other expenses. 

My question is am I the ass-hole for now kind of giving up on looking for a job? I've got my masters coming up in around 8 months and then my PhD. I'm being pestered every single day about getting a job and when I ask them why they want me to get one It's the same comment like ""don't you want more money?"" or ""you're just going to sit at home and do fuck all?"". I can't understand what's the massive problem about me not having a job for a few months before I start my masters, It's not like I'm in dire need of money or struggling.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you Reddit.",23Jan2020,1
615,"I'll try to make this as short and concise as possible to prevent any confusion and to receive the best results. I'll keep this person anonymous for their sake and my conscience. I had an old friend on discord who I enjoyed having conversations with, sharing memes, along with sharing an interest in certain adult material that I won't get into here. Point is at the time I considered us to be good friends, I am unsure as to how they truly felt about it however. At some point roughly around September to October of 2019 I had said some questionable things, one of those having been making a joke about working as a prostitute (which I do not do). I suppose I might have struck a nerve as they became far more distant with me after then, I vaguely remember him saying something along the lines of ""We're still friends, but I don't know how to feel about that."" This, obviously, upset me in that I wasn't aware that I would offend or cause some kind of discomfort in him, especially considering our common interest (and sharing a server) for *certain* things. I intended to apologize but my discord account was unfortunately deleted, and all attempts to have it reinstated were met with botted replies. I've since made a new account and rejoined old servers, only to find he had left them. I've asked mutual friends we had, and they had not been able to speak with him either. I eventually googled his old discord name partially as a joke and partially curious as to if something would come up. Surprisingly I had found a twitter page, fandom wiki page, and references to a steam page (which I at one point had him added on steam but no longer do). I felt a bit dirty working so hard to search for a way to contact him again, and after reading articles and watching videos about internet stalkers I'm worried I might fall into that category because of my persistence. I've recently found his account again from the help of one of his friends and I'm currently waiting for an acceptance of a friend request so I can finally deliver the apology I've wanted to give for so long. I could theoretically have his friend send it over, but it doesn't feel as genuine as it would be if I were to give it to him myself. I do not have romantic feelings for him, but I did consider him to be someone who's wellbeing I cared deeply about. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, am I stalker-ish or stalker-like traits for trying this hard to get back in contact?",23Jan2020,1
616,"she is in my girl guide unit - let's call her Amy. all of this happened over the summer and idk why but i just remembered yesterday and i feel compelled to do something but i'm not sure what, also, i could be overreacting?

Amy is VERY fragile and can barely talk to people she's known for years - we are both 16 and i've known her since we were 12. she's sensitive and awkward and lacks a lot of social skills. once our girl guide leaders told us they were dissapointed in us because we were loud at a hotel at night, and she cried - they didn't even raise their voice or anything.

our unit was going on a trip to the UK - there was a meeting with the girls and the parents to go over paperwork and stuff, i was sitting next to amy's dad.

we had to draw this thing for the girls in the UK, and I heard her dad mutter that she couldn't even draw or color in the lines properly or something like that (i dont rlly remember this was months ago). anyways her dad definitely called her an asshole and said the f word a couple of times - the worst part is her younger brother was sitting there too and hes probably only 10. he wasn't too loud and everyone was talking so i think i was the only one who heard.

we went on a trip, and this one night amy was crying to one of the girls. this girl she was ranting to, lets call her Mya, had a very traumatic childhood so I don't really think she was able to realise that what amy was going through was not okay or normal. they both thought i was asleep and i was on the top bunk so i didnt say anything, but i heard everything.

amy talked about her parents aren't ever proud of her and nothing she does is enough for them - a lot of the places we stayed didnt have good wifi so she wasnt able to contact her parents - and her dad yelled at her for being ungrateful over the phone.

there's one last thing - its kind of weird to talk about but back in 2016, we went to a national camp. these girls started talking about masturbation and sex and stuff and amy started BAWLING. everyone was kinda weirded out but this one girl hugged her and asked if the discussioin triggered a bad memory and amy nodded.

i know its a big assumption but maybe this means she was sexually assaulted or abused by someone? i dont know - but now that i put everything together she could be in a really tough situation and im not sure if shes okay.",23Jan2020,1
617,"I am trying to decide whether to go to university in Belgium or in Denmark.

I would much rather choose Belgium, because the university (KU Leuven) is better than the one in Denmark and the degree I would choose suits me MUCH more. On top of that Belgium resonates more with me. However, in Belgium a year costs 1000 Euros (not a crazy amount of money, but still), and in Denmark it's free, as well as in Denmark I would receive a grant of 550 Euros every month, which is quite a bit of money - basically enough to keep me comfortable along with a job.

On top of that, if I would stay in Denmark, I would stay close to my parents, which have a negative impact on my well being. I would not live with them, so our contact would be severely reduced, but I would still live very close by.

Moreso, I do not like Copenhagen, and I would study in Copenhagen... so... there's that.

Finally, I am already admitted into the university in Belgium, while I am not completly sure if I would get into university in Denmark.

I really need some advice right now because I feel like this is kind of overwhelming. Basically I'm choosing between 550 Euros a month and the degree I want alogn with personal freedom and comfort. I really want to study in Belgium but I don't want to regret my decision. Please help!",23Jan2020,1
618,"\*\*Warning: longest post in the world ahead\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so I was really reluctant to post this but I've reached the point where I'm really sick of bottling it up and I could use some opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents separated when I was about 9 and my brother about 11. We weren't very upset about it because it was a lot of fighting and screaming anyway. We wanted to live with my father because my mother was a really nasty person and screaming all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a long custody battle and basically the next 10 years was a cycle of us going to see her (dinner, sleepover etc), she would try to be nice for a while, but she would keep complaining and bitching about how horrible we are to not love her and how evil my father is to take us away, until we would get mad at her and she would slap us (mostly me, because I am super defensive of my brother and father) and we would refuse to see her for a while, then she would keep calling and calling and calling until we agreed to see with her, then she couldn't suppress her nasty self and it would blow up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile this is shortly after the Asian Financial Crisis and my father is struggling really hard to work and take care of us at the same time. We lived in a rented house and ate relatively shitty food. And powdered milk, which I hate. Happy to say we made it through and my brother got part/full scholarships while I did a cheap local program (in Malaysia) for a few years and the final year of my bachelor's in London. 

&amp;#x200B;

As we became adults my mother still picked fights, but she gradually lessened the severity/we were better at telling her enough. But seriously, she is such a horrible person that this one time my brother and I were both driving over after college to have dinner with her, in super intense rush hour traffic. My college was closer and my brother's further away + worse traffic, so he was maybe 30 mins late. She spent the WHOLE TIME complaining over and over and over again about how he was late. We weren't even going anywhere, just eating at her house, and there were only the 3 of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, she never seemed to work a full time job and always had some newfangled direct sales thing she would yammer on about how great it is, then after a while stop and start bringing up some other junk. There is a crystal thing in her house that costed like USD2500 and she put our hairs (with the knob thing at the end) in for good luck or whatever. WTF right. Oh she also says she is a devout Christian then we were like then why do you believe in this?? And she mumbled something so inconsequential I don't remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously this stupid shit is costing her much more money than she's making. She's racking up credit card debt, she bought a fucking Peugeot, sold it to someone, bought it back at one point, then sold it again. She renovated her RENTED house to build an outside kitchen area. I have no fucking idea why, there is a perfectly functional inside kitchen. And the outside one is all disgusting and rusty now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily for her my father has been busy raising us so my brother starts working and making money. So she's taking money from him the whole time. He's paying for all the dinners for the mother who never raised him. We're kinda worried she's gonna be a huge leech AND downer his whole life. Worried that after my father dies (he is older) she will show up and refuse to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

The silver lining is that she meets an Australian guy and by some miracle of God manages to not be such a horrendous bitch and marries him. So now she's in the process of moving to Australia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around late 2016 I come back to Malaysia from my master's. I've just started working and only making about RM3000+ ($800). I'm giving money to the father who raised me and who pays the bills for the house I live in. I'm preparing to pay a huge amount for braces. I live frugally because we were so poor when we were young. She shows up for dinner on one of her many trips back and forth from Australia, and says she wants to clear her credit card debt and asks RM1500 ($368) a month for 6 months. She says after 6 months she will start paying back x amount per month. My brother seems to consider it, then she says from EACH OF US. She doesn't even care that I've only just started working and she's asking for basically half my salary. My brother said he would give her money and not to get it from me because I don't have much. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was the only incident where I witnessed it and she specifically said it was A LOAN and outlined a ""payment plan"", but there are COUNTLESS of other times where she's asked my brother for money, thousands of dollars at a time like upwards of US $1000. I don't know why but my brother keeps giving it to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2020. She's married, she's flying back and forth between Australia and Malaysia, at least 2-3 times a year. She's going to Taiwan for holidays. Every time I see her she has bragged something about money. On previous times she has mentioned - how much money she gets if/when her husband dies (wtf right? I don't remember how much but it's a decent amount), how much she makes being a part time nanny, how affordable her cost of living is. At one of these occasions she kept asking me how much money I was making and I asked her if she thought about paying my brother back. She pretended to be like ""yeah I guess it's time"" but obviously nothing has come of it. She's also very fond of planning large family dinners 10-20 people and going ""oh my son will pay"". They were having dinner somewhere and my brother and I didn't eat with them cause we already had plans, but dropped by to say hi after, then she started saying ""come, let's go to baskin robbins, \[brother name\] will treat"".

&amp;#x200B;

Today I told her I was planning to become a permanent resident of another country and moving away, then she started talking about how she is a permanent resident of Australia now and gets 13,000 AUD ($8882) per year if she can't find a job, she gets to attend courses for free etc. She also told me to go visit her before I move. I said I didn't have money, then she was like ""I pay for your ticket"" (she won't really). She also talked about how they spent 3000+ AUD ($2050) on a holiday to Tazmania. At dinner she chose a restaurant and started reading the menu and was like ""ooo quite expensive, nvm \[brother name\] can afford it"". Wtf. Thankfully her husband is not as much of a shit as her and wanted to pay the bill. Then she started making a huge deal about it like ""ooooo we're treating tonight"" and I was so sick of her bullshit I was like ""yeah you earn Australian dollars."" Then she mumbles something about how my brother is the son (so he should pay all the time). I NEVER bring up money myself because it makes me so pissed off, but somehow she always does. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this because I'm always sick of her bullshit then I forget it for a while, then she comes back and slaps me in the face with it. Am I wrong in thinking that she should at least pay for the amount SHE specifically said was a loan??? Should she not be picking up some of these dinners??? Should it be ALL on my brother, whom she didn't even raise or contribute financially to his upbringing AT ALL? My brother doesn't want to confront her and wants to just let it be, but it's so disgusting and sickening to me I cannot even respect her as a person. I don't really want to see her anymore but I do because if I don't she will just nag and complain to my brother a lot. But I've really reached breaking point with this bullshit. Should I just tell her once and for all how I feel? I most definitely do NOT want her thinking she can take a nice expensive holiday to visit me instead of paying zero money back to my brother. I see people talking about how their mother's dont want them wasting money meanwhile my mother is like wantonly spending my brother's. I also consider telling my aunt (her sister) how I feel and hope she can break it to her, or tell her husband so he can make her pay my brother back. I'm sure he would be horrified if he knew. 

&amp;#x200B;

(If you're wondering about our financial relationship with our father, the three of us treat our money as one. We have an overdraft in my brother's name so we just put all our excess money there to reduce the interest. My father had a hefty hospital bill recently and we paid it collectively.)",23Jan2020,1

621,"(18M) 4 months ago one of my friends from school broke up with his girlfriend of 1&amp; 1/2yrs. He ended it cause “he wasn’t attracted to her anymore” but he handled it very poorly &amp; she was very upset afterwards for a while.

624,"Sorry this is so long. I appreciate any feedback. 

I can't stand my brother in-law and sister in-law and their kids (Its my wife's brother). They have a 5yo boy and a 3yo girl. My kids are 10 &amp; 7 so I have some experience with kids and parenting. They live 2.5 hours away and we don't get together very often, but they usually come to us and stay with us. The tension when they're around is palpable. 

I don't even know where to start. I'm not a particularly strict parent, but the in-laws never discipline their kids when they're doing things that most parents would find unacceptable. When I say discipline I dont mean punishing or yelling, I just mean addressing the issue AT ALL. Both parents are weak and don't want to be ""mean"" to their kids. Rules and specifically boundaries are not defined or enforced. Its mostly the 5 year old boy. He creeps me out. He does a lot of weird shit. He doesn't act like a typical 5 year old and often acts like he doesn't understand English when I try to interact with him, but it's more than just shyness. He's a colossal pussy and is scared of everything, and I mean safe/simple kid-friendly things. Not anything that a reasonable person would think a child would be afraid of (I realize that kids are kids and they're all different and its ok for them to have irrational fears sometimes). His parents reinforce the behavior though, and don't even try to teach him to be brave or help him overcome the irrational fears. Sometimes they even validate the fearful behavior, but usually they ignore it. 

I try really hard to have positive interactions with their kids and try to be a good, fun uncle. I make my kids try to play with and include their kids in games/activities, but the son just doesn't seem to comprehend and/or acts too scared to participate. This often frustrates my kids, which adds to the tension. I mean something as simple as tossing a ball around between 3 people completely baffles and/or terrifies him. Again his parents make no attempt to help him or reassure him that tossing/catching a ball is a simple safe activity. 

The 3 year old daughter acts like a typical 3 year old, but she also has no rules and relies on her cuteness to get away with with everything. Which, in my opinion as a parent, is something that can get out of control quickly and be a major problem as she gets older. Both their kids struggle at daycare and get in trouble a lot, but mom and dad act like they have no idea why, nor do they care. Both parents just seem to do whataver is easier on them as parents, regardless of what is best for the kids. 

Part of the problem is that the in-laws have made me out to be a monster to their kids. They often tell me that they use me as a threat to their kids, meaning they tell them they're going to drop them off and have me babysit them and tell them not to listen to me. Which, the last part is fine, I get it, they're not my kids so they don't have to listen to me. 

It doesn't help that I have nothing in common with the parents. I struggle to even hold a conversation with either of them. The conversations we do have are about as superficial as a conversation can get. It's like talking to strangers. It gets downright uncomfortable sometimes, either because the conversation is awkward or because I have to tell my kids to stop doing something that their kids continually do with impunity. Also their kids havs no bedtimes. So when they stay with us we can't even interact/bond like adults or even have adult conversations because their kids are exhausted and therefore require constant attention (whining, needy, meltdowns, crying, tantrums, etc.). 

I don't get why this shit occupies so much space in my head. I shouldn't give a shit about any of it. This has to be because of me, some kind of subconscious insecurities, anger, resentment or something, right? I lost my only sibling so I want to have a close relationship with them. Although we really have nothing to build a foundation of closeness/friendship on. Maybe that's a pipe dream, but I at least want my kids to be close with their cousins. I'd like for them to have fond memories of being with their aunt/uncle and cousins, but dammit its brutal being around them. Any suggestions? Anyone?",23Jan2020,1

A first lecture and knows that so she didn’t come early with her friend but her friend kept watching me till she went inside second lecture i went outside she was at the same place i smoke at so i went to the car again she moved close to the car then went for a walk then inside every time she comes close she keeps watching the car and thats it for the day,
After that day the whole week she keeps looking at me really quick like really quick just to see what am doing or maybe waiting for me to approach so am regretting not going up to her and feeing like i missed the chance again what yall would advice me to so.

Now what am asking for :
Am i doing something wrong as of bad impressions?

Should I approach her one more time ( I don’t want to cause i feel like i did my part of showing her that am interested multiple times although i really like her and don’t wanna lose her)? 

This one for the girl is she the type of girl that likes attention and like to keep boys around her at the tip of her finger or whatever?

What yall think of the whole situation ?

Edit: i heard she live in a place suspicious place thats place known for girls doing stuff with boys and all that type of stuff and that stuff although she doesn’t look like that type of girl maybe am blind with love idk(not sure about that information) , and i heard from a student with them that she got something going on with their teacher (although they kinda hate her cause she is the type of girl that own herself doesn’t pay any attention to who around her) both of these things i heard before the monthly exams where she was avoiding me at the time (maybe am wrong and that she just was shy) maybe that thing didn’t go well and she went back to me maybe it didn’t even happen anyway and that was a lie let me know what yall think.

If you reached here thanks in advance for only reading means a lot ? I think?

Thank you :)",23Jan2020,1
631,"I'm a plus sized 24 y/o F here (5'8, 220 pounds) that comes from a very traditional but close Filipino family. I have one aunt in particular who gives me a really difficult time about my body. She says passive-aggressive things like, ""You'd be so beautiful if you lost weight"" and ""Your boyfriend still finds you beautiful?"" (I've gained weight over the years) 

Normally I brush small things like this off, but the tricky part is that I work with her so I'm taking these comments nearly every day. Today I brought lunch in for work, and when she saw it she said, ""Why did you bring food? You know the family's eating out for dinner tonight."" As if I'm too fat to have lunch and just wait until 7PM for our family dinner... 

It's getting to the point where I feel that one day I'll just blow up in her face and say things I don't mean. I tend to just laugh about it and not say anything, but really it's super hurtful. I know that what she says is coming from a place of concern and care, but how she goes about saying it can be very embarrassing and hurtful - especially during work and we have clients in the office. How do I make this stop? I've never been good at confrontation.",23Jan2020,1

I asked some specific questions about one of the fields he is studying but he didn’t really have answers. However he said I had good questions and should definitely look into it more and email him.

I did some research and found really interesting stuff, so I composed a 500-word email summarising a few papers. The problem is that I’m really afraid to offend him — i dont want it to sound like I’m lecturing him or something, just sharing information I found interesting.

I'm not really struggling at all and I don't see myself struggling in any future classes that I will take. It's not a problem of money or difficulty but more of mental capacity at this point I think.

638,"I typed this out 2 days ago, but I couldn't post it. Hopefully it posts now. I decided to leave it hoe I originally wrote it instead of going back to change anything.

This is possibly going to be very long and full of meticulous personal details of my mental health and childhood/recent abuse. If somehow you think you know me, please keep this to yourself. The last thing I need is all my friends and family knowing I'm saying all these things online to strangers instead of talking to them.

I'm also typing this on my phones notes, so if it looks bad my apologies.

(To preface, I am a 20 year old female diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety, and am working on getting a diagnosis for ptsd)

So I'm freaking out right now. I just recieved a letter in the mail from my community college financial aid that an ""Attendance Confirmation Form"" is being sent to all of my instructors for my fall semester classes. The reason being that I failed all of them. If they find that I failed because of not attending my classes, then I will have to pay in full the money financial aid covered at first. Midway through the semester I just stopped attending my classes because of some overwhelming matters. I know, this was a terrible idea and completely on me. I take full responsibility for that.

The semester became probably one of the most stressful semesters for me, because my bipolar disorder was quickly starting to control my life. I became extremely unpredictable and would have major mood swings. One day I'd be okay, the next I'd be in my car ready to drive off the nearest cliff. Suffice to say, things were not good.

Now I know the string of actions I'm about to mention are me being an immense idiot, but please hear me out. I'm incredibly desperate because I really don't know what to do. I've been crying nonstop because I know these actions are my fault but I kept going even when I knew I was ruining my life.

The campus I belonged to at the time is a very small campus. Everyone knows EVERYONE. It's a good and a bad thing.

Well, It was a bad thing from the beginning for me because when I started going to college before last semester I was in the same class as a very recent ex of mine. That wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't for the fact that this man was terrorizing my life. It got to the point where I wanted to get a restraining order, but things were so convoluted and messy that I ended up just spiraling into very bad anxiety issues. That man knew everything about me, and he knew exactly how to cause me to have a panic attack without even having to talk to me. That became a huge theme, and in turn I began to isolate myself from people. I had a best friend at the time who was incredibly supportive and helped me throughout those stressful times. When I have panic attacks, I tend to pass out briefly. I end up being fine in the end, but when it happens in public in front of hundreds of students multiple times in a short span of time, it becomes a source of humiliation. At that point, so many people knew I'd just ""randomly"" collapse, and it quickly made me feel uncomfortable in my own skin.

Not just that, but at the time too there was this guy that would randomly show up at the campus. I didn't know him at first, but he randomly started talking to me and hardcore flirting. I didn't really know how to feel, but I was charmed at first because I wasn't used to just randomly being flirted with like that. Well, he quickly became an issue. Because of my anxiety, I tend to be too afraid to speak up about things that genuinely bother me. Well, within the first hour of hanging around him between my classes he was being really touchy, putting me on his lap, and all around invading my personal space and privacy. I knew it was making me uncomfortable but I had convinced myself that it was okay because someone thought I was worthwhile enough to be flirted with. Well, the next day he found me out of nowhere and asked to hang with me. I said yes, because I didn't really have many friends at the time. Well, as soon as we got into the elevator he tried to kiss me. I told him to slow down and he apologized. Well, after the elevator he kept pressuring me into kissing him until I eventually gave in because I didn't know what else to do to get him to stop. He swiftly decided that it was okay to be sexual with me, and any chance he'd get when he saw me he'd touch my butt or my boobs and try to put me on his lap right on top of his erection. He kept trying to makeout with me in random places, and I'd just let him because I was too scared to deny him. He would make me feel bad whenever I told him I was getting weirded out by making out with him, and when I told him that I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue seeing him he would say things like ""I thought what we had was special"" and ""I've never had a friendship connection like with you before"" to guilt trip me. It got to the point where I thought he was sincere and kept putting myself in this position because I felt bad for him. Eventually my best friend at the time helped me figure out that I shouldn't be letting him treat me this way, so eveytime he was around I would act less comfortable and be a bit more forward. In the end, he stopped showing up so I was okay for a bit, but those memories haunted me for a while after.

When I started the fall semester, I still had those negative associations of humiliation and unwanted sexual encounters. At first it wasn't too bad and didn't affect me too much, because I had decided I wanted to make more friends and put myself out there more. Well, before the semester started, I had dated this other guy who also went to the college. I broke up with him in the middle of summer, but asked to be friends toward the end of the summer. I thought I'd be fine seeing him again when school started, but the first thing he did when he saw me was get incredibly close to me and almost acted as if we were still dating. He's a generally touchy person so I didn't say anything at first, but he did it more often to the point where he actually was treating me like we were dating again. I told him to stop over snapchat, and he did for a week or two. Fast forward, I decided one time to smoke (marijuana) and then come onto campus since I was starting to get really stressed out. Well, I was in the cafe with friends and we were all just chilling. Everyone at this point knows I'm high, and we all just treat it normal. He shows up and since I was high I was acting differently, joking around with him and such. My tolerance was still low at the time, so I just was careless and stupid. Well, he didn't realize I was high until he pulled a friend of ours to the side to ask if I was. As soon as he got confirmation, he moved all of his stuff to sit next to me, he then got really close to me and put his hands on my lower back and thigh, and was just making himself at home. No one really said anything, so I assume they thought we were maybe getting back together and thats why they didn't interfere. Well, later I was still high and he had to leave, so a guy friend of mine stayed with me until I was able to be on my own. Still high, I asked if he thought it was weird the way my ex was acting, and he just told me ""in my opinion, I don't think you should get back with him"" 

The day after, I didn't even know how to feel, I felt so uncomfortable and disappointed. It got to the point where I felt so helpless. He kept acting like that too, and it started to happen even when I was sober. The problem was that all the people I was friends with, he was better friends with, so I never felt comfortable confronting him about it. Well, eventually it got so bad that I just convinced myself I was still in love with him to cope with the discomfort. I started losing my sense of reality and having rapid cycles of mania and depression. Everytime I tried to eat, I'd feel nauseous. I couldn't eat properly for weeks. It got to the point where I looked like a crazy lady to everyone when I'd come to the college. 

I'm a very hyper and out there type of person despite my anxiety. I dress flashy and uniquely, to the point of me being considered ""slutty"" because I'd wear lots of ripped jeans, crop tops, fishnets, and just crazy weird outfits and stuff like that. If a person saw me, I'd stand out. That became an issue when I started having bipolar episodes, because I already stood out to people because of the way I dressed and acted, so I was this ticking time bomb of anxiety and impulsivity to everyone. People always saw me and everytime I'd be around they'd ask me how I was and I would talk about how I was stressed out. I started smoking weed constantly, to the point where I'd have full days of just being high just to be able to cope with existing. It was so much that it seemed like all I wanted to do was smoke. That definitely altered some peoples perception of me.

One day, a guy friend who I had a sort of flirty thing with was hanging with me and a couple of other people I was friends with in our school cafe. As I was talking, he took a creepshot of my cleavage and showed it to me. I laughed it off thinking he was gonna erase it or keep it to himself and that was that. I later get pulled to the side by another guy friend who tells me that he tried to show him the picture. I felt so embarrassed and upset. I called the guy out on his shit, but he basically got away with it. I was so immensely upset, because even when I asked him to his face why he took a picture of my cleavage he said it was a ""candid photo"" and when I asked why he showed it his response was just ""I thought it was funny."" A friend of mine confronted him and made him hand his phone over to make sure he didn't have the picture. He apparently erased it, but the anger I felt was so bad. I was literally crying my eyes out at my college because this guy really just got away with violating my privacy, someone I thought I was really becoming good friends with took advantage and just got away with it. For all I know he could have it saved somewhere else, or he could have sent it to others and then erase it from his phone. I was devastated. Soon I noticed he started hanging out with my ex a lot, and then I noticed that he was hanging out with some of my friends. It started getting to me. I felt like he was trying to get people to be against me. I just avoided him or ignored his presence most of the time, but god did it hurt to see people I thought cared about me prefer to be around someone who just blatantly pulls shit like this.

Soon, I became a chore to be around. One of my closest friends at the time stopped talking to me out of nowhere, and it felt like everytime I made a joke about me being a mess everyone would agree but in seriousness. It got to the point where my paranoia was going crazy. I started to believe everyone was against me and that I was the butt of one huge joke. I stopped going to my classes and just being near the college became a huge source of crippling anxiety. The college itself had literally become a trigger to my mania and anxiety. It got so bad that I eventually just stopped talking to everyone for almost 2 weeks and would try to limit coming to the college. The problem was that I couldn't come home because my parents were under the impression that I was still going to my classes. So I'd at times be forced to show up to the college. Not being able to do much, I'd hang out in the library for hours because I didn't have a job anymore or any money so I didn't want to waste gas (I live 30 minutes away from my college, but with traffic it could get up to an hour or more). I don't have the best relationship with my parents (They're sort of abusive, but not enough to get their kids taken away apparently) so at the time I just kept lying about going to classes and stuff. 

My life felt like it was spiraling out of control for the better part of 3 months. I knew I was failing my classes, my professors would email me and I'd just ignore them. The weight of knowing I was going to have go deal with the aftermath was making me feel fearful everyday. It literally became such a huge issue that I felt I was going crazy. I eventually tried to commit suicide because of how bad things were getting. Eventually, I had taken myself to a crisis center to talk to someone because I needed to get things off of my mind so bad. I never mentioned being suicidal to the crisis center therapist, so they didn't take me inpatient anywhere. I just complained about my stress and school and told him how I had stopped going. He gave me some advice but ultimately it didn't help much. 

Now, I lay here in my bed. I'm in a much more stable mood these past almost 2 months. The fall semester ended a while ago and now the next spring semester is starting soon. I decided college isn't for me based on my performance not just at this college, but because in general normal schooling had failed me completely. Even when I genuinely tried so hard all those years to pass my classes, nothing I ever did worked. Even when I had proper therapy, even when I had proper medication. I really just think something is wrong with me. I'm broke, I'm having trouble looking for a job, I'm still dealing with not just issues from the college, but issues with repressed memories of my childhood coming back and realizing the actual mental and physical abuse I was put through as a child. I have nightmares that have me waking up fearing for my life. I've only been avoiding my issues, not working on them. Thankfully, I really see them for what they are now instead of just thinking I'm crazy, but it's too late. The damage is already done and I already had just stopped going to school. I feel so stupid. I really let other people control my life. 

I don't even know what I'm asking for anymore, I don't even know where to start. I've tried so hard looking for a job but nothing seems to be working. I've tried finding side gigs to at least keep a semblance of an income since I knew I'd probably have to pay my college back. I feel like a freeloader, and I hate it. My last job I would have stayed at but it's a small family owned amusement park, so in the winter there's basically no hours. I ended up quitting though because the owner (very old man) and his son (maintenance guy who's in his late 40s) both made me wildly uncomfortable, and I couldn't handle it anymore so I just left. Now I feel like the biggest idiot for quitting the only job I've ever had.

Now that this letter has come in the mail, I don't know how to even continue. I'm afraid that I'm going to do something I'm going to regret, or that I'm just going to ignore it and things are going to get worse but I genuinely don't want to go back to that campus with everything that happened. I'm afraid to run into the people I know and be judged when I walk past. I just look like a lazy stoner who has issues to everyone. I feel like I tarnished my own reputation there and I'm never going to be viewed different. I just, I want to give up so bad but I know thats not what I really want to do. I keep crying trying to figure this out. It's so hard, I just want this to stop so bad. I'm too scared to even become close to people again because I feel like this is going to happen all over again. I'm afraid everyones going to think I'm crazy. People have already called me crazy and said things about me, I really don't know what to do anymore. Please, if you have any advice, even something little it'd really help. I feel so hopeless.",23Jan2020,1
639,"Throaway account. I would have posted to relationship advice but it won't allow me so I'll just ask here.

Now, before we even start. This has nothing to do with femminism, or the portrayal of women in society. Matter of fact, I am a bisexual guy, who dislikes hair even on men just the same. I like shaved people. 

 Most body hair doesn't really bother me (for instance, I'd rather touch a shaven leg but an hairy one doesn't really ruin anything), except for armpit hair: I really do not like armpit hair. I don't like to look at it, and looking at it is a huge turnoff. 

In a non sexual way, it doesn't disgust me: It's not some kind of irrational fear, its just that it's a huge turnoff when aroused.

Now, my girlfriend has a problem with it: She shaves, but we've had an argument where she told me that she doesn't like the fact that she is ""forced"" to, while I do ""nothing"" about it.

 I told her she is free not to shave, but that I'm free to not like it. She says she is feeling manipulated. I can see where she is coming from, but that's not what I'm trying to do: I just want to be honest, and not have to pretend to not have issues I do have.

She says that I should at least try to understand what turns me off so much about it, and to somehow work on it. I believe that there is no way to control what one likes, but I would still like to somehow give it a try. 

What am I supposed to do here?",23Jan2020,1
640,"As I’ve gotten older I’ve noticed more and more how insecure, and uncomfortable I am around males. I believe that my feelings around them has been influenced by the relationships I hold with the men in my life. 

For starters, I was shunned by my grandfather before I was even born because I’m biracial. I remember being young and wondering why I was the only one around me who didn’t have a relationship with their grandfather. 

I also grew up without my biological father, because he cheated on my mother with someone in a different country. My earliest memories include me asking why I was the only one in my pre-K who didn’t have a dad, and on Father’s Day, I would be the only kid doing alternative activities because I didn’t have a male figure to give the gift too. 

When I was around 7 my mother remarried my step dad, and he immediately took me under his wing. I was finally the daddy’s girl I always wanted to be, but he was a major alcoholic, and made multiple empty promises, yet he always made me feel welcomed, accepted, and loved. Up until then I had never gotten love from a male figure. My parents divorced when I was 14, it was a very quick divorce and required that my mom and I move back to the United States after being stationed in Germany. I never really got to say goodbye because we were about to miss our flight. I just had to suppress the emotions that leaving my dad brought up. 

October 22nd 2014 was the last time I saw him, and since then, we have only communicated on Facebook, and have talked on the phone maybe 2 times. I remember waiting to get phone calls on my birthday, and Christmas, or just a simple Facebook message, but I never did. On my 16th birthday I had a major breakdown that was triggered by my unideal living situation, and how much I missed him. I was looking forward to getting a happy birthday message from him, and my mother had to force him to call me and wish me a happy birthday. Since then, we haven’t communicated. Even seeing daughters out with their fathers bring tears to my eyes because he always promised we would be a family, and that nothing could bring us apart, and yet, we don’t talk, and every time I try and reach out I get left on read. 

Sometime last year my biological father messaged me on Instagram, and the quick conversation we had brought up everything I’ve been trying to suppress about my failed and terrible relationships with the men in my life. I often cry myself to sleep over them. And they have started to effect my dating life. I can’t t close to men, I can’t trust them, and I always feel like a burden when I’m in relationships. Yet nothing I have tried has made these feelings go away. I’ve tried talking it out, writing it out, and just pushing it down, but I still find myself longing for a relationship with my step father. 

Are there anyways I could move past this and start to live a health life that doesn’t include dragging around unattractive daddy issues?",23Jan2020,1
641,"(Backstory) \\/

So I'm a currently serving in the National Guard after 2 years of active duty for the U.S. Army. During that time I developed a pretty nasty smoking habit, and as soon as I moved home I tried to quit by switching to vaping. It's going very well and I haven't smoked a cigarette in two months since I got home. 

(Current) \\/

I recently enrolled in college (While still in the National Guard) and I'm in my third week of school. Ever since I first moved in I was vaping inside the room (Only once every 3 or 4 hours) IN FULL SIGHT of my roommate. He never mentioned anything to me regarding it and I assumed he had no issue with it. 

Just today I came back from taking a shower and my things were all over my bed and desk. I told him ""If you have any problems just let me know"", he said ""Yeah no problem, you're fine"" and let out a light chuckle. About 20 minutes later he said he was going to a meeting with his professor (Mind you, while he was leaving I had my vape in my mouth, and he said NOTHING), I said, "" not a problem, see you in a few"". 10 minutes later security came to my room and demanded that I stand outside and they proceeded to strip my entire half of the room looking for anything vaping related. They took my Juul, the pods for it, and an entire bottle of Nicotine Lozenges because apparently I, ""Was causing a severe allergic reaction for my roommate, causing him to come to us (Security)"", I was dumbfounded and told them that I have been using the products to quit smoking but because I'm only 20, in New York it's illegal for me to have them. They then said I have a meeting with the Dean of Student tonight at 9pm to discuss the problem and result in a possible punishment. 

Not five minutes after Security left my roommate came in and said, ""So. Are you gonna be good now?"" I looked at him and said ""Excuse me!?"" and he then went on a 20 minute rant about how I ""Mislead"" him and ""Tricked"" him into letting me move in by not mentioning I vape. I said ""Why the hell weren't you a mature man about this and just tell me you had a problem with it? I would've taken in outside or just quit. But instead you went to Security and got me in trouble with the Dean about this BS."" He then said (In shortened terms) that this was all my fault and I deserve whatever punishment the Dean gives me. 

Lord tell me I'm not wrong in all of this.

Thanks for reading, I'll take any advice on what the hell to do next. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I can't move out because in the school ""Rules"" if you are at fault and are suspected of repeating the offense (Unless it is a violent offense) you can't move without your roommates ""Approval"" (If that shit makes sense to any of you please tell me, because I'm only three weeks in here and I want fight him.)",23Jan2020,1
642,"Long story, short. Last Sunday, I lost my virginity to a masseuse. I am a 25 year old Canadian male. Up until that point, I had been a virgin, never been intimate in any way whatsoever with a female, and had never known what sex feels like. I wanted so badly to know what it was like. I had only been masturbating to porn almost every day up until that point. Started masturbating maybe when I was 16 or 17.

After debating the idea for 5 months and trying to avoid massage parlour/escort websites and averting my thoughts about them whenever they occurred, I succumbed in my long-fought battle :""(, finally gathered up the courage to go, and lost my virginity to a masseuse last sunday. I went back on monday and had sex again with another masseuse. In both sessions, both blowjob and sex were done with a condom.

I feel so ashamed and guilty to have done what I have done. I have no-one to reach out to in regards to this :( I cannot focus because that thought keeps recurring and haunting me. I feel like i shouldn't have done it. Yet, I was fighting very strong urges. 

What is your advice to me, and what can I do to prevent the temptation to visit a masseuse again should my urges haunt me again? I feel like I should never do this again.

650,"As most people do, I have many things I could use advice on, but this is one of the less serious and personal matters. So I am a very closeted bisexual male, 19, and I live in the southeast US. I do not ""look like it"" on the outside, and I rarely ""act like it"", so no one would ever guess unless I told them. (I put quotations around those two phrases because I do not believe in certain kinds of people acting a certain way, but I know many people where I live do believe that) Down here people are very slowly starting to become more tolerant of the seemingly increasing group of lgbtq+ people ""coming out"", but of course, it is not perfect. I will get to my point now.

I like to wear tighter clothing. It is more comfortable for me. My family knows this too and (thankfully) do not suspect anything. A few times one of my friends has let me borrow some of her clothing to wear (only once for drag haha), so I already know that I find women's/girl's clothing comfortable. Sometimes I will go into shops and see cute pairs of jeans or leggings in the female section, but I do not know what fits and what does not, so I can not just buy them without risking them not fitting. (Also I don't understand women's sizes yet haha) I know most people would just suggest I try them on in fitting rooms, but I have had issues which ruin my confidence of asking the cute college girls and guys to let me try the clothes on. Most stores here require an employee to unlock the fitting rooms. Of course I have had employees give me weird looks when I ask and tell me 'sorry, not happening', but usually they are pretty nice and understand what I am trying to do when I walk over to the women's/girls' section alone. However the biggest issue has been the Karens that try calling mall security on me for being a pervert/pedophile, or other things of that nature.

I would rather not have more karens or male-karens(?) insulting me because I am searching through clothing like anyone else would, but I know it is unavoidable sometimes. But I still can not gather the confidence to ask store employees or anything like that, and buying online to try on and send back is just too expensive and tedious to do. So after reading my post, does anyone have advice for me?

654,"Hey people.
I would really appreciate some advice from you guys.
So I have this one friend that I always have to hit up so we do stuff together.
He was depressed and had no job 5 years prior before me and my friends met him.
He's 25 and lives with his parents (no that that's really bad or anything just want to paint the picture)
It happened a lot of times now that we had plans to do something and even made up the time and stuff. And 10 minutes before meeting he would send a text that he's not feeling that good an he couldn't make it ,and it happened so often now that Im starting to think that's just his go to excuse if he just wants to stay home and stuff.(I'm also not the best with timing but at least I actually meet my friends even if I'm sometimes late) 
I don't understand him at all. 
Cause he often Tells us he's so happy that he finally found some good friends. 
He had no friends for 5 year.. Or no good friends at that. 
And then HE JUST DOESN'T HIT ME UP. 
From all my friends me and him met the most and did the most stuff together. 
And in my opinion if I'm the only one that ever hits him up and he doesn't do it.. Why should I always hit him up. 
I would really appreciate your advice guys.
As for now the last thing what we did together was a grilling party 2 weeks ago that my best friend kinda organised for him because he never did that before(he also pulled that I'm not feeling good bullshit excuse) and was an hour late and he ate 2 sausages.. Keep in mind my friend organized it for him..
So I really don't know what to do we tried talking to him so many times.
And I had so many conversations with him about him just hitting me up from his own.
But I dunno.. Am I overreacting
What's your guys thoughts
Lemme know

655,"I considered this person my best friend. let's call her S. I normally didn't have anyone, but I had her. we talked about things that only we understood. however, it was extremely toxic. we both struggle with severe mental issues, so we used each other as a therapist when we needed help. I would go to her with what I felt were small issues/common advice. things I knew wouldn't be a trigger for her. I never brought up anything big like our intense mental things, cause I knew asking a disordered person for help on disordered problems would be pointless.  but S she would always come to me with issues that I had no true solution to. I was happy to be there and be trusted and I wanted nothing more than to listen and help the best way I could so that I didn't lose her (as she has ditched people in the past for similar things) but what could I do besides that? the thing was if you gave S advice that she didn't like, you were an asshole. S needed help\* I could not provide to her no matter how much I wanted to. idk if that's what pushed her away but. I felt like it was all one-sided (i say this as someone on one side. chances are I was just the same with her, we were both toxic). she would pound on feelings and thoughts that I understood but only from a 'me' point of view. so I would just tell her what I have told myself. but that was never good enough for. and it was always up to me to find the solution. and because of that, every day was stressful and I felt like I was crumbling under the pressure of my problems and hers.   
disappearing isn't new for her, she does often. she ghosted me when I couldn't get her any weed in early 2018. after 4 months of not talking she came back and apologized for it. I will always accept her apologies cause I understood that things were not easy for her. it felt like I was finally getting my friend back and like we were growing a deeper bond. but then she ghosted at the end of 2018 summer. I understood this cause that time of year was really hard on her. she came back early Feb 2019, for a week. then I never heard from her again. It's coming up a year now.   
friends drift apart yes but this was so sudden. her family was the root of a lot of her issues so I never met them, nor have I ever been to her house.  I still text her with the hope that she'll suddenly reply. cause that's what I always do. that's what always happens. I want her to know I'm still thinking about her and that I'm still here for her. i**s that bad?** but the thing is I feel like there is truly nothing I can do. I have the phone number she won't answer, social media accounts that she seems to have also ghosted, and no family to do a wellness check with. I know she doesn't owe me anything maybe she ghosted to change her life or felt like I was toxic for her. if that is the case I completely understand. my heart aches every day though cause I miss her. if the case is she is done with me that is fine, but I at least want to know she is alive and well. my true dream is to know what happened.

I wrote this all out cause I've never seen our friendship put in order and I wanted to get it off my chest. obviously there are things missing (mostly side things not relevant) if I could write out the entire telling of our friendship I totally would but would have a novel. I've had friendships end, but more gradually. **Is this just how real life is though?** This person is a big part of why I am the way I am today.

Today she told me she even wants to dish out hundreds of dollars for professional photographs just for Instagram. I don't know why but this really bothers me. If I could guess, I'd assume maybe I'm bothered because she has just become so self absorbed and it's like she's stopped caring about me as much. I'm the complete opposite of self-absorbed.

If the restructuring of the engineering department isn't complete in the 2 months, what do you think is her best option? Going to the more hands on role or waiting longer for the restructuring and potentially missing out.

The difference in salary is estimated to be about 10 grand.

669,"I (22m) work with a ton of awesome people who are all around my age and a pleasure to be around. We hang out outside of work often and I consider them some of my close friends. Because we’ve all (around 20 in the group)  grown to be extremely close, lots of people regularly hug, tap, touch, grab a shoulder etc in super normal and friendly ways. There is nothing that falls outside of normal friendly interactions in the slightest. 

That being said, I’m in the initial phases of dealing with my sexual assault experience and get uncomfortable with having people in my personal space without warning. I’m an outgoing guy and love being a part of the group, but don’t know how to communicate that I don’t like being touched without coming across as aggressive or rude. When I expect a hug or something like that, I am fine and happy to participate, it’s when it comes out of no where that I get really jumpy and uncomfortable. 

I’ve said side comments asking people to not, but nothing really happens and it’s almost brushed aside as a joke that I’m just a jumpy person. I’m not really the type to send some mass email with a big announcement or anything - making it a spectacle or event would make me more comfortable. 


I don’t want them to feel like they did nothing wrong, it’s just getting to a point where it’s extremely distracting. I don’t think I feel comfortable opening up about my sexual assault with the group as I’ve only told some family and a few very close friends.

672,"Okay, first some background, I am an 8th grader (I know, i'm young as hell) in middle school, and last year I was in 7th grade, and one of the girls in 8th grade (now 9th grade, whom we'd call Elena) had a sister in 6th grade (now 7th grade, whom we'd call Marie) whom I never knew she had (because she was in grade school while I was in middle school)  Elena has a bad reputation in school for being foul mouthed, cussing really sexually explicit words for 14 year olds, and this year, Elena became a 9th grader and her sister whom we should call Marie came to our school since she became a 7th grader, I didn't really notice that they were sisters until I saw them speaking together and realized ""They're sisters? would've never guessed, but they do really look alike"" (Marie's prettier though) Anyways, we have two school terms instead of three, in the beginning of the first term I never really saw Marie, but I did see her when we have a praying break (schools in Saudi Arabia have praying breaks) since I go downstairs next to the 7th grade classes to pray, the reason I didn't really see her was because 8th and 9th graders would have their lunch breaks upstairs inside the actual school, meanwhile 7th graders would eat in the school's backyard which was small, for the first half of the term this was the schedule until one day our principal decide to make us eat in the backyard, from that moment on we'd eat in the backyard with all the other grades, now to the actual story!!

&amp;#x200B;

One day I was trying to go down the stairs because I wanted to go down to pray but it was a bit crowded so I was standing on the corner of the stairs waiting for people to go up so I can go down, when Marie came up the stairs, stood next to me and said ""Pretty, may I know your name?"" I told her my name and she left, literally never thought about it again.

&amp;#x200B;

then like a day or 2 days later, during lunch break I was standing on the wall zoning out, then I stopped and my eyes went down on a friend group, Marie's friend group! she was smirking and staring at me while whispering something to a girl in the squad, 2 girls of the squad were staring at me as well as the girl she was whispering to, the 2 others didn't, I stared back at Marie and she knew that I was and she stared back but she continued staring for like 4 seconds then she looked down at her friend's cheek and continued whispering, then 5 seconds later the girls turned around and started laughing at me, I didn't think much of it, I just left and hung out with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

then a day or 2 later, during lunch break, She and her friend group were doing the ""secret telling squad hug"" they hug, and whisper something to eachother, I saw it but I was eating my chips and looked down at the floor and like 15 seconds later I look up, surprise surprise! Marie was staring at me, she was right in front of  my face but not that close to the point that it looks like she can enter right through me, like a bit further but still VERY close (while doing the hug tell thing), When I first lifted my head I was like ""Oh my god!"" because I was shocked of a face being right in front of me lol.

&amp;#x200B;

then the same day or a day later, probably the same day, I was sitting on the stairs with my friends listening to what they have to say, then I suddenly turned my head, and she was staring at me, I looked right back at my friends because it was like the 4th time I caught her staring at me, and I am not really the ""stare back then give stink eye"" type of gal so I brushed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

after that I Haven't caught her staring and that was like a month and a half ago.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT like a week later, I was passing by her when I heard her say ""I swear i'll get her number!"" as I passed by her friends said ""There she is! there she is!"" don't know if it's me or not though.

&amp;#x200B;

then the last thing so far, Yesterday we had a Quran period (I live in Saudi Arabia, so every school has Quran) and the class didn't bring their Qurans so the teachers sent me to get some, I went to Marie's class, knocked the door and asked the teacher if I could have a Quran, surprise surprise! after half a second after I asked she QUICKLY turned to her bag and rummaged for the Quran, didn't find it when sitting, stood up, searched for it, found it, walked to me, gave it to me, I said ""Thank you!"" and smiled at her she said ""You're Welcome"" and smiled back, not to mention she was the ONLY in the class that gave me. I was thinking that she  would give me a Quran when I first entered I wanted to stare at her, but I tried not to make it seem like I was, first thing as I walked in, I had a few Qurans in my hand but they weren't enough, so I don't know if when she saw them in my hand then immediately got one out of her bag or when I asked, it was last period, so I needed to return the Qurans 5 minutes earlier before school's over, when I went down to return it to all the girls that gave me, I went into her class and her friends told me that she left with the  school bus (since girls in the school bus get out of school 15 minutes earlier) so I kept her Quran with me and planned to return it the next day (today) After all the grades got into their classes, before first period started in like 2 minutes, I grabbed her Quran went into her class, gave her it, said thank you to her, replied shyly ""You're welcome"" with a slight smile.

&amp;#x200B;

And now things to note: 

1. Her stares are NOT hate filled, she looks at me deeply, like how'd you would stare at someone you find really pretty
2. She looks really nice, so if you tell me to tell her to quit it, I won't because she seems nice.
3. I told my friend about this, and we planned that she'd go to the class (the same day I asked, Wednesday) and ask for a Quran and see if she gives her, and then she'll return it the next period, if she doesn't, I will ask a few periods later and see what she does.
4. I told my other friend and she said that she'll ask her if she knows anything about me, since they talk from time to time but not friends, more of acquaintances, then we'll see what she does and analyze her actions, and determine what she wants from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need you guys to tell me what you think she thinks/wants of me, I told my 2 friends they said that she wants to befriend me or finds me really pretty, what do you guys think though? do you think she was badmouthing me when she told her friends something and they laughed? Please upvote this so more people will see and please write a detailed answer, the longer the better as well, thank you lovely people!

He's very defensive over his stream, he's repeatedly lied to us about his relationship between him and his community, he tells us its just for money, they are just strangers, but adds them to his FB page, which is very odd given how paranoid the dude is about being doxxed.  


It seems to be quite the dichotomy between how he treats me privately and publically, especially when he has often talked about how good friends we are IRL on his stream and has repeatedly used my real name live on stream (while being paranoid about his own identity).   


He would often be very blunt/caustic when it came to my own mental health issues, but during his stream, he's always talking about supporting mental health and being mental health positive with his community.   


We got into an argument this Christmas, he took something I had said to be about him, which was a total misunderstanding.  Then he told me he had stopped taking his meds but refused to tell me why. Then I didn't hear from him for a few days.  


It looks like he's deleted me from FB, whatsapp and all social media.

678,"Life is mostly a zero sum game. Every loss is another's gain and every gain is another's  loss. The world is finite so there will always be winners and losers. Consider how in business one idea can potentially kill an industry and put people out of work.

The thing is that I find that I am painfully aware of this and I don't feel comfortable knowing that for me to succeed in life others will have to lose. How do you accept this fact?

E.g If I start a local business and I gain customers then I've diluted the market for everyone that already competes in the industry. For every customer I get the other businesses in my area have lost out. The same applies to other areas of life that have a competitive element.

How do I become more ruthlessly competitive in life? How do I fully accept that my gain is most likely someone else's loss?",23Jan2020,1
679,"Please, this is urgent. I'm talking to my best friend right now and our conversation is breaking my heart, please. 

My best friend, who I trust and love with all my heart, wants to commit suicide.

His parents adopted him and they've been fucking his mind and breaking his spirit constantly.
Here are some examples:
1)They've been verry strict with him all his life.
2)They always tell him that he's worthless and that they never should have adopted him.
3)They have 4 other biological kids, and his mom told him that her own kids didn't do what he is doing, implying that he's not her son.
4)And the worst part. They took a girl named Anca into foster care and they left her. His mom told him ""I can get rid of you as easily as I got rid of Anca"".


His girlfriend is my other best friend, his mom doesn't agree with their relationship becuase she blames everything that my bff does on her. This night, he talked to his mom, and she told him everything. He came to my apartment all broken and shaking, I immediately got panicked as I saw him and as he told me he wants to kill himself.
He told his mom multiple times that he wants to kill himself. She would always tell him ""So do it"" or that she doesn't care.
This night she told him that if he doesn't get rid of his girlfriend, his parents will go to his girlfriend's hometown and ruin her reputation by telling everyone that she is a slut and things like that.
His dad told him that he's useless, worthless, that he never should have adopted him, that he never loved him and that he was never his son. He gave him a strict schedule. Get out of school and study non-stop until 12 AM with 1 hour breaks between the hours. I honestly couldn't live with such people. He suffered them for 11 years. If they were my parents, I'd have run away long ago.
Before coming to my place, he texted me to ask about a quick and painless way that someone can die. I knew his girlfriend was over, so I told him that someone can light a candle, put chloroform on a plate on top of it, and fall asleep as the person is sleeping. He came to my apartment and told me he wasn't joking. As we were laying down, I looked at his phone and he was reading a Wikipedia article about chloroform.
I told him that if he kills himself, I will kill myself because I couldn't be able to live with myself knowing that I had a part in my best friend's suicide. I told him that his girlfriend will kill herself too becuase she won't have him. She does love him a lot and so does he. I never wanted to get to emotional blackmail, but I thought it was necessary.
His parents are extremely close minded and won't listen to anyone, so I don't think I can talk to them.
What the fuck do I do? What do I tell him? I don't want him to kill himself. Please help me asap!",23Jan2020,1

693,"Hello, there.

I’m located in Idaho.

 The last twenty-four hours have been kinda hellish. I signed a lease about a year and a half ago for a wonderful apartment in the best location. The housing market in ID is kinda bonkers, especially in larger cities, so for a private landlord to take me on with no formal references outside of student housing and no credit check was nothing short of a miracle. I had been living in my car, leaving my household items in a friends' garage for two months until I found a place.

 Recently, a really massive happening at my secondary job, where I worked as an independent contractor, revealed that the staff had let some really unconscionable HR oversights happen. I spoke out against it in an email, and that email was sent to one of the perpetrators… Who happened to be my boyfriend’s roommate. My boyfriend was asked to leave, and out of shame, I agreed to let him stake out at my house for a couple weeks until we could find him a new place. He wasn’t moving in - Just leaving his things at my home, and primarily sleeping at his parents’ house in another town over until we could figure things out, and maybe move in together at another location. I wasn’t let go from my contracting job, but they didn’t sign me on to the next project - Something I’ve been pretty depressed about, because I fear that my working relationship over there is done after advocating against the mishandling of harassment.

 His things are at my house. And, to be honest, with him feeling displaced, and me feeling displaced, the place turned into a bit of a dump. Nothing unsanitary. Just… Things, because it’s a studio with no storage capacity, and we're really busy people, and sometimes tidying falls by the wayside.  
Now, here’s where things get… Questionable.  
  My landlord shows up two days ago asking where a rent check is. I certainly sent in the check on time. We’re still wondering what has happened - Though, she has tenants leave outgoing mail on the window in our unlocked foyer. I’ve had a package stolen, and a bike. And, admittedly, I had seen a week ago that there was a large sum of money in my bank account that had gone untouched - I assumed they hadn’t cashed the rent check yet. I should have reached out.  
  I’m not home, but my boyfriend is - He had a longer lunch break, and lives nearby, so he came over to play some video games. He answers the door. I can understand why this may have been a shock to her - A strange boy, the house is in a less-than desirable state (nothing more than clothes on the floor, some paperwork strewn about the desk, unmade bed, and -most shockingly- some unsightly trashbagged piles of clothes I had gone through on the weekend with the intent to take to the thrift store, alongside a mid-project vanity declutter. On a scale from 1-10, 10 being a frat house on its worst day, it was a four. \[The bathroom may have been a five with my makeup, body products, towels, and trashbags\].)

 She pushes past him into the apartment, and immediately starts accusing *me* of doing drugs. Pointing to the clutter, saying things like “This is what drugs do to people.” “Yep, that’s drugs.” “Boys like you come into these girls lives and ruin them for good.” “She’s stopped paying rent, she’s gone off the deep end.”  
  And my sweet, Eagle Scout, former-LDS, aspergers boyfriend does not know how to deal with this. I don’t think he or I could get drugs if we *tried*. It took him 20 years to try caffeine.  
  So, he calls me. I come home, and immediately call my landlord, apologizing for the state of the place, apologizing for having my BF over - explaining the situation that led him to homelessness, and my guilt over it, explaining my depression over it. I also elaborated that the only recreational drug I take is Tums. She goes on a *tangent* about how drugs will ruin my life. I’m… Concerned, and try my best to sedate this argument - I offer to take any test, and guarantee that it’ll come back clean. 

 She tells me to get her the money, and we’ll go from there. I take my lunch break and tornado the house until it is clean as a whistle. I inform her of this, and tell her I’ve left the check in my mailbox for her to pick up, and that I’ll follow her lead on what steps she’d like to take to communicate about everything that has happened. I'm very afraid she thinks I've allowed my boyfriend to move in - She has reason to believe so. His stuff is there, and he spends the night once or twice a week, but he's finding the same struggle house-hunting as I did when I came across this place.  
  I’ve paid her the money, with a $75 late fee for good faith, but haven’t heard back. I’m a bit nervous. I feel like I’m going to lose my home, and have no rental references to gain me a new place. I’m so scared and sick to my stomach. I’ve been a kick-ass tennant until the last month, and I love my home, but I don’t know if I can live with this kind of anxiety. I also have no means to find a new place on my own. 

 If my boyfriend and I look for a place together, he’s always lived in friends’ places, and his last roommate who kicked him out owned the condo. I’ve lived in student housing, and this place. We pay rent, we volunteer, he’s got a full-time job, and I get a *massive* housing and living stipend with my scholarships, because I’m a fantastic student, alongside a handful of stipend-based, gig-based, and fill-in work, I make more than he does. But it doesn’t look stable on paper, and I have no idea how to advocate for my lifestyle. I’m very comfortable. We both pay for *everything* in cash, we’ve never been in a position where we would need to borrow money, because we work our asses off in ways that aren’t necessarily traditional.  
Advice, please? What are my options? How can I placate my landlord? Alternatively, how would I begin the process of househunting with my partner with the cards stacked against us?  Or just… Comfort?",23Jan2020,1

697,"Several years ago a close friend of mine (F-early 20s) began dating a man a few years older. 
This was her first serious relationship, and though she is beautiful and smart, she has always expressed insecurities about her looks and intellect. 
Early in the relationship, our friends learned her new guy was recently out of jail for fraud and drug charges. His charges and record were visible online. When we broached this subject with her out of concern, she was immediately defensive and wrapped up with the romantic notion that he had changed his life to become the right man for her- citing his sobriety and hard work at their job. 
In the several years since, she has become more distant from friends, she is also isolated from her family who moved away from their home town.  It has become awkward to spend time with her as the bf is difficult to get along with, and they rarely spend time apart. 
The couple now live together and several problems have arisen.. 
1) He doesn’t have a license to drive. He had previous financial barriers, outstanding fines to pay etc, but has paid them, and should theoretically be able to attain his license legally- but just hasn’t.. yet he still drives her car around illegally.

2) He does not work, and depends on our friend, who is currently working a menial job to make rent and all expenses. He has had countless jobs that he quickly quits because he hated it”, “they ran out of work”, “they didn’t pay me on time”... we suspect he keeps getting fired.

3) A third party revealed the BF is using meth, which the gf quickly denied.. all signs point to yes.. he is abusing drugs, and possibly getting back into fraudulent activity to get his fix.. 

It’s clear my friend is being used, but she “loves him” and is defensive of any critique of their relationship. I’ve stopped saying anything negative about her bf in fear that she will cut me off and be completely isolated- she’s already alienated herself from several other friends. I think her insecurity is so deep that she feels she doesn’t deserve better.

I’m at a loss for what to do here. I’ve once been in contact with her siblings, who initially had no clue what was going on, now have a surface understanding of the situation, but feel limited to intervene because of their distance and other responsibilities. 
I’m really afraid that my friend will lose trust in me if I do anything on her behalf that’s “behind her back”, but I know she won’t be receptive to intervention either. 
I’m really afraid she will end up involved in some kind of legal trouble if she stays with him, or will get pregnant or engaged and be tied to him forever. 
Open to any suggestions for how to handle this situation. Thank you.",23Jan2020,1
698,"We had a really nice relationship for almost 3months now, we really love each other and just everything felt perfect. But we got into a couple of fights in the last couple of weeks and now everything is falling apart. I travel alot so we only meet up when I'm back.  

So today i was coming back home and we were fighting over a chat and it was awful, because I was tired and I wasnt thinking rationally and was thibking only about myself. So it ended up that she wanted us to meet ul when I come back (Ill stay home only for 4days) and I said I dont think I can make it and told her to just say what she wants over the chat and she said that she'd been crying for the whole day, spoke to her friends and her mom and decided that we are not meant for each other, that we are too different and that she doesnt feel happy being with me anymore.

I know absolutely everything that I did wrong and I'm madly inlove with her, but I know that this might be it. That this time my mistakes wouldnt be forgiven for. Its killing me. We are going to meet up tomorrow and figure things out fully.

703,"I haven't been able to sleep for the past 3 days since I moved back into my apartment after winter break, and I've mainly been trying to avoid it. The reason being what I presume to be a homeless(?) man (at least it sounds a lot like a man) screaming outside my apartment each night at around 2 am and not stopping until the morning or early afternoon. He doesn't say anything when he screams, mainly it's just him moaning like he's in pain every thirty seconds, or sometimes it's incoherent words. I have no idea where he's located, but the screaming is loud enough to tell me that he is definitely nearby, and I don't know what he looks like.

This is the first time something like this has happened in the 4 months I've been renting the apartment. Up until this point it has been fairly quiet - I do live in a city but ""quiet"" being as quiet as it can get with the constant noise of traffic in the background, which I don't mind. But the sound of him has been so distracting and obnoxious lately that it's affecting my everyday routines. Not only can I not sleep (I tried ear plugs but it didn't help all that much), but I can't do anything but blast white noise in my ears during the day to mask the sounds of his screams.

Within the past 24 hours I've talked to the police 3 times. Not only is this man committing a crime in my state by disturbing the peace (also known as breach of peace), but I'm fearing for my own safety every time I leave the building. If he's hanging out around there and is either on drugs or has psychological issues, he not only is a danger to himself but to others. I have no idea what he's capable of. I also emailed my landlord before I called to explain the situation and he told me to call.

So, at first I called the non-emergency line in my city, but they redirected me to 911 because they said those would be the best people to handle the situation. The first time I called was yesterday at 9 am, and the dispatcher told me they would be sending a car out in the middle of the night to investigate. However the screaming persisted more than it did on the first day, so I called again at around 5 pm telling them to come sooner. The dispatcher told me they would come sooner. I woke at around 6 am this morning (much later than the first two days, maybe because of the ear plugs) to the sound of his screaming again, and called the police a third time. It is now much later in the afternoon as I'm writing this post and he is still screaming outside.

At this point I have no idea what to do. I can try and get my roommate to call, and maybe my landlord too if the police don't listen to the two of us. I feel like they are not taking this issue seriously and probably have not sent anyone out. What am I supposed to do for the next few months if this doesn't stop? Continue avoiding my apartment so I can get some peace and quiet and make myself go deaf by listening to white noise at full volume? Is it appropriate to continue calling the police in this situation until they do something?

Some people may think this is overreacting but how would you feel if a random person decided to keep you up all night by screaming nonsense outside your window. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?",23Jan2020,1

709,"Before I get to my post, I'm a 20 year old male university student, if that matters. I've also posted this on another subreddit, but I wanted to see if I can get answers on here. 

I've had a long history of social anxiety and shyness. I grew up very reserved and it was always very difficult for me to make friends, let alone approach someone and start a conversation. I quickly grew to resent myself for my inability to communicate with other people and the loneliness pulled me into depression. I would always cry myself to sleep and I'd wonder why I was like this. My self-esteem hit rock bottom for a long time and I honestly felt like I had no other purpose besides school, so I just put all my energy into it. And instead of having healthy social interactions, I was always just reading books in a corner (I'm not saying reading is bad, but I believe that I probably could've been making  friends instead of reading so much). I've gone through most of my life without friends, mostly because people didn't seem to like me very much due to being extremely shy. I had a best friend in high school, but we had a falling out a few months ago and I haven't spoken to him since. He's one of the best guys I've known and I regret what happened. Now I'm in university and I have no friends. I have no one to talk to. And it's killing me on the inside. I feel extremely lonely all the time and I wish I had the ability to make friends. I don't understand why it's so difficult for me to talk to people. It's so scary. Honestly, I'm on the verge of tears just typing this due to all the pain my shyness has caused me. I've gotten better over the years in terms of opening up and stepping out of my comfort zone, and I'm extremely lucky to have my long distance girlfriend. But I'm still struggling with these feelings of loneliness since I have no friends currently. I would appreciate any advice on how to cope and deal with this, guys.

But we’re also the kind of friends who sorta make out??? Fuck buddies ig except we haven’t had sex yet. 

But I’ve kind of started to think he doesn’t actually like me as a friend and just wants someone to screw him? Like he’s nice but I’ve had a few people (who don’t know him) tell me he’s trying to play me so I’ll be softened up enough so he can fuck me without me being suspicious about his intentions and then he’ll ditch me and never speak to me once he finds a gf. Which, yeah if he gets a gf I’d stop making out with him but I wouldn’t stop hanging out with him! I really enjoy his company and think he’s a good person. But my friends have started to put seeds of doubt in my mind so everything he does seems sus. He hugs me when I’m sad, just a tactic. He holds my hand when we’re walking, another way to soften me up. He tells me he cares about my wellbeing? No he doesn’t he just wants sex. I want to be his friend but I keep thinking super negative things about him. He seems embarrassed to let other people know we hang out. Like when we walk he makes it a point to avoid our work because “they’ll make fun of us”. To which I said “why? We’re just friends why would they make fun of us?” To which he said “yeah.... just friends....” in a weird way that made me think, what if he just wants me to fuck him? I thought that with him right next to me and I got uncomfortable. I don’t wanna think that way of him but what if my paranoid brain is right? He’s a great guy who I really enjoy talking to but I need to stop thinking like this. I can’t ask him, I don’t want to offend him. I’ve been through that whole “yeah we’re bffs just let me screw you then imma ditch you and never speak to you again” thing I don’t want to go through it again.

711,"So I went to a party last night where they decided it would be a great idea to dye my hair electric blue. Since I hadn’t really thought about the consequences, I said sure. While it didn’t exactly turn out electric blue, it’s still very clear that it has been dyed.

Now my problem is that my mother is extremely strict with certain things. She tries to control a lot of aspects in my life. I can clearly remember her ranting about an extended family member who dyes his hair black. If she thinks that’s extreme, I don’t know what she’ll think about mine. Thankfully, I managed to get home and into bed before my mother saw me.

I’m not going to be able to avoid her this morning so I need some advice on what to say if she gets angry with me. Any thoughts?",23Jan2020,1
712,Ok so a bit of back story my dad is white and from Canada and my mom is Japanese and from Japan they met in Japan when my dad was a English teacher there. So my sister and I are Japanese. We moved to Canada when I was 7 and my sister was 9. My sister and I barely spoke any English so we basically had my dad teach us basic English for 3 months before we started school and even when we went to school it was really rough. Now both my sister and I are in high school we are completely fluent in English and everything but our father still comes up to us in school and ask us if we are ok and is basically helicopter parenting us when he doesnt have a class. We have tierd to explain to him that we are fine. Hell we even did a fucking English eassy about our English skills to prove to him that we are fine now and we have everything under control.

727,"Just know I'm on mobile so bad formatting and whatnot.

Recently I had an argument with one of, if not, my closest friend ever in my life. I'm quite new to this sub so I know this topic is probably really light hearted compared to most of the stuff I've seen on here. Anyway, I had an argument with my friend over text. I don't want to get into details about what our argument was but you should just know that I was right. I know that sounds super cocky but I showed the texts to some of my other friends and they all said I was right in this situation.

During our argument I was being extremely petty to him in return to all the arguments we've had in the course of our friendship where he always acts like an ass. Every time we've ever had an argument I'm usually right but I end up apologizing to him despite the fact he's always stubborn and refuses to admit he's wrong. I'm trying not to sound cocky but trust me, if you read all our arguments you'd see that I'm right. To recap, everytime we've EVER had an argument, he's always extremely petty, stubborn, and refuses to admit to his mistakes. He also never apologizes first, which is a crunchy bonus.

In our most recent argument, we were just chatting normally then he decided to make an argument about the smallest shit ever, so I decided to be a petty ass and ended the argument with a spicy zinger and a block to him. After showing some of my closest friends our argument to see what people think, they all had the same comment: I can't believe yall would argue about something as little and as childish as that. While I do agree it was childish, I just wanted to be the petty guy for once. He always makes arguments, usually out of nothing major, and he always just sits there and waits for me to apologize for my mistakes, then he decides to apologize for his mistakes.

I know you're probably thinking at this point, ""that's a shitty friend, get rid of him"" and while I really wanted to, I realised that if I did, I'd be letting one of the biggest chapters of my life go just like that. He's been my closest friend for many years and I have so many nice memories with him, and I really don't want to just drop him like that even though I kind of feel that it's right. He's one of the nicest people I know, and practically everyone likes him. He's told me things that no other living person on this planet knows and I can't just let that go. His shitty side that comes out in arguments is probably his only negative personality trait, other than that he's really nice and I just don't know, man.

Just to clarify one thing you probably thought of while reading this. Yes, I'm extremely repetitive in my writing but that's because I didn't outline my text and what I wanted to right. I need any advice I can get about my little mental dilemma. I really don't know what to do and any advice would be appreciated. However, if this blows up (I know it won't but whatever) I probably won't reply to most messages as I am a busy student and exam week is about to begin.

Thank you in advance to anyone who might give me any advice, I love you all.",23Jan2020,1
728,"I’ve been to a therapist for 4 months now. At first she seemed very professional and experienced, very compassionate and I was happy I’d found someone who would approach CBT techniques. 

However, I feel that my therapist still treat me as a kid who has no real problems. I’m 20 and I know that I can’t be really treated exactly like a full-grown adult, but some things which happen during therapy make me believe I look just like a 11 year old teenager. 

She seems to only pay attention to one trauma in my life, my dad’s death when I was 9 and that’s all. I’ve tried to talk about my overthinking, my anxiety during exams, my social anxiety, my poor self esteem etc. but these topics are superficially approached once in a while and then we go back to my “I suffered a lot for my dad” and “my mom didn’t know how to react” venting. 

Moreover, she has recently asked me to do a CBT homework - I have to imagine I’m a little kid and I have to write a letter to my mom. What I would tell her at that time. 

Yeah, I can figure out the purpose of this exercise, but I don’t really see a point in writing imaginary letters. I can’t imagine myself creating an emotional and touching note and I just feel awkward about this idea.

729,"So my girlfriend was kicked out of her moms house and has been staying with her aunt who is getting evicted tomorrow. She will not have a place to stay unless we get an apartment together.

In preparation we toured apartments last week and found a great 2 bedroom for the price of a 1 bedroom. My girlfriend didnt want to make the decision to live there right away but finally today decided that it was the best place for us. So I started the application process and completed it on my end, paying the $80 application fee.

I informed my girlfriend that she needed to submit her app now that mine was done because the apartment would not be held for us unless her side of things was also completed.

She told me okay she was going to do it right away. I gave it 30 minutes and texted her asking if she completed it yet. No response from her for the next to hours after that. 

Then the leasing agent called me to inform me that other people have started to fill out applications for the same apartment and since my girlfriend still hadsn't filled out her application then I might lose $80 and the apartment.

Then I called my girlfriend and asked what the deal was. She said she was getting ready for 2 hours for her grandmothers birthday party. She ignored my texts cause she was doing this. 

I am mostly getting an apartment because my girlfriend wont have a home here soon. I have a free room at my grandfathers house but she is not allowed to live there with me and doesnt want to anyways because he has smoked in the house for 30+ years.

I am so livid right now. I know I'm mad but if we dont get the apartment and I lose money theres a good chance I will breakup with her. This is a big issue for me.

He's shown he can change his wound himself, shower, cook, clean, drive, and take his medication without help. He's far from being an invalid.

736," 

Hello Anyone!

I am 27yo F talking about marriage with my 29yo M boyfriend. We have been dating for a year now, and have started talking about the future and marriage. We are a great match, and on the same page for all life and planning conversations. Frankly, he is one big breath of fresh air.

He told me a couple of weeks ago, that it would be something he is really interested in to plan a surprise wedding. My immediate internal reaction was shock and apprehension. After thinking about it a little bit, I am really warming up to the idea. We would have the autonomy of planning and would be able to scale as we wanted, and keep it simple.

We would likely hold it on the property that we will own together (working on getting the property and house over the next year), and it would be amazing for a wedding, whether it was a surprise or not. The surprise appeals to me because of the low-stress environment it created fro the guests and allows us to just focus on the purpose of the wedding, which is to get married and have a celebration with friends. I am pretty low maintenance, so I feel like I can make this work and still get all of the important things out of the wedding day that I would want.... mostly my boyfriend being there lol. We may look at turning an engagement party into the wedding, or a housewarming party into the wedding as a way to get people we love to show up. Not sure yet.

My current questions are whether or not I am nuts for thinking this is a good idea? Are there things I am not considering that may make me regret planning this?

As a parent would you be pissed if you showed up to a party at your kid's house, and it turned into their wedding? If people could not make the party and it ended up being our wedding would they hate us? Will I wish I did something more formal later in life (I doubt it, but I'm gonna ask the internet for reassurance anyways).

What am I not considering here?

Thanks for your thoughts",23Jan2020,1
737,"I know Asian parents are strict but damn this is something else. This may not be the most awful story you’ll ever hear about Asian parents because yes, there are worst people out there but this is getting bad. Me and my boyfriend are both 20 years old, and stuck in quite a shitty situation. 

For me it is just my mother, my parents divorced when I was three years old so I am just living with my mother. One or two years back my mother would get physically violent with me when she gets angry but it stopped once I started fighting back (I don’t hit her back or anything like that but I would defend myself from her blows, like grabbing her hand when she was about to hit me) and actually stand up for myself. But this only stopped the physical abuse. She never truly listens to me, and want things done her way. If she doesn’t like it I will be punished. She raises her voice, and throw things around, hit an object to make a loud noise to show that she is angry and I’m the cause of it. At this point I stopped trying to explain myself all the time, even if I tried to talk politely and patiently without raising my voice she would consider it as me “talking back” at her. Even if I do everything she tells me to, she’s quite unpredictable. 

Now, my boyfriend is going through everything that I mentioned above and more and it’s much worse than mine. Because both of his parents are abusive. His mom would scratch him till he bleeds, bite him, punch him, slap him, hit him with an object and shout at him. Throwing unimaginably harsh and awful words at him. One time he came home a little past his curfew (which is 12 am), his mother changed the lock pads of their front door and did not give him the key for a month and a half. He was on his semester break then, but he was locked in his own house. Often times when his mother is displeased for some reason she would not provide any allowance for him for a month, ad she doesn’t care if he starves. His father abuses him physically and emotionally as well, though not as severe as his mother, but it’s still bad. 

I’ve known this for a while now even before we got together, but he is nothing like his parents and he’s a great, caring and amazingly sweet guy that is incredibly understanding. Sometimes I would see scratch marks on him and it would just break my heart, but he never really wanted to talk about it so I never pushed him to. But damn that frustrates me. I really want to do something about this, but we are both still halfway through our degree and there is no way we can survive on our own out there. There’s no cps in my country. I decided to speak about this today because, he was a little past his curfew today because we were both hanging out , his parents are livid. His mother threatened him that she would give me an earful, and that I am an awful girlfriend. No offence but we are 20 years old for god’s sake can’t we hang out a little bit past midnight? Of course my mother gave me an earful too, and she also threatened me that she will give him a lesson and contact his mother If this happens again. I’m not sure what I can do at this moment for the both of us, except finishing our degrees, get a job and move out together. But until then, what can I do for him, I need some advice.",23Jan2020,1
738,"I tried posting in here the other day and unfortunately didn’t receive any advice other than some guy being rude to me. So let’s try this again. 

I’m in college and I live in an apartment with two roommates, both of whom I am very good friends with. Recently, one of my roommates has been very negative and overly sensitive. It seems like she’s constantly in a bad mood, complaining about things that are fixable and gets offended by everything. It’s starting to wear on me and my other roommate because we feel like we’re constantly walking on egg shells around her and we hate that we always feel that way in our own home. There seems to be a lot of tension and it’s hard to relax because you never know when you might say or do something that upsets the other, seemingly very sensitive roommate. 

She complains about us to each other (meaning she talks about me and things I’ve said/done to the other roommate and talks about the other roommate and things she’s said/done to me) and we try to just ignore it, but it’s becoming more frequent and she seems to be bothered by the littlest things. Instead of just being upfront with us or letting things roll off her back, it’s like she harbors every negative feeling she ever feels and overanalyzes every interaction to find something wrong with it or with the person she interacted with. 

Most of the time when she gets upset, she either gives whoever she’s talking to an attitude (just gets really snotty and passive aggressive out of nowhere) or goes upstairs and slams her door and doesn’t come out for a while. It’s very childish. 

Basically, I’m wondering how my other roommate and I can approach her about this, either separately or together. I’m worried about making her feel like she’s being attacked because it’s “2 vs 1” and I don’t want her to get defensive. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I can’t live like this in my own house anymore. I’m tired of walking on eggshells around her. Both of my roommates are two of my closest friends and that makes it really difficult to solve the problems we have sometimes. What should I say? How should I start that conversation? Should I even say anything?",23Jan2020,1

Of course she starts crying harder, but if any of you have kids you know that a crying child will cry differently according to the situation, and this child, to me, sounded sad, not spoiled.  He continued to berate her and his language got worse the more he yelled.  Damn this, shit that, a few GDs, and ""You're just like your mother, always whining to get what you want.  Well, I've had enough and this is going back!""  There were some icy pops in the buggy and he turned and headed for the freezer section.  Of course the child started crying harder and promised she'd do better, but with his yelling and cursing she was just getting more upset.

744,"Mobil sorry. Throwaway obviously. 

I, among a group of late 20’s/early 30’s people, manage a restaurant. One of the other managers has been severely depressed his whole life. He has attempted suicide twice. Once at a young age, once years ago in college. 

He is on medication and, from my understanding, was in therapy until the therapist (through our health insurance) essentially told him that she had worse off people than him she needed to focus on. 

He has been married for a few years now. His wife is amazing, empathetic, and, from what I can tell, very present for him. 

Recently his unhappiness at work, and I assume his life overall?, has escalated. Despite taking time off, reducing his hours, giving him the “easier” shifts with fewer drunks/assholes, he continues to poorly handle customer conflict, escalating aggressive situations and causing himself and other coworkers to feel endangered by the angry customers. 

Beyond that he has expressed to me homicidal thoughts about upsetting customers. ie “I wish they were dead.” “I want to kill them all.” “Sometimes I just feel like going postal.” Whenever he says these things it’s with a slight laugh, and I don’t think people take him seriously. But he’s told me he’s not joking. 

I recently heard from another manager that when a homeless guy would not stop harassing customers in front of the restaurant, and after becoming frustrated that the guy wouldn’t leave, my coworker told the homeless person “I could kill you right now and no one would care.” 

If there was any doubt before, it is entirely erased. I am taking this very seriously. Concern for my coworkers and the safety of others is growing rapidly. *And* I’m scared for him. He is clearly screaming for help. And I want to actually help him, not hurt him. I think he’s still at a point where resolution can be found without insane consequences. But I could be wrong. So I’m asking you. What should I do?",23Jan2020,1
745,"Hi, everyone. I'm having a hard time, and would love some advice. 

A little backstory, first. I am 20yo and live with my parents. I currently do online school, as I'm anticipating moving out before the summer comes. I work part time in food service, and I will be able to keep my job (through a transfer) even if I move away. I have saved up enough money to move out without the risk of being homeless, and I am finishing up the process of getting my car (and other assets) solely in my name. It seems like I have all my ducks in a row and should be able to move out, but all I feel is crippling anxiety and a fear that I'll have to run back to my parents. 

My parents, especially my dad, have been mentally and emotionally abusive towards me for as long as I can remember. I get yelled at for choosing to do homework instead of washing THEIR dishes. They leave moldy clothes in the washing machine that is in my bedroom (the garage) because they expect me to take care of it after coming home from work at midnight. I am constantly told that I am ungrateful and horrible, even though I chiefly clean the house, take care of the pets, and basically keep the house from falling apart. I have called my mother many times when I feel that my safety is at risk when at home alone with my dad. I know that moving out will be better for my mental and emotional health, but I feel physically ill at the thought of leaving. My therapist and friends all want me to leave and support me, but my family (parents and siblings) have repeatedly said to wait until I go to a university, or that I won't succeed on my own. The issue is that my mental health feels so fragile that I don't want to waste time or money at a 4 year, especially if I want to drop out. 

I'm also anxious about subleasing with a stranger--all my friends are locked into shared leases. My job doesn't make enough money to get a lease approved solo. I could quite school and get a second job, but I am just so afraid of my life being ruined bc I want to escape my parents. 

I don't know what to do. Should I move out ASAP, even if it means crashing with my friends for a while? (They offered.) Do I stay? Do I get a second job and get my own apartment? Sublease?

I just don't care about myself enough. Everyday just feels like a loop, and it always ends the same way. Me being alone, feeling like theres no real point in trying anymore. Nothing has changed. I'm still just as broken and lonely as I was a year ago. I have an extreme desire for something new and exciting, but I know that nothing is happening. I try to clinge to happy memories because they get me through the day, but I want more. I want new memories. But there's no one left to make them with. My mom's dead. My dad's burnt out. My friends don't seem to care. I just feel so lonely... I want to go out and do things, but theres no one to go with. I can't even drive yet, so I'm just left to sit here in my own self pity, having no motavation to even try anymore. I just want to feel loved. But I guess that isn't for everyone.

747,"I've been getting a lot of texts recently, but not for the reason you'd expect.  It started late last year when I got a text message from someone who was wondering if they could buy my parents' house.  Interestingly, they had perfect English and used my dad's name - my dad didn't link my phone to anything related to him, and it's far easier for a scammer to get my name from my phone.

I delete the message and move on.  About a month later, I get another text message from this guy.  Again, perfect English and he's ""just checking up"" to see if we want to sell our house.  I delete the message and move on.

Some time after January 1st, 2020, I get another text message from him.  Again, perfect English, and he starts off with ""Happy New Year!"" and asks the same question again.

I delete this message and block the number.  However a few minutes ago I got a very similar text message from (supposedly) a female this time.  She provided something the previous ""person"" didn't - my house was listed on some site.  She found it, and noticed that it was marked For Sale, then text messaged the number on the listing.

There could be two things going on here:

1.  I have a very persistent scammer on my tail.

2.  Someone found our address, my father's name, and my cell phone number and hav created a false listing on some website where people sell houses.

Is this a scam?  I'm very familiar with lots of different types of scams, and this doens't fit any of the ones I'm familiar with.  If this is a scam, has anyone else been hit by this?",23Jan2020,1

I'm a 16 year olds and i'm worried about what i'll do with my life after school. Right now i'm studying enterprise and marketing. I don't want to study this at all since i'm not intrested in this at all, the only reason i'm studying this is for my parents. Lately my grades have been dropping because of my lack of intrest in the direction i'm studying. I truly want to study something i'm intrested in and feel passionate about. The problem with that is, I don't know what to do with my life. Since I care more about my own happiness than income I would like to study philosophy but you can't do much when you major in philosophy. I feel stuck in between the fact that i want to do something that makes ME happy and what is gonna secure me a safe future with a good income.

Any advice?

TL;DR: I'm studying something i don't want to and my grades have been dropping. Should i do something I feel happy about or should I secure my future with a job that can keep me financially safe.

Socializing is quite hard for me because i‘m a rather introverted person. However, I figured i rly succeeded in integrating myself more.

I could now just say, well fuck it i don‘t need to get along with everyone. Problem is i‘m still in some kind of apprenticeship so i‘m getting evaluated. I don‘t really care about my coworkers and it was just out of kindness and decency that i tried to involve myself with her.

Then he kept asking for her to step out of the cafeteria every day until one day he just straight up came to our table and asked her out.

Right off the bat the guy gave off red flags. Instead of forming a genuine bond with her, first thing he did was complain to her how he was the only one in his family who hasn’t “done it”. She was physically uncomfortable and didn’t speak at all to him. Just pretended to smile. 

Long story short, she panicked and said yes because she didn’t want to be mean. My friend said he saw the weirdo practically groping her. She was a friend of ours so you might understand why we’re concerned. She has severe shyness issues. Like when we met her she barely made a peep. She barely talks and if she does it’s super quiet. Think of her like Hinata from Naruto but 10x worse. 

Her breaking up with him herself is out of the question because she just can’t say no.

We’re all also big soccer fans and England is one of the biggest hubs for soccer. 
My parents still make me run big plans like this by them for their approval. (they’ve always been this way) I explained how the trip was only going to be like 700-800 dollars (no hotel cost, found a cheap flight etc) and that this would be the only opportunity because we won’t know if our schedules match up again, and friends sister moves back to US in June.

My parents went on to not exactly shoot down the idea fully but rather give reasons as to why they don’t think I should go. Saying this shouldn’t be my first international trip by myself I should take a tour trip or, I should go take a trip with the university before I go with friends, I don’t know what could go wrong or what could happen in customs and finally (the one that pisses me off the most) that there isn’t a chaperone there with us.

I recently started a job at a car dealership. To be exact I Started the job on the 4th of January and my title is 'Trainee Sales Executive'. My boss is sort of an asshat, He loves to boast about the fact he's so successful and has a Rolex on his wrist. I'm 20 years old and have been in the field of sales since I've been employed. The previous industry I used to sell in was technology so I sold Tv's, gadgets but primarily sold mobile phones. I was the top salesman pretty much everywhere I went \*This is to re-enforce the fact I can sell not to compare myself to others pardon my arrogance\* and I'm getting treated like an absolute baby and a fool. I've managed to create a relationship with my fellow work mates (other salesman) and my boss pulled me into his office and said he 'feels' like I'm not bonding or helping enough in the workplace... I replied ""I come in to listen and learn, I joke around with the other boys and we have a good time"" he then stopped me and then replied ""Well don't joke around with them, you're not at that level yet and your relationship with them isn't developed enough"". I was so baffled by his response where I just said ""Ok"" after a short sigh. Multiple times I've been ridiculed for being young and saying I'm way too unexperienced for my age and that he doesn't want me to talk to any of the customers about cars because he doesn't want me to say anything dumb and scare them away. It makes me feel so useless and its actually affecting me mentally. I have a child on the way and I can't afford to lose this job. I don't know what to do? Should I whistleblow? Would I get laughed at? I've gone from a really confident salesman to being broken down into some rich guys robot. I get disrespected on a daily basis, I get told I need a haircut, I get told I need to buy everyone lunch if im ever late? like what the hell.

785,"I'm (31F) having these thoughts of purchasing a puppy for 2 months now. I like to consider myself a rational person, and usually, I'm trying my best not to react based on current emotions, that's why I'm having doubts and don't know what to do.

Here's the thing: I usually live between 3 and 6 months in a location, in a rented apartment. I don't have a place of my own. I work from home, allowing myself to travel, that's why the frequent change of places. This thing comes with pros and cons.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\- new places, different language, different culture

\- I earn enough to have a modest, comfy life, I could/should do better though, no savings yet and that is scary.

\- I have a close friend with who I usually travel but sometimes our lives don't match financially (he earns more than me and it's hard to keep up with him. For example, if he chooses the location and the apartments in that area are OK for him, for me will be expensive. I don't want to waste half of my salary on rent).

&amp;#x200B;

Cons (and the reasons I consider purchasing a puppy):

\- there is no boyfriend in my life, I find it very difficult to find one given my lifestyle

\- no kids, no family, just this friend I have but he has his own thing going on (studies anatomy)

\- I'm feeling depressed most of the time because of my loneliness. I'm ashamed of the fact that I don't have a family by now even though I'm sociable and likable (my past confirms it)

\- because I only spend a few months in a location, I don't feel like integrate much, therefore, I'm not making any friends. All of my friends are in my country.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want a soul only for me to take care and give attention. I'm pretty sporty and active and have enough time to take care of a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

My worries are:

&amp;#x200B;

\- it will limit my possibility of evolving financially (spending more time and money on the puppy, not on searching a possibility to make more money or to become knowledgeable about smart investments)

\- no more flights, I would have to travel by car (I don't have one, my friend has one, but maybe we won't live in the same area in the near future. It happened before.)

\- it will limit my rental options

\- I'm scared I'm making a very emotional decision and in the future, I might regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I want to buy a puppy because I'm always alone and depressed and I'm thinking that he will improve my life. I'm a sporty girl, I could spend quality time with him. Because I don't have a place of my own, I'm scared of the limitations that a dog might bring me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it will be the right decision to buy a puppy.

787,"So - August last year I got offered a graduate job for my engineering degree.   
This wasn't just any job, it's with the best company around and they offered me over 6 figures and great career progression. Of course I signed. The job doesn't start until February (Late next month).

So I just needed to complete my coursework and start. I really mucked up and failed a course in my final semester (It's my fault I know but Elec ain't always easy). I can't start the grad program unless I am able to give them my final academic transcript. I am so desperate for this job I begged my course coordinator to come up with a solution. So what's going on, I am enrolled for that one course this semester that I failed and will be marked early so that I'll have finished all my courses by the grad program start date.

Here's the issue though: From what I've heard, my uni won't release my real final transcript until the official course grade release date in june - meaning I won't be able to start my grad program. Should I contact HR there and tell them I have a signed letter from the uni official saying I've completed all the course stuff and am eligible for graduation - the transcript just can't be released yet?? Will they knock me back because of that?

I honestly don't know what to do - I don't know if HR will be okay with that. They seemed to really like me there but it's a huge company. I've been losing A LOT OF sleep over this :(",23Jan2020,1
788,"So, this girl is the year behind me in school. I met her briefly at the freshman orientation last summer, but didn’t see her again until just before the school year started. She messaged me on instagram saying that she had heard from people that I hated her. I was confused, to say the least, and messaged back denying it and telling her it was a pleasure to meet her at the orientation, and I hoped we could get to know each other better during the year. Basic formality. She seemed fine with that answer, and that looked to be the end of it.

It wasn’t.

About halfway through the first semester, she started sending me things whenever I posted on snapchat. Mostly, it was vague enough to not make me angry, but gave enough context to raise alarm bells about what she meant. An example would be the time I posted a video of me singing and she simply responded “😣🙉❌❌”. I never responded to her, save for the occasional “?”, which she never seemed to acknowledge. That was strange, so I asked tumblr for help, who told me to block her because I was uncomfortable.

She somehow noticed, like, immediately. Within a day she had messaged me about it on instagram. I went into a panic attack, so I apologized, and claimed it was a mistake and I meant to block someone else. She just said “ok”, and I unblocked her so she wouldn’t get mad. 

Well, today I got another message. This time, it was plain and simple, “stop staring at my girlfriend in chem.” Now, I may be bi, but her girlfriend is NOT my type, and I definitely haven’t been staring at her. But I know her girlfriend must have claimed I was, since this girl isn’t in chem with us. I told her I wasn’t, and apologized anyway to try and end it, and she hasn’t even opened the message despite the fact that I know full and well she’s seen the notification, she’s that kind of person that will make sure she sees everything someone sends her. Plus, she’s posted on snapchat in the time it’s been sent.

Lately, I’ve caught her girlfriend glaring at me, or just seeming annoyed with my presence in our shared classes, so I assume this has something to do with them both having something against me, but I don’t know what I’m meant to do about the whole situation. Any help here?",23Jan2020,1

794,"I keep losing friends. Like my whole life I become best friends with someone very fast and then after a year or so they will do something that I feel is a big betrayal (examples: many have gone after my ex boyfriends behind my back, one stole my credit card, my best friend since birth was very insensitive after I got raped by my boyfriend and was in a year long court case with him, she then went after the guy I dated who was my biggest support during that time), one constantly talked shit about me behind my back about how she didn’t think I was as pretty as people say and that I am stupid. 


I have a few friends who have never done anything like this and are genuinely loyal people. I try to be a good friend and be there for my friends as much as I can, on their good and bad days. Why do I keep getting screwed over? Apart from my friend who stole my credit card (she obviously had issues beyond me lol)... should I just forgive these friends. 

The way I handle those situations usually is to confront them and tell them they have upset me. I try to stay calm and rational about it but sometimes I blow up because I would never do that to someone. I have very bad taste in men so I think that may account for some of the drama over guys but at the same time I shouldn’t have to worry about my friends going after men they know I still care about. 

I’m just getting tired of it. Thinking of moving far away and starting over. I hate knowing that there are people out there calling me crazy just because I stood up for myself and cut them out of my life. It affects my new relationships too because there are whispers that I’m a “crazy girl”.

While this is a issue, a much larger issue is when it comes to my SO. I don't care who she hangs out with or literally what she does day to day, I tend to be a pretty relaxed person. However I swear anytime something meaningful in my life comes up her family plans a trip or she has something to do.

For a recent example, I happen to be moving into my first independent living space and this is something I have worked and strived for, and she just happens to be taking a trip across the country. While in my heart I know I should be a happy for her and tell her how amazing its gonna be all I wanna do is fucking loose my shit. I know she cant help it, it's not even her choice. Of course I try to fake it best I can and tell her how nice its gonna be but my transparent self gives away my emotion almost instantly. It creates issues within myself and between her and I. I know the whole time she's on the trip I'm gonna be pissed, Im not gonna wanna know how much fun she is having or what she is doing. Im going too completely isolate myself and be a dick. I only know because this is how I react every time. 

I want to stop feeling this way, I know how toxic it is. I try so hard to control it but its like this wave of heat and anger wash over me and I'm not myself. Like I said before im a generally calm person but jealousy makes me into something I don't wanna be. Please help. please tell me how to fix this? How to change?

800," 

Over the last few months, one of my closest friends has had success in losing weight through a popular yet extremely restrictive fad diet, which she mentions in nearly every conversation. For context we’re both college aged girls. Lately, she has claimed to have gotten down to a 21 inch waist and 25 inch hip measurement which is nearly 10 inches smaller than the average runway model. When she said this I asked if she meant 35 inch hip measurements since literally no adult has 25 inch hips, she insisted hers were 25. While she definitely has lost weight, it’s nowhere this extreme-- I would say she’s around a US size 6/8, which is perfectly healthy! Another element to this is that I’m personally one of those lucky people who are naturally a size 00/0 because I have a fast metabolism. She started this diet shortly after we became close friends, which makes me wonder if that contributed to her wanting to lose weight. Also just to clarify, when I’ve been over to her house she’s had me try on some of her skirts and jeans (that fit her) and they were all way too big for me. My waist fluctuates between 23 and 24, so her claiming to have an even smaller waist than me literally just does not make sense.

I’ve heard of people having body image disorders in the context of seeing themselves as larger than they really are, but could it be possible that my friend has this in reverse? If so, do you guys think it’s worth mentioning or should I leave it alone? My concern here is for her health, especially since the diet she’s on is so restrictive that I worry all the measurements and numbers are getting in her head. She has other mental health issues and sees a therapist, but as far as I know she has never been diagnosed with an eating disorder or has talked to her therapist about her eating habits.

I’m also concerned that if she continues constantly talking about measurements and dieting, she’ll alienate herself from our friend group. I see her the most out of anyone else in the group, and nearly every time I see her she’ll mention something about her weight loss. When we’re at parties she’ll talk to people about the ‘science’ behind her diet and how well it has worked for her even when nobody asks. 

I guess what I’m asking is if this seems like a genuine cause for concern worth saying something to her about? I know that lots of young women are obsessed with fitness/diets/losing weight etc but this seems like another level entirely.",23Jan2020,1

I have a friend in my life who I am very close to. He means the entire world to me, he's my absolute everything, my favorite person, we just have an unbelievable mutual connection. He's generally a very 'I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks of me as long as you and I are happy' person. He has personal insecurities and we both have really bad self hate issues but we're working on them. 
He's trans and is going through the consultation stage of getting top surgery. He doesn't talk to me much about it because it's a topic he just has issues talking about. Yesterday he found out the doctor is going to use a method he doesn't want because of the scarring. He already has scars from unrelated things that he's incredibly insecure about and now he's upset that he's going to have these scars. The surgery is still worth it for him, but I know he's struggling with coming to terms with the fact this isn't going how he wanted and he doesn't know how to deal with the insecurity. 
I don't really know the best way to comfort him. I was hoping maybe someone who has experience in the subject would know the best way to support someone dealing with this. I just care about him so much and hate to see him upset, especially when he's so distant about this topic. Is it better to just never bring it up or what?

808,"So the company that I work for merged with another. My old manager promised me a promotion and a new title change when someone quit unexpectedly 2 months ago. Around then, she had told me that she was submitting the promotion papers for HR to process to take over the person who quit role.
Around that time, she had a meeting with the new director and new manager that were coming over from the other company as my old manager is taking on a new role within our company.  During the meeting, the new director had asked her who filled the position as they had someone else in mind. My old manager told them that I did and she explained to them why she gave me the position as I deserved it  and that the person they wanted to fill the position was already hired to work another role in the company. Later that day, I had lunch with my old manager and the new director &amp; new manager. The new director brought up the person they wanted in my position name again and explained that they were fired from their company by an old director and came back to work for the company in a different position when the old director had retired, but they wanted their old position back within our company after the merge. My old manager explained to them again that the person they wanted had been hired for a different role and that she has given the position to me. 

I have been working two positions at the company for  the past 2 months. Last week, I asked my old manager if HR ever processed the papers for the promotion.

So in summary I am a bit of a nerd. I have also been a 4.0 student my whole life and it has not changed. My behavior is acceptable at home and in school with no drugs or any other crap. I am taking hard classes such as AP physics and getting over 100% at the end of the quarter, so school is very good for me. I spend a lot of time on the computer after school and go to robotics for 3 hours everyday and about 12 hours on the weekend. I am also a social person that talks to people a lot, so I don't just sit and do nothing. Lastly, I work 3 times a week at a local restaurant and have made around $2,000 in the past 6 months. So I make my own money and pay for things I want. But 90% of the time I leave the money in the bank as there is really only 1 thing I want to get and have been wanting for over 2 years now.......VR!

Now to the point. I have a 1080 so no further requirements for VR other than the package of headset, controllers and base stations. For some reason my parents DESPISE VR as some sort of time waster/waste of money. They believe it will make me never leave my room as I will always be in this ""virtual world"" if I get it. This statement is 100% false because why would it make me spend more time than normal games? My parents have made jokes about my posture due to gaming and I have told them that I would rather be moving and standing up rather than sitting with poor posture. I have showed them all the other stuff BESIDES gaming (which I want to do) like art, architecture, and more. Still my parents (mainly mom) continuously refuse to allow me to buy ANY VR headset on the market.

* Research/data/computers/education
* Helps others/people in some way (public health/environmental awareness)

819,"So basically I have a friend whos mother psychologically abuses him on a daily basis. If he dares to push back even for a bit she will physically abuse him. The abuse is really really bad. I mean looking from the outside it is amazing how he can cope with it. Basically what she does is she gets mad over every little thing all the time and yells at him about how useless he is, how she wishes he was never born etc. When she really gets in the mood she will push so long as to break him down completely using stuff like bringing up his dead father and so on. That is even one of the pleasant examples. And she will only stop until he breaks down crying in front of her and even then it does not end sometimes. Maybe another example if she comes home any day of the week from drinking at like 2am she will wake him up and not stop until he has to go to school.

To the point where headaches, nose bleeding and other problems like that started occurring. Also not sleeping well, waking up in the middle of the night crying.

820,My family dealt with a bad house fire the other night and alot of burnt ceiling insulation and ash got all over the room and on all my shoes and I want to fix them up since their really nice newer shoes and looking for advice on how to clean them and remove the smoke smell entirely from them?,23Jan2020,1
821,"Using an alt because people know my main account.

Also, I need advice before dinner (in about an hour), can read TLDR at the bottom.  
So a bit of background info: I'm 16 and I have a job as a newspaper courier. It used to be my younger brother's (14) job but he found a new job in January. My parents insisted that I take the job, but I didn't want to and I expressed that to them. My reasons were I was more focused on school and academics, in my country, grade 11 is usually the most important time to apply for university etc. They replied with ""what is a little time taken off your day? you use that time going out with your friends or watch YouTube anyways?"" 

So I was pressured into the job and I thought ""maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all."" Fast forward to today, I'm 2 weeks into the job and I have a final math exam coming up tomorrow that I need to study for. I expressed to them that I don't think I can deliver today to which they replied: ""it's only an hour, there's no harm in that."" Fine. So I called my brother to come with me so I could have some small talk with him as it gets quite boring out there. I was almost done when this incident happened. 

Keep in mind I was really stressed for exams and I was thinking to leave as early as possible, I wanted to get it done quick. My brother wanted me to throw him a newspaper so he can throw it over a vertical garden to another house's porch which I had already delivered to. I, thinking I had to get this done as quickly as possible just ignored him. Because of this he just completely walked out and went back to the house that we live in. I don't know what happens but I just snapped. I completely just said, No I'm not dealing with this anymore, I'm going home a studying. It's his job, I shouldn't be forced to do it. So I walk home, not thinking straight and stressed out and just go to my room and start flipping through my math book.  


Suddenly I hear my mom screaming at the top of her lungs for me to come down and that's when I know I fucked up. She says she'll deliver it herself and I realize I've made a mistake. So I get out in my hoodie and start bringing the newspaper. She yells at me to get a jacket because it's below 0 and in that split second, I made a decision to get the jacket as I didn't want to anger her even more. When I get back, she's already half-way down the street. I get back into my room and here am I writing this. I know I should probably be studying for my math exam, but I feel like I might need to fix this situation first. I genuinely don't know what to do. She already told my brother to put a letter of resignation and I want to apologize to her but I'm not sure how. I realize probably should've finished delivering and talked it out with them and I'm an asshole for just walking out in the middle of the job. What should I do to fix this, I urgently need advice before dinner which is in about an hour.   


TLDR: I fucked up by walking out mid-way from my newspaper job and need to apologize to parents for that. Any advice?",23Jan2020,1

I arrive to the interview 10 min early and told the front workers I had an interview they told me “she’s busy have a seat” and directed me to the back of the bakery. As I sat down I was trying to calm my nerves and only to realize the entire time I was sitting next to the employer ! 

The employer was interviewing someone else besides me. And 2 other people were waiting to get interviewed after me. So this is how it went : 
We introduced ourselves she asked me about my education and availability, experience etc. 
I’m only 19 and still in college and had 1 job before when I was 16. 

The interview was super short and she didn’t ask me as much as other employers and she didn’t even explain the company to me at ALL. Like nothing. She basically said I must show up this Friday (tomorrow) for an unpaid training from 4pm-8pm. She told me how this will be like a trial and error test run to see if I’m a good fit. Which means it’s not guaranteed I will get the job. I have to show up in all black everything and they will give me a hat for the employees at the front. The problem is I’m very nervous and I don’t know what to expect for tomorrow’s training because I’ve never been through any situation like this. What can I do during the training process to make sure I will be hired for this position at the bakery ?

Then he told me they're going to take it is the morning and skii while high around other people, resort staff, families, and children. He is also not an exceptionally experienced skier.

My argument is that if he falls and needs help, gets seen with dialated pupils, or gets noticed acting strange, he will face charges for possession, and consumption of illegal substances. This could effectively ruin his life and probably mine too. We both work in the medical field meaning our jobs take drug use very seriously.

843,"So I (21 F) live in an apartment my family owns with my boyfriend (20 M) and my oldest brother (38 M). 


My boyfriend and I have lived here rent free for about 18 months. I ""paid"" the rent by taking full-time care of my grandmother who lives on the first floor. The idea was for me to do this while I go to school and work a part time job. I never made it to school since caretaking and work took up every hour of my day. 


My boyfriend's mom stepped in about 11 months after we moved in. She wanted us to move in with her in Florida. Again, the idea was for us to live free and go to school. She is very wealthy and made some pretty lofty promises. It sounded much better than 16 hour days with no end in sight. We decided to go. 


Months pass, we have most of our lives packed. My brother moves in to take over my Grandmother's care. Then his mom ripped the rug out from underneath us. All very dramatic. 


Almost six months later, we're finally settled in again. With my brother living with us and taking over half of my grandmothers care. My boyfriend is paying our one utility (electric) as his contribution instead of rent. I'm set up to finally start school in the fall. 


I got home today and my boyfriend tells me he wants to try and move to Florida again. His mom is extending the olive branch, she wants him to go to college. She'll get us our own apartment. I smell bullshit. She took a hammer to our lives once already. I've spent months kicking myself for going along with this in the first place. She has a history of doing this kind of thing. I told my boyfriend she's only doing this to have control. Plus I would have no support system. Everyone I love would a thousand miles away. He thinks this time is different. He thinks that this will solve all of our issues. I told him he could go alone but he refuses. He only wants to go with me. He feels like he doesn't have a future here. He can't work enough to afford to pay his bills (about $600 a month) and go to school. I think he can if he wanted to.


 I'm sorry this is all over the place but I need some outside input so I dont destroy my future or my (otherwise very good) relationship.",23Jan2020,1
844,"Hi,

So I'm moving away to complete different province in Canada and I hired movers to move my stuff but I have some concerns about the movers already.
The movers gave me a quote for 1000lbs/pounds  so if its less than 1000lbs I still have to pay the same amount unless it's over 1000lbs then I have to pay more which is ok.
I weighted all the items at home and it was a little over 800lbs, and the next day the movers picked the items and said they will weight the items the tomorrow, I got an email the next day saying I have to pay $300-400 more because the weights are over 1000lbs, so I asked them to confirm that and also told them that we'll have to weigh it again at delivery.
They emailed me back with:
""We can confirm that your weight is accurate and tomorrow I will send you the scale ticket from the pickup, however, we can as well proceed with re-scaling your items only with the following conditions: 

If after scaling the weight is within 10% from 1430 lbs, we will have to charge you $400 fee to cover the fuel surcharge, labor, equipment and time spent. 

If after scaling the weight is over 10% from 1430 lbs, we'll pay for re-scaling and additional applicable fees and will adjust the final bill according to the new weight""

I have to pay $400 for re-scaling the items, 
If I don't I'll be out of $300-400 if I agree on re-scaling on delivery and it's more I'll be out of $800.

I don't know if the weights are accurate or its made up since it wasn't weighted in front of me?.

850,"My previous school was competitive so back then I would always do my projects and homework 1 week before the deadline, reviewing notes each day, and other things a diligent student would do. 

But now, I observed that I cram on my researches, I seldom take notes during the discussion, and I just feel not motivated to do things that I do back then.

Maybe because my current school and classmates aren't as competitive as the previous one. Just so you know, I was only a middle achiever at my previous school because there were a lot of students or my classmates who were more intelligent, genius, and talented than me but now my current classmates regard me as one of the best. It frustrates me because I am not. My former classmates would only laugh at me at that compliment.

Or maybe because I am easily influenced by my surroundings. When my classmates get lazy, I get lazy too. Birds of the same feather flock together they say.   

I want my old self and It's my goal to finish college with a title. So, how can I get back on track and avoid being influenced by unproductive habits so that I can be a diligent student again?   


Also, optional question, how can I properly say ""no"" to my current classmates that always ask me questions to teach them during an activity because when I do, I cannot focus on my own paper and I will write the wrong answer or not finish it because too many people are pressuring me to help them, distracted by a load of questions near me. I don't want to hurt them by not helping but I want to finish my paper too. I save them but no one saves me. I am aware this could lead to depression.

851,"I guess I get the feeling from being molested as a kid. He called me his cute girl and it just haunted me ever since. Then I started thinking about it more and I just wanted to feel cute; so I started crossdressing. Over time the crossdressing became gender dysphoria. Now all I want is to be a girl. My family is extremely christian so they teach me that being transgender is a sin, so I constantly hate myself for not being able to control my feelings. Now the way I handle it is acting like I can't stand transgenderism as a concept. Now everyone thinks of me as an incel for hating women. The few people that know I like crossdressing think I do it because of gender dysphoria, but I never tell them that's what it actually is. I feel like shit for always lying to them about it especially since my best friend is trans. 

I have no idea how to tell people the way I feel. I'm scared what people will say. I know my family will disown me and never acknowledge me again. I want to come out but I can't do it. I can't even tell the trans friend because I really love her and I don't want her thinking I'm doing it to impress her. I feel that people will think I'm doing this for attention also.

852,"For background info, I have had depression and bi-polar disorder since middle school. I've been in deep trouble because of it that I won't get into here, but I've almost entirely recovered from it. My parents, however, have issues trusting me compared to my siblings because of my past. I have proven time and again that I'm responsible and stable, but their position hasn't budged too much. Also, I am 19 and currently taking online courses to finish off some highschool classes. I also live in Florida, if that helps any.

My parents both are highly highly overprotective of me, to the point that I've never truly been unchaperoned from them once in my life. I suspect their grip on me could have been a contributor to my mental health, but that's neither here or there. But recently it's been getting worse since I got a boyfriend that my father in particular told both of us that he doesn't like him to our faces. I just want to take comfort in him, since I have no real friends because of my online courses and the fact that I had to sneak around just to find my bf online anyway. 

It's too much to bear, and I've dealt with this for so long. I have been getting more depressed recently because of the apparent hopelessness of my situation and it's gotten to the point that I am considering just moving out and cutting ties for my health. 

The main issue is my meds. I have never had any control over them, which makes sense in a way because I don't pay the insurance, they do. But I need to take that fistful of medicine twice a day in order to remain stable.

The real question I'm asking is if I, as a legal adult, can order my meds from my pharmacy without the insurance payer physically present. Additionally, can my parents legally claim I am unstable if I decide to leave their home without their consent? Do they have anything they could call the cops on me for if I do this?

If I could do those things, the rest would be easy as I could stay at my boyfriend's until I have a better solution.

There are many reasons I no longer want to go, it's very far away from my home and it will cost me over £100 each time I visit home, the course will not result in a good job, I'm losing passion for the subject, and, I know this will sound stupid, but there's people I want to stay for.

858,"Hi! 

I work as a medical administrator at a clinic in Sweden. My main assignment is to transcribe dictations into text. Every time a patient comes in for an appointment, the dr dictates the clinical examination, diagnosis and etc. for that patient and I write that out in the patient's file. Training to become a administrator takes two years of studying of mostly various laws concerning health care and you need to take several exams before you can get your diploma. I have worked with discriminatory laws in my training, at my former job and also here at this job. It is our job to be a filter between the doctor and the text and to fact-check and double-check the information so that everything is correct and comprehensive. 

The doctor dictates that a patient who has an appointment for neck pain isn't ""wearing any makeup"" and isn't ""styled enough"". This is a completely unnecessary description and I send him a message pointing out that the patient could feel very disrespected by those comments and it would be a good idea to remove them to not risk him getting sued for them. He storms into my office, screams that I  ""will not have any opinions"", I ""shouldn't think or say anything that contradicts him and do only exactly what he says"". I got very offended because the door was open and everybody could hear him, both patients and my colleagues so I told him I was only trying to help him. I always have great discussions with our other doctors and sometimes they understand my perspective and sometimes I see it from theirs but my advice is always wanted and appreciated so I was a bit blown away by his reaction. 

I spoke to my supervisor who in turn spoke to my boss. She arranged a meeting with me, my administrator colleague and the doctor. The dr again said that we are to have no opinions, we shouldn't say or think anything and he doesn't want to hear in a really aggressive way, saying that we have no idea what we're talking about and that we should shut up basically. My boss says nothing. The whole meeting instead is about the administrators role and that we shouldn't be defiant to the doctor. I'm flabbergasted. Not only does my boss defend the doctors completely unprofessional behaviour but she also tells us to not do our job. I tell her that I stand by my opinion about the doctors comments and that nobody can tell their colleague to shut up and not share their opinion, when the boss herself has said many times that this is a clinic where we give feedback to each other and that nobody is above the other. 

I'm not sure what can be done, I don't think this doctor will stay for long because he has already ""accidentally"" prescribed opiates to an addict and is under supervision and he also sent a patient with sensory and auditory hallucinations home, who later committed suicide. But I thought I would at least ask. My colleague and I feel like second class right now and it's causing our motivation to drop. Adding to that this Dr also has taken up the habit to call us ""girls"" every time he needs us which is fucking annoying.",23Jan2020,1

863,"I'm a 2nd-year computer science student (at uni). I always thought I wanted to be a programmer but now I feel like it's a bit... pointless?

I feel like I'm just making my life hard. What awaits me after graduation is a highly stressful job that won't be rewarding enough to compensate for it. If it could make me a millionaire, maybe it would be worth it but honestly speaking, my life will probably just look the same as it's always been. Maybe I'd just have a bigger TV or a newer smartphone. That won't change my life enough to compensate for the hard work.

I could just be a shop assistant and I'd be able to afford all I need and at least I would have time to actually live without additional stress (life is already stressful enough).

I'm not writing this because I'm losing motivation or anything, I'm just literally wondering why I'm even doing all this?

My cousin got some random low paying job a few years ago and he just finished building his house in a little village in the middle of nowhere (it's his 1st job ever). I will never be able to afford anything like that because I have to live close to a big city to even get a job in my chosen field. How is that worth it?

871,"Background:

I just graduated college in Fall 2019 with a CLA degree which focused on learning Japanese so that I could leverage that into becoming a Japanese media translator. This graduation is the culmination of 5 years of schooling; schooling that I restarted (was a dropout) with the sole intention of becoming a translator. I have studied abroad in Japan, I have been dedicating myself to daily Japanese study for over two years now and I just learned Tuesday that I passed the N2 (second hardest out of 5 levels) Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which can be a real boon on a resume. 

I applied for the Japanese Exchange Teaching program, passed the application stage, and am currently waiting for my interview date in Early February. My planned ""next step"" after college was to go teach English in Japan while living among the locals, perfecting my own Japanese skill, and then after a few years becoming a translator. I didn't want to live in Japan forever, just something like 5-7 years before moving back to the US. First year JET teachers make ~$32k. Fourth year teachers make ~$38k, if I remember correctly. **Big qualification: my position in JET is not at all assured yet, but I know I am a strong candidate.** 

Today, I received a job offer from the company at which I am contracted. They are literally creating a position for me because they are so impressed with my talent/potential. And they want to hire me on at 50k, benefits, 401k, and an office. This job has nothing to do with Japanese, but it is in a field that I do find more than enjoyable. I actually look forward to going to work each day. My boss also hinted that this company is the kind where ""individuals with initiative can and do rise to the top."" 



* I have about 50k in student debt.
* If I move to Japan I would be leaving my dog that I love with my parents and he would definitely not live long enough to see me move back.
* If I move to Japan, I'm leaving my friends and family for half a decade or more.
* If I take this job, I am essentially giving up on my dream career. Though I don't intend to give up learning Japanese as a hobby.
* If I take this job I would be able to pay off my student debt in probably half, maybe even a third, the time it was intended to take.
* If I take the job and succeed, the potential for a financially lucrative career dramatically increases.

Hoping Reddit might be able to point out facets of either decision that I am not seeing.",23Jan2020,1
872,"So my Mom is pretty lonely and stuff she has had a hard life. Around a year ago she made friends with a guy (just friends nothing more), and sometimes they would go for coffee and chat, and he would also come to the apartment sometimes as he is good with fixing things and he would help with fixing stuff around the house. However my Mom found out he is an alcoholic, but he was always really nice and kind to me and her, and also my siblings when they came home to visit. He was pretty fine but he started to come to the apartment more and more, and when I went to see my Dad (in Seattle) last summer for a month, I found out that this guy was coming to the apartment everyday and he didn’t wanna leave and he made my mom feel scared and worried. 

Fast forward to recently. He got insanely drunk a few months ago and came to the apartment and starting insulting my mom and stuff. He was also telling people in our city (small city) and people we know that he was my moms boyfriend and stuff which isn’t true. So after this my Mom told him to leave and she didn’t let him in, and he went away. That was in November, and since then he has been stalking us, like waiting outside our apartment, waiting near my moms workplace and standing near the Walmart we go to. He has seen me come from the gym and he has insulted me and threatened me [18M]. He’s also insulted my Mom and stands outside our apartment recording us with his phone. 

What do I do? We’ve already gone to the police they don’t seem to wanna do anything about it. He waits by the downtown he knows we are busy people and always have a lot to do and he is waiting in the places we frequently go to. 

I’m moving away soon and it means my mom will be living alone, as my other siblings are older and moved out already. I’m worried about my Mom and I don’t think I can move while he’s being like this.

My Mom hates him and never wants anything to do with him. I hate him too and I wish he would just die and leave us alone. 

What do I do?",23Jan2020,1
873,"I...have issues with being touched. Especially when it’s unexpected, because of some stuff that happened earlier on in my life.

For some context. I’m 15 and I go to a private school, but I’m not from a particularly wealthy family- in fact- the only way I’m able to attend is through a combination of scholarships, bursaries and external support from an organisation.  Originally though, I’m from a estate in an area known by most in my country for being pretty dodgy (if you catch my drift).  My point is, I’ve experienced a lot of stuff that the rich people around me never have, and they don’t understand the things people like me have had to go through because of their own circumstances. 
They just can’t understand, so I haven’t bothered to tell them, but my friend knows, which makes this whole ordeal so much worse.

Anyway, I feel a brush on my upper thigh (accidental on her part) and I instinctively go into fight or flight mode, slapping my friend really hard, without even a thought. I didn’t even realise I had moved at all before I did it, all I remember is feeling a chill run down my spine when I felt the touch. 

Of course, to everyone but me, I did this for no reason. I apologised and tried to explain as best I could without spilling too much about more personal things, but she and the people watching began to yell at me and get angry.  I keep apologising and my friend angrily tells me to ‘get a grip on [my] instincts then’ while everyone just glares. I’m left to stand alone by everyone and told not to follow.

The rumour going round is that I paused before hitting her, making it intentional.
- fantastic!

People are pretty riled up at me now, especially as I’ve done this before (although only once or twice for the years I’ve been there), and everyone is vaguely aware that I don’t like to be touched. Still though, I hate how this reaction I can’t even control limits me so much and puts me in this situation where just about everyone borderline hates me now.
I know this is probably nothing compared to what everyone else on this subreddit has been through but, right now, I need advice on how to handle this response I get, as well as what to do now I’ve destroyed 90% of my friendships in one fell swoop.

I still spoke to her and endured all of what she was putting me through because she told me she would change. I kept talking to her until she finally seemed uninterested, so I stopped pursuing.  
Over these past 2 months I felt like I really moved on because I stopped thinking of her all in one. She was rarely on my mind, and on top of it all I started seeing this amazing girl last month who I am really falling for, what's even greater is that she's falling for me too, and we both agreed to go at a slow pace and see what happens from there.

This has made me more and more angry, but I love him so I've let it slide, until today. He just bought a brand new car and was boasting about it to the family.  I texted him and said ""WTF dude? You are out here buying new cars, yet you can't even pay me back?""  He claims he needs it because his wife needs it for their kids.  Of course, the new car is his excuse as to why he cannot pay me.

901,"Obligatory this is a throwaway.

This is also incredibly hard for me to talk about, as it happened recently- I guess I'm also so far in denial that I'm questioning my own sanity. But here goes. 

About a week ago I invited my best friend over to my place, because I wanted to get drunk for the first time and she told me that she would supply the alcohol. Obviously I'm very new to drinking, so she promised me that she would stay sober to take care of me and make sure that I didn't go over my limit. I completely trusted her, as we've been best friends on and off for over 7 years and she's *always* had my back and been the person I trust more than anyone else. After multiple promises that she wouldn't let me do anything dumb, I started drinking.

About 2 drinks in I'm feeling the effects (I'm a very small person and apparently a lightweight). I told her this and even though I was tipsy I could tell that she wasn't really watching out for me. She was only laughing at my slurred speech and even encouraging me to drink more. I trusted her and liked drinking so far, so I did. After that it gets hazy. And *quick*. 

I remember small segments-

• at one point she came up behind me and was hugging me a lot, and I remember being confused why. I did try to push her away, but I was completely trashed at this point and no match for her.

• I went to lay down a while later, and my shirt came up a bit- when I fixed it, she pulled it back up and said ""nah, leave it. That's hot."" 

• she insisted on following me into the bathroom while I went, to ""make sure i was okay.""

When I woke up the next morning, she was already awake. She asked how I felt and honestly, I felt terrible. She then asked if I remembered anything from the night before~ which I did not. When I told her that she started to giggle, and when I asked her what was so funny, she told me something that made my heart sink.

""We made out."" Of course I was disgusted. I couldn't have consented, could I? I don't feel that way about my best friend. I asked her how far it went, and all she'll tell me is ""it went a lot further than that."" I should note that she was acting incredibly giggly the entire time she was telling me this. 

I rolled over, closed my eyes, and pretended to sleep until she left. Now I don't know what the hell to do. We haven't talked since. I can't shake feeling violated and dirty, but I barely even remember what happened. Any advice is so appreciated, I'm at a total loss. Am I overreacting?",23Jan2020,1

903,"So I am in the process of writing a novel sequel about a young man named Mark who has a mild form of Autism and deals with anxiety. 10 years ago (in the events in the first novel), Mark as a 9 year old took an anti-anxiety drug called sertraline or Zoloft for anxiety. It helped but it made him ""feel like a zombie"". He came off the Zoloft after 7 months by his pediatric psychiatrist. At age 19, Mark decides to go back on the Zoloft for anxiety again while he is in college. During his second time on the anti-anxiety medication, he meets Jessica who is a beautiful 18 year old woman who likes Mark and he likes her back. However, Jessica drops the ball to Mark that she is transgender.

Mark is OK with that and decides to date her. It works very well for him, however they seem to share a common problem in dating besides their diagnoses (she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, he is diagnosed with ASD) and that is sexual dysfunction. Jessica has low T due to her HRT treatment while Mark's sertraline suppressed his sex drive.

That's a portion of the plot. Hopefully that's enough to get you to understand my idea.Nkw I have two ideas behind a title for the novel. The first suggestion is *Zoloft Odyssey* which is a reference to the similarly titled movie and novel *Prozac Nation*. The other one is *Clockwork*, which is a reference to the video game *Banjo-Tooie*, a game that Mark loves to play and loves to play music from the official soundtrack. In Banjo-Tooie, the co-protagonist Kazooie can fire a type of egg called *Clockwork Kazooie Eggs* that can detonate on command after being fired.

I appreciate your suggestions. Let me know what you think. I look forward to hearing back from you.",23Jan2020,1

905,"My apologies for any formatting mistakes. I'm not used to posting long-form on reddit / unfamiliar with proper formatting procedure.

My (29M) wife (28f) and I have been living in the same apartment complex for the last 4 years. We really like the place; it's not too expensive, it's a bit off the main road so it's quiet, and there's a park nearby that we can walk through for peaceful afternoon strolls. It's also near public transit and in an overall safe neighborhood.

About 3 weeks ago, the couple in the apartment below ours were having a domestic dispute. Over the years, we've heard a lot of the fights that take place in the apartments around us (the walls aren't too thick) and by volume we can usually judge whether or not we should call the cops.  On this particular night, things sounded really tense and possibly violent. It was about 12:15am and we heard expletives, crashes, stuff being thrown around, screaming, etcetera. My wife came out of the bedroom having heard the commotion, and she prepared to dial 911.  


Then, we heard a scream. It was that ear-splitting kind that only comes from actual terror. She then yelled 'Call 911'. My wife started the call, and I went downstairs. I found the girlfriend (early 20s, black, short, wiry) with her back against the door to their shared apartment. She was holding it closed so the guy (early 20s, hispanic, short, avg build) couldn't follow her. I told her she could stay in our place and that we'd keep her safe. She agreed and I put myself between the two of them so she could get upstairs.   


My wife got part of the story out of her. She is living with the guy, but they actually broke up about 5 months ago. They still live together because she has nowhere else to go - and will move out when he lets the lease expire. She relies on him for her phone payments, car payments and rent. He takes her keys, her phone, and anything else she needs when he gets really mad. If she doesn't hand them over, he tries to choke her, and apparently has gotten her in a choke hold more than once.  


The police showed up in full force (Thank you Police Officers of America. I think seeing 6 fully uniformed police officers ready to help out reassured her) and they arrested the guy. The police officers got her statement, didn't take ours, and led the guy off in cuffs. The GF (who apparently isn't the GF anymore) then went back downstairs and continued on with her night.   


Now... in the aftermath of this, my wife looked up the police record and saw he was arrested for assault. The charges described him trying to choke her out. However, he was only in jail one night. It's been a few weeks and he still lives downstairs. She also lives downstairs with him- she can't move out.   


I'm renewing my lease, and in the conversation with Property Management, I learned that the Property Managers don't know that this interaction occurred. If they did know, they would definitely kick him out and that would leave the former GF homeless.   


My wife is a little scared of retaliation, and has set up a camera to watch our door in case of a break-in. I'm personally of the opinion that the guy is a shitbag and I don't really want to live next to him; just in case he's vengeful about the whole ""Calling the Cops"" thing. I'm not afraid of him; I stared him down once and I have no qualms about doing that again. But, I'd still rather not.  


So I have a bit of a dilemma. Do I:  


1. Tell Property Management and get the BF kicked off the property so that I don't have to worry about him doing something crazy, knowing that it would make the GF homeless? or...  

2. Don't tell Property Management and let the GF live there until their lease runs out (about 5 months); then report him &amp; make sure he gets kicked off the property?

907,"I started talking to this girl a few days ago on snap and it was going really well. She just got out of a relationship a few weeks ago and I told her I’d like to go take her out somewhere and she said she’d love to go. I told her I’d pick her up this Saturday night and she said okay. 

However, she has been extremely distant this entire week. Yesterday I asked her where she wanted to go and she left me on opened. Then today I asked if she wanted to bullshit later tonight and again I was left on read. What do I do? Do I just wait until Friday night to ask her again where she wants to go or just I just ignore her and move on? She seemed super excited but all this week she just won’t respond to me. I’m not spamming her I’ve only snapped her 2 times.",23Jan2020,1
