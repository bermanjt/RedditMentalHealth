0,"i’m a 15 y/o girl, if that clarifies anything.

i don’t really know why i’m posting this, but i just need advice (or a shoulder to cry in, i guess). the last few months have been hell. my grades are dropping because i procrastinate literally everything, i’m sad and tired all the time and i feel like actual shit. everything feels so hard, and i honestly feel like a true disappointment to my mom. my grades is what i pride myself on, and since they’re dropping i feel like my worth is too. i hate myself, honestly. i feel like i’m not worthy of anything at all. and it feels so shitty, since i have no reason to feel like this. i live in a country with free healthcare, i have a family, and few good friends. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. and i don’t want to die or anything, i just want to sleep. or cease to exist. i just feel sad and tired all the time. and i can’t tell anyone, my best friend doesn’t understand it at all and my mom just thinks i’m too lazy to work. i don’t have anyone to talk to. i don’t know what to do. i just want to be happy, i want to work hard and get good grades and be a good daughter and friend. i don’t know what’s stopping me from doing that. i’ve felt like this for months, and i don’t know what to do. please, if anyone can help, tell me what i can do. i hate being like this :(",06Nov2020,2
1,"I don't remember what I said exactly, but I think I made some offensive comments on Facebook about 3 years ago.  About a year ago, I deleted all of my Facebook comments so I can't find them to reflect off of.  I'm pretty sure that if my place of employment ever saw it, they'd follow the firing trend because that seems to be the go to solution in today's society.  I regret being stupid and for having edgy moments.  Anyways, 3 years later, nothing has happened.  I still fear the possibility that someone took a screenshot and could use them against me in the future.  But my thought process: why would they wait?  Not sure.  If they hated me, wouldn't it be used now?  I'm wondering if I'm being irrational with this type of thought.  It's really is affecting my health.  With this going on in my head, I don't feel like I should be successful or try hard because I could be harmed in the future.  I also don't even want to start a family because I don't want anyone to suffer from my mistake.  Hope this makes sense.",06Nov2020,0
2,"When I say I'm unsure, I do mean it. We're 21 and have been dating 2 years. It got serious fast. We were fantasising about traveling, marriage etc at the age of 19. He has an ongoing mental illness that comes and goes. I've played therapist, spent hours a day for days on end,  researching the illness when he didn't. I got so stressed out several times. He can go 3 or 4 months with this barely being an issue and that's amazing ! But every time the illness hits hard, I get overwhelmed again and it would be emotional abuse/gaslighting if he didn't have a mental illness. I came very close to ending this beautiful thing on 3 different occasions, the last being 2 weeks ago. He has been better for the last while but for the last 3ish months I've had this horrible feeling that the pain his illness put me through is too much to truly get over. I still feel some resentment for hurtful crap he said a year ago and I shouldn't. 

My parents want to invite him on a family vacation next summer (which he doesn't know about yet) and it seriously worries me as I feel there's a very good chance we might not be together 7+ months from now. I can't guarantee his illness won't take a serious downturn and I'll get overwhelmed and selfishly leave. If we do I'll obviously return any money he pays but I'm terrified continuing a relationship that *might* end in a break up is wrong? I would really miss him if it ended, he is still my best friend and its possible things might improve and the last year will be a distant memory. That's what I want. We met for the first time in 6 weeks yesterday and I found us having fun like the old times and I had butterflies for the first time in 6 months!

3,"I’m in highschool and I’m making a portfolio of all my best pieces.


One of them happens to be me, i did it of myself in the mirror as practice but it came out really good so i want to turn it in.


The problem is uhh i was shirtless. and i’m a girl. It’s not sexual in nature but it’s very obviously boobs. you can’t super tell it’s me but in the drawing i’m holding my sketchbook and pencil so it’s sort of obvious that it was me drawing from a mirror.

4,"I need some advice.

I'll make the story as short as possible. I work with 2 colleagues on my team. I'm a male 30ish married guy, and the two other colleagues are male (mr. L, mid 30s, married + kids) and female (ms. M, late 30s, married + kids). Because we work in the same office, we developed a nice friendship over the last 2y we've worked together, even though I'm very shy and introvert. Separately, ms. M and mr. L are the nicest, sweetest persons I've met. Ms M is so nice and sweet (**) that I've developed some kind of feelings towards her, but not the kind that would make me cheat on my wife or anything. (I love my wife).

Anyway, the thing is this. Ms. M often does something that you wouldn't think is bad but hear me out. If me, or mr. L do something for her (help her work related or something) she would compliment us in a way that would make the other kind of jealous. She's very vocal about how great one of us can be, and of course this happens interchangeably. Sometimes it's me who helped her and she would say how smart and intelligent I am, how I'm such a good boy etc etc (**) (kind of makes me feel uncomfortable because of mr. L being right there). Same thing when mr. L helps her. The problem is that it really makes me jealous when she does that to him (I try really hard to pretend I'm too busy with work) and I'm 80% sure mr. L feels the same way when she does that to me. I would prefer if ms. M wouldn't be so excited when sharing her compliments towards me or my friend. Just a normal thank you would be enough. This happens almost on a daily basis. Ugh.

This is the first half of the story.

Lately, I've been going through some personal issues with anxiety attacks. Mostly because of heavy workload, plus an MBA (full time) program I'm doing which is driving me crazy, very stressful, it's taking a toll on me really. Plus I'm kind of procrastinator so as the week goes by, the feeling of guilt, self hatred etc etc gets stronger because of me not working on my assignments (school) but I do great at work because I don't put that on hold unlike school assignments.

In addition to this, recently mr.L and ms.M found interest in this X activity (e.g. knitting) and they talk about that all the time. Because of my school assignments I've been using some work time to work on my homework, and that kind of excluded me from this activity, and now I feel completely excluded from them. It seems they want to talk about that all the time and it drives me crazy. I couldn't bear it anymore so I moved away to a different office desk so I could not hear them talking, with the excuse that I need some lone time to work on my school projects. This probably made everything worse. Now I can't even concentrate on my work or my school because I'm always thinking about them, are they talking right now, what are they saying, etc etc. Now because I'm in a different room I've excluded myself, I regret this so bad. And I feel like I can't come back to my original desk even though they have asked me when am I coming back.

To make it worse, if I want to go to the restroom or anywhere really I have to pass by the area where they sit (around my old desk). Every time I go to restroom or something they are always chatting and sitting together (aaagghhh) probably discussing about that knitting activity (haven't they got work to do?) And btw our boss is on annual leave so that's why they can do that all day it seems.

Today I came back from doing some errands and I see them sitting together again chatting about who knows what. (Btw I should mention that I'm kind of in charge until boss comes back). I felt so angry that they are not working but just chatting and having fun together, instead of doing work that I know they have. Anyway I was super angry but I kept my straight face and came closer and asked (nicely) to mr. L about progress on some task he was supposed to be working on. While he tried to make up some excuses, Ms.M quietly moved her chair back to her desk (so that confirms they were not doing anything work related) and in the end it made me feel bad because now I'm the bad/unfun guy (a.k.a the boss). This episode has been replaying in my mind all day since it happened. I can't focus on my work anymore.

Please keep in mind that I have very few friends, and from my work they are the closest ones. We often go out together and have a beer.

Look, I don't know what to do. It's affecting my life believe it or not. Let me ask you a couple of questions.

1. Regarding the first half of the story, how can I fix the issue with the ecstatic compliments from ms. M? Should I talk to her? I don't want to sound jealous, but I want her to understand that what she's doing can make others uncomfortable or unhappy (**).

2. Regarding the second half. Any advice? Is this just jealousy from my side? I mean, they really have work to do and I'm the one in charge for the time being. Also I don't want to be the ""boss"", like they would hear me coming and suddenly pretend to be working or something. At the end of the day they are my friends... I don't know what to do.

3. Should I try to integrate myself to them again? It terrifies me to be rejected so I'm really thinking of making my far away room my new permanent desk. But this is going to seriously affect my day to day work if I can't get over the fact of them having more time together... But if I come back to my old desk, they may just be silent all day because ""the boss"" is there with them... Which will make me go crazy if I ever feel that way.

PS: probably this is all a fabrication of my mind, because I'm very insecure person. They are very nice people. Today ms.M offered to bring me lunch (**) because I was ""working"" during lunch hour. Stuff like that still happens. Individually, ms.M and mr.L are very nice to me, but when they are together it kills me. 

PS 2. Because of my stress levels and the whole situation I booked a session with a psychologist. First time I ever do that. Not sure what to expect but also can't wait, I need to get this literal pain off my chest asap. 

Sorry for the long post. 

(**) I marked some parts of the post with this symbol. It's there to explain one of my theories about ms.M. I'm thinking maybe ms.M is just nice to everyone, maybe she just craves to have the attention of men or something. does this make sense?",06Nov2020,1

6,"Hey guys,

So ... yeah ... I fucked up and I have absolutely zero excuse. I don't think I'll go into detail here.

I've done what I could to repair my error, it's alright now.

The thing is I can't stop feeling so shitty, I know it's useless and I shouldn't pity myself especially after doing something wrong. I just want to have some advice to get better, be able to function and not let useless culpability prevent me from staying productive and doing what's right in the upcoming days.

What do/did you guys tell yourself when that kind of thing happens ? Do you have any advice ?",06Nov2020,2
7,"
Hey all, I don’t normally open up to random strangers but some of you all proved to me that there is still nice people in this world. I am not trying to throw a pity party or get attention by any means but life lately hasn’t been the easiest. Also another note I am in no way trying to sound selfish or brush other people’s problems off because I understand that some people have it worse than me.

But anyway back on the topic, I am not going to say my name or whoever is in this story’s name because of privacy reasons, but I am in a relationship. I have loved my gf for years and we NEVER fight. It is a healthy relationship and we have no issues at all. Even our political views differ but that doesn’t change us. 

Anyway, my gfs dad is very strict and borderline mentally abusive to my gf. And she always comes to me for assistance. Which of course I help her all the time. I am very polite to her parents because I feel that no matter who you are meeting you should always be nice and respectful. 

Anyway, for our first month dating we got to face time write letters to each other and stuff which is great I have no issues and I know that her dad was strict and thats totally fine. But through the months my girlfriend has been getting in trouble for the dumbest things. Like she got grounded for 3 weeks. Again I am a close person but never controlling so Its not uncommon for me to go a few weeks without talking to her. But due to the nature of how her dad is It stresses me because of how bad the environment is. 

You might wonder where her mom comes into play with this and she is absolutely great! I have no issues with her mom. Her mom thinks we should be able [I and my gf] to talk and face time a lot but do to her moral reasons i guess she believes that the male in the family holds all the power. If you believe in that I am not judging 
I just dont think its a good way to live. 

Anyway I am drawn between wondering whats gonna happen next, i always try to stay positive and it’s really hard sometimes. And I am at the ends of my rope. I really dont know what to do because Me and my girlfriend did nothing wrong, however, her dad is cutting between us and is making difficult. Its as if he is trying to cut and me out of her life and control her. (Keep in mind we are not little children)

And to those who say I need to toughen up, I totally get it but I am a dude who kind if goes by my emotions. 

Anyway, I hope whoever reads this has a great day, and I hope no matter what life throws at you I know you can get through it.",06Nov2020,1

10,"We've never been close. 
She believes I had a perfect upbringing, I believe all her years of drinking, smoking and neglect suggest otherwise. 

When my first son was born, I tried to heal the wounds and try to fill in that chip on my shoulder. 

It's been going well, but the last year things have declined greatly. 

She's been brainwashed by the right wing media, by social media and everything in-between. 

The woman that taught me not to look down on homeless people, would now proudly tell them that it's their fault and they shouldn't have wasted their life on drugs and drink. The irony of that.

The reason I ask, is my dad is ill, very ill. 
I haven't seen him since February due to Covid and there's a high chance he won't make it to the next.

11,"This is going to he a fairly lengthy post but if someone could please give me some advice or help point me in the right direction, that would be great.

I'm a 17yo guy who graduated high school at 16(Purely becuase I was just lucky). I am currently taking classes at the local community college to pursue a career in Cybersecurity and I also work at a fast food place making 12.50 an hour.

I feel like I'm not retaining the information I need in order to be ready for a career in Cybersecurity. I'm taking 4 classes, 2 are CIS courses and the others are some required for my degree, and they give a LOT of work and it's gotten to the point where I'm only trying to meet the deadline and get the grade.

I have a gf who is also a coworker, we haven't been together long at all but unfortunately, I feel like it's not going to last long. Not because I don't like her, I'm crazy about her. I don't think it will last long becuase of me. I'm pretty awkward socially, have a lot of insecurities. My gf has told me that I am boring sometimes. Sometimes, well, most of the time, my mind just goes blank when talking to people irl and I can't think of ANYTHING to say, and this happens with her. I don't fucking know why, she seems like someone I can actually be myself around but I can't get passed the barrier becuase I'm just not that interesting of a person. So yeah, I don't know how long she will deal with it. 

I keep getting these thoughts too of, ""Man I really like this girl, but we're both young, the chances of us really staying together are so damn low why even try?"" Those thoughts depress the hell out of me becuase like I said before, the longer I stay boring and not being able to come up with anything to say, the sooner it'll be over. 

I've been asking and asking and asking my mom to let me drive so I can finally get my license and start saving for a car, but I am pretty sure she just doesn't want me to drive. She told me that she needs to pay a 200$ deductible to add me to her insurance then a monthly fee. When I started working I told her I would pay that, but she won't let me. I asked my Dad about it and he told me that I shouldn't have to do that and that I should just be able to be added to the insurance. I don't know if my Mom has been lying to me this whole time or what but I really need to move out as soon as I can, but I don't know where I would go.

All of these probably sound like the typical teenage problems bs but i just feel like I'm in a constant state of worrying and i can't get a therapist or anything. I'm so insecure about myself and I just feel so damn pathetic awkward and sad. People always ask if I'm ok and tell me that I look sad even though I'm not. I can't think of anything I am really good at. I can't find a hobby to get into, I spend most of my days just working and sitting scrolling on my phone. 

I just don't know what to do, I WANT to be more outgoing, I WANT to be more fit(I'm a fairly skinny guy), I don't WANT to be boring or be looked at as sad and depressed anymore but there isn't really a lot I can do.",06Nov2020,1

There's another guy who started last spring (and has spent nearly all of his grad school experience dealing with weird stuff thanks to COVID and 2020 in general). I knew from the start that he was depressed, but he still came to hang out with us during our distanced social events and seemed to have a good time. A few weeks ago he sent the whole lab group a text saying his next two weeks would be really busy and he couldn't hang out, so we just kind of accepted that and didn't try to plan anything. Going on about 4 weeks later, he's been incredibly rude to all of us, just generally unpleasant, doesn't seem to do anything for a mental break, and the few times I have seen him in person he's really not doing well taking care of himself physically. Normally I'd mention this to our advisor, but I think a lot of his academic stress stems from our advisor and that would make things worse. My other lab mate said he went to therapy in the spring and it helped, but he's not doing that this semester and I am genuinely very concerned about his wellbeing. He's a really great guy, and this year has been rough on everyone, but it's effected him pretty significantly. As far as I know, he doesn't have any friends in town besides us (lab group).

TW: mentions of sexual abuse

To make a long story short, I was sexually abused by someone in my childhood. (Never got to court) I debated saying about it through my teen years but now I have realised why I didn't say anything until I was older.

My mother was the real person I was frightened off. I don't know how to put it other than this: my abuser was predictable, my mother was not (emotional outbursts were unhelpful too).

I honestly believe that, for whatever reason, she started resenting me as I got older. Perhaps because I resemble my dad? Who knows. I have wondered if my coming out to the police gave her the perfect excuse to get rid of me. 

So now, the problem I face is that it feels like I have this black pit of hatred burned into my heart and mind. How do I fill the hole? I will never forgive her but I need closure.

29,"I've been at this for a while but seem to be not understand something about how to fundementally change as a person. Despite how much I try, I still go back to the same habits that I can't seem to shake off. Let me explain...

As a kid, I was really into punk music and hanging out in basements. I developed a taste for extreme metal, and eventually became a massive stoner. I sank countless hours listening to drug related records and acting like a total dipstick. I started dressing in black most of the time and wearing extreme metal shirts. As I age, I find that I like this type of thing less and less, but I feel stuck in my ways and unable to branch out.  


Even though I am mostly alone, I find myself going back to the same records, dressing in the same ways and feeding into the same self-destructive bad habits, like occasional binge drinking and cigarette smoking, and this is after years of quitting. It's like I don't know how to form relationships with ""normal people"" because I've spent over a decade indoctrinated into a toxic subculture. I feel like a member of a cult who woke up and realized it's all bullshit. I get angry at people over small stuff.  


I just want to leave the dark image of myself behind as some kind of intense bad boy and instead embrace a lighthearted approach. I want to stop listening to metal music and stop being edgy, but I just can't seem to shake this part of me that I know is a bad influence on my behavior. It's keeping me from happiness and keeping me to succeed. It's feeding the angry part of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately whenever I find myself listening to old hardcore punk albums I make a conscious note of it and try to listen to something light hearted right afterwords, like anime music or something. I feel like I'm not being genuine unless I'm into something dark and scary. If I'm scrolling through podcasts, I feel undrawn towards anything except for horror podcasts. I only really want to read horror novels. I always go back to heavy music when I'm in a bad mood.  


Does anyone have experience just leaving an old self behind and becoming a completely different person? How did you do it? I don't want to be one of these tough guys you see on the street that have to prove how tough they are because they listen to slayer or something.  


How do I find a direction and a new style when I'm habitually drawn to this instead?",06Nov2020,1
30,"I’m so confused and kind of hurt. There were no disagreements and we both mutually seemed happy with the arrangement. We already had sex once, and he was only my second partner. He was always a bit more sexual than I was, but I genuinely liked talking to him. It wasn’t all about sex, we talked about life and school. He texted me yesterday asking what time he could come over and we both agreed on an hour. When I checked my phone after 30 mins, I noticed that I was blocked. So I reached out to him on where we met (Tinder,) and he quickly unmatched me after I asked what’s going on. I texted his phone number but he’s not answering, so now I just feel used and stupid, and I feel like this whole thing is my fault. I should have known better, I can’t tell if maybe he thought I was getting too attached to him or what. But I wish he would have told me, instead of just the block and ghost because I would appreciate closure. Reddit, what do I do from here??? And what do you think happened?",06Nov2020,1

32,"Hey guys! I \[23F\] have a bit of a dilemma.

Due to COVID19, I have been out of a job since March. Before everything, I was a music therapist and RBT who worked in a school setting. And since the schools were the first things to close... yeah, there's that.

Because of all that, in September, I took a job as a nanny. It's my ""hold you over"" job until the schools open full-time and without fear of re-closing due to cases rising. I could technically go back to being an RBT since the job is still available but, again, I'm super wary of the unsteadiness with schools. 

I emailed my boss a few weeks ago (she knows I'm nannying in the meantime) to ask about how long I had to go back to work. She said I had until February 1st, 2021 to return to the school setting before my contract would be terminated. This to me seems fair and I started making plans for my return.

However, when I went to talk to my family about this, they surprised me with an offer I couldn't refuse: a three month, paid, move to Bonaire in the Caribbean. The family I work for is tired of the cold and both work from home. Because they work from home, they can easily pick up and work somewhere else. The family decided they wanted to try an island in the Caribbean and asked me to go with them as they would still need nannying services. We would leave in January and be back at the end of March. 

In my heart, I feel as though I can't refuse this offer; however, I would have to quit my RBT. Moreover, I'm currently in grad school to further my work as an RBT and I need a specific number of hours after my graduate degree to sit for the higher credential (approximately 2000 hours). If I took the nannying job, I would be even more behind in my hours and thus further behind in my future career. COVID19 has already significantly derailed my future so I need all the hours I can get. In the same breath,though, COVID19 has already significantly derailed my future... so what's two or three months more?

Also, and because this is important, RBT jobs are in high demand. If I left for Bonaire for three months, I'd more than likely be able to find a new job with a new company within the month. I'd also be taking a significant pay-cut from what I'm making now (probably $2500/month to $1200/month). I'd live with the family as well.",06Nov2020,2
33,"This girl I know was an escort and she loved doing it and made good money. She met this guy through her escort ad, she liked him but she wasn’t ready to give up escorting just yet plus she was pretty busy trying to balance 2 lives. A year later she was starting to get tired of escorting and the guy had never quit trying to get her to hang out with him. She finally decided to spend some time with them. They clicked right away and they got close quickly and things were seemingly perfect. She quit escorting to be with him and they decided to go on a trip together. They both had a “habit” they wanted to break and they figured being away from home would limit their access to this “habit”. The withdrawals from that habit made him very grumpy and mean sometimes. As they were about to board their first plane she saw the first signs of this. She remained sweet and understanding and even though he was being snappy, she didn’t snap back. Their first stop was spending 3 days in Seattle. He treated her pretty unfairly while in Seattle. He would tell her to shut up and to leave him alone. She had a rough past and was sensitive to this because of it. When he acted this way she would respond by getting sheepish and when he saw this he got even more angry saying things like “quit acting like a battered housewife”. This girl tried to keep it inside in front of him and others. She found herself frequently finding bathrooms to cry in. Then the went to Alaska things got a little better but his mean behavior would still happen just not as often. She remained loving but had begun to start feeling that it was more than withdrawals making him act like this. One morning she packed her stuff, left the guy and went to a friends house. He was devastated and he apologized and talked her into coming back. She did and things were a lot better at first but there were still red flags. For example if she didn’t want to have sex, he would get upset and make comments that made her feel guilty. Also they had trouble communicating. He frequently interrupted her, and he would cut her off to try and finish her sentences but when he did it was wrong. She bottled most of it up and she began getting depressed. Once they got back home they picked the habit back up and her depression got worse. She was resentful and angry about the way she had been treated and it still happened at times. He got to the point where he was sweet most of the time and he did a lot for her. He made sure bills were paid and got her what she needed. He provided most of the income. The only problem was when they argued it would get really bad. She had given up on the relationship for a while. She tried to end it but he made it hard and she kept caving in. Her resentment caused her to become bitchy and snappy at times. She would get distant and reject his efforts to be intimate with her. He was on her computer one day and she asked to use it. He said “yeah in a minute”. He often would say he’s gonna do something but not get to it for hours because he would be stuck on the computer so she calmly said “I know you get lost in the computer sometimes and I just wanted to know if you could try to not make that the case this time because I’m trying to do a job application. He responded by saying “fuck you” she felt disrespected and got upset and he told her he wasn’t trying to disrespect her but she was tired of it. She kept telling him it was over despite his pleas, then his pleas turned to insults and then back to pleas and so on. She left to stay with her aunt for the night. The next day she came back to see if he was done packing and he kept begging her. She kept saying no. She told him maybe if they could be friends a while and if she could see his behavior change she might reconsider later. She left again to get away from him. When she woke up the next morning she had a ton of texts from him. He had found one of her oldest ads online and assumed she was working. Also someone had posted in a forum and it sounded a lot like her. He told her to kill herself and called her all kinds of terrible names. He said I hope they find you in a dumpster, called her a sack of shit and much more. She showed him evidence that it wasn’t her who had made the post. He started apologizing but she feels the relationship should be over. It’s too dysfunctional and even though their love is really intense, the fights can be more intense. He keeps apologizing and begging for her to forgive him but she doesn’t feel ready to to that and she definitely doesn’t think they should be together. Do you think the relationship should be over? What’s your opinion on the whole situation?",06Nov2020,1
34,"To keep it vague, my best friend's father is really sick and we're having doubts on whether he'll make it. Another close friend is feeling a lot of similar depressed and hopeless feelings, and is having doubts on her long distance relationship. My boyfriend had been having doubts on his situations with his life but recently got hired for a job which he's really happy about (and I want him to keep being happy when he feels it). And my step-grandma (who I consider my family) is also really sick and we're having doubts on whether she'll make it. Not only that, I've been having issues in my own home.

I haven't been feeling my best for the past three months. I've been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for almost a year and I've been having to switch because they either haven't been effective or they give me a lot of side effects. A couple of days ago I just switched meds again so my body's still processing it, which I understand. But I've been feeling basically suicidal for about a week while changing my meds. I feel like my feelings aren't valid in my situation because my best friend is going through the worst right now. I can't tell her how I'm feeling because she's going through a lot and she won't tell me anything that's going on, I have to end up finding it out myself. I want to visit her and see her but I feel like I'd just make her feel worse with how I've been feeling. I don't know if I should visit at all. My boyfriend is also close to my friends and he knows what's been happening to them and he's trying to help as best as he can. I feel like my feelings wear him out and are going to wear him out with everything happening.

I want to soak up everyone's pain but I don't have the energy or don't know what to do. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling so down when my best friend and everyone else are having it worse. I kinda feel like I should go away for a few days to see if I can help myself so no one would feel burdened with my stuff along with theirs but I know they need me to be there. Like actually be there.

What should I do? I can't split myself into fours, much less just ignore what I've been feeling any longer. I want to disappear and wish everyone didn't know me from a start so they don't have to deal with me but I know its not possible and I'd hate to cause anymore pain to them or make it seem like ""I feel worse than anybody else so you should pay attention to me"" you know? So what do I do?",06Nov2020,1
35,"Background- veteran, Sr in college, attending grad school next fall.   


So, I have been talking to my best friend since we were about 12. She lives in Arizona, I live in the midwest and I have always loved her. We're great friends, understanding of each other and push each other to better our lives. We are both attracted to each other but she has made it clear that she does not do long distance relationships. I'm looking to attend grad school (only a masters) in Illinois because of my GI benefits. I'll have two degree and zero debt. The problem is that I'm 28, I would like to settle down at some point and I want to be with her in Arizona. I have dated different girls over the years and I always think about her and the good times we have with each other when I visit Arizona (about once a year). I have a couple of different options but financially, I think it's best if I stay in the midwest so I can have zero debt.   


Option 1- Arizona and pursue a graduate school about 1.5 hours away from her but possibly have debt. With this option, we can at least see if things would happen between us with me being in close proximity to her.   


Option 2- stay in the midwest and pursue my masters in public administration from a state university and have no debt but push everything back in my life for about two years.   


I have been weighing the pros and cons of this for some months now and in December I will be sending off applications. My bachelors degree will be in political science and I'm not too overly concerned about the job market. We're both in a time in our lives where we're restructuring things, she's finishing up her degree in engineering (paying out of pocket so been going part-time forever). I just worry that if I don't take this opportunity to attend the college out there in Arizona that I will miss out. Also, I can move out there after my grad program but I just don't understand anything about the job market because I have spent most of my adult life in college or the military.

I am a very impulsive guy and I got really angry, and I wrote him a text saying that I needed to know if I met a positive person, because I met also my friends and don't want to put them into danger. And then I called him dickless, so afraid of a damn swab to put his own family at risk. Dickless. To my father.

I feel really horrible now, because he's my dad and I love him and he loves me, but damn I got really angry and just had to say what I thought.

The thing is, my mom wathes a lot of anime and quality shows and I have some mad respect for her. And that hurt me. I am embarrased to watch what I like right now. I can't even talk about it.

But when *she* talks about things she likes, such as castlevania, she doesn't have a single day not praising it. You know what? I don't really like castlevania. It's just not my cup of tea. But I act like a human being and don't talk shit about it in front of her. I don't want to make her feel sad. But she doesn't do the same for me- she has 0 respect for me.

I don't know what to do. I can't even talk about things I know about, things I have researched. I seem to be afraid to talk or do something in front of my parents, and I really don't know what to do.

40,"So I work for a warehousing distribution chain and I'm currently employed in quality control.  I get to work M-F, 8 hour days (as opposed to everyone else's 10 hour days from Sun-Wed or Wed-Sat, so I get my weekends).  I get to work by myself and collect data and suggest improvements and make processes better and I really like it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I also really like the idea of working in HR, as well as working from home.  So I took an opportunity to work for a temporary, seasonal position that allows me to work from home through December and possibly some of January.  Potentially, this could become a permanent position, but experience and my cynicism tell me it's not going to work out that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, normally when someone takes a seasonal position they are backfilled with another seasonal position.  That way when the seasonal comes back, they have their spot they can refill and take over their role again.  This isn't a standard, it's simply how I've known it to be.  Now, I knew that it may not turn out that way, but I'm close to my boss and knew that he would make every effort he could to try and get that to work that way.  Unfortunately, it didn't, but not at all to the fault of him.  He's great.  So I've been trying to make peace with the fact that my job security isn't really there anymore, and I'm taking a risk in having taken this position, and could possibly come back and get stuck with working Wed-Sat, 10 hour night shifts, which would absolutely crush me and my entire personal life.  I've worked nights before.  I can't.  It just destroys me mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

So now here I am freaking out because in three weeks I'm going to take on a role that lets me sit on my ass for at least a month and at most maybe a month and a half and I'm freaking out that I've completely ruined my life by giving up control over it and that there is nothing I'm going to be able to do and that it's going to kill me and I'm so scared that I've absolutely ruined everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea if this is the right place to go to.  I'm probably just venting and picked the wrong sub to do it in. So, sorry for that if that's the case.  I just don't know what to do and my entire energy is going to worrying about this and everything could be ruined just because I wanted to try and branch out and pursue other roles.

When we first dating, he told me he took a lot of Xanax. I kind of just accepted it because I didn't know much about it.

Then we would argue when he was on them, and he would start punching the walls and banging doors, which scared me. This happened on two occasions. He told me it was 'xanny rage'. 

I researched Xanax and realised how bad they were. My boyfriend would take 2-3 a day and blame them for his memory or anxiety. I know I couldn't control what he did when he wasn't with me, but I asked him to not take any while he was in my company, unless I was taking one too (I only take half, and I take it VERY occasionally when I struggle to sleep) . And that if he did, to just tell me.

Anyway, cut a long story short, I found out my boyfriend took one last night. Whatever, I dropped it. This morning, I realised one of mine had gone. So he had woke up and just taken another one without saying anything, when we both had just been chilling. When I confronted him, he denied it and was laughing (maybe nervous, maybe just a d\*ck.) He did admit it in the end but probably only because it was blatantly true. I have a inkling that he's been taking them behind my back and I just haven't noticed because I trusted him. 

I don't think I asked too much, I was fine with him taking them with his friends. It just puts me off that hasn't respected my boundaries and now I don't appreciate the slyness and doing it behind my back which is throwing up concerns. I guess I just don't understand his desire for taking something which ruins him and potentially is ruining his relationship. I've had my experiences with drugs but once I feel them affecting me, I kind of just stop.

53,"there’s no easy way to explain this. so i’m going to start at the beginning and go through this in list form:
- we become friends
- she is depressed and suicidal, i become her main support while i am also suicidal with an eating disorder, and dealing with hers and my mental health at once (though she doesn’t know i’m suicidal). she makes fun of my crushes, interests, mannerisms, looks, etc., is passive aggressive, expects more attention than i can give her at school; i bottle up my anger because i feel guilty because she is depressed 
- years later she apologizes and i genuinely accept it
-as time goes on she falls back into her passive aggressiveness and expects more attention than i want to give her
- she finally has a therapist so i start to distance myself knowing that her chances of suicide are lower, and she is falling back into passive aggressive behaviour and i am too
- she gets mad at me and tells me we’re going to “hangout” but she “isn’t going to be nice”, and vents to all her friends about how i’m ghosting her and not giving her energy
- her friends start cutting ties with me too

i have two options: lie and spare her feelings, or tell her the truth: i never wanted to stay friends with her in the first place, she relies solely on my attention for her mental health and feels like a huge burden, i haven’t fully forgiven her and let go of the past, and the only reason i have stayed with her for so long is to stop her from killing herself.

i would have told her earlier, i swear. but she was even more suicidal back then and if i told her that, she would’ve harmed herself.

her point of view is this: she is depressed and suicidal, she doesn’t know that i am too, she tries not to rely on me but still does, she acts horribly towards me and gets no repercussions, she apologizes for her bad behaviour, i accept it, then seemingly out of nowhere i’m lying to her and start distancing myself. 

so, yeah. i have no idea what to do.",06Nov2020,2
54,"I was in a relationship for 8+ years with kids married?I thought we were but papers didnt get turned in.
During covid I had a mental breakdown and I said something I should have not said because I didnt mean it.
I want to be with him still but I dont know what he wants other then to be my friend and co parent  our kids.
I pointed out several times that I dont want a friendship because I want a relationship and if he were to find a new gf then I would be heart broken.
He comes over to where I live and if I'm on the bed he will lay on my and talk to me (that hurts because he doesn't want to come home to me) and he finds that to be normal. I've told him hes casing false hope for me and the kids because they see it as us getting back together.
If I say anything about our relationship I get ""well what did you say/do?"" 
I apologized,  but he won't get over it.Then continues to hug all over me and be playful pretty much the things he should have been doing when we tried to make things work again.

We never really had fights and if we did it was forgotten about or well till this break up happened.

Why would you treat your ex like your together?
Why would you want to hang out with them?

Idk what to say anymore.",06Nov2020,1
55,So my crush asked for a break and I understand why. So I let him go. And while I’m grieving in my own sadness and love for him. I did some thinking. I thought and made a list of all the bad things he did to me and in general. Then I remembered he used to text my bsf and she showed me he sent her hearts. I did  think much but he was doing that with her while speaking to me and flirting with me. My bad and I broke up being friends 8 months ago so we don’t speak. But I did reach out to her once and now today I asked her about when my crush sent her heart emojis...she was confused cuz I asked her about it so randomly. I was basically asking what was going on. I said I’m asking this cuz I can’t stop thinking of all the girls he texted and I wanted to know what and why he was texting her hearts. She stated she knows I liked him a lot. But she wouldn’t answer my question. I don’t wanna accuse her of being suspicious cuz she won’t answer my question but she’s like acting dumb almost. I’m asking easy questions but she’s changing them up and acting confused. She will not answer it for some reason. Like she doesn’t wanna hurt me. I won’t be surprised if they had something while he was speaking to me but she KNOWS I had a huge crush on him so I will feel betrayed if she says they had sum going on,06Nov2020,1

61,"Hello, sorry in advance for bad spelling.

I dont know where to start... 
About a few hours ago from making this post, in a  Discord server with people i know from real life i sent a ""quote"" in a channel for quotes. The only rules AT THE TIME for that channel were that it had to be a quote. Then, after a while i realised that i was muted in that channel; like any other normal person i asked in the general chat: ""Why was i muted in #channel-name"". 

Basically at the time it was an unfair mute until the person (the person is the person i want to apologize to but dont know how/should i) said why he muted me. I suspected it was the person in question as he said it must have been an error in the system without unmuting me, again, i asked for an unmute; no response (staying quiet usually means hiding something in this context). 

He then claimed and kept claiming that the quotes had to be funny/interesting (to which ill refer to as ""Good"" quotes) in some sort of way which was never before said in that server. Basically he started a revolution - decided to make a poll and asked if people agree that quotes should be funny/interesting in some sort of a way. 

Most people voted ""yes"". Then after that the owner who previously voted ""no"" made it an official rule. After that we kept arguing for sone time. Its important to note that i was a little too defensive and agreesive as my unfair mute stoll wasnt removed.

Anyways, we kept arguing and eventually he said he muted me because at the time of me sending it, he got the notification while doing homework and expected something good, which he didnt get (i agree, my quote wasnt funny because AT THE GOD DAMN TIME IT WASNT A STUPID, OFFICIAL RULE) - which led to me getting muted. I told him he should have just asked me to stop if he was doing something important - he assumed the worst and told me i wouldnt have stopped even if he told me to - called me names which leads to the present; should i apologize to the person in question for being too agreesive?

I want to but i dont know what to say, ""Hey im sorry for sending a quote that wasnt good at the time when there wasnt a rule for them to be good and being too defensive and agreesive because i got an unfair mute at the time"" 

And to the person if you are reading this, might aswell put it out here - im sorry for doing something that bothered you, if you asked me to stop i would. 

TL;DR: Got in an argument with someone I know in real life because of an unfair mute in a Discord channel because it bothered the person, while he never wanted to tell me to stop. Should i apologize? And what should i say in the apology?",06Nov2020,0
62,"I know this is dumb and I should be able to figure it out on my own, but I feel a bit lost.

Also this is about relearning to enjoy reading in my own time NOT assigned reading.

How do I get back my interest in reading?  I can't remember what I like,  I kinda think it may be school, and being forced to read things I'm not interested in has kinda made me lost on what/wanting to read on my own time.  Because I did notice how when I was in a school that didn't do book reports on 1 specific book and allowed us to choose, I enjoyed them a lot more back then.  In my current school we're assigned books and they're always a bit boring.  Just not my thing.  I think it kinda made me lose track of development of my own desires and interests in reading.  And I don't know where to find them again.

Some things I do like, Kingdom hearts, moe (i think)/some adventure anime. horror is cool too, though I dont usually read horror.

I can find shows and games, but not books for some reason. I want to read again though.  Especially because my dream job (Animation director/having my own animation company) involves story telling, and I swear this is affecting my creativity and writing skills.  I have difficulty describing things now a days too.

I told him I don’t ever watch porn (been years that I haven’t) and that I always think of us in the midst of it.

64,"Apparently this happened a couple of weeks ago. This is the going to be a long story: 

I (24F) met him (28M) last year in March. I wasn’t sure about him at first but we spent like three months just texting and chatting before meeting in person. We met on Tinder. So we started to date in June and on August he asked me to be hi girlfriend and I said yes. I was very happy since this was my first relationship ever, and I really liked him.

So later in September, out of nowhere, he ghosted me. For a week. And then I kept contacting him until he broke up with me through a text message. He said that he was just too busy and that he wasn’t interested in a relationship. Also he was fired from his job like a week before this happened. 

I was having a bad feeling anyways because he never shared with anyone that we were dating and he never introduced me to his friends, etc, while he knew a couple of my friends and a family member. Not even his mom knew that he had a girlfriend. 

Anyways, a month after the break up I went back on Tinder trying to find a “rewound” (I know this is not the brightest thing to do, I’m sorry) because I was feeling very bad. I really liked him and was starting to have feelings for him. Then I saw him again on Tinder and I swiped right to see if he did too. Indeed he did. So he asked me to talk about what happened.

He said that he was feeling bad, that he did have feelings for me but that he wasn’t sure about us, that he didn’t feel like I was girlfriend material since our lives were so different, etc. Then he asked to met in person to talk about it and we did. It was really awkward. I was so uncomfortable and he just seemed very chill. I asked him to not speak to me again after that.

Two weeks after, he says that he doesn’t want to go NC and that he wants to try again but taking things slowly. I agreed with a condition and it was for him to do therapy. I even found him a therapist. So the therapist diagnosed him with severe anxiety and depression. And he had some other issues too, like pretty unstable emotional states, fear of intimacy, hypochondria, etc.

Our sex life was pretty terrible and he never seemed like he cared about fixing it. And one of my conditions for being together again was to talk in therapy about this, but he didn’t care. He stopped therapy like a month or two after he started.

So on February this year, he started having some panick attacks and mood swings and every time he did, he called me. During my classes, during work, during the night, during lunch. It was exhausting. He said that he wanted to kill himself, that he felt like a failure, that he was so sad, etc. I tried to calm him every time, but I was feeling exhausted.

And his mood swing were pretty odd too. For example, during some of our conversations he started to do sexting (which I don’t like) and asking for nudes and when I refused he just was mean to me. This happened a lot and I was starting to think about leaving him. 

So, one day on LinkedIn, I see that he never got fired from his job when we broke up in the first place. So he lied. I was really tired of his mood swings, exhausting behaviors, manipulation and lies. And then I proceed to block him everywhere. But, really everywhere. 

Then, a month after that, he reached out again through another phone and said that he wanted to be friends because he cared about me. That he knew I was exhausting of him but that he wanted to make things right. I explained every reason of why I didn’t want him to contact me and that was it. Then he sent a FB friend request a month later which I rejected and never hear from him again. This was last June. 

Now, I was just on Instagram and I saw that his profile was suggested. He never was too active on Instagram so I didn’t feel the need of blocking him there. I was curious so I went through his profile and saw a photo with some “RIP” comments on it. A comment said that apparently he took his own life but there wasn’t any more details about it.

I felt like paralyzed when I read that. Like I did something bad and then I cried and cried.

This is so weird because I feel so guilty for some reason. Like, I knew that he was having serious mental health issues. I did try to help him, but maybe it wasn’t enough? I don’t know any of his family members or friends, so I really don’t have anyone to talk about this. I just don’t know how to do. I feel very sad.

Thanks if you read this whole thing, I just wanted to share it with someone.",06Nov2020,1
65," This summer I moved into an apartment with my two best friends and one close friend of mine. We all attend the same University and have known each other since Freshman year (we are Juniors now). 

With only 11 days until the school year started, I had already moved into the apartment and tested positive for COVID-19. None of my roommates had really moved in yet and they were all staying at home. I informed that I would be quarantined in the apartment and that they should avoid moving in. I was also quarantining with my boyfriend at my apartment because we had spent most nights together leading up to my positive test.  

My roommates asked me to vacate the apartment and go back home to a different state. I originally told them that my boyfriend and I would leave in six days so that both of us could get two more COVID tests done and get the results. 

My roommate collectively told me that I was to leave by the next day so that they could move into the apartment early for the school year.  I replied by saying that we would leave in two days. They were uncompromising and forced us out the next day. We ended up testing negative on all subsequent tests (we got tested 4 more times total) meaning that my positive test was a false positive.  

After this whole situation was over, I talked to my roommates and told them that I did not appreciate them kicking me out with no time to prepare and especially since none of them were living in the apartment at the time. My roommates apologized but one of my best friends apologies came across as very insincere saying ""I'm sorry YOU feel that way"".  I later address this insincere apology with them but she refused to apologize for kicking me out saying ""I'm not going to apologize because that's what I felt was right at the moment"". 

This has caused a divide between my roommates and me. As of recently, they asked me to not live with them next year because of the tension this situation has created. I was the one who found this apartment and even bargained for a lower rent.

Should I just move on and not expect an apology? What should I do to resolve this tension with my roommates?",06Nov2020,1

68,About a year ago I was at my family’s annual Christmas party and there was around 35 people there so it was pretty easy to blend in. (For reference I’m 15 now around 14 at the time) I was playing with my baby cousins in the living room and most people were outside. My baby cousins all had to go eat dinner so I was left basically alone in the living room besides a few other random people. I saw my uncle coming over (I didn’t think anything of it at the time because he hadn’t done anything odd before this) he sat next to me very close. I was picking up a weird vibe but I just ignored it. He started talking to me and while he was talking he would stroke my arm in an oddly flirtatious way. As we kept talking he touched my hair and continuously stroked my arm and grabbed onto it. He seemed a little buzzed. I was really weirded out so I left pretty quick. The rest of the night I tried to avoid him and was left really confused as to why he was doing that and if it was normal. It’s been a year sense that and I haven’t told anyone. Is that odd or do you think it was normal. I see him like once every three months and every time I see him I get a weird vibe and he always asks “where’s my hug?” I’m seeing him again tonight and I wanna know what I should do and if anyone thinks it’s weird.,06Nov2020,1

I don't!!!) 

your expected to dress up and put on a fake smile while your family insults you and you have to listen to their snotty bratty kids scream and cry over getting them the wrong gift and mulled wine is expensive af to make and I don't even like wine oh and the gifts !!

86,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old college student. This will be hard to explain, but I'm struggling to find a place. I don't mean a clique or fad, I mean that I can't seem to be a functional member of society.

1.) I have a mother who refuses to believe anything I say or stay silent. There is not a single day that goes by where I don't feel complete apathy towards her and my family. I have attached myself to trying to annoy her as much as possible just to get her to do anything for me beyond giving me money \[which doesn't really work anymore\]. That's all she'll do unless she believes in what I'm doing. If I attempt to explain anything to her, I either can't gather all my points, or more likely, she won't believe a word I say and blame me for the problem once again. Then if she becomes distraught \[which is essentially the only time she'll listen to me beyond the times I throw something in the house\] she'll just blame me more and tell me to go to counselling acting like counselling is some sort of magic pill that will make all the problems go away instantly. If I tell my full story, I can openly attach most of my problems today to her, how she raised me, and the situation she put me in. I have almost zero love for her, and, honestly, I wish to stab her along with my family just to see them suffer. My mother is the main bread winner in a house of six, and she has openly attempted to control the house from when I was a very young age.  


In that regard, my entire family treats me like an idiot. None of them including my younger sisters pay any lick of attention to me. My father treats me like I'm five years old and likes to act like he's taught me everything when in reality the most I remember of him is going home to drink and watch sitcoms all day while I play on my mother's computer. Both of my parents are lazy as shit and refuse to take any responsibility - it always has been that way. Then when I confront them, as usual, they'll blame me in every capacity. My mother openly does care for me, however, considering she won't listen to me, I keep her as far away from what I'm doing as possible. Otherwise, she'd get in the way while attempting to help, then blame me when she does literally everything I've already done saying I haven't done it then quit.

Also, I have attempted to smack and harm them before to get my point across. It never works, and the next day they just go back to doing the same thing with me being threatened by my father.

2.) I have constrained myself to my room. I don't do anything. I don't talk to anyone physical. All my friends are online and typically miles away from where I am. All my classes are online. I don't want to leave the house - then I'd have to explain it to my mother. I don't want to try and meet people again. I hate this nation, its people, and its culture. Whenever I meet someone, online or in the flesh, it's just another day where I have to act like I want to do everything everyone else wants to - otherwise I'm treated like shit or ignored. This is beyond the fact I can't really explain things to most people - sometimes I believe I'm selectively mute or something, but I don't know anymore. People activate my anxiety, being in a classroom creates depression in me after just a few days, and if anyone says anything out of the ordinary to me, I am pressured to the point of breaking down over it in a month.

3.) I have attempted to work from home for about a year now. My parents have thought I just dick around. I have bounced from many things. Typically I just ended up in an online market with no qualifications. I have attempted writing, but I have nothing to write about except stories which is overly inundated with competition. I don't have enough qualifications for any other form of writing except for podcast content where there's no common integrity and student papers which most markets don't allow. This is beyond the fact most companies don't consider this ""experience"" either, and my parents would never consider this work - in fact, they think I'm just making excuses.

I attempted to be an online musician for a while. This is what I originally wanted to do with my life for oddly specific reasons that I won't get into. Again, I ended up in a marketplace with nothing, then a few months later I just started uploading random tracks. Despite the fact at that point I was randomly mashing stuff together because I had long stopped caring about what I made, I found that I couldn't really produce content fast enough to make anything in the next year.

I would love to get into authorship, but really, there's no way to get book publishing around my parents. I don't want to hear them talk about my work, and I don't want to deal with them anymore.

There were quite a few more odd jobs. I've seen assistant jobs, research jobs, and other odd online things. Nothing seems to work out, and most of the time it dwindles down to me just not having qualifications. Anything with a resume is almost an immediate failure as there's nothing on the resume. Why is there nothing on that resume? Because when I was in High School, my mother didn't want me to work. She openly has said she does not want her children working like she did when she was poor. 

 4.) High School was hell in its own regard. That's a whole complication that I feel doesn't really need explaining. The results of it is all that matters. I graduated, but I graduated with grades lower than what a community college allows \[partially my fault, but it's not worth explaining the full story\]. So, I essentially went into a GED class, passed English with flying colors and withdrew from mathematics - I didn't really understand how the class worked, so, despite knowing most of what was in that class already, I wouldn't have passed. Now I have decided to take the mathematics test - I didn't the first time because I was ultimately misinformed on how the requirements worked. However, I tried to take the test last year, but my mother wouldn't listen - then she blamed me when I blamed her. Now I absolutely need to take the test right now to stay within my plans, but trying to talk to my mother gets me no where, and I don't even know if the test is open due to Covid.

5.) I have looked in the past few months for a real job, starting with something like an administrative assistant or receptionist. I have applied to almost 100 jobs with no result. The only job I got close to having was with the police department as a telecommuter - I failed a portion of a test with five questions, that means I didn't get the job. Looking at warehouses, pawnshops and retail now, but I'm not even sure I can work retail or pawnshops without breaking down within the first week. Why don't I go to the warehouse? Simply put, it's because of the same thing.

5.) I have increasingly grown erratic because I can't take it anymore. I have throw cats, stuffed them in trash bins, kicked cats, and kicked puppies all within the last month. I almost strangled one to fucking death taking my rage out on it. I have continually had a stronger urge to commit acts of violence against everyone in this house and or myself with my father's rifle. I am sick of this. What the hell do I do anymore?",06Nov2020,1
87,"I’ve reached the final stage interviews for a new role, as my current role is a fixed term maternity contract. In the previous interview, they asked to give me an example of something and I panicked and stretched the truth on a small situation to make it seem bigger. I was also asked about videography and I implied I created something when it was actually done by the whole team. 

I know it’s bad and I shouldn’t have done it, I just completely panicked in the interview as I really need a new job within the next month. I’m now beyond anxious and feel physically sick over the upcoming final interview in case I get the role, they check references and ask about the situation/video and find out I stretched the truth. 

What do I do?! Cancel the interview and pull out of the application? Hope it doesn’t come up in the references if I do get the job?! Please advise, I’m in a complete and utter panic.

88,"This is gonna sound so lame. Basically the title. My boyfriend and his friends are really “cool”. Same with his siblings. Idk how to explain it more than it’s just a little intimidating. 

My bf and I have a GREAT relationship, I feel sincerely comfortable in my own skin around him. He’s very kind and easy to get along with. 

His friends and siblings are SUPER nice too, I just find myself kind of closing up around them. I get anxiety about talking almost at all. Sometimes when there is a big group of people around I hope I can just kind of shy away in the corner and no one will talk to me, but sometimes that makes it more awkward.

91,"My (17F) boyfriend (18M) lived with his mom up until two hours ago. His parents are divorced but they still co-parent, and he's staying with his dad for the moment. 

Ever since I met him (it's going to be around 2 years at this point) I knew that he lived with very angry people. His mom, being the primary caretaker, is not the best mom around, to say the least. She drinks a lot and is very explosive. She is verbally abusive. His dad, from what I've heard, isn't all that much better to be quite honest, but at least he doesn't seem to be as damaging as his mom. They got in a fight today and she basically kicked him out of the house. He's currently staying at his dad's, which luckily is near me. 

I know he struggles with emotions a lot, specifically with anger and sadness. Living in an angry home for so many years is bound to mess someone up, and I know he struggling with letting people help him. He's very adamant of being strong, and I'm trying to help him learn how to deal with his emotions in a less harmful way. 

How do I deal with this? How do I help him? I know he has friends but I want to be able to support him adequately. I have struggled with my own demons in the past but I'm still not sure how I should approach this. I don't know what to say or what to do, and being a minor means that I don't have many options. I'm not too sure I can help legally but how can I be a support system for him? What do I say and what do I not say?

93,"For reference, I’m in grade 12, we’ve been best friends for 3 years.

Lately I’ve really started to notice how big his ego is. For example, he thinks he’s extremely attractive, he is better than everyone else because nobody does things HIS way, and in conflicts he would never admit he is causing the problem (it’s always other people’s fault, etc)

When we hang out, I really feel like he thinks lower of me because I’m not, for lack of a better term, on his level. Anything I do annoys him because he would’ve done it a different way, automatically discrediting my decision making. 

Basically, he’s turned into a huge narcissist.  think he’s always been one because he was a spoiled only child, but it’s really starting to show now. 

My question is, how should I approach this issue? Should I confront him about it, knowing that it could very well end our friendship? The other option would be to let it run its course until I go to college next summer, at which point the friendship would fizzle out.

“hi sorakarina1,

i wanted to connect with you regarding your new schedule. as you recall, when mark (her boss, director of ops) and I spoke with you regarding your position, we discussed having you work weekends. At that time you told us weekends were not a problem for you.

now that you have a new manager to cover M-F, we will have you begin working weekends effective 11/23. your schedule will be friday through tuesday.

please confirm that you are prepared to transition to the weekend role.”

without going on too long of a rant, I hate this company and everyday I hope I’m fired. I genuinely do not recall ever mentioning to them that I’m okay with working weekends. I certainly have nothing in writing regarding it.

How do I professionally respond and let her know that I don’t recall what she’s claiming and how working weekends just isn’t going to work for me? I’m more than prepared to be fired, but would she be able to spin this as a resignation if I refuse to work the weekends?

97,"So, here it goes

 I have been great friends with a great gay friend (i'm 19M, she is 18F). Let's cal her Sue. She is the coolest person i know and i really feel like she was a person you meet once in a lifetime. The problem is, i have a really bad habit of running late and forgetting things, so i always ran late when we had to meet up and hang out. It wasn't a big deal when i ran late for like 10 minutes or something, but i used to be late for 30 minutes or more. But she forgave me. Every.  Fucking. Time. I don't know why i keep doing it, but i simply can't seem to manage my time. I procrastinate, i run late, i don't pay attention, i'm a hot mess if you will. Yet, apart from all that, she still forgave me. She was the best friend ever. 

Now, here's when i fucked up the most. Started college, met a girl (19F), let's call her Becky. I really like her, so we start talking, she played League with me, i asked her out, it was swell. Until one day, when she invited me to go to the mall with her. I say yes, of course, and go. The thing is, i had to meet with Sue the same day at 8 o'clock. So, i figure, i go at 7:30 there to meet up. The thing is... I forgot, completely. At 7:45 i get a call asking me if i'll make it on time. I say sure, but i kept staying with Becky cuz you know, i like her and shit. I get onto the bus at 7:50, and meet up wth Sue at fucking 8:45. 

Poor Sue had to wait for my fucking self for 50 goddamn minutes in the cold. I meet up with her, and I walk her home. This time it was different. She was understandably mad. We didn't talk, and halfway, she started to simply say: ""You know, I think you just don't care. I had a shit day, and was looking forward to meeting with you, but yet you had me wait for 50 fucking minutes"". I felt devastated. I really care about her, you know but yet, i still forgot, i still was an asshole. I thought with my dick instead of my brain.

I feel like an asshole, like i'm the worst friend ever, and maybe i am. I don't want this to end, but i simply don't know what to do

TL;DR: I fucked up by being late to meet up with my best friend because i wanted to spend more time with the person i'm attracted to.",06Nov2020,2

99,"I had an affair with a co-worker this past February which started out as a friendship dating back to 2018. This past year we began talking more and more and developed an emotional (and months later) intimate connection. During this time my wife was being neglected by me and I refused to see how she was feeling or acknowledge her feelings. I pushed her away when she tried to love me, ignored her love letters to try and win me back and refused any sort of marriage counselling. Fast forward to today and I am now out of my home and living with the woman I had an affair with. I cry every single day due to shame and guilt and feel like I love two people at once. I fear of losing either person and feel guilty for not taking better care of my marriage. I feel guilty because a part of me wants to go fix my marriage like my wife is willing to, the other side of me fears losing the person I am currently with forever.

I am dealing with feelings of fear, guilt, shame and anxiety every single day and no one is responsible except for me. I fear that if I still love the person I am with that I cannot fix my marriage and will live in regret for not staying with that person and I fear that if I don't go back to my marriage that I will forever live in guilt for not doing everything I could to save it. My father in law now hates me and wants nothing to do with me and I don't want my in laws to make my life a living hell. Both people feel like an option at this point and I feel so helpless and lost.

103,"So this may seem stupid, but in past few months I've been discovering myself and trying to put into words what I'm feeling or not feeling and maybe trying to figure myself out.
The first thing is that since childhood I've been very independent and by myself. Not that I've been in abusive or neglectful household or something but its just been that way. This has made me trust  pretty much only myself. Also I have thought about people in my life and I havent thought of anybody that I would miss or need like at all. I have good and reliable friends tho, and I trust them but I feel like I can easily live without them as well.
I have noticed that I am very cold and could be depressed, but I'm not trying to diagnose myself here. The only time I have shown any deeper emotions is when I'm drinking, so that's that.
I have noticed I have sexual problems as well. I am seeing this one guy for a few weeks and I dont seem to feel anything as well but not only emotionally but physically as well. I like him as a person and I think that he is attractive, but when it comes to sex or just kissing really I do it because that's what people do in relationships. I have thought about asexuality but I dont seem to check all of the boxes so I'm confused about that as well.
In general thoughts about sex dont make me feel sexy, just weird, because I think of it in more animalistic kind of way. It seems to me that I am looking at everything from a differen kind of angle too much and excluding my human self.
My question probably would be is it normal to unintentionally repress feelings, because I'm not doing that intentionally. How to deal with it and maybe someone has been or is in this situation of feeling like a robot",06Nov2020,1

105,"I'm Michael, 34, and all but completely defeated and terrified for my future. I've gone through an incredibly painful (from what I'm told by professionals) life. I've been repeatedly instructed to develope my own personal ideas on coping strategies because I cannot grasp traditional methods. This is mainly due to gross disinterest of repetitious methods I've been actively using sometimes since the age of my earliest memories in councilling. I just lost all interest in living and I'm going to go all out by trying to discover myself through the eyes of a 3rd party, my camera lens.

Now, I know I'll need help in finding out what I can do on and off screen to develope myself (my style, characters, how to finance things, etc.). Maybe I can, on screen, allow myself to feel emotions I don't allow myself to feel in real life. I'm just so alone in my mind and cold, from damage, in my heart. Honestly, I don't even know what other kinds of questions to ask to make this the most expressive form of therapy I've ever done. So I'm open to absolutely everything and would love to have someone to look up to, research or explore, or maybe even a mentor.

My sister has been complaining about how everyone else has a puppy/dog, and how she wants one. We all told her she shouldn’t get a puppy, but she did anyway. It was okay for a couple weeks, but now it has become an issue. This puppy is only 10 weeks old. The reason this has become an issue is because OS cannot take care of her anymore as she has work to do, and is now seeking help for unrelated mental issues. P (puppy) is home all alone in a crate and it is pissing me off. That puppy should not be home all by herself crated all day. OS has a boyfriend but they have relationship problems.

Someone already offered to take her and asked when they could come pick her up. MS (middle sister) didn’t reply as she didn’t know what OS wanted to do.

im in my mid teen years and i feel pretty bad. ive got a bunch of problems and i feel like i have a negative mindset. 

Ive been feeling really lonely as i dont have that many friends. I have some close ones that care for me but they dont really enjoy me being around them (which really hurts), i always feel like a sideman. i kinda understand why - im negative, not exactly the funniest and try hard to be funny as i am impatient and want my social position to improve. i get pretty bad social anxiety in front of my friends and ""popular"" people, and end up saying awkward and stupid things. Overall im pretty reflective and realise problems like these - eg how negative this whole post is, but idk how to improve / change. Since joining a new school, ive had the mindset of trying to impress people to fit in and ""become popular"". Ive spent my time trying to be enjoyable and funny but its done the opposite, and im at my lowest now. I dont know what to do now - i dont have people to go to like that, and i want to be having the time of my life rn like other people around me, but everything seems to be falling apart and im finding school harder and harder, as i dont fit into most of the little groups of people in each of my classes, once again making me feel lonelier and worse. all these things build up and i just wanna give up sometimes.

how do i become a better version of me? i want to go party and be with girls but i end up in my room blasting music and scrolling on my phone like a loner...

some people have come from worse places than me (being nerdy and not really liked), to having lots of good friends and girls. i feel jealous of many things like that, and sometimes am a cunt out of anger and laugh at people who have it better to make them feel worse to hide my own problems.

i want to enjoy life, and by that i mean hang with friends after school, have a good friend group, fit in...

i realise im saying like i want to change who i actually am, which is stupid, but i think i need to. i 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 need more confidence.

I’m a second year college student, and I don’t really have any friends at my school. I made lots of friends my Freshman year, but most of them found other “groups” outside of where I met them, so the people I hung out with Fall 2019 semester, I didn’t really see Spring 2019 semester. The people I hung out with Spring 2019 semester, I haven’t really seen at all this semester. I’ve made a couple of friends, but I don’t like any of them too much (I know beggars can’t be choosers, but I’m just being honest here), and they all seem to have a separate groups outside of where I met them. I’ve tried multiple times to get involved with the school. Last year, I joined an organization that I really liked and got a “big” (if you’re unfamiliar, it’s just like an older person in the organization that’s supposed to be like your “mom”/older sister), but she hasn’t tried to befriend me AT ALL.

I’ve done so much to ensure that I give my all every time I try a new organization, and go out of my way to be bubbly/outgoing/entertaining, but it just never really results in any type of friendship. Covid has obviously only amplified this problem. I don’t know what to do. I’m heavily considering transferring, but don’t know if this will be an issue at another school? Is this a normal university experience? I know it’s normal to struggle with finding friends/a group at first, but it’s been almost three full semesters and I’ve put so much effort into getting involved and meeting people. It’s so discouraging, especially after seeing everyone on social media look so happy (IK social media is very fake, but whatever). I don’t know what to do. 

Should I transfer or will this likely be a problem at other schools?",06Nov2020,1
120,"I (18M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome for most of my life, as well as ADD, OCD, and anxiety. Undiagnosed chronic illness is a problem for me as well. These days, I feel like my life has come to a halt, and I don't know how to get out of it. It feels like my diagnoses are a prison that keeps me from succeeding in modern society.

I struggle with managing my diagnoses for things that I want to do, i.e. hobbies, let alone things that I don't want to do. The idea of work and ""adulting"" startles me, because I feel like I could not manage them from a mental health perspective.

For starters, society has an inherent lack of support for people like me. When we're children, we get all the support we need from teachers. However, as we mature, people eventually drop that support entirely. Can't do something? Too bad, it's your problem.

Second, I am inherently incompatible with the way society works. I don't think I could force myself through a menial, low-paying job. I don't think I could work in a corporate job either, since I see society for what it really is. Being a mindless drone in an office, working to subsist a corporation that has only financial gain in mind, would be completely incompatible with me.

Some people with Aspergers manage to turn their interests into jobs, but that wouldn't work for me because my biggest interests are dinosaur games and anime. Neither of those interests are particularly useful. Networking isn't an option either, since I currently have no ""real world"" friends.

Thus, I'm at a crossroads. Damned to unhappiness and burnout (perhaps more) if I go down an incompatible route, damned to failure if I don't- all because of my comorbid conditions. I want to be successful, but I genuinely don't see how I can be.

What can I do in life that would be compatible with success, my conditions, *and* my happiness?",06Nov2020,1
121,Hey guys. Got a question. I applied for a casino job and got the job on the spot. I then had to fill out a large packet for a background check. They initially told me they would get back to me in 3 - 21 days . It’s been about 3 weeks already and I’m getting kind of worried. I called and talked to HR 3 days ago and she said that because I moved out of state it may take a little longer. I”m thinking worst case scenario I didn’t pass the background for some reason and they just haven’t told me (the gaming department). But I think I’m just over thinking it. Does anyone else have any experience with this ? How long does it typically take for a background at a casino ? Thanks,06Nov2020,1
122,"A childhood friend of mine is a busy mom. I understand that she has a toddler and that she can be busy all day long. She’s never been really invested in her own education and didn’t finish college. Her and her husband have always ignored the news and not voted because they don’t have time. Recently she’s tried to inform herself about the world and things going on and talks about how she’s done a lot of research on different things (Save the Children for one), but then she sends me her sources and I can always easily disprove them just from some searching on reputable, non biased sites. We also differ on sides of the political spectrum and I’ve always been more informed politically than she is.

Now it seems she will find videos on Instagram and watch them really quick then go about her life and this gets in her mind as the truth of what’s going on. She contacted me today to talk about how everyone has gone insane with the election and tarted ranting about voter fraud. She then sent me two very clearly biased videos about it. I personally don’t know a lot about voter fraud so I went digging into some studies and unbiased (as possible) sources and sent them to her. She quickly turned the conversation but it really concerns me. I’d like to be able to talk to her about it but I don’t want her to think I’m trying to “convert” her to my side. I think everyone should be better informed.

I’ve thought it through and I can’t think of any possible way I can bring it up to her without her getting offended or thinking I’m trying to make her feel stupid. Her daughter is my godchild and I just want her to be informed not only for herself but for her child as well.

127,"So my wife is probably the most beautiful woman that I've ever dated. We have sex 2 times a week and if I initiatiate she would usually never turn down sex. However, I can't help but compare that with my ex, I'd always want sex from her and I would be in lust.

My ex by the way never really initiated and my wife right now is a far better fit with my personality. My wife's affectionate, kind, fun to be with, and just beautiful, however I don't lust after her like I did with my ex. I can't even think of my wife in naughty positions like how I did with my ex. My wife just has the girl next door look while my ex had that clubbing lusty look, so I can't imagine myself doing the nasty things I used to do and think of with my ex.

When I try to do something to better myself in any way, whether that be reading, writing, exercising, being sober, stopping smoking, or just trying to make myself a better person, I find myself always trying to live to perfection. And when that inevitably fails because nothing or nobody is perfect, I get so mad. I don't lash out at anybody and rarely break anything (if I do it'll be my own possessions) but I internalize it and hurt myself or act in a self destructive manner.

I get overwhelmed with blind anger and self doubt to the point where I want to throw it all away. I can't see the point in carry on trying to improve myself because I don't find myself valuing life enough.

I just want to know how to carry on in trying to improve my mind and body without constantly fighting an uphill battle. I'm so sick of forcing myself to care about myself.

129,"TL;DR at the bottom

Okay, so I've been meaning to talk to more people recently so I can see more of what's out there, y'know? I'm tired of the same thing over and over and I wanna get to know more people with different lifestyles and cultures, not to be inclusive, but just out of curiosity.

If we're being honest, diversity and inclusiveness aren't bad in any way, but they're being pushed so much these days to the point to where it's stressful and if you have a personal opinion, the word ""racist"" gets flung around and it's ridiculous. Like just because I don't want to deal with all the race stuff doesn't make me racist?? I just wanna stay out of it because so many people can easily take advantage of it and I'm already stressed 24/7 and was long before COVID-19 started.

I just wanna be able to talk to different people purely because I'm curious and interested and not have race politics shoved down my throat or all over my feed. Like I know some things need to be addressed, but it just gets overwhelming for me.

If anyone has any tips on how to better do this or any solutions, please let me know.

TL;DR - Anon wants a black s/o but can't gain the courage to talk to anyone of a different ethnicity because of the stress of the current racial climate help pls

I'm 19f, he's 21m. 
He has a girlfriend. 
We used to be close friends a few years ago, we drifted apart as time went by and lost touch.
He slid up on my Instagram story and we started talking again, one week ago. Recently he asked me if I've been dating anyone, I said no. Conversation goes on, then, he sends me a thirst pic, its a picture of him with no shirt on, showing his torso. He asks if he looks good, I say yeah, and steer the convo back to some work stuff I have going on.
He's also called me cute, pretty, and gorgeous when I've sent him selfies I've taken at places I've visited; one was at the grand canyon, another was of me at the ocean. 
Here's where I'm confused- he's done all of this, but I'm really not sure if he's being friendly with me or flirty. He never did this in the past. He also isn't the type to cheat on his girlfriend. But a lot of time has passed so I'm not sure anymore. 

IMPORTANT: I am not trying to date him at all, I don't feel that way for him, never have. I also wouldn't want to ruin anyone's relationship, so depending on what people tell me here, I might just end the whole friendship. 
Sorry if this got kind of long, there was a lot of info to cover.

133,"I’m (28F) a primary school teacher and my boyfriend (27M) is too. We have to mix with 30 different households each and have a bubble with our TAs, but if we see each other indoors we are breaking the law as we both live with our parents. 

We have bought a house and just waiting for everything to go through but we live 1 hour away from each other. We spent 70 days of the first lockdown apart until I took the leap and moved into his and travelled the 1 hour distance to work every day - he lives with his mum as his dad died a few years ago to cancer, so him moving in with me and travelling the 1 hour to his work would mean his mum being on her own whereas my parents are still together so I wouldn’t be leaving one of them alone. Anyway. During lockdown I wasn’t teaching a curriculum it was just wrap around care but the 2 hour around journey after a week made me very ill. (I struggle with energy and suffer with anxiety) Now I have the dilemma of moving in with him and having long journeys and my school is in a deprived area so the kids are very difficult day in day out, so I know it will take it’s toll on me very quickly. 

Basically, we’re both feeling uneasy at the thought of breaking the law and visiting each other. But it was so tough the first time, and we have to mix with so many other households that it just seems mixing with one more household at the expense of our happiness should be worth it? It’s also difficult when we see our friends/people on social media just doing what they want but we know deep down we don’t want to do the wrong thing.

I’m a 19M who had a pretty great life growing up. I played sports, had friends, had a supportive family and a great brother who I spent a lot of time with. Unfortunately at the age of 16 in grade 11 I started smoking weed excessively. It didn’t feel bad and I wasn’t trying to cover up any sadness or anything it was just a lot of fun to do and I also had a bunch of friends that also started smoking weed when I did and we all kind of experienced the same amazement at once which lead us to enjoying our times smoking so much. I also picked up vaping somewhere along the way and have been ever since. Luckily because I had good parents I still did all the things in my life that I needed to do, like I had a job from age 14 till now and I got pretty good grades in high school (90 average senior year) all while still smoking weed at the end of each day. So that’s great and all I’m glad that I made my future prospects good with good grades and I also have shaped my body into a fairly fit one. I used to be fat but then just decided I wanted to look better and so I worked out a bunch all while smoking weed. But now I am 19 and I just tried out university this past semester but withdrew due to the difficulties of online learning as-well as a lot of stress from moving to a new city and living with a group of boys I kinda knew in highschool. Now I’m in a new city and recently I’ve decided that I want to stop spending money and being dependant on weed and nicotine for my happiness so I’ve succeeded at quitting weed and nicotine I’m kinda struggling with but overall I’m dedicated to quitting it. I guess there’s a lot of things I’m kinda sad about such as the fact that I haven’t really started any post secondary and that I’m now another year behind all my friends. I also feel ashamed for just smoking so much weed in the past 3 years I think it’s taken a toll on my memory and I didn’t really pursue many other interests in life such as sports.

Right now my plan is to just work a lot and make as much money as I can while deciding what program I’m going to take next year but I’m very vulnerable in my thoughts, I feel ashamed of myself constantly and compare myself to everyone around me instead of just enjoying life and the thoughts that I have. It has caused me a lot of anxiety which creates social anxiety and has stopped me from seeing the funny side of life. 

I used to just laugh at everything but now I take everything wayyyyy to seriously.

138,"
Hey guys, bit of background, currently 40 weeks pregnant with a scheduled induction for Monday, living in the UK where my local hospitals Covid restrictions allow me one support person only on the labour ward with me. I can’t decide whether to let my ex in with me or take my mum and just want some outside perspectives.

Two days ago (also two days before my due date) my ex decided it was a good time to tell me he’s completely ending our relationship (we have been broken up roughly 12 weeks but had agreed not to move on yet so we could work on getting a good friendship established to start off coparenting as well as possible) since the breakup was pretty recent I am a bit heartbroken and it does hurt to see him move on even before I’ve given birth. What ultimately led to our breakup was his adverse reaction to my pregnancy, pressuring me to have an abortion which led to him resenting me when I didn’t have one, he did eventually come around and has always said he wants to be financially and physically involved in our babies life and this hasn’t changed since he dumped me at approx 26/28 weeks because he’d fallen out of love with me. We’ve managed to be pretty good friends since but a part of me was probably holding out for us to reconnect fully, I was crushed when he told me he wanted to give things a go with this new girl he’s met at university and thought it was selfish he chose to reveal this to me so close to my due date because I think any sane boy would know it would likely upset me. He expected nothing to change, for us to still be friends, him to attend the birth as usual and even stay the first week of the babies life at my house.

I decided pretty quickly since he revealed to me that he’d met this new girl that I won’t be comfortable around him because I’m feeling the typical jealousy and sadness that comes with the territory, therefore I stopped planning to take him to the birth with me. My mums had plenty of children and physically has a way better grasp of what to do/how to support me than my ex and I have no issues with her being there other than I know my heart pines for my ex to come. I want my ex to be able to support me in labour, hold my hand, rub my back and distract me etc but know that it might feel a lot more fake and hurtful irl because I’ll know in the back of my head he’s with another woman.

My head says mum, my heart says Ex, does anyone have an experience similar or any advice? Much appreciated",06Nov2020,1

140,"I discovered my best friend of 15yrs voted for Trump. Yeah I was upset and disappointed but after talking to her I got more upset and now I don't know how to handle the aftermath. This is going to be long, sorry.  

Quick background My friend is a 28yr white female and raised in a conservative and  Christian house hold. She goes to college and is supported by her  parents. She has had a pretty easy life besides having anxiety  and has no personal bills except gas for car.

As for me, I am a 27yr Native American/Hispanic Female raised in an open  environment. Some family is Christian but don't push it onto anyone. I  have struggled growing up, like being homeless  to having to start supporting my family of 4 at the age of 18 and I have  always had to work hard to afford anything. I still live in family home  but me and siblings split bills to help support our mom.  (She knows all this too) 

I originally didn't want to ask but b/c of legislation trump has done &amp; a lot of other changes the trump administration has made, my life and  family have been personally affected in a negative way.  So, I needed to know my friends understood that. Now, my friend is very much a puppet to her family in my opinion. So, she doesn't care about the church but fakes going to church on Sundays. She complains that she has to take care of her siblings pets but when I tell her to stop she says her parents get upset so she just does it.(those  are just some examples) My friend, regardless of her family definitely has a personality that contrasts with them and she has strong opinions when it comes to  people... So, if we were taking trump's personality and putting it on a complete stranger that knows her, she would avoid them and dislike them. 

This is why I thought she would NOT vote for trump since she never seemed like the political type, even though I knew her family would. So after she told me she voted trump, I was surprised and disappointed but decided to ask why. When she told me b/c she didn't like Biden I decided to ask for specifics. I started with ""ignoring the fact Trump is  just a horrible person and only focus on legislation and anything  that his administration has done to affect the people what has trump  done for you?""      I explained to her the ways trump has negatively affected me and my  family as well as what he has and wants to do that negatively affected  the people who are not white middle class Americans. When she couldn't explain anything political I started suspecting she was just blindly following her family. So I asked if she was and if I could have been able to talk to her about both parties would she have changed her vote? She told me she wasn't following them and no she would still vote for trump. I asked again why and she said b/c she doesn't like Biden but gave no real reason. When she saw how sad it was making me she tried to say she knew trump wouldn't win and even if he did the president  couldn't do anything anyway. I explained again not true, and if it didn't matter, why couldn't she vote for Biden to show support for me?  She then said ""b/c I don't like Biden"", so I asked what he has done to negatively affect her. She replied with ""he hasn't affected me and its b/c he has done nothing even after being in office"" 

Then I said ""he was vice president so what did you expect especially if  you already think the president can't do anything?"" She finally says to me ""I understand and I didn't like either but I disliked Biden more then trump"" I looked at her and said that to me it sounds like she is saying; ""I  understand why you are upset but I didn't wanna vote for Biden b/c he has done nothing so I am going to vote for a sexist, racist, corrupt individual who only cares about people like him whose policies hurt my friend"" She stayed silent and all I could think of is she had no real rebuttal or real opinion so she was probably just following what her family says. 

The fact that even in this situation she chose to be a puppet and metaphorically threw me under the bus really hit me hard, more then 'just' voting for trump. The last thing I asked was if she was just throwing her vote away and refused to vote for Biden why didn't she just vote for the 3rd party? She said she didn't think about it. . .

I ended up asking her to leave b/c I just felt like she didn't really care about my friendship. Like it was a feeling of ""wow, she really  wouldn't have my back"".  I'm sure if her family didn't like me she would hide me from them rather then confront them. And this has made me confused on what I should do  about our friendship. 

Any helpful advice please.

This worries me greatly as I'm scared that popper is going to do something to separate Lilly from her friends and manipulate lilly into false security that popper is good and the real friends are bad. What should I do?. Lilly says it's because they got bored and they say that popper is fun and that they're attracted to the chaos.

Sorry if my English isn’t great it’s not my first language 

I’m 40 and a single dad raising 4 boys 18M, 16M identical twins, and an 12M I love them so much and I do what I can to give them a good life I have them going to a really good boarding school I went to when I was younger as well I have arranged for them to have private classes there to make sure they walk out of there with good grades. 

Because as a kid I got into fights often and had to learn to fight through getting my ass kicked i made sure they all have been doing martial arts for a long time

There is defiantly I difference in how I treat them but that’s down to the fact that the two twins get amazing grades acing subjects they will be doing for entrance exams to university and even doing well learning that advanced material with the private tutors that they will be assessed on in 2 years though they both get in trouble at school generally for not doing what they are told or behaving badly on classes that they don’t care about. a comment I got off their head teacher was “they are incredibly smart students and as the maths teacher I love having them in my class but as a year head they are little shits” 

The oldest on the other hand behaves badly in class and get bad grades either doesn’t study or doesn’t try often scrapping though his classes on passes so I usually get mad at him and try push him to actually study but it doesn’t help so as punishment I don’t give him money or let him go out with his friends , who I really don’t like since they are a bunch of idiots. 

While the twins I let them do whatever they want really letting them spend time at their friends houses at short notice. I don’t even really punish them when I should cause of how well they do like recently the two of them came back home during a break from a friends house absolutely plastered and stinking of alchohol and covered in vomit with one carrying the other so I cleaned them up and sent them to bed and just talked to them about how they gotta learn their limit.

Recently I left the 4 of them at home and had to go to work for a long time since i had to deal with something when I was there I got a call form my youngest to come home cause there was a fight  

What happened according to the youngest was  that the oldest is pissed that the twins can get away with whatever so he confronted  one of them and they both ended insulting each other before they started a fight and the oldest beat  twin 1 badly to the extent that he’s now got bruising across his entire stomach area so twin 2 later snuck up on the oldest kicked him in the balls and then proceeded to kick him while he was down and left him there and after the oldest recovered he threw twin 2 down stairs the results of this is that twin 2 has a broken rib and is a pulled muscle , the oldest nose is broken and has a black eye while twin 1 is just in pain form a beating 

I have no idea how to fix this or what to do about it

To start with a bit of context and give you guys a backstory, I was a 25 year old virgin.  I never kissed a girl or anything until recently.  Call me an incel, loser, lame or anything you’d like.  I’ve heard it all before.  I was bullied really bad during my childhood and that may have to do with my social anxiety.  I went to therapy for it and got help.  I start dating my girlfriend a few months back and everything’s been okay I guess.  We get along for the most part and she’s a good person.  I, however, have this one problem that I can’t seem to get over.  Before me, she’s been with 9 guys.  I know 9 guys isn’t alot for a 30 year old woman but it seems like alot to me because I started so late.  It honestly makes me feel like shit.  I feel like a joke that I was a virgin for so long and she got to be with all these different guys.  It’s like what’s the point of even trying anymore?  I try not to make it a big deal but it causes me to shut down sometimes.  It makes me feel like trash that she’s been with all these people and I haven’t been with anybody.  I do my best not to judge or anything but I often still feel like shit.  I like her alot but I feel sometimes that I’m giving more than I’m receiving as shitty as that sounds.

156,"Throwaway account for personal privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really even know how to start this. I feel like the only important information I need to share is that I'm gay and no else involved in this story knows that. Okay so I have been working an internship for the past 2 summers. While I was there, I met someone who we're going to call Toby. I would say that Toby and I are pretty good friends. We didn't necessarily spend a lot of time together outside of work, but while we were at work we always had really good conversations, and eventually I really came to like him. Well, spoiler alert, he's straight. I sort of figured that he was straight from the beginning which is why this is really all my fault, but I never got a 100% confirmation. Anyways, the first summer I fell sort of hard. I had just gotten over a really hard year at college and he was really the only person I wanted to talk to day in and day out. Even if I came into work feeling like shit, or if I was in a bad mood, I would always perk up when I saw him because he made my days so much better. That first summer was when he met his girlfriend too. This was obviously difficult for me, but I guess maybe there was some part of me that held on to some sort of hope. Eventually, the summer came to a close, and I left the state and went back to college. The distance put between us helped me feel better about the situation for the time being. 

Fast forward to summer 2020. Our place of employment is considered an essential business so by the time my spring semester finished up we were back to working together. It went okay, but I always sort of had that thought in the back of my mind asking me if I was really sure that things couldn't work out between us somehow. But still, at points over that summer it was really hard to see him, which was super paradoxical because all I wanted to do was talk to him more. Considering we were in the same building for 8 hours a day it was pretty hard to avoid him in the end, especially since to him we were just good friends so he always wanted to have a conversation about something. While I knew it was bad for me in the long run, I valued my time with him too much to make any attempts to totally cut him out of my life. Once again, the summer ended, and being 1000+ miles away at college has helped me a lot. 

Fast forward again to about a week and a half ago, and I see a social media post that he is proposing to his girlfriend in. Well, if nothing else closed the door for me then this certainly did. I'm not even surprised, they're absolutely perfect for each other. I couldn't be happier for both of them that they have each other, and I truly, genuinely mean that. It's just hard because there is this very selfish, narcissistic part of me that wishes I could be that person for him. I think what hurts even more is that I don't think I'll even meet someone like this again. Toby is incredibly smart, kind, caring, motivated, honest, and frankly I think I would've done anything for him. If I got a call tomorrow and he needed me, I'd be on the next plane back to where he is. What also hurt me is that I never even had a chance, like at all. There was no opportunity there for me to make something happen or for me to truly express how I feel because it wasn't going to accomplish anything. I probably would have just made the situation extremely awkward, and it would've been the end of our friendship. I don't really know how to deal with a lot of this, I'm overwhelmed sometimes with how I feel and then all of the sudden I'll just be numb to it, like it comes in waves. I need help navigating this, I want to talk to someone, but I don't feel like anyone in my life will really understand what I'm feeling, I don't really even know what I'm feeling half of the time. I understand it's been over a year since we've known each other, and that I need to grow up and move on from him, it's just been hard. If anyone has had a similar situation, I would love some advice right now.",06Nov2020,1

158,"Hi, recently (for not saying 6 months ago) my parents started to be really annoying, at least imo 

I’m starting to learn code and got really interested in the whole programming world, but with my classes, I find time on the afternoon. That’s where I want to put 3-5 hours everyday, cause i like it.

I’m sensible to loud noises, and have a low voice, I literally can’t even shout lol. And it bothers me to talk and they start doing loud noises, JUST WHEN I TALK.

I ask them nicely to stop it and let me at least finish but no, and I’m being “disrespectful”. My mom always turns on the sink all the way instead of taking one more sec to regulate it. And she does this whenever I talk like wtf dude.

There’s +1500 but this is getting kinda long, but today I was making a coffee alone, enjoying the moment and my parents enter shouting my name. Not mad at me, but they scream it instead of saying hi.

And I just ignore it as always and went to my room to do my stuff alone and I peace. And he says I’m mad at them? And that I hate them??? And that I’m depressed????

I’m actually really happy, it’s just that this lockdown makes me pass more time with them, when I don’t want that.

I love them, but they’re too much. I hate being 4 hours with them everyday, it’s really annoying, and whenever I want to have MY TIME, I’m apparently “depressed”?

Sorry I didn’t said this earlier but I’m happy and have friends, I can’t go see them tho. But I’m NOT DEPRESSED but I try to tell them and they reject it. 

Anyways thanks if u red this and sorry for making it so long. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",06Nov2020,1

160,"Hi! So my 80 year old landlord lives upstairs from me and my current roommate in a two family house in Boston. I've lived here for over 2 years and have tried to be extra nice but our landlord has very dry humor which can be borderline sarcastic/rude and it makes me feel uncomfortable. One time when my old roommate lived with me we had electrical issues that needed professional help. When we first moved in our landlords nephew said to call him with any issues and not bother his aunt. So we called her nephew to let him know. Our landlord came knocking at our door the next day and told my old roommate that she'd put her over her knee and give her a whacking if we didn't call her first again. My old roommate said she doesn't think out landlord was playing around. This is the weird dry humor where we don't know if she's serious or what. She's referenced beating my old roommate multiple times before.

My old roommate had to move out because of financial stress/covid. A very close mutual friend of ours, who is a male, wanted to move in. When we let our landlord know she told us how the previous male tenant destroyed the apartment and locked her out of her own house. She started crying crocodile tears. We were empathetic to her situation but overly reassured her that our male friend was as nice as can be and would never be that disrespectful while also reminding her that we hoped she'd trust us enough to know we'd never put her in that type of situation. She then said she was concerned our male friend was the same guy who lived there previously and was trying to mess with her again. We reassured our landlord once again that our male friend was not that person. She then also told us she had been sick and didn't know how many months she had left to live. That statement raised our concern and we asked what was going on and she said she was just old. Very strange.

My old female roommate moved out and my new male roommate moved in. It's been 3 months and I think it's been great up until now. I went to give her the rent check today and asked how she's doing and she said not good at all. I asked what was up and she said HE was the problem, referring to my male roommate. My heart dropped and I asked her what was going on and what I could do to resolve the issue. She said no and shut the door in my face. I pleaded with her to let me know what was going on and she opened the door just a sliver so I could only see one of her eyeballs. She said she was upset because he took down the smoke detector from outside our back door and left it on the back porch when it rained and that she didn't even know if it worked anymore. My male roommate took the smoke detector down in September and she's just now telling me how upset she is in November. I apologized profusely and said we'd buy a new one and install it tonight. Then explained to her that the reason we took the smoke detector down was because anytime we simply boil water the smoke detector beeps non stop. My landlord told me she had an inspector coming to the house and that we'd be in trouble if our apartment had damaged. I don't know whether to believe this or not. I asked if there was anything else upsetting her and she shut the door in my face.

I'm an adult in my 30s, minding my own business, and have gone above and beyond to be kind. Rent is always paid on time and the house is always clean. We don't have parties and are usually busy at work or at school. She is home all day and before covid happened she never left the house either. I don't think anyone visits her. I'm starting to think she has cognitive problems from being so isolated. I have empathy for her but I'm also not someone's punching bag. My male roommate has told me he's had a couple run ins with her recently while she's gardening outside. He'll say hi or try having conversations with her and she ignores him completely.

Has anyone else experienced this with an older landlord who lives in the same house as them? At this point I no longer want to engage beyond giving her the rent check. Also, from the very few conversations I've had with her daughter and nephew on the phone they've only ever been nice to me. I feel bad she's angry with us, this is her house after all. However, I'm pissed off too. I can't read her mind if or when she's mad at us. Come knock on my door! I am always kind to her and she can't even open the door all the way to have a conversation. This apartment is in a great location and super affordable so I don't plan on leaving.

Sorry for the long rant, just very confused and wonder if anyone has been in this situation before. Any guidance on how do I not let my landlords behavior bum me out?",06Nov2020,1

At the beginning of this year I went to online schooling, it didn’t work out so well as I’m completely not used to it and didn’t like the style. (I failed 4th and 6th grade, and I’ve steadily made my grades back to honors. I was completely back on track after years of straight D’s and F’s but then online school happened.) so I went back to normal school. Everything went fine until about yesterday, I found out a girl sitting next to me in class had the virus. I notified my parents because my school didn’t email them for some reason?? My school is known for being shady and there’s no reason why they shouldn’t have emailed my parents. The principal and everything came in and questioned us, so it seemed like a big enough deal for me to tell my parents just incase. Especially since there are older family members. After I told them they started freaking out, saying stuff like they’ll die and end up in a hospital, but more importantly that if they die or end up in critical condition it will be my fault. (Because I had the opportunity of online school but failed terribly) this truly hurts me, and I believe that what they said was wrong. But am I just being nosy about that girls business? I was trying to look out for my family but I see how I could be being rude or invasive.

Grew up strict-ish Christian home. Quiet, always managed to have a couple good friends at whatever stage (pre college graduation).

Not great starting relationship with parents. Mom was nasty while dad was absent most of the time due to being a workaholic. 

Told to work hard, get good job, go to church, make money, etc. 

Become software engineer, high stress, put everything into it, put social stuff on the sideline. High school and college friends are now maybe talked to once or twice a month, no meetups with them since I’ve moved so much.

Move out of state, away from parents, and get away from the church.

Start to question my AGAB, go to therapist, figure out I’m trans. 

Due to self-doubts, internalized transphobia, job changes, more moving, feeling unsure about things, I distract myself from &amp; repress those feelings.

COVID hits, my job goes mainly remote and is still crazy stressful. Have to quit, move back home due to hitting the stress limit/mental breakdown and having no social support structure other than parents, who have built a better relationship with through mainly phone calls, but still not super close.

Still living with them as I put my mental shit back together, the whole trans feelings and everything surrounding that get brought up again.

I want to start transitioning as I’m in my late 20s and feel like I’ve wasted time already, but can’t because my parents are still deeply religious and idk if they’d accept me (they’ve never been outwardly rude towards any group of people), and if they don’t, I have no where to go, and no one to stand by me at the moment.

I know I could always move away again, but after living with them, I’ve seen my dad’s faculties diminish, and I’ve sort of had to act as a “sitter” of sorts and help out a lot. I really worry about me being further away and not being able to be there in an emergency.

Idk how to navigate all of this, whether to transition in secret (but then what happens when I get into a relationship then?). 

I wish I had a better local, social support structure, but idk how to get that during the pandemic. I honestly just wish I could press “the button,” as that would take most of my daily stress out of my mind.

We didn’t speak to each other for 4-5 years after that. (In the interest of full transparency: she moved in with her new boyfriend about 30 minutes away after graduating, wasn’t at college or anything, and I didn’t have a car at the time. She would have to come to me if we wanted to see each other. I understand that’s not ideal, however I would always try to make it even by giving her gas money and paying for coffee or food if we went out somewhere.) 

If it was just this instance alone, I wouldn’t be on this subreddit. My husband and I had started dating around the time my friend started ghosting me. He’s seen the text messages and I would usually call or text him after, upset. So about 3,  maybe 4 years ago now, he ran into her at the store and decided to ask what her side of the story was out of curiosity. She told him that I was the one who had ghosted her. I’ve honestly been a little pissed off about that since. 

I see her post every now and again on social media because we have a lot of mutuals and it seems like we still have a lot in common after nearly 10 years. She went out of her way to find my husband’s Facebook page to congratulate us after we got married (my FB is on private and heavily locked down). She has not tried to reach out to me directly in several years, and I haven’t either. I’d like to give her the benefit of the doubt, that maybe going into our 30s now she would be a better person and friend... and this is even if she would want to pursue a friendship with me, I have no idea if she’d want to try to be friends or remain acquaintances. I’m also nervous that she might just still be a shitty communicator and friend. I feel like I might just be looking at the past through rose-colored glasses. I don’t need more friends in my life, I have two wonderful VERY close female friends and a decent group of more casual friends. Is it worth it to maybe just add her on some kind of social media and see what happens? Or should I just leave it alone?",06Nov2020,1

177,"I have a friend in school, let’s call her A. We met at the beginning of the school year (in August) and immediately I felt like I could talk to her about anything. When I failed my maths test and was upset, she comforted me. She was there to help me when I had a breakdown because of school stress and gave me advice, which made me feel better. 

However, there’s this other friend who hangs out with us frequently, let’s call her B, who A always makes fun of, to the point where she crosses the line between friendly joking and actually hurting and annoying her. For example, she mocks B’s foreign accent, to the point she won’t stop even if B tells her multiple times not to. When B confronts her about this, A acts like B is just getting offended over nothing. 

I feel like things are changing though between A and I. She has been doing things since yesterday that make me feel like she’s intentionally trying to piss me off, maybe starting to become like what she does to B. 

For example, yesterday A, B, and I were talking about school, and I mentioned how glad I was that I had chosen to take higher level Design Technology over standard level as my required science subject. She takes standard level Biology as her required science, which she hates, and immediately started saying things like “Design isn’t a real science” or “it’s a ‘science’” (with the word “science” in very obnoxious air quotes). 

She even asked me, after doing all that, whether it offended me if she called it a “science” in air quotes. It didn’t offend me, so I said no, because I don’t give a shit whether Design is a science or not; I take it because I like it and that’s it. What annoyed me was that we were talking about something completely different, but as soon as I mentioned the word “Design” she immediately started saying how it’s not a science. It felt like she just wanted to get a reaction out of me, or intentionally annoy me.

Today she annoyed me a little too. She sent B and I, plus her best friend, an email with a link to a video my family had posted online of when I was 6, singing a song. It annoyed me because there was no reason for her to send that, let alone that it was sent to other people. 

I’ll admit I could be acting a little oversensitive about this, I have a tendency to do that sometimes. I’m also very literal and logical so I’ll take something the completely wrong way and get upset about it. But the problem is not the video itself, or calling Design “not a real science”. The problem is the gestures themselves, that I feel like she is intentionally trying to piss me off, and I’m worried this could the beginning of her treating me like she does B. 

I’d really appreciate if someone could tell me whether she is trying to piss me off, if I’m just being too sensitive, and if so, how I can deal with it. I really don’t want to lose her as a friend as I can’t forget all the kind things she has done for me too, but this is getting on my nerves a little.",06Nov2020,1

180,"Hiya! Just want to say I appreciate anyone who stops by to read this. I'm going to do my best not to ramble and just include what feels important to the situation.

 I moved away from my hometown when I was 20 due to a lot of hardship growing up with my family. At the time I'd been transitioning as FtM so I couldn't get a job no matter where I applied, I was being stalked by my abuser, and was suffering from agoraphobia. My best friend who lived in CA offered her home to me as long as I could get there.. So in a shitty beatup car and $500 dollars to my name off I went. I didn't know what else I could do anymore and I left WV. I don't have any relations with my father or mother, but I am very attached to my Granny and Mimi (their mothers, basically) During this Pandemic my MiMi fell in with Covid, managed to fight it off, but definitely isn't my fiesty firecracker of a MiMi who will sass me into the ground anymore. She's quiet now and I'm actually noticing her age. My Granny has went from asking me to begging me recently to please return home even if it's just for a few years.. Mostly because my two baby brothers always ask her about me and why our dad won't let them talk to me. My younger sisters are calling me and checking in on me and always telling me about things that have happened I've missed or how they wished I'd of been there to keep them safe from god knows what. My childhood best friends have both had babies and still ask me when I'm coming home to meet them. I ran away from all the bad because it was consuming me and now all I can think about is the family who I do love to death waiting on me to come back.

Despite how I came to CA I've managed to make a decent living for myself even though admittedly I'm not very happy and I can feel myself slowing down and just treading water out here.. I can't fully dedicate to school. My best friend is leaving for the military. The only other person I had any interest with cheated on me throughout our 2 year relationship and I'm not touching that with a 6ft pole Covid or not. It's too expensive out here for me to ever have the peace I want to pursue, but I'm scared to go back to W.V. Terrified, honestly. I'll feel myself getting excited about seeing my family finally and then I can't breathe anymore and I'm drowning in my paranoia and panic. I feel so fucking weak and hopeless over this.. I've been through therapy, in patient facilities, and still I'm terrified of a fucking old man who's been dead for 2 years. I don't want to go home because of a ghost that haunts the entire fucking town in my eyes.

187,"I feel like I have had the most shitty luck regarding woman. I haven’t had a single serious relationship before. 

Back in highschool, i was best friends with Stacey. I was madly in love with her. I had feelings for more than a year before I finally built up the courage to ask her on a date. A few days before I planned to, she called me asking me to drop by. I went over and that is where she told me that she is gay.

I was absolutely devastated. I didn’t want to hurt her so I kept my mouth shut and supported her the most I could. A few weeks later she tells me that she noticed that something was bothering me, so i told her my feelings. She rejected me of course, but said that i’d be a great boyfriend etc but she’s gay. I accepted that, I continued to support her. Eventually she always came to me to talk about her having sex with a girl, her feelings etc. This went on for 2 years until I couldn’t take it anymore so slowly but surely i cut contact. This still pains me to this day, i miss my friend so much. Its been nearly 5 years so its too late to reconnect now.

After Stacey, I met someone in Greece on holiday, but that didn’t last.

After that nothing has happened. I have had a few crushes but they were either not interested in me, already dating someone, or gay. (I met another girl who turned out to be gay.)

Now whenever i watch a series or movie with a love story for example I start to feel very lonely and wishing I were that person. I long for love and to be able to love someone. I’m getting desperate for a relationship and my feelings are really hard to write down. I feel... empty

All around me people are getting into relationships but not me. I don’t know what to do. Tinder doesn’t work for me. Have tried it a few times and I barely get any matches.

I’m also still a virgin as you might’ve guessed which makes me nervous too. 

I am usually a really confident person but when it comes to woman i freeze. 

When I reflect on highschool I now realize that One girl in particular always helped me with her and she would’ve maybe been great, but i had tunnelvision. She is also taken now.

I don’t know if I’ve ever really got over her. When i think about her I feel sadness and regret of a missed opportunity.

190,"This is gonna be messy as I'm not sure how to organize this, so apologies in advance.  

Several characters on the field here: myself (23M), my brother (27?M), bro's girlfriend (27?F), my mother (50sF), my grandfather (80sM), grandmother (80sF), and my aunt (50sF).

&amp;#x200B;

My life right now is a big kerfuffle. I don't get along with my mother as we often break out into fights, so I've been living with a couple friends for a while. However they would like me to move out once I take the GRE which I have scheduled in a couple weeks; I have been studying for it a bunch, but I still have a lot to cover. I am also currently looking for a job to support myself so I can find a place to live so I don't have to live with my mother; living with my mother is a huge detriment to my mental health, which I already struggle with on my own, and all around would not be healthy/good for me. If I don't do well enough on the GRE then I won't be able to get into any of the grad schools/programs that I've picked out, which leads to me having to put my \*\*entire\*\* life on hold for another year (bc semester timing and whatever). (Somewhat minor note but not really minor: I am very close to running out of my medications and really need to get them refilled, and those are ordered to be filled an hour away from where I am right now, so if the plan is to leave for the drive tonight, I may be screwed with my meds.)

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt is in the ICU (or something) (reasons not super relevant), and it is highly expected that she will pass away \*\*soon\*\*, like maybe within the next week. I, personally am not super close to her as she is more or less estranged to most of my immediate and extended family, so I don't have many feelings about her passing. My aunt is in another place about a 10hr drive from where I am. My uncles are on their way there, my grandparents want to go but grandmother is in bad shape thus can't. It's basically been decided that my grandpa and mother will go to where my aunt is, but grandpa is old thus can't handle the whole drive by himself and my mother has a bad leg and also can't handle the drive even with my grandpa. SO a third person is required to help drive. They want to stay there for a few days, maybe 4 or so.

&amp;#x200B;

My bro and his gf are currently in town. My bro doesn't have any work to do this next week and is available, offered to help drive. His gf has lots of work though so can't help much. But the kicker here is that we have a total of 5 pets to take care of. It's a bit much for one person to look after all 5, especially since my bro&amp;gf's dog acts weird with the cats around, she might want to herd the cats or might want to kill them, we don't know and, needless to say, don't really want to find out.

&amp;#x200B;

We have caretakers to help my grandmother physically (get around, make food, etc), but the caretakers won't be able to provide the emotional support that she currently is in need of. So it would be nice for someone to be there with her for that. Harsh to say, she is also kind of a burden when it comes to that too, she's more or less a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to choose to do. I am somewhat available to help drive, but I won't be free enough to get much of my own work done while I'm away, so that's not in my favor. If I don't help drive, then everything is a dang mess and is proving difficult to organize the plan of action. I just don't know and it's stressing me out, making me extremely anxious, and like, I am about to breakdown. Idk. I probably left some details out, so questions are welcome.

201,"I’m in college &amp; I currently live with two of my best friends, A and B let’s call them, in a townhouse . We get along and honestly living with them has been fun! 

My other best friend, C, kinda got screwed over with her living situation due to the pandemic... she was supposed to be abroad, but she now lives off campus with a roommate. She doesn’t have anyone to live with next year and so after taking a couple of months to decide, I told A and B that I’m going to move out of our townhouse when our lease is up (end of May) and live with C next year. (told them a few days ago... approx Nov 2) 

A and B had been pretty set on staying in the same townhouse for another year. They knew that I was on the fence about it, but about a week ago (let’s say it was Oct 26) I felt pressured and agreed to live with them. I realized my mistake and changed my answer on Nov 2. I totally get that me agreeing and then going back on my agreement is shitty and I genuinely do feel badly, but I don’t want to leave our other friend hanging. Also, B can be very picky and i’ve been feeling a bit micromanaged recently. 

So, when I told them I decided that I’m going live with our other friend, they were upset and expressed their frustration with the fact that they now have to find someone else to move in, that they don’t want to live with someone who isn’t a close friend, so they also expressed their displeasure about potentially needing to pack everything, get movers, and move to a two-person place for next year. ‘A’ will say hi to me although she makes it clear that she doesn’t want to chat or hang out, but B literally hasn’t acknowledged my existence these last few days.  These are genuinely two of my best friends... I don’t know what to do and I feel very sad about it. Am I a massive asshole? Are they being petty? 

I want to say something to them about ignoring me at some point bc we are such close friends and usually do everything together, but for now i thought it would be best to give them space.

205,"For work, I have access to a client's social media accounts.  

The client, who is married, is using disappearing messages on Instagram to talk to a woman who is not his wife. 

I do not see the messages, but I get FB notifications that give me a preview of the woman's responses. 

Their back and forth chats go on all throughout the day and well into the night. They seem to have escalated to physical contact, include ""I love you too,"" and she refers to him as 'Babe.""

My questions are:

Should I tell the wife? She is an awesome woman who I respect a lot. I do not know what kind of understanding she has between her and her husband, but I certainly would not want her to get an STD. Also, in the spirit of sisterhood solidarity, it feels like the right thing to do is to tell her. I believe she has the right to the truth. Because I can only read snippets of the other woman's side of these conversations, I do not know the full extent of this affair. I have no idea if what is going on is grounds for people to break apart their families over, and if I would be causing a bunch of unnecessary heartaches.    

As for myself, the client and I have a signed memo of understanding agreement that does not include any language about protecting his privacy. What legal actions could he possibly take if I send his wife the receipts?",06Nov2020,1

This has happened a few times now. The rub is that he tells her he’s suicidal sometimes and I see no evidence to the contrary and she says if she leaves he’ll have no one.

208,"We've been friends for a long time and were very close until recently. We'd spend all our free time together doing things like movie nights and drinks, amusement parks, stay over at each other's houses, and just generally explore the town and enjoy each other's company. And then she quit drinking. She drank very heavily, but after it got her into some trouble last year it seems like everything changed. It was almost like she completely changed overnight. Suddenly she no longer had time for me. We would normally see each other several times a week but now I'll be lucky if I see her once a month. It kinda makes me worry that she only liked me when she was drunk. We are, after all, very different people with very different goals and interests. I've tried talking to her about it but she just writes it off as her being busy, and I'm not sure I believe that. I don't want to make a big deal out of it because honestly she seems a lot happier now than she was before, and that makes me very happy for her and I'd hate to ruin that or make her feel bad about it, but, idk...

I'm here seeking advice on my in laws. My husband's mom wants us over for Thanksgiving obviously but I'm not sure its a good idea. Our state has had alot of cases and lots of people in the hospital.

His mom wants us over for Thanksgiving and our state just issued no more than 6 people and no more than 2 house holds for gatherings. They have a big family so we're over that already with 8 people and 4 households.

212,"Obvious trigger warning for ed related stuff

I’m seventeen and I have a very close group of friends who are all around my age. Since about two years years ago I slipped into an eating  disorder and though the way I eat is mostly back to normal I do still have thoughts and a mindset that are a result of my eating disorder. 

Anyway, today I was hanging out with some people I don’t know very well at all and we got onto the topic of disordered eating, and another girl started talking about her past eating disorder. Despite having NEVER spoken openly about my eating disorder and the way it made me feel or behave, not even to my own parents or exs, I felt totally okay suddenly admitting that I’d had an eating disorder and even joking around about it with these group of people I barely knew. 

Because of this I’m wondering if I should tell my close friends- if I did I would make it ABSOLUTELY clear that I wasn’t doing it for sympathy because I honestly wouldn’t hate anything more, and either way I really don’t eat in a disordered way anymore, if anything it would just be so that I can speak freely about it, because I honestly felt so much better being able to say all the things I’d been thinking to myself for the past two years aloud AND have people listen. 

The thing is, I’m not sure if I would exactly get that from my friends- I don’t mean that they wouldn’t be supportive, but rather that they would feel weird and uncomfortable about talking casually about something like that with me, especially if they knew it was something quite personal to me. For me, it would just be to clear the air and stop feeling like I’m hiding something from them, and to come to terms with what I’ve been through in a weird way, but it really wouldn’t be worth it for me if I went through the drama of having to tell them to get nothing out of it.",06Nov2020,1

I don't hate him for this, but I am concerned. He explained how he often thinks about harming others and really struggles to calm down. He punches things when he's upset so I've tried to recommend he punched a pillow instead or got a stress ball. He explained how his parents lock him in his room when he is angry and won't let him buy a stress ball because he can just ""scream into his pillow"". 

I don't really know how to help him without making him feel like he is a weirdo, or that I hate him. I also don't know methods to help him calm down when he's angry. I've suggested he found something that calmed him down or something he found fun to do when he is angry, and I've tried to get him to stop bottling up his anger, but I don't know what to do to help him further.

218,"Okay so my little brother accidentally got his gf pregnant. Now even before she got her pregnant he was talking about wanting to break up with her because they just weren't a good match and she's kinda hella irrisiponsible. He said he was under the impression she was on birth control but never really confirmed I guess. I understand it takes two to tango I'm definitely not blaming her at all. 

However he doesn't want kids, never has. This girl was his first sexual experience so I assume he just was dumb. The thing is she doesn't want an abortion or adoption and he really doesn't want to be a father. Neither of them have ever lived on their own and they both are young (like 18/19). So he has just broken up with her and said he will pay child support but doesn't want to be part of the child's life. 

I just feel so bad for my brother because I feel like everyone is going to deem him an asshole. But he doesn't want kids, he should've been more careful yes but if a woman doesn't want kids she can abort. He doesn't have that option. His kid is being brought into this world without him wanting it to be.. is he really an asshole for paying child support and never seeing the kid? I want to say no but I just know he's gonna get flack for it. He wasn't raised with a father around and our mom kinda sucked and I just don't know what to tell him. 

I'm just struggling as big sister to encourage him not to see his kid. But I don't feel right pushing him to be a dad to a kid he doesn't want. He shouldn't have to beat father if he doesn't want to right?

219,"Like, honestly, never have experienced anything like this in a work environment. Firstly, work in mental health rehabilitation, so I knew what I was expecting work wise. Being slapped, hit, sworn, sexual comments, biting and possible death was something that i came to terms with. We also had training regarding self defence and how to verbally deescalate. 

However, management, had decided to constantly move me around to the different wards that we have so I couldn’t even get used to the patients which didn’t bother me initially- but then it was a daily basis. 

During my first week it had been great but the team I had been with started leaving me on my own with one patient (who is considered high risk) for the entire shift without breaks so they could all chat in one room. 

I have been left with agency staff that haven’t worked there and had to be in charge for the day- which I had no training (eg money management, the notes, handover and other stuff)  so it was a shambles. I did ask for assistance however everywhere was too busy and had to figure stuff out for myself. 

They had then switched my shifts over to nights without even asking me about it- if they did, wouldn’t have minded. And I stated that to management but turned a blind eye. 

I will admit, night staff were fantastic and had explained the ropes and had even reported the stuff that happened during day shift with me (which I am very thankful for- still nothing has been done however!)

The worst thing being was that the team in charge of the rotas haven’t even changed a thing which has gotten into my last nerve. And they were just plain rude when asking ‘what the fuck’ in all of these scenarios. 

I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable with what I have expected in this role and have decided to look for a new one while I’m adamant to find one. My question being; 

Am I being unreasonable and young/naive with what the world of care is like?",06Nov2020,1
220,"Hi,

I'll keep this as brief as I can.

I'm a dude in his early 20s and my life is... so weird at the moment. I feel so numb and pointless, and I have no idea how to snap out of it.

I am living abroad as part of a 1-year exchange program. It started in February, and I had the best month of my life before lockdown.

In lockdown, I wasted most of my scholarship, gained weight and took a big hit to my mental health. Luckily, I eventually got a bit of a grip and lost some weight and got excellent grades at uni.

I also had to spend a month alone, since most of my friends went back to their countries, and it was a nice experience.

However, as the second semester started, things started getting worse.

I was sharing a flat with a girl from my hometown who, before we left, got involved in a weird love triangle between my two best friends (one in love with her, the other just used her for sex). We barely ever got along, but we managed to bond during the lockdown. She seemed to have resolved things with my best friends and we talked about them a lot, with me sharing a lot of information about them such as our experiences, how much they changed over time and basically stuff that is well-known in our friend group.

When this girl went back home in June, I noticed my friends become distant all of a sudden. I put it down to the fact that I decided to stay for the second semester of my exchange instead of coming back so I let them be. Last week I facetimed one of them when I got drunk (the guy who was in love with this girl and started dating her when she came back home). It turns out that she twisted all the stories I told about my friends to make it seem like I was trashing them. She basically turned my friends against me, and also strained their relationship as the love triangle intensified. This is just a very short version, but I am beyond disappointed in my other best friend and I feel betrayed, as it turns out that he is trashing me behind my back with that girl, and I can't believe he didn't talk to me and just believed her, even though the things I allegedly said about the two of them are so out of character for me. It's also disgusting how they treat my other best friend who is dating her, as I could see and hear how much he felt hurt talking about the two of them flirting and acting weird around him.

Besides that, I also feel a severe lack of motivation due to everything being restricted. I don't feel like socializing with most people, and I don't feel like talking to anyone and listening to what they have to say. I don't know why that is, but the only reason I have been socializing is to try and break out of this rut and potentially get laid.

Speaking of getting laid, I can't stop thinking about sex. I am a very intense person, and I usually crave sex and sugar to deal with everyday stress. I am also very direct, so most girls can probably tell that I'm not really interested in anything else besides sex. I know this is an awful attitude and worldview, but despite my best efforts to be a decent friend, I can't stop craving female attention and it annoys me that I can't just shut it off. I considered using Tinder, but I don't feel like going through the whole dating thing, not to mention that I don't wanna risk my own or the other person's health. I know this shallow desire for sex makes me seem like a douche, but I really don't feel like I can make a healthy emotional connection with another person in my current condition.

While I've managed to curb my sugar addiction, I keep craving junk food and I'm having a hard time stopping, but it often feels like the highlight if my day tbh, which is sad (case in point, this day totally sucked until I had a Whopper, after which it continued to suck).

On top of all of that, I seem to have fallen out with a very close female friend. She came here for this semester and we study together back home. We once made out and we used to have some strong sexual chemistry, but instead of pursuing any kind of relationship, we became very close friends. I obviously care very much about her, but something seems to have snapped.

She is also feeling this ""COVID malaise"" like everyone else, and she is even colder than she usually is. She tends to jokingly insult me a lot and it's part of our dynamic which I usually don't mind. Two nights ago we celebrated her birthday with a few friends, and for some reason, she called me stupid a bunch of times, totally unprovoked. At first I thought it was a joke, but I noticed she kept repeating it throughout the night and it kinda got to me.

Well, that night I got so heavily wasted and went to bed earlier. I spent the next day mostly recovering and deciding to give up on alcohol and socializing until things get better with the pandemic, because it just isn't as fun or as thrilling as it was before. In the evening, we went out with a few acquaintances, but I knew it was gonna be crap so we went home after an hour. During that outing, I made a joke in our native language that we joked about before, but she just dismissed me in such an ugly way, I felt like I did something really bad. I got fed up with her attitude and we barely spoke on the way back home.

Today we barely even spoke or saw each other, except for a ""hi"" in passing and a few messages relating to uni. I went out to buy something and get that Whopper I previously mentioned and realized I forgot my keys. I told her to open the door of the apartment when I ring the doorbell and she said she would. I spent 40 minutes in front of the door, despite ringing and knocking constantly like a lunatic, calling her and sending messages. When she opened, I asked if she ignored me on purpose and I could feel that she was lying, as there was no way she couldn't have heard anything since her room is the closest to the front door. That really hurt me.

To finish things off, we have a girl living with us and she is nice, but she keeps asking too much and trying to be best buds, which kinda disagrees with my introvert tendencies. Today I wanted to be alone and focus on my studies, but I heard her crying in the living room so I couldn't help but try and comfort her. It bothered me how much I just didn't care about her mental problems, as I have been dealing with similar ones for years. Still, I spent an hour talking to her and it absolutely drained me. 

I know people have worse problems than the ones I just mentioned, but these are all happening at a rate that I can't keep up with and as a result I feel kinda lost and emotionally drained.

My biggest desire right now is being alone and working on my studies and just listening to albums, watching movies, cooking food and reading books until things get better in the world. I also want to exercise outdoors, but the government will allegedly force us into home confinement from next week to curb the virus outbreak.

Any advice or anything of the sort is welcome. I just couldn't keep bottling these things so I decided to write here. Whatever you contribute to this thread is more than appreciated, thank you.",06Nov2020,1

223,"Location: BC, Canada

I preordered the Nest Audio stereo pair at the end of September and the delivery status showed that it arrived on October 9th, a day when I was home and able to receive packages. The problem is that they did not arrive. It occurred to me a week later that they should have been delivered, so I checked the page and saw the status at that point.

I contacted Canada Post; they said I should contact Google and Google would need to file a claim, but that the package was probably misplaced or stolen and Canada post could compensate Google for it.

So, I contacted Google. They at first said they could do nothing since they had handed the package over to Canada Post. Once I told them they needed to follow up with Canada Post about this, they told me they were ""investigating"". I got daily updates for more than a week that boiled down to ""We're still looking into it.""

Today, I got an e-mail saying there was nothing they could do, again. It was the exact same wording as the original message, in fact. So I don't know what Google has been doing for over a week, but apparently they haven't been contacting Canada Post. More likely my case was just on a pile and someone looked at it for 5 seconds before hitting the close button.

Suggestions welcome. I'm this close to filing a chargeback with my bank at this point. If someone has a number I can call or a place I can contact, i'd like to.

225,"This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise I’m not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered a lot. I know this is a major victim mentality and that’s part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely want to get out of it.

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame.

It’s about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think it’s a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life. But in reality when I begin to believe that, I can’t stand to accept it, it’s so incredibly embarrassing because I have so many mental weakness and am so miserable, knowing it’s my own doing, I just... every bone in my body feels repulsed by that. 

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness.

When I make opinions I like to stick to them and when I make mistakes it’s hard to accept I’m wrong internally even though i know logically I was wrong.

I think part of this comes from people always complimenting me on this skill and now it’s just ingrained in me that I could do things last minute and do well even if that’s not always the case. But it’s also really difficult to accept weakness. 

I also recently failed my knowledge test for drivers license even though it’s suppose to be easy for everyone (I was very close to passing). I admit it’s my fault and logically know that because I didn’t thoroughly study yet something inside stubbornly doesn’t want to acknowledge and accept it.

So she puts us in touch and prefaces with that he's incredibly shy so to be patient. She also mentioned his friend ran into her in the store and said how interested he was in me and how nervous he was. 

It takes him a few weeks to finally text me, and he quickly asks me to drinks. I agree, we make plans for the following week, and we start texting every day (not all day, but just a bit here and there to check in and see how each other's day was going, we both work demanding full time jobs). Leading up to the drinks, I casually text him and hear no response. I jokingly called him out on it like, ""guess I shouldn't count on those drinks!"" and he was like I'm so sorry, I thought you didn't answer me, blah blah. I knew it was bullshit, but he made moves to reschedule so I was like fine. The day before we plan to get drinks, I text him to confirm and did not hear a thing. The day we're supposed to get drinks, he still hasn't answered but posts himself out with his friends on his Instagram. I didn't call him on it, just took the L and moved on because while I was annoyed, it wasn't worth any more of time or energy. This is early March.

Since then, he's always the first one to view my Instagram/Snapchat stories, one of the first to like my posts, etc. Now that COVID restrictions have lifted and I'm going out more, there's been three times I've been out walking my dog and he's driven past, then looped around the block and passed me again. But he doesn't stop to say hi or even wave. It's weird. So, my question is, wtf is that? If he was still interested, he would pull over or text me something like, ""hey, saw you walking Buster today!"". Is it true that he's shy and too scared, or what?",06Nov2020,1

No one asked, and no one will probably care, but here it is.

I never told my friends what I knew, however the owners contacted my friends about the dog FIVE weeks after they found it. My friends contacted Animal Welfare (AW), who picked up the dog and contacted the owner. In the process AW determined the dog wasn't fixed and the tattoo that the vet had told my friends indicated it was fixed is actually a breeders tattoo. When AW questioned the owner he told them it was because it was only 5 months old, so it didn't need to be fixed yet. Fortunately, AW isn't run by a bunch of idiots and they knew it was an adult. This combined with several other incriminating statements he made, his prior criminal history related to breeding dogs without a license, and an ongoing investigation into him, has led to a new criminal case being filed against him. AW is going to return the dog to my friends once it has been fixed. I know of at least 6 other dogs he's using in his breeding operation. Hopefully they and any other dogs in his possession will be removed and find new, loving homes, but for now we know that at least one of them is safe.

233,"I’m only just 17 and I’ve been addicted to quite a few substances considering I only had drugs for the first time at the very beginning of lockdown. I have always drank a lot (to the point of blacking out and throwing up more times then I can count) but had never done drugs until a bit less than a year ago. 
I had made a big deal about not wanting to try anything for a long time because I didn’t want to get mentally dependent on anything and knew I was in a very bad mental state. Due to peer pressure and I guess boredom, I let my friend give me weed for the first time. I realised it calmed down my anxiety and thoughts (I often have really bad intrusive thoughts) and made me feel and function a lot better. I ended up pretty much smoking everyday the entire summer, with it slowly increasing. 

A lot of my friend group abuse substances (including things like coke and meth) and one of my friend sells drugs as well. It’s entirely normalised with my friends and because my parents abandoned me during the summer the only people I saw were people doing hard drugs and so it became normalised in my head and my attitude changed. 

I spent pretty much all my food money on ketamine (my friend suggested I try it once when he came over and I quickly become dependent on the feeling). It was similar to weed but much more effective; making me feel numb and heavy and far away. I became dependent on drugs as a form of escapism. I would do ket or weed everyday in the morning and then continue as normal, no one could really tell, it just made it easier for me. I pretty much ate no food and spent all my money on drugs, I dropped to 45kg (losing 5) over about a month if I remember right. 

I remember when I went to hospital, the first thing my friend did when I got out was give me drugs. 

I did other things as well, like psychedelics (acid and 2cb). I enjoyed acid but I didn’t really find it addictive, it felt more like an experience rather than a way of coping and also was a bit unsettling for me (I have a family history of schizophrenia and have had a lot of outer body experiences when I was a kid and really mentally unwell). Tripping was always nice but it made me feel super weird about life and my self-image and completely changed the way I look at things but not necessarily in a good way. 

I can’t really afford ket anymore and I’ve gone back to school so until recently I had switched back to pretty much just smoking weed every other day at lunch or alcohol. That was until Halloween when I tried pinging (MDMA) for the first time. I had specifically avoided it because I was afraid of comedown and knew a friend who was addicted but I was offered it while I was crossfaded and ketted and stupidly said yes. 

The feeling of it was such an insane euphoria and was one of my best experiences. Acid was in a way better as a thing but did not have the same level of pure happiness. As someone who is suicidal and depressed, I loved the feeling of pinging way way too much. I did it only last weekend and comedown was shit but I spent the whole of the week thinking about it. I borrowed £30 off my friend today and went and bought a shit ton from my plug. I’m just sitting in my room with it in the corner right now and it’s taking the highest effort not to do some. I’m really really afraid of becoming addicted but it’s not really something I can control and I don’t know how to get better. 

I also don’t think my friend group is a good influence for me; I’ve been offered meth and shit before and I’m really afraid that the moment I try something like heroin which is meant to be even better than pinging I will never be able to get sober. 

How do I go about this???",06Nov2020,1
234,"I went to get something from the mailbox because a friend had dropped something off for me and she put it in the mailbox. It was pretty big so when I opened the mailbox, I didn't see anything else in there. I came back inside and then my dad yelled at me for not getting all the mail and he called me selfish. This made me really upset and I went to my room and cried. I felt a little frustrated because I wasn't aware that mail was still in the mailbox, and nobody had asked me to get it so I had no idea there was still mail in there.

246,"I'm a 21 year old guy from Belgium. I live at home because I'm still studying. (I commute to school every day since Belgium isn't very large). My brother and sister have both moved out already.

My parents are both very toxic people. It's as if they don't live in this world, they have no moral standards at all (except when injustice is done to them) when we were children, they used to hit us. I don't think we got  bruises or something but is was pretty bad nontheless. I think I repressed these memories, I do remember a certain times where my mother slapped me in the face multiple times at the same time, and I began feeling dizzy, because I misbehaved (as children tend to do). My father threw his slipper regularly, or he threw me on the floor when I was 16 years (my brother told me this happened and suddenly that memory came back). My father also hit my sisters head on her keyboard when she was younger. We've been raised feeling guilty: ""we should be thankful because they pay for our school, bring food to the table,..."" 

My father is a disgusting person. He's very controlling, a jerk towards his kids and wife, knows no mannerd at all. I don't feel welcome at all, he constantly tells me ""your bedroom is not YOUR room, it is mine and you're allowed to use it"". He's very greedy and even committed forgery (which he didn't get prosecuted for at all) 

But the worst thing about him I discovered a couple of months ago. My mother came clean about something on the night they had a bad fight (as regularly happens here: 15 years ago my mother found child pornography on the home computer, the worst part: he'd secretly videotaped my sister in the bathroom  (a child then), also alot of video's of underage babysitters taking showers in our bathroom. The last video was one of him jerking off in the sink. Beside these selfmade videos there were also other videos and websites on the computer leading to disgusting imagery involving young children. This happened 15 years ago and my mother didn't do anything at all, no police. Heck she didn't even divorce him... Keep in mind we were all still very young children when this happened... I know it's true because he admitted it to my mother... And a couple of years I was on the home computer, I typed in ""y"" for YouTube and got a weird autocomplete site,. Then, I thought It was probably a virus. now I know he's still doing his dirty thing

I was devestated when I first heard the news (and still am), but 3 days after my mother told me this, she said I was ""little dork"" because I couldn't live with the fact my father had done those things. When I threatened to contact the police she said I would be  a coward that would tear apart our family if I ever contact the authorities. 

My brother and sister also know this happened, they're also devastated about this. My brother began developing a drinking problem (luckily he's doing better now). I have suicidal thoughts and feel terribly alone. And now with this lockdown I'm becoming more and more detached from reality and my friends. I feel paranoid all the time and I think I'll have mental issues for the rest of my life. I've been in a psychiatric institution twice when I was 16yo  (I think I was already developing the fears I feel now). My sisters happily married but also scarred for life, and she's planning to move to Canada in a couple of years, to get away from this life.

The girls in my class looked at it and they said the list was pretty accurate. That basically crushed any confidence I once had. Whenever I am with a girl alone, I get nervous even if I don't necessarily like that girl. I always assume that the girl is creeped out by being close to me. I basically have no social life.

I used to work at a factory where my brother works. He pulled some strings and got me rehired in his department. Well, it has been rough.

265,"I'm 17, and I have been friends with a girl since we were about six, and we were best friends for years and years. 

However several years ago, she went through a tough mental state, which I tried my hardest to support her and cheer her up through, but it resulted in her constantly insulting me and undermining my confidence, she would openly mock things I was insecure about, and even said horrible things straight to my face, which were incredibly hurtful. 

I normally allow people to walk all over me, but I had reached a limit after several months, because I would never even consider saying things like that to people I don't like, let alone my best friend of about nine years at that point???

She eventually apologised, and I forgave her, but I never forgot, and it still plagues my mind to this day. I also found out ages afterwards that she only apologised at the time because another one of my friends forced her to. 

I have distanced myself mentally from her, but we are both in a big-ish group of extremely close knit friends, so it's virtually impossible to cut ties with her without causing a massive divide and tension, which is what I want the least. 

It doesn't help my case that she is a loud, outspoken person who draws most of the attention in any setting. I'm very quiet, and it's easy for me to get awkward and tongue tied even with my closest friends, because I constantly feel pushed to the side and it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety. 

Am I overreacting? The initial split was years ago, but being around her makes me feel so uncomfortable and not good, but I've never actually broached the subject to anybody.

266,"So Six Flags has opened up again is allowing guests to come in with reservations. I made plans with my cousins, Betsy (23F) and Roger (21M), and Roger's girlfriend (RGF for short; 20F). Betsy has a season pass so she made reservations for last week. We would've gone sooner but Roger needed time to pay for the tickets so a week didn't seem too bad. Now despite knowing about these plans a week in advance when I asked him tonight if he'd bought the tickets he said that they couldn't go now because RGF's parents wanted to have a family game day/night tomorrow. Despite our plans being made in advance, it now seems unlikely that he's going, along with RGF. Which brings me to my main issue.

Previously, going anywhere with just Betsy has been awkward. We don't have too much in common and things can get pretty awkward when it's just us two. The best example is when we were both 13-14, we went to the local boardwalk park and it was really bad. Rides were fun, but when it came to talking it was hard to really start anything. She saw some of her friends there and all but ditched me. Since this was before I had a cellphone, I had to wait until the pre-organized drop off time I set up with my mom beforehand and left once she showed up. My cousin stayed behind with her friends.

A more recent example was when we were in high school (we were 16-18) it was me, Betsy, one of her friends, and their boyfriend that went to the same Six Flags. Half way through, despite being aware of me purchasing a meal plan for the day since they said we'd be there all day, the majority wanted to dip out and just order pizza at the friend's house. I tried to be part of the group but it was clear that after a while our personalities didn't meld well. The friend drove us to the park and back to her house so I had to call my mom to pick me up. Again, Betsy stayed behind with her friends.

Now I'm not faulting her for staying behind. But I am taking it as proof that when it's just me and her, or me and people only she's familiar with it's not a good time for me. Even though she's never said anything to me either I'm sure she didn't have a really good time with me either both of those times. I want to say things have gotten better, but I'd still say the difference in our personalities hasn't really changed much so I can't imagine things will be too different. 

So how do I let her know that I don't want to go if their not going, in a way that doesn't come across too badly?

(I had one idea so far btw: ""Hey Roger and RGF can't go this week so maybe we should just go another day that we can all go.""

Aside from that I dont know. I am American and this feels like the time to move if im going to. I grew up in the bible belt and would love to move away. But im worried about leaving my family and friends behind. 

If I did move where would I go to? Part of me wants to spend a few years in Vegas, part of me wants to be a beach bumb in Florida, another part says live in Minnesota, or Chicago, or Alaska, hell im tempted to move to Canada. 

Theres just so many options I dont know how to decide.",06Nov2020,1
268,"I a 26m have been married to my wife 28f since I was about 18. 
   we have two kids a six year old and a one year old. 

I have been thinking about this a lot and I realized that I no longer love my wife in a romantic or relationship way, while I love her for giving me my children there is just too many issues for us to sort through.
I guess my main question is how do I get out of this marriage while still maintaining a good relationship with my children as I have a feeling she will try and use them against me.

269,"Im 24 and i have been experiencing symptoms of bipolar since i was 14, it started with this unexplained misery that would come out of nowhere and when i got older it started to evolve and i would get bouts of insomnia aswell as paranoia and delusions, it started in college when i would all of a sudden i would start to hear this overload of whispers and although i couldnt make it out i was convinced it was about me, i would also feel like when i was walking down the street or round a shop etc that everyone was staring at me, i use to have this constant feeling that people were watching me and there were times when i would very briefly see people standing at the window just staring straight at me then they would disappear, i still experience this, if there are people outside my house i start to become convinced that they are pi's or something trying to gather evidence on me. all these things have intensified as i have gotten older and i started self harming as a way to try and distract myself from depression or anger etc, i also started to contemplate suicide a lot especially last year and i even stood on a chair with a noose round my neck at one point but changed my mind as i couldnt bare the thought of my mum finding me dead. after that i started smoking weed which actually helped a lot but i just cant afford it, it helped me only think about one thing at a time instead of thinking about everything i could see and how it could hurt me etc. it also helped with my insomnia. i quit recently because as i said i cant afford it and i dont like the methods in which you have to consume it whether its smoking or edibles etc. I also used to abuse painkillers a few years back, i used to fake back injuries just so i had something that could turn off my mind for a few hours. I have reached out for help several times but it always ends in disappointment, the first time they told me i was too young to get diagnosed with anything, the second time they told me it was just anxiety and they gave me these shitty anti depressants and the last time they just gave me these dumb exercises and coping mechanisms, i know that whatever i am experiencing is far more than just a little anxiety or depression, when things are bad they are awful and i'm scared that they are so mind altering that they could force me to do something regrettable, i feel like the only way i will get the help im looking for would be if i were to get sectioned. i cant cope with the rejection i get from doctors and psychiatrists despite needing the help, everytime they under react and act like im some drama queen it really hurts me, i know what im experiencing is something and due to not getting any help its lead to me going down the route of trying to help myself, ive heard countless stories from people who have been diagnosed and i see myself in them so often, their stories are so relatable, a lot seem to be a lot milder cases than my own. Im in a fairly good place at the moment so please dont worry about me killing myself or anything, im just looking for some advice on where to turn next, maybe you have similar experiences. I live in the UK and as much as i support the NHS my experiences with those who deal with mental health has been awful, it feels like there is no incentive to help and instead its like they are doing the bare minimum to get you out of the room and onto the next patient. this probably isnt true but it feels this way. their are more details symptoms etc but i just summed up some of the worse ones.

270,"So I don't know how to feel about this or what to do so me and this guy have been friends for nearly a year now, we met on one of those friend making type apps, we have only met once but we talk alot, we talked for like 7-8 months and then stopped for like 5 months and then started talking again it's been about 2-3 months now and lately he's been weird so like when we call we talk for hours and the next few days is quite which is somewhat reasonable but recently after our call the next day i texted him called him and what not but he didn't call me back and texted 2 days later and then I told him why ain't you calling and he was like I am in a bad mood so I was like what's up tell me then he called me and when I asked him what's wrong he didn't explain it to me well and then he went on about my problems and starting  giving me advice about how I should make new friends and that I should not count him as a friend and everything so after that  things just got awkward and I just ended the callI I was low key mad so I haven't texted him or anything for a while but I sent him a  meme and then another and then he said that ain't a good meme so I was like fine I won't send then he was like no no send more so I did that and then all he did was leave me on read and when I called him he didn't pick up Even tho he was up, so now I don't know what to do, I want to express my feelings and tell him that I am mad and that if I don't mean anything to you then goodbye also he hasn't saved my number till this day",06Nov2020,1
271,I have a person I have been friends with for years almost 8 years. Over the last few weeks everytime we talk he tells me in our conversation let me call you back because my mom is calling and he never calls back. I don’t believe him when he tells me this and I honestly think he doesn’t really want to be my friend anymore. Maybe I am boring? I don’t know but I just have a feeling that I should just not bother with this friendship anymore. I call this individual my best friend but he doesn’t call me his best friend.,06Nov2020,1
272,"Hi, I made a throwaway account cos I don’t want my friends seeing this.

I’m 15, from the UK, and am facing a problem currently. I’m pretty sure that some of my closest friends are quite homophobic, and I don’t know how to act. I’m not part of the lgbtq+ community, but am an ally. Anyway, it isn’t uncommon for these friends to use gay in a derogatory sense (which is normal for teenage boys I guess) but they also use slurs and occasionally go so far to say stuff like “I hate gays” or “I wouldn’t sit with someone if they were gay”. Now, I don’t know what to do, because:

A - they’re generally quite nice people apart from the homophobia, not all of them are homophobic anyway, and I’ve known some of them since before I started school, so I don’t know if I could bring myself to leave the group

B - we’re teenagers in school, so I would likely be bullied or at least picked on if I left the friend group

C - I really wouldn’t have anywhere to go, I don’t have any friends as close as them, so I would be alone if I did (I wouldn’t be able to make as close friends between now and when we leave school)

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? I don’t want to just look past the homophobia but then I would be seen as weird, and I don’t know if they’d like me as much if I didn’t? The homophobia is the only real thing I’m uncomfortable with in the group.",06Nov2020,1
