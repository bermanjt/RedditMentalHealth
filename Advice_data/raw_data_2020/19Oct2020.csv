0,"Generally me and one other friend argue about a lot of things pretty consistently, these things are relatively minor and started out because it was fun to argue, seeing who could get the mental edge. But more recently it seems like every little thing one of us says turns into a competition, or a disputable topic. We talk in a group of 6-7 every day on discord and this happens consistently throughout the day, on school days from 5:20 to 11, weekends from midday to midnight or 1:30. Obviously we don’t argue for the whole duration but more often than not recently the arguments have become far more heated, if that’s a lack of sleep or we are just getting fed up of each other being right I’m not sure. It got to the last straw for me earlier when I realised that I was becoming seriously distressed at him raising his voice and having to stop what I was doing to try to calm down for upwards of 10 minutes (shaking, fast heart rate, out of breath). This happened after I said to him that he shouldn’t vocalise anger towards us/me for going into a game without him. I messaged him 40 minutes prior asking if he wanted to join and he didn’t reply so we got someone else in and he seemed irrationally angry towards me for not letting him join/waiting for him? From that example it really does seem like he just wants a reason to berate me but I’m not sure if that’s just confirmation bias and I’ve singled out that example in my mind. Anyway after calming down I came back to insults, which I do too so is fair but he’s been far more aggressive towards me recently and it feels like less of a “jokey insult” and more of an actual dig at me. I had to leave again maybe 30 seconds later and burst into tears from what I assume is my body trying to deal with the stress I was feeling? I wasn’t sad but just overwhelmed. I’m not sure what to do because even when I try to just discuss something normally he will take that as a challenge or confrontation. I feel like by asking him to tone it down I’ll cause a divide between us which could lead to a breakdown in our friendship, i.e talking behind each others backs when one of us isn’t in the call and so on. I’m asking for advice on the best way to deal with the situation without breaking our friendship, or least with the minimal damage. I don’t want to get into a situation where I feel anxious about what my friends may have been saying about me behind my back, and don’t feel like they are being forced into acting a certain way around me because I told them to.",19Oct2020,1
1,"My husband and I sometimes detail cars as a very small side gig on the weekends. We got a 2015 Mazda CX-5 that hadn't been washed in a year and was pretty trashed on the inside from a lady that works at my husbands job and has some mutual friends. Originally it was supposed to be a exterior/interior full detail, which then turned into full detail with clay and wax, which then turned into all of that plus some paint transfer/minor scratch repair, which then turned into ""do what you want, I trust you"" per her.   


Well, we did everything. Full exterior detail with clay bar, wax, polishing, removal of paint transfer and small scratches, cleaning and dusting of interior with leather cleaning and conditioning, removing of stains on the white leather, throwing away all the garbage, spot cleaning the dog vomit off the carpets and cleaning the floor mats, vacuuming. All of this took a combined 12 hours from the two of us, my husband from 8-3, me from 10-3 (we rounded me up to 10 since I started at 9:30), with one extra hour of labor included. The total with everything we did and had to do was $300, and at first everything was okay. And then my husband started getting texts of ""fuck you, you screwed me, I can go on groupon and get the same thing for half the price, don't ever fucking talk to me again, I'm going to your bosses boss about this and they're not going to fucking be happy about what I have to say about you, fuck you."" My husband did a really good job of keeping civil with her regardless of the situation, and ended the conversation with basically ""Pay us what you think is fair, or don't pay us at all, up to you. But this conversation is over."" And now mutual friends are having their phones being blown up by her and having her ranting about the situation, and we've apologized to them for being dragged into it.   


I'm pretty bummed because we did a really really good job on her car and genuinely put all into it that we could because it seemed like she had a lot going on emotionally from what we heard and saw with the wine cans under her front seats and stolen supplies from work, I even lint rolled her carpets to get all the dog fur out that wasn't coming out with our professional vacuum.   


I don't know how to make this situation any better with our friends or with my husbands coworkers, and I'm not sure I can. She ended up not paying us anything, which is demoralizing but better than my husband getting cussed out. Any advice?  


TL;DR We did a damn good job of detailing a ladies car with all the bells and whistles and some extras and charged her $300 on a $460 tab because of mutual friends and she became aggressive about the price after initially agreeing to it, pulled mutual friends into the situation, cussed my husband out and is going to talk to his bosses boss tomorrow and try to get him in trouble (she can't, we have text receipts and I had him get a head start with a superior), and ended up not paying anything at all, did we handle this correctly and is there anything we should know?

I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he called. Im really bad at comforting others, not because I don't want to but I panic. I listened and tried to say something but was mostly quiet and with quarantine I can't see him and be there. I don't know how to help or be a good friend.

4,"This is a long post 

tldr: How do I handle my problems with autonomy from having overprotective parents.

Bonus story tldr: how I got emotionally disconnected from my whole family.

I think I have overprotective parents. I'm 18F from South East Asia and:

• I'm not allowed to visit any friend's house. (I'm only allowed to go to places where there's a guard, ex: malls, restaurants). This comes with not being allowed to stay anywhere overnight away from my parents.

• I'm not allowed to commute on the weekends

• I'm not allowed to leave the house in general (even just to go get something at a 7/11) unless it's for school

• I have a 7pm curfew

• I'm not allowed to buy things by myself. They'll rummage through my things and scold me if they find something I've bought without them (few examples are: Rubik's cube, eyebrow razor) 

• I'm not allowed to do certain things with MY OWN body (no pain relievers for period cramps, can't dye my hair, not allowed to shave anywhere so I just do it in secret when I need to) 

The list goes on. And right now their rules are a bit more loose since I'm in college. Before college I couldn't even text my friends. Although, there are some things that I wasn't allowed to do that I think we're reasonable because of our financial situation back then (no internet, not have a room of my own even until now)

And if you're wondering: in my country, this isn't normal. Our culture is generally not as conservative.

The thing is, I think now I have problems with autonomy. I have fixations over the trivial things I never got to do. I get super defensive and insecure whenever these things are brought up in a conversation. I always try to prove myself academically and artistically to make up for the fact that I think people see me less of an adult or less of a person because of my lacking life experiences. 

I'm starting to regret following these rules obediently. I honestly don't know how to handle my feelings with this one. It haunts me everyday but it's been esp heavy these past few weeks. Maybe it's because I've start to actually internalize what happened the last few years of my life. 

So.. any advice on how to deal with my pettiness over not being able to choose for myself?

Here's a bonus story you can skip:

The time I screwed up the most was when they found out I was pursuing someone at 15. You know, the I like you and you like me type. All we ever really did was text to each other. During this time they caught my sister (13 at that time) cutting classes to hook up (and maybe have sex with boys). Let's just say that I've got heavier consequences. Until now I still don't understand why they hate me more for just chatting with a boy compared to my sister. Generally, she had a bit more freedom that I didn't really mind but this was beyond my comprehension. This event + the accumulation of internalized anger and regret got me emotionally disconnected from my whole family.",19Oct2020,1

Despite me and the rest of the group arguing ect she remained friends with both of us and stayed out of the situation. That group has since tried to regrowth the friendship we once had. Let’s call the girl I remained friends with Lucy. Despite being extremely private and not very trusting I tell Lucy more than I’ve told ppl I’ve had over 5 years of friendship with I still hold back a-lot though.

Anyway, me and my girlfriend know this person who we’ll call T. T is special needs, this does not bother me. T does not have much experience with girls due to his condition, therefore every girl he sees he wants immediately. My girlfriend, and I, are overly nice- we won’t kick him to the rocks like others would. I try to be nice to him, I won’t be mean because that’s not right. But at the same time- he constantly wants to talk to my girlfriend or hang out with “us.” I put “us” in quotations because I’m just his vessel to her, therefore I’m his best friend. I don’t doubt he sees me as a friend, and I would like to be his friend- but I know the real reason. I keep avoiding him, putting him off, etc. but in a nice way, but I have this guilty feeling I should just hang out with him. I just don’t think it’s right my girlfriend has to sacrifice her comfort or anything for somebody else’s happiness. What do you guys think here? I won’t be mean, but how do I ignore/ put him off? Thanks a bunch kind strangers! &lt;3

I posted this on AITA and people gave me a shit fit for supposedly “not giving my girlfriend a say.” So allow me to explain, she does not want to hang out with him. He makes her uncomfortable attempting to flirt “subtly” with her. He asks her to do weird challenges, or just says odd stuff, which I get it he doesn’t understand. However, she’s not just a fantasy- she’s a human being.

13,"

For context, I am in my twenties and my friend is in her forties. She is an RN. I am an unemployed, graduating senior. I am married, and my spouse makes good money- but neither of us spend it on flashy or random things. 

Since I’ve known my friend for the last 4-5 years, she has mentioned starting multiple businesses that never happened. Now, she has decided that she wants to launch a random clothing brand. She has been upset that the guys shes dating have not wanted to invest in her business, nor any of her girlfriends from college. She has labeled them as jealous that she is escaping the 9-5 life. She has spent money on an LLC, ordering a microphone for an accompanying podcast that does have any episodes, creating social media and says she is going to pay for some branding company. She does not have any social media presence of her own whatsoever and has never had an interest in clothing. As someone obtaining a business degree, I tried to gently tell her that she was putting the cart before the horse. The model of asking your friends and family to buy your product is not sustainable. She asked me if I liked the designs that she was brainstorming and I told her politely that they weren’t my thing.

Now she has launched a campaign with some online store, I think Shopify. She is selling a basic black hoodie with a really basic random graphic on it for 60 dollars. She has asked me four times to buy the hoodie, tell my husband to buy it, and to share it with friends. She’s been saying people who haven’t bought it yet are jealous. I don’t want to spend 60 dollars on a hoodie that I already told her I did not like. I am trying not to be mean, but she will not take a hint. It is really weird, because she’s kind of acting like the MLM people. Again, I am unemployed, I pay my student loans out of my savings account and try to limit spending our household money outside of essentials. So if i were to spend 60 bucks, it’d be awesome
To spend it on something worth it. Additionally, We are preparing to move across the country In a month and buying a house, she knows this. Not to mention, it’s a pandemic.  

I am so confused about what’s going on here? I am wondering if she’s just looking for a big payday on this basic product? She’s making me really uncomfortable by continuing to mention this product. How do I tell her gently that I do not want to buy this product?",19Oct2020,1

A had been telling me just a few weeks before that her and her partner had a threesome with another female but she said she thinks the girl usually initiates it to get with the male. 
anyways that will be important later 
we were drinking and things escalated really quickly to playing strip card games, A ended up kissing me quite passionately when we were alone outside and I didn’t think anything of it but that was the only bit of attention she gave me.
as the night went on I wasn’t feeling too good so I went to lay down in their spare bedroom. I asked if we could go home but my partner didn’t want to 
My partner and A’s partner came in and we’re saying that they wanted to have a race on who could make their partner cum first. 
I honestly felt really uncomfortable but I agreed and we were in seperate bedrooms at first but after I finished A and her partner came in the spare bedroom and turned the lights off.
A’s partner was going down on her and my partner and I were just kissing and all of sudden I felt something off with him, I felt down his arm and felt that he was holding her hand while she was moaning and what not, it bothered me a little bit but I didn’t say anything I just went outside. 
they all came out and we were talking about the race and A said to my partner “when is it going to be your turn going down on me” he just laughed and I was confused. 
we went inside to watch a movie all in the same bed, I thought it would be my partner and I next to each other but it ended up being A’s partner, my partner, A and then me.
A’s partner fell asleep and I just turned over and pretended to be asleep, I felt my partner and A right next to me touching each other and kissing, their breaths were getting heavier and I just turned around and saw them together and it infuriated me. 
I got up and went straight to the car and we went home, I was angry because no one talked to me about it or If I would be okay with that.
My partner has cheated on me before and we have talked about being with other people and how I’m not okay with it and neither is he? 
He seems to think it was okay because I was there but agrees with me that if A’s partner and I did anything he would be mad

So i blocked her and some of her online friends in that group ..the user has somesort of hatred or issue towards me for no reason apparently then outs other people who called her out on this and then victimises herself...the problems here are: 

1- i blocked her, but she is a very popular person in these kinds of groups, and shes post before weird stuff about being abused and having ptsd i think shes a sociopath, but shes very active and popular on social media, shes on all the social media sites u can think of, its insane..and in videos she comes across as a fake bitch, but people love sucking up to her because of her looks...delusional

So what would u have done? And what do u think of her random hateful behaviour? Did i do well to just simply block her weird ass, cause i dont wanna hear from this weird self entitled girl again.

We've spoken seriously about our future, like everything within the next year and beyond. The other week I asked him about something we'd avoided talking about since we met: past relationships. After all these months, I wanted to finally be open and honest with him about it, and to understand a bit about this missing piece of his life before I knew him.

To be clear, I didn't (and still don't) want juicy bedroom details about his former significant other(s). I just wanted to know what kind of people they were and how he met them, very brief bits about them and felt like we should get rid of whatever skeletons are in the closet once and for all, also, together, put these other relationships behind us. Well, he didn't answer my question, explaining that he'd prefer not to talk about either of our love/dating/sexual histories. I wasn't surprised, given that he'd only once brought up the topic before and because he's a sort of private person, in general. However, I'd hoped he'd say something like, ""Yeah, I dated around/had a few girlfriends before I met you, this is what they were like this is how I met them etc."" Maybe that sounds stupid, but I thought it would have been direct and reassuring, even if he didn't want to divulge much detail or dig up past feelings. Instead, he simply said that unless I had a really good reason to discuss it, he'd prefer never to talk about this at all.

My reaction was confusion (at first) because he had brought up our sexual histories when we first started dating, and spoke about each guy he’d been with a little bit, but not about the girls much at all. So I made an agreement with him not to speak about our past like that, as a matter of trust and respecting his privacy. But part of me isn't OK with this conclusion. As we consider a deep partnership/friendship, are we wrong to not be at least a little open with each other? How could we be open and honest without hurting one another? Or is the past truly the past and all that matters is what we create together? I'd appreciate some perspective from those who've successfully had ""the ex talk."" Is this a conversation worth bringing up with him again? Since you guys are not my boyfriend, I'll tell you that I've only had two relationships prior to this one and they were both with girls. One left me pretty heartbroken for about a year and then I was with my second girlfriend for about a year, same thing happened. A few years later I met my current boyfriend, and then he changed everything. I guess I'd like to be able to just know what kind of girls he was with in the past, where he met them and I’d be happy to share the same. Like not asking him anything I wouldn’t answer myself.

Thanks so much for reading.",19Oct2020,1
28,"Hi! I'm Portuguese and I'm currently in university taking languages, literature and culture. However, this happens to be my last year and i still dont know which master i should choose.
I'm interested in a lot of things, such as cultures, traveling, beauty, social media, fishing, music, science, manual work, etc and I love to express my opinion and point of view to others, and I'm really open minded. Also, i have a lot of skills such as teaching, organizing events, being responsible and mostly I'm just hard working. Hence, I don't know what type of job I would fit in but I can see myself working on a magazine or organizing events? Or even as a teacher? I really don't know.
I'm afraid of getting bored, so being a teacher maybe is not for me.
help???",19Oct2020,1
29,I’m a 15 y/o American and I have had 2 female parents my entire life. I was adopted at a few months old and my parents have taken care of me since. They have been married 24 years and had to get married twice after we moved to a new state. As long as i can remember they have loved each other and me. My one mother ( we’ll call her M1) has been very aggressive. She gets easily angry and it’s been very difficult getting along with her. This morning my parents sat me down and told me they are splitting up because M1 may be straight. They say they still love each other and they will run the business together and still do the same things as before but they will be splitting up. I cried because I wasn’t really expecting it and I made a few jokes about 2 Christmases while crying( probably not the best thing to do) but I have been asking why doesn’t m2 move out. She is the nicest person ever and i just want to look out for her. And she doesn’t deserve this. I talked about it with M2 all day about plans of them moving rooms etc. to try to calm myself down. I have been struggling with mental health for a long time and was starting to make progress. Me and m1 have a very rocky relationship and at this point I don’t know if I can even look at her the same. I’m trying and I love them but I just don’t understand how you can be in love with someone for over 30 years then all of a sudden not want to be with them. After m1 got home from watching football with her friends I jokingly asked if I can have the down stairs room. She got mad and I asked why she’s being aggressive. She said I was being passive aggressive and called me selfish. I said we are done talking because I was angry and she got in my space and touched me.( every time we get into a heated argument she gets in my space and threatens to slap me. I yell at her and try to walk out side so I could take a walk. So I’m sitting outside righting this while crying and I just don’t know what to do. I know their relationship is none of my business but they were the only people I had and now I can talked to anyone except my therapist but I only have a appointment once a week. What should I do? How should I feel?,19Oct2020,1
30,"Let me preface this by first apologizing for length, and second acknowledging that I’ve been an über-sensitive people-pleaser for most of my life who has been gaslit to believe I and my sensitivity are always at fault in previous relationships. I’ve been working on it the past 5-ish years, but still sometimes struggle with knowing if the person I’m having issues with is behaving poorly or if I am, so that’s what I’m hoping to get some perspective on. 

So I (36F) have a work friend (40F) we’ll call C. We started talking at work about 5-6 years ago about shared interests and workplace frustrations, and gradually got closer to the point where we’d text, share funny memes, and occasionally see each other outside of work. I had just moved to the area alone and it was nice to have someone to talk to with common interests. 

Things started to change when C was promoted at work and, even though she wasn’t responsible for me, she technically became my supervisor. All her previous complaints about the company we worked for went out the window and she became a “company man.” I’ll be the first to admit that part of our bonding was due to venting/straight-up b*tching about ridiculous things in our workplace, and she’d always been ruthless in her critiques. So when she started participating in some of those same behaviours, I was understandably turned off, but didn’t know how to address it. 

Those sorts of things escalated to the point where another supervisor at work confided in me that they’d been getting many complaints about C’s attitude and work style. (Yes, the workplace was extremely toxic, of that I’m certain.) A colleague who was also a close friend even discovered that she’d sabotaged his promotion. Thankfully I got my own promotion soon after and transferred to a different department so I no longer had to work with her. But, she still never let an opportunity to gossip and gush negativity about the company and our coworkers slip by. I fully admit I participated at first, but this was right when I decided I needed to work on my own negativity and stopped participating. But her negativity has escalated to the point where she talks as if everything is going to be a disaster, no matter what it is, and it really brings me down. I’ve tried countering it to no avail. 

I also began to notice some other concerning behaviours. No matter what C was asked about, she acted like she already knew the answer, all the details, and didn’t need anything explained. She was always right, and if she was corrected, she’d breeze right through like it hadn’t ever happened. This is true for emotional matters as well as practical, eg. assuming to the point of telling me I was furious about a relationship issue when I was actually just deeply sad. It was irksome at first but has grown obnoxious with time, to the point I no longer confide in her about the important things going on in my life because it drives me crazy when people assume they know my thoughts and feelings and they’re wildly off-base. 

She’s also got a spending issue. She’s hinted at having charged off a huge amount of debt in the past, is constantly purchasing anything and everything, and has severe FOMO to the point of setting alarms for every online shop update and placing huge orders every week. I’m not great with spending myself and I find her anxiety over missing restocks and things rubbing off on myself so I spend needlessly, so I’ve done my best to be more conscious about it and resist. However, she also constantly purchases things FOR ME, unasked. She’s always dropping by with a box of this or that, even having online orders shipped directly to my house. I’ve explained to her a few times that I appreciate that she thinks of me, but that I’m trying to simplify my life and get rid of material objects, so I’d appreciate if she no longer bought me things. It will work for a short while, but she always pops up again with something that “said my name” to her. Again, I’m trying to be better with my spending, and her constant gifts make me feel guilty because I’m not buying her random presents to reciprocate. It feels subtly manipulative, but I’m not sure if I’m imagining that. 

Something I know I’m not imagining is C’s lack of respect for her children. She has two, about 8 and 14, and it seems that she doesn’t believe her children have any rights with her because she’s their mother. She’s told me she’s going to smash the video games the 14 year old bought with their birthday money because they got in trouble at school. I told her that was awful - if anything, take them away for a while, but don’t destroy their property. She saw nothing wrong with it and smashed them in front of the child. 

I’ve tried to “drift away” several times in the past, but she always guilts me back, with gifts, being super friendly and positive for a bit, and even using her youngest child to guilt me. She’s had them send me video messages when I haven’t spoken to her in a while, asking when they’re going to get to see me. 

The latest occurrence of this is what may be my final straw. Around the end of August, she and her 14yo stopped to drop off more things she, unsolicited, had bought for me, and she started talking about the Pride flags I’d just put up. She herself is straight and cis, but she has a strange, sort of fetish-y obsession with all things LGBTQ+ - especially gay men, like one of her biggest goals is to have a gay BFF, she’s obsessed with drag queens, she has a “gay man” persona she uses sometimes, etc. She acted like she knew what a fairly obscure Pride flag (for an orientation I’ve never discussed with her) was and then proceeded to misidentify another flag while seriously disrespecting her child: she said, “this one wants a pink and purple one, a trans flag, but [they’re] not sure yet, right [14yo]?” and gestures to her child, who’s staring silently at their phone in the passenger seat. 

Now, her children know me, but they certainly don’t know me well enough for her to discuss their identities with me without their permission. I was so shocked I couldn’t even think to say anything about it, so I simply asked her child how school was going. 

After they left, I thought about this relationship for a long time.  The next time she texted, I told her I needed some space away from everything to figure out what I was doing with my life. She’s kept texting and sending social media posts, etc, since then, which I’ve ignored. I’m drained. While I don’t believe our friendship has always been awful, I don’t believe either of us are getting anything out of it anymore, but I know she would disagree. That makes me wonder if in continuing communication, I’d only be enabling her dysfunctional attachment style. I don’t feel that she wishes me well, beneath all her efforts to stay connected with me. It’s just a feeling, and I can’t prove it, but there are times when I get a very jealous, hateful feeling from her. I wonder if she envies my “freedom” (I’m unmarried, no kids) because her own marriage and situation are so dysfunctional (that’s a whole other story).  

Or am I the dysfunctional one? What if I’m imagining/blowing everything out of proportion because the friendship isn’t “easy?” This is not the first time I’ve ended a friendship for similar reasons, and I worry that I’m the problem: that once I get so close to people and see what’s beneath the “public persona,” I want out. I do have a few strong, long-term friendships this has never happened with, but I’ve ended at least three previous friendships over similar concerns. Or am I just rubbish at choosing friends?

It may be the easy way out, but I don’t want to continue our friendship, and I have no idea how to effectively communicate that to her. I don’t feel it would be productive to say “here are all the things you did wrong, ta-ta, leave me alone,”  but “drifting away” isn’t working either, as she’s still trying to talk - even going so far as to mail me another unwanted gift - after almost two months. Any advice from those who’ve dealt with similar situations would be appreciated. 

TLDR; Not sure if friend is toxic or I am, but I want out - what now?",19Oct2020,1

It doesn’t even help that they steal other things from me (I’ve kept track of everything they’ve stolen. And it can’t be that I lost those things, since I keep everything in my room).

35,"Context age: me 18
Older sister 22

So basically, me and my sister were in the kitchen and she was serving herself some dinner. However she somehow dropped her whole plate filled with rice and shattered it completely. I yelled at her cuz that was really stupid and all she said was fuck and then cleaned it up. But at that moment when she dropped it that I felt a great sense of joy because she tears my head off If I even do something remotely dumb. But I’ve never done something that dumb. Anyway, so as she’s cleaning up and she gets a call from her bf. She answers even though I’m in the middle of yelling at her. I tell as soon as she answers to hang up as this is a bad time. I even said this loud enough for the bf to hear. So at this point I’m just watching her clean up and telling her off because of how she’s a complete hypocrite. And  I went to the length of embarrassing her in front of her bf cuz of this. Which I agree is totally not cool. But then again why tf did she have to answer??? Then she finally hangs up, tells me I’m jealous of her somehow and that I want them to break up. Then she goes ahead and says “if you ever contact him I’ll break your arms” In an angry tone. Like what the actual fuck? Then she storms off cusses me off some more and then goes upstairs. I think this is kinda stupid but I feel like I have a point even though I kinda did mess up a bit.

38,"I found my biological family a year ago. In the beginning, it was great, they cared about me and wanted to know me and communicate with me. Slowly, they stopped talking to me completely. But I still talk to my biological mom. Anyways, slowly she didn’t want to call as often and didn’t ask me questions, didn’t want to talk every day, etc. But I did. And when I’d beg her to talk to me a little more, she’d get angry and say plain “no- I don’t want to talk”. Clearly I’m hurt because she spends a lot more time with the son she kept and I missed 18 years (I’m 18). Long story short, we fight every day about this. I’m always angry with her (although I forgave her in the beginning, I’m angry all over again) and now her husband is involved saying I make her upset, need to leave her alone, etc. (because I said things like “i only feel anger for you now” because I feel as though she minimizes my feelings and gaslights me when I’m upset saying “you’re too sensitive” etc. Anyways, is there any hope with birth family ?

I know my mom would have a problem with it mostly because of health risk (because she has an enlarged heart and pacemaker) and naturally is just concerned with health I say this because she's told me about alcohol and her experiences with it and we were able to have a conversation about it.

45,"hello there! i desperately need help, so i won’t sugarcoat what i’m about to say: while i have no diagnosis for anything, my personality is unstable and changes rapidly, and i want to put an end to this by finding myself and becoming confident.

i have really low self-esteem. i can’t look people in the eye because i know they’ll be looking back at me and i hate my face. things like that.. just bring me down. i think because of it i desperately try to change myself to what i perceive as either ‘cool’ or ‘cute’ to make myself more bearable. 

because of this, whenever i watch a new series or find a new online personality to follow, i’ll latch onto a character/personality and copy their style/mannerisms. i’m aware of how childish and unstable it is, which is why i want to stop doing it. i’ve lost all sense of identity because it all relates to a fictional character/personality that’s not mine. 

i make it worse by constantly switching what i’m interested in; ironically, by trying to get a better grip on who i am and what i like, i only lose myself further. i’m so easily swayed, one wrong fixation and my entire political views/outlook on life will change. it’s so frustrating yet i can’t stop. i want to become confident in myself, but i’m afraid i’ll still latch on. i’ve put asking for help off for so long because a part of me doesn’t want to change; a part of me wants to revel in being an awful piece of scum, while the other wants to help others and be a good person. every time i want to move on from this i feel as if i’m betraying myself, or rather my ‘awful’ personality, or i’ll inevitably start feeling bad about myself again and decide that i don’t deserve to be happy. this daily internal battle between these extremes tears me apart.

i know that just by asking a group of strangers, my problem will not be instantly solved. please, just give me a push in the right direction. there’s a good chance that by tomorrow i’ll feel like going against the entire world, so i want to ask for help while i’m still in a more positive mindset.",19Oct2020,1

47,24F who lives in a very populated city in the US. Basically I feel like everyone just gave up in trying to manage corona and is just living life like before. I however can’t seem to do the same. The only people I see are my boss (who works with older people so she’s careful) and my family (who work from home). I haven’t seen any friends really because I have no idea who they are in contact with and I’m super close with my family and would honestly rather hang out with them. My roommate on the other hand is living life semi normal I would say. Obviously not doing as many things as before but still seeing friends and what not. Today she told me she was hanging out with these guys she literally just met today. I feel super uncomfortable with this. We’re good friends and I feel confident enough to address issues that I have to her but I can’t tell her how to live her life and we live together so not coming in contact with her is unavoidable. So I’m torn between bringing this up to her or just being cautious like I’ve been doing? I get tested for corona often because I see my family a lot.

48,"I only have them on Reddit, i have no other means of communicating with them.

They used to message me every single day and have now left me feeling deeply concerned for exactly 2 weeks.

The last message they sent me way ""hi i hope you're okay ive had a busy few days."" - Now, this could be true of course, but they haven't reply to a comment or posted anything in nearly 2 weeks.

2 weeks seems like a long time period to be so busy that you can't even respond to a message. Not even a ""hi.""

Before you say ""they're tired of you"" well i often said ""if you want me to leave please tell me and ill leave you"" and they actually encouraged me to message them. Infact, they'd often message me first.

So to round this up:

* I met someone on here who spoke to me daily and would initiate conversations
* They said they were ""busy"" on October 6th and haven't responded to me since
* They replied to a post on October 8th and haven't been active since
* They never told me to ""go away"" and actively encouraged me to message them

52,"I'm a senior in college taking Biochemsitry. Because of the pandemic, we have to watch pre-recorded lectures. I knew that this was going to be a hard class, but I had to take it because it's a requirement for medical school. I have been studying a lot for this class. I have my spirals organized a certain way for notes, with certain colors to make important points stand out, and to highlight things I need further explanations on. I am also emailing the professor quite a lot with any questions I have, and for the most part, it helps. 

I know the material well to the point that I can answer questions if people ask me, but when it comes to the quizzes or exams, I always do poorly. I have been failing all of them. I just had a quiz last week which I felt confident on, and turns out I did worst on that that compared to the previous exams/quizzes.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I put so much effort into it, and it doesn't seem worth it. I've talked to the professor and she doesn't have hope in me at all. I've gone to office hours and individual office hours to ask questions. I have lost all hope. It sucks even more because the people I know in class are doing much better than me. I just don't what I'm doing wrong. The teacher doesn't believe in me, and why should she, all she knows about me is that I'm failing exams. This class brings me to tears and is ruining my health, but I have to take it as a pre-req.

53,"Hey guys. This is my first time on this subreddit, nice to meet you all. So, my friend, who has always been kind of a “player”, has been dating a lovely girl for just about a year. When they started dating, due to his past behavior, I always thought he didn’t really deserve her because of how much he would talk to other girls and just be kind of a snake with girls. But, when they really got into their relationship, I thought he changed, he seemed to appreciate her a lot and it seemed great for him. So, yesterday, (the day before his birthday and less than two weeks before their one year anniversary) he decided to smoke with this girl he had talked to last year and they ended up having sex in his car. He told me, and I was just shocked. He always spoke of how much he loved his girlfriend and how he would never cheat and stuff. It just told me that maybe I was right about him not deserving it.

57,"My family is a b\*tch. My mother always favors my brother and always chooses him over anything. My dad doesn't care. He watches everything unfold and never steps in. All these years of my brother thinking he is better and taunts me and makes my life a living hell has made me want revenge so bad. For example of how sh\*tty of a person he is, let me tell you a quick story. Once when he was 14 (I am 2 or 3 years younger than him) he wanted the Fortnite battle pass. He asked my mom for it and she said no. It was a big thing everyone had it, so why couldn't he? He came up with the genius idea of taking her credit card and typing in the number on the game. Didn't work? Oh no, take it from our nana instead, a hardworking woman who is financially struggling. Didn't work? shoot, mother found out, she said that someone has been trying to use her credit card! Solution, blame the younger sibling (me). When I was questioned about it, I told her everything. She didn't even know that he took our nanas card. She called my mom a few days ago asking if she dropped it somewhere in out house. Now that my story matched up with hers, my mother went to question my brother. Keep in mind that he is a terrible liar. he confessed, starts crying, boo hoo. What does my mother do to make him stop crying? Buy the battle pass for him. That's right, BUY IT FOR HIM. And I was just sitting there in disbelief. All the emotions coming through my head and i realize how unfair the world can be. I understand how some people will never learn from their mistakes and keep doing it. Next story: He calls me b\*tch/sh\*t in my fathers native language so my mom won't understand. he knows it upsets me and that's the only thing he has referred to me as since i was 3. I tell my mother and she says ""Oh he's just a silly boy"" or ""Oh, that's just how he is lol"" and when I tell my father he tells him to stop then forgets about it the next day. I once tried to tell my extended family that he calls me this and they said ""oh he's just a boy being silly"" and it f\*cking boils my blood. I DON'T CARE IF HE HAS A PEN\*S OR NOT, BEING MALE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. My parents always believe him over me and that is also why I hate them. I once said that I caught a video of him playing video games during online school and he gas lighted the situation and flipped it on me and I got my phone taken away for the week while I could happily hear him continue in the other room. That's just the a few that came to mind but if I thought about it for a few minutes I could write so much more. Now since you get the overall idea of how shitty they are, I would like to ask for some advice: I want to get payback at them. So bad. I was thinking of doing something during Christmas and drop the bomb on the whole extended family. However, if i do, their life would most certainly be ruined and they will be seen as an outcast from the extended family. Maybe there is another way to take revenge? I just want to do something to make sure they never mess with me ever again.",19Oct2020,1
59,"Hi, I am struggling a lot with anxiety right now and I'm worried all my friendships might be fake or not as close as I thought.

**Pros of my friends:**  
\- almost always accept when I ask to hang out, even if inconvenient for them (they wanted to come to my house to meet my family when I live 20 minutes away; a friend frequently stays after school for an extra hour so we can go thrifting/out for coffee for a few hours after my 7th hour)

\- typically always spend as much time together as possible when we hang out (ex. we'll go out to breakfast/lunch after a sleepover)

\- always seem very eager to make plans when I initiate and they always offer to negotiate what we do/where we go so it's most convenient for both people

\- ask me to hang out sometimes... although, most of our hangouts are planned in-person and sort of mutually if that makes sense. One person will suggest something and then we'll all pitch in with ideas/offers to host at their place

\- text me funny things sometimes, like memes over text or TikToks they find funny (this happens fairly infrequently but typically at least once a week)

\- have told me directly I am one of their best friends (this has happened with 2 of my best friends in the past 2 weeks)

\- one friend gives me gifts of my favorite small snack a lot

\- always address me when I walk into class/turn towards me and make an effort to talk to me 

\- some ask where I am/if I'm okay if I am late or absent to class

\- care deeply about my boundaries

\- we often vent/talk about problems

\- they feel very comfortable around me and are willing to share embarrassing interests that they are less eager to share with the popular group we talk to. One of my friends said being with her other friends and their boyfriends made her miss us because she knows she can be herself around us. 

\- typically always reply to text messages, whether it be a conversation starter, ask to hang out, meme, etc. One friend sometimes forgets to respond but she is a notoriously horrible texter and has told me this.

\- very physically touchy and very verbally affectionate. typically people's bodies/feet are always turned towards me, we lean on one another while walking, they'll sit close to me, hold my hand or arm, etc. They also typically make eye contact with me while speaking or just while sitting down in class to wave/smile.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- asking me to hang out directly very rarely happens. Like I said a lot of our stuff is planned mutually and a lot is planned by me, too, but I don't really feel like there's a super clear effort from them like I would be a first choice or someone they really wanna spend time with. It's super rare I'll get a text saying ""hey want to go get coffee on this date?"" that isn't a group invite

\- they don't text every day or sometimes for several days. I think the longest has been about a week and a half where we won't have any contact over social media/text at all because they haven't reached out and I get self-conscious about being too clingy or irritating so I don't either

\- have other, extremely close friends. Which isn't a bad thing inherently, but when it's clear they text them all of the time/hang out with them super often I get a bit sad and wonder if I'm investing too much into the relationship

\- sometimes I don't feel listened to when I talk or like I'm annoying people when I talk to them",19Oct2020,1

63,"I have this childhood friend who I’ve known and been close with for nearly 15 years. She and I were regulars in each other’s households for most of our growing up but around high school/college we drifted apart. We started becoming friends again around 2018- I went through a pretty serious breakup and started reaching out to all my old friends again and she and I started FaceTiming a lot/hanging out regularly. 
When we reconnected, at first it was very exciting to have an old friend back in my life, especially someone that I had so many fun and exciting memories with growing up. But then after some time I started realizing she and I had become two very different people. To keep it short, I’ve started realizing how terrible of a friend/person she can be and how I’ve either allowed it or just didn’t even notice. Also, I think she could easily be a narcissist.
It really started getting bad last year. She was in a relationship that caused her to be very insecure and she gained a lot of weight which she was really unhappy about. On the other hand, I was doing really well and I met my current partner and have been in the healthiest relationship of my life. She started telling her very conservative/religious family everything about my personal life like family issues and even my sex life (wtf) even though I told her it bothered me. She started being really demeaning to me in front of other people, making fun of me and pointing out really specific insecurities. She started flirting with my boyfriend when we all hung out and even started snapchatting him even though she’d crucify me for even texting her boyfriend without her knowing. I didn’t even realize how creepy she was being until he said it was making him uncomfortable. She started being friends with my ex who was extremely damaging to me and would tell me about their interactions (again wtf). The culmination was one night when we went out with her sister- in the span of 4 hours she said I gained weight, I looked terrible in my graduation dress, my face was saggy and that my new apartment (which I saved really hard for) looked awful. The comments about my weight really got me because I’d been struggling with an eating disorder from 2018-mid 2019 but I started getting better and gaining healthy relationship weight when I met my lovely boyfriend around then. I confronted her about everything after a week of processing it all and basically told her I was done with having her in my life. At first she was defensive but then desperately apologetic. To make it short, a few months ago I decided to talk to her again and be friends since she broke up with her toxic ex and seemed to be in a better place from looking at her social media. But now that we’re friends again, albeit not very close, I think she’s still the same toxic person just maybe less insecure. From being friends again the last few months I still see her being ~in my opinion~ a very manipulative/toxic girlfriend and friend and it’s hard to watch other people in her life experience how mean spirited she can be.
I know that I don’t want her to be my close friend but when I pull away, she communicates more and tries to pull me closer if that makes sense. I don’t really know what to do, should I keep trying to slowly drift apart? I’m terrible at confrontation and she’s pretty good at making me feel like I’m in the wrong or over reacting when I do confront her. Also it seems pretty evident that she’s self aware of her toxicity, even making jokes about it, but she has no desire to change or seek therapy or counseling (which I’ve suggested to her a few times in the kindest way possible). Has anyone had a similar experience? Any advice?",19Oct2020,1

So my father has not spoken to my mother unless absolutely necessary for four days now, and now it's taken a turn to getting scary.

My mother got his prescriptions yesterday. She made sure to tell him that. He won't take them - my mother guesses, purely because she got them.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm at a loss. It's not enough that he's giving us the silent treatment. Now he's endangering his own health just to spite her. To clarify: I'm afraid he's willing to kill himself in a tantrum.

68,"Throwaway for anonymity, of course. Hoping the cruelty of reddit can smack some sense into me.

I'm the bad roommate. The one that forgets to do their dishes all the time and leaves them in the sink. The one that decides to do a household chore and then completely forgets about it the following day until someone else does it, even if it's on a list. I end up doing another chore to make up for it out of guilt. I feel horrible every time they call me out for it via our group chat. I usually end up guilt-cleaning after doing my dishes as a way to say sorry. I feel like I can't apologize in response because apologies and excuses mean nothing. I try to be better and I tell myself that I will, and I end up being better for a few days before I get too lazy or I get too tired after work or any other flimsy excuse and I end up letting it pile up and get gross. And only then realize that I should do something when it piles up. They have every reason to be mad at me about it and I know it. They don't deserve my bullshit. I'm just surprised I haven't gotten yelled at in person about it yet. 

Today they called me out on it again. The spiral of self-hatred I always fall into when this happens peaked into a panic attack, something I haven't experienced in over a year (even with an anxiety disorder). I cleaned everything up and retreated to my bedroom. This is a bad habit that I've had for years now, though I've only been living with these people for a few months. I'm disgusted with myself. I loathe that I am this way. I know I'm a horrible person. But I don't know how to enact permanent change. I always repeat the same damn thing.

73,"I live out-of-state for school and work, and haven’t visited my home-state since last November. My parents are both in their 60’s, and my Dad has medical conditions that make him even more high-risk. My parents really want me to visit, and even though they’re mask-wearing and believers in the severity of the virus, they feel the risk involved in me visiting would be worth it. I debated for a while but ultimately decided that I wasn’t willing to risk carrying the virus home with me, or getting it while traveling. I work in the service industry and even with testing, I wouldn’t be able to entirely eliminate the risk. 
They finally accepted my decision about that, and then my Mom started floating the idea of visiting me out here over the holidays, via plane. I immediately tried shut it down, but she’s very persistent, and told me that she’s even started looking at flights. I told her repeatedly that I don’t feel comfortable with it, and as much as I miss and want to see her, I can’t bear the thought of getting her/my Dad sick. She says that it’s no more risky than going to work (she does work out of the home at a hospital in a lab, but nowhere near covid patients), and says she’ll quarantine when she gets back home, and that I can take off work &amp; test before she gets here. Even though there are things we can do to make it less risky, I still don’t want to take any risk at all. I told her that this really wasn’t essential travel, and she said that mental health was essential and visiting with family is apart of maintaining mental health :(
My parents took this very seriously at the beginning, and agreed that I shouldn’t visit home. I can empathize in that this has been going on for a long time now, and it’s really hard to maintain cautiousness for this long. I miss my family, friends, and hometown SO much. but it’s not like the virus is any better now than it was back in april. it’s just as bad/worse now. 
am i being overly cautious??? I feel kinda like i’m losing my mind lol. I’d love advice as to how to convince my mom that visiting is not worth the risk.

I am living with my family on rent and my mom bought a home a couple months ago so we will move out next month the latest, and the home my mom bought is reaaally far away from my campus, it takes nearly 2 hours and i have to take 3-4 different busses just to get to campus. So i was thinking about renting a home near the campus. The flats near campus are really shitty and also their prices are high cause students eventually have to rent houses near that area. But i found a house 2 days ago, went to visit it and it was awesome, it was better than i ever dreamed of. And the price is still a little high but it's ok for a home in that condition. It has 2 rooms but i couldn't find any roommate for this semester, so if i rent it i'm going to have to pay it myself for a couple of months. It will be hard but not impossible. Maybe in the beginning of the second semester a friend of mine can come live with me but it's not certain at the point. 

The family problem is a whole other thing. I live with my older brother and my mom. Since the beginning of Covid, for like 8 months, i left the home just 10 times or something to meet my boyfriend and i never took my mask of cause i was so scared that if i went out and got Covid from somewhere, something would happen to my mom who is a smoker for 30 years or so. I washed everything that came into the house, i did everything and i was ok with fucking my life up cause i don't want something to happen to my mom. But my mom meets with people, she doesn't take it too seriously and i was angry about it from the beginning, i told her a million times that i fucked my life up for her she has to pay attention and she does nothing to protect herself and us and she doesn't give a shit about it. She continues to act reckless. And last week on Saturday she ate lunch with the constructor worker she doesn't even know who is making some stuff for the house she bought. I was furious and i yelled at her etc. and she got very upset about it and tried to defend the guy to me about how he is cautious about Covid, but she just met him and she can't know how many people this guy meets with in his life. So it went like that, it's been a week and yesterday i asked my mom when we are going to move, what is the situation of the house, and she said ""The construction stopped cause the construction guy got corona"", i said ""When"" and she said that his test came back positive on Monday or Tuesday. So as you can guess, i went crazy. She didn't even care to tell me that, she didn't think we are at risk, i went to meet my boyfriend that day and i may have infected him and so his family, she knew that but she didn't even care. All these months i feared that something would happen to her so i stopped going on with my life, and she put her, mine, my brothers, my boyfriends and his family's life at risk. All these months i didn't go to live somewhere else, rent a home for myself etc. cause that i won't be there to help her if something happened to her. And she does this. And i'm still scared that if i went and rent that flat near campus and start to live there, something will happen and i won't be there. Is it nonsense? Idk i'm a very anxious person and especially about death. But i feel like if she doesn't care at all, i should let this feeling of mine go. But i can't convince myself.
And i'm afraid that if i don't rent this flat i will never find a home like this, and the prices will probably be higher when the announcement about school opening cames, cause everybody will start to search for flats like crazy and i can never know when that announcement is going to come.

80,"I need some advice on something kind of tricky.

There's this toxic person I don't really want to be friends with anymore. I've accommodated for them and gone out of my way for them and they've done nothing but treat me badly. They pretty much have the attitude that I'm slow and childish and stupid, and I just want to be done with that.

I want to just send them a message, block them, and be done - not even hearing their side or anything - and my gut is strongly telling me to do so. But something is keeping me.

Should I have a conversation with them? Should I talk about the issues that happened between us? We never really addressed it. I haven't really talked with them in awhile - I don't really want to, I've been trying to get my distance - but they used to be a huge part of my life. And I would be lying if I said a part of me doesn't want to have it out with them.

But honestly? I'm not sure the conversation would go well or if it would be worth it. And I'm not even sure they would understand. I have a feeling they would just blame me or deny it. Plus - I don't even really know if I want to continue the friendship or have a discussion with them.

Even so, I guess I just wonder.

And this is a side note I guess, but there have been times where they've been nice to me, and kind to me. And they started getting a lot nicer to me after we graduated high school. But still, the issues just outweighed everything else.

So, I was playing Soulshatters (fun roblox fighting game) when this guy asked me to train him. I agreed, and we became friends quickly. He acted like a normal teen (did gen z style humor, referred to his parents, ect) He was kinda overprotective and attacked people whenever they attacked me, but idk if that’s a sign or not.

That’s when he asked to friend me on Discord. I have a Discord, but I only use it for SS tournaments and events. I agreed, what could go wrong? He then asked to VC and I said no, my parents would get mad. I was also kinda feeling uncomfortable at the moment.

He then sent me this really, really weird message. 
“Red carpet in a new location with an eye catching up on at security levels in a small space station and bacon house and bacon and a call for me is my ps I have no problem at this moment and bacon was the only way I'd get my own money for me to do that
Your dad will have you on 8PM to do something about you on a regular date or something and you don't know if he's a lot better to be on his way out and you are in my way or the guy who doesn't care if he's just like me to get you a lot and bacon for you on your side when you're going back into it with the new girl in your relationship”

It really caught me off guard, as everything he had said on Roblox was very coherent and normal. 
I wasn’t sure if it was the same guy, but he acknowledged that he had said something to me. It felt like a copypasta, but when I looked it up nothing came up.

I’m really paranoid rn and I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this but I need advice. As I’m typing this he sent me another message, this one says: 
“In my experience it has become an increasingly important thing in life in a society like this is the only place where people have been treated with the right of their children for me 6PM but they also don't want them in their own life or the world in my opinion that 555is is the best 3PM I can find in a relationship with the world and bacon in front for a lot and that”

I really hope that it’s either not him or he’s trolling. &gt;~&lt;",19Oct2020,1
83,"Ok, so this one is going to be a high school drama, so be warned but I really need help:

Cast:

Me (OP): I’m mostly a neutral person who avoids conflict, and when it arises I don’t pick sides, running for class secretary
 
(I’m going seven dwarves on these names lol) 

Bestie: running for class president, we have been best friends since 1st grade, she is such a good person, highly competitive (like myself) and does not handle defeat well (like myself), also knows how to guilt me

Let’s call my other friend B*tchie: also running for president, really fun, self proclaimed b*tch, popular, will talk bad about you to everyone if you cross her, not great home life

Moody: my other friend running for president, always tired, takes things way to seriously, she is always there for you, she either loves you or hates you, you will either love her or hate her


Ok so here is my predicament:

Do you can see the issue. Three friends and I have to choose which one. I want to vote for Bestie, she has really good ideas for her campaign and is like one of my favorite people. I also said I would tell people to vote for her because she really is my first pick. But B*tchie will totally talk bad about me and she has a lot of influence at the school, so if she starts gossiping about me than I might not win secretary which I would say I have a good chance right now if all the information I know right now is accurate. B*tchie is also promoting me in her campaign video (I didn’t ask her to do that btw though it really helps) so now I feel guilty if I don’t vote for her. Moody also thinks I’m mad at her right now (even though I’m not) because she can’t take a joke. Also all three could easily blackmail me if they wanted to. Though B*tchie is most prone to that type of behavior. What do I do? Who do I vote for? How do I maintain all three relationships without damaging one? Thanks, please I’ve been thinking all day and can’t think of a way.",19Oct2020,1
84,"3 years ago, I ghosted everyone I’d ever met after failing out of college. This included 4 people who I loved more than anything. The guilt is pretty consuming. 

I've kept tabs on them. I'm not so arrogant as to say that I specifically was the cause, but like... some of them have had some difficulties, and they're the type that might be caused by not being sure whether your friend is alive or dead. 

I imagine it's hard to believe I really cared about them after what I did. If I’m being totally honest, the fact that I’m still here comes down to luck. The entire reason this happened was that I honestly believed they were better off not knowing me, and it still feels that way most of the time. 

Basically, I need a reality check. My brain says that apologizing now is better than never doing it, but the rest of me has trouble believing it.

Is it *kind* for me to try to apologize now? I don’t want to reopen old wounds. I also don’t want to deny them any closure they need, or anything I could do for them. We may not know each other anymore, but I owe them the best parts of who I am.  

Is there anything I can say or do? If someone did this to you, what would you want to hear 3 years later?

Tl;dr:

I ghosted my four best friends in college- like, *best friends*. I don’t know how or whether I should apologize now, or let them forget me.",19Oct2020,1
85,"Hi r/advice,

There’s a guy I like, who I’ve only met once, that I’ve crushed on on Instagram for like a year now. We chatted a little bit but I think I came off super weird because he stopped responding to me when Ive tried to talk to him since. I even sent him a text and he didn’t respond. (When I initially got his number he did respond so it was weird). 

He watches literally all of my insta stories though and likes all my posts. I like his back when I see them too.  

So I’m confused... should I ask him to hang out again one more time or just assume he’s not into me. If I ask him what do you think that I should say? It’s also not really safe to hang out with new people now so I have that to consider as well. 

Thank you guys!",19Oct2020,1

I don't know how long it is going to take for me to get a part time job, and I don't know what my mental health will be like if I jump into living on my own. On top of that I dont know if next semester school will be in person or not (cuz covid). If I live on my own I would be doing a practicum, part time job, and full time classes so if classes are in person I would never be home. 

Now my cat is very anxious, when I first got him he was a stray and it took him a long time to stop screaming, to trust me and to not destroy everything including my arms. He is now a very sweet boy around me and my friends. he's a wonderful boy. He is territorial and cannot be around other cats and he is very anxious around strangers, especially men.   


SO what I did is I made a post on facebook trying to see if someone I know and trust will take him in permanently, but no one will. I had two people offer to temporarily foster him (both are men but i dunno i think leo could warm up to them eventually).   


Okay so here is are my options im debating between. I can make a post on facebook market place and see if a stranger will give him a permanent home or I can have him temporarily stay at a friends until I get my shit together. I just... am scared. I dont know whats going to happen next semester, and i dont know how long it will take to get my shit together. I also am scared to cause trauma to my boy by moving him all over the place, and thinking I left him. I also am scared to give him to a stranger.

Something and that was when it actually really hit me that I need to lose weight I have adhd to which can make it hard to set my mind to something also very hard to cut back on my eating ( I’m a fast eater which makes it hard to realize I’m full until it’s to late)

Anyway I started exercising for at least 2 to 3 hours a day cutting back on food (taking less not a big heaping pile and only eating at breakfast lunch and supper no snacks)
I’ve also started eating healthier that has been two months ago I’m not down to 170 but my weight seems to be all wonky.

Before I tell you what happened just know I did get my period that morning so it could be bloating but wouldn’t that have started with the period idk.

An hour or two ago before I  into the shower I checked my weight I was 165 I checked three times because I was surprised I usually only got down to 166 sometimes after my shower me and my sister watched a movie when I brushed my teeth I decided to check again and I was back to 170 and idk I’m started to worry because I’m trying so hard to lose it.

I’m not looking to become extremely under weight I just wanna get to maybe 150 somethings idk 148 would be the lowest idk I just wanna get in shape I guess you could say.

So idk any suggestions on how to lose the weight or what might be happening because those jumps happen all the time.",19Oct2020,1

I sometimes go and have dinner at my uncle and Aunt's house and that's great, but it's more or less the extent of my social life.

I'm missing the rest of my family, because I live under the local authority and I cut off from my toxic mother and I'm going through therapy and the more I learn, the more I realise she was emotionally and psychologically abusive. I was also physically abused by one of her ex boyfriends which she laughed at and I was sexually abused by the neighbour and she used to go on and on about him doing this and that and how wonderful he was, even after she knew. It took me years to realise how bad she was for me and I've only cut off fully around March this year. I started therapy about 1 and a half months ago, but I still miss my mother despite everything. 

I feel so lost, because I want my mum, but I know she's bad for me, I'm bored and lonely, having no luck getting a job and I'm getting very little sleep at night, hence the compensation during the day.

I’ve stopped using any kind of make-up. If you look closely, you can see very small bumps, some are merged together. I tried popping it, but nothing but water comes out. They are not blisters. They are skin colored, a little lighter than my normal skin. If I stretch it, there’s nothing there, only a lighter patch of skin. Sometimes it itches, most of the time I don’t feel anything. If I go over it with my finger it feels like nothing’s there. It’s only below my bottom lips. I don’t have anything over the rest of my body.

I don’t lick my lip and I don’t recall being allergic to something. I didn’t eat new things and I’m not using new things. I’ve checked for gluten but it was negative. I’ve gone to the doctor, she only said to come back if it gets red. She thought it was because of my lip balm. I don’t use it anymore but it’s still here. The next appointment is over 2 weeks.

103,"Hi I'm 25 was disowned by my family 1.5yr ago and I'm  slipping into hard drugs to stay alive. I take drugs to keep myself from becoming engulfed in thoughts and feelings of suicide. A year ago I was avidly against drugs and now I'm desperate for anything that will take the notion of time and reality away. 

I tried therapy and anti-depressants. I'm tapering off anti-depressants for several reasons. Not sure if its the withdrawal effects, but i feel more suicidal than usual. I cannot stop crying I just want it to end. 

I started taking vallium when it felt like if I didnt go to sleep I would end my life. Then started heavy smoking marijuana  everyday because it helped me get through the day. Now back to taking vallium and remeron because being high isnt enough to numb the pain. Purposely overdosed on tramadol 6 months ago and almost died (didnt because a friend saved my life).

I dont care about anything but I know what is happening and what I am doing is not okay. Trying to stay alive simply because I dont want to cause drama, but truely I would love to just never wake up again. I want it to be over. 

I'm trying to rationalize with myself. Make myself happy with hobbies and a better future, but I am in so much despair I care not for those petty things. I feel like a hyperaggressive fighting dog, that is more convenient for society euthanize than to deal with. How is it humane to keep someone so miserable who will not get better alive? At this point I have no hopes of getting better. Therapy, time, meditation, religion, hobbies, purpose, none of that have helped. Its not that I dont love me, I'm just tired of this game we call life. I dont want to play it anymore...

But I am trying to like the game ""life"". Im trying. Failing. Help...

110,"Basically overall no complaints. Half decent job, single, no kids, no debt yet, 30 F.

However, I hate routines. If I have any routine, its generally speaking:

1. Get home from work

2. Feed pets

3. Roll blunt and pour a drink

4. Sit on deck with my door propped for the cats to come and go

5. Chill with cats and/ or sometimes company for a bit 

From there either take the cats for a stroller walk, read a book, or watch a documentary. Sometimes go out to eat. I know, lame lol

Weekends: its anyone's guess. Just usually focused on decent food and drink outings, or meal prep and supplying my mini bar so I can chill at home and have some friends over. Take cats on walks weather permitting, maybe hike bike or swim if its warm out.

I do have company sometimes, but I do like to veg out on my own too. My two cats are my world and we cuddle in the morning and watch TV together at night. They  love documentaries, especially sea creatures.

Sounds fun right?

Well yeah. Til you realized your 30, no kids still (which is honestly fine imo), no husband (once again, nbd I feel!) And everyone asking me ""**why not??**

Honestly I don't get it. Why can't I just be happy? Everyone has regrets and things idk why everyone is telling me what mine will be. I look forward every day to coming home and seeing my cats, cuddling, letting them out with me to feel the breeze. Filling the bird feeders so they can watch the birds. It makes me happy.

However I do acknowledge that I use substances as a crutch and wonder if I might feel differently if that weren't the case.

And yes I have friends who drink and smoke every day but I don't see them everyday so its not like they're a daily trigger for me.

I enjoy days where I play binaural beats on low and read a book and put some bird video on the TV for the cats. I think its so peaceful I am not sure why people would constantly question why that makes me happy and ask me why I don't have x y or z yet.

116,"Hello! First time posting. Need some advice. This might be a bit rambling, I apologize. You can skip to the last paragraph if I ramble too much. 

My friends Adam and Valerie accidentally betrayed my trust. I'm actually not that upset at them, as I understand. I've worked with Val for 12 years and we are like sisters, but I've known Adam for 8 years. They started dating about 2 years ago, and am so happy for them. But we all moved to a new town for work, and met Larry.

Now, the first day I met Larry, something was off. But Adam really loves handing out with Larry. To me, he is very two-faced and we have had beef in the past (if you are bored enough, my other post on reddit AITA, about splitting 50%, is when I stopped trusting Larry) but I just.. deal with him to keep Adam and Valerie around. I hate making waves, but it is getting into some rough waters and I need help. 

Larry pissed off a coworker lately, Dan. Dan is that older, wiser guy and I kinda view him as a second father. Larry did almost the same thing to Dan as he did to me, and I told him in a week, he will text and apologize. Lo and behold, Larry did, but Dan is also leery of Larry now. And Dan told me how Larry told him I got a DUI.

Like many in my shoes, I am a bit embarrassed for my actions that night. I actually am now forced in therapy and believe I have some PTSD to work through. I actually was pulled over on the side of the highway, and went quietly. I have a lot to work through, but the only people who knew about my DUI is Adam and Val. As Dan told it, Adam had called both Larry and Dan the night of my DUI to see if anyone had seen me. On a personal note, I was not in a good place, and was glad people were worried. Neither picked up, but Larry asked about the call the next day, and one of them (assuming Adam because they are the best of bros) told Larry I had been arrested and he, unprompted, went to Dan the next day, and told him, even said Adam told him not to tell anyone. Now, most people would be upset,  but like I mentioned earlier, I'm actually not. I get it. Larry can be pushy for information, and Adam is a big ole softy. 

The issue is Veteran's Day. Almost 7 years ago, I had the unexpected and unpleasant experience of coming across a 11 day old corpse, in the Florida heat. My mother. She was a drunkard, and I tried to check up on her monthly, even if she only hurled insults. Valerie knows the broadstrokes- I told everyone I went to the doorway, but to you internet, I think I went inside. And I word it like that because I lost 2 minutes that day. At 5:04 pm I pushed the door open and my next memory is at 5:06, on the phone with 911. I dream of that door a lot, especially around November 11th. 

I am angry about the situation. I have been for 7 years. But I do not know how to deal with how I feel, so I bury it and only deal with it when they pop up. I'm actually relieved I am finally getting the help I need, though I am sorry the root I foolishly took. I've been screaming for help under my own gag for a long time. Sorry, went on a tangent. 

I am worried Adam told Larry about my mother. Val knew because, well, 12 years of being coworkers. And I told Adam one drunken night, because I felt bad one half knew. Larry knows I found a body around Veteran's Day,  but never mentioned whose. 

How do I approach Val and Adam about knowing they told Larry about my DUI. I'm not upset, but I need to know if they told him anything else because I have to mentally prepare. Otherwise, I will go aggressive and punch something or someone if Larry tries to use that knowledge against me.",19Oct2020,1
117,"I (26M) am very interested in this girl (23M) and we have been friends for years. I confessed to her 2 years ago and never got an answer.

Fast forward to last night, she stayed over at my place and if it was any other girl, the signals that she was giving would have been obvious that she is interested in me, but she is an overly open person who is abnormally friendly so I have simply dismissed all these ""Signals"".  

After talking to a couple friends, I am freaking out of the fact that I may have just ruined my chance to be with her, I will be seeing her next week, but I don't know how normal it is for people to give up soon after giving hints. I am debating calling her and asking her, but I know it would be better to do in person. This is stressing me like no other, I cannot sleep, I cannot do my errands, I cannot work, I barely ate today.

My thinking is that a girl that would give up so soon after giving such signals for the first time is not even worth my time. Another thing is I really do not care, I want to know what she thinks about and what she feels about me NOW. I cannot function at all. I want to wait until I see her next, but if I cannot function I will have to call her up.

Is there any advice for this? I know timing is everything when it comes to a relationship, and I don't want to mess up my chance with her, I have barely any experience with relationships.",19Oct2020,1

Basically in OLD lingo *any* interaction or response is understood as interest. I’m a friendly guy and like to connect with people no matter what but I don’t want to lead her on if thats what it translates. It sucks either way. Hopefully I’ll find someone and be done with OLD soon. So is it the right thing to do nothing?

If a mod could reach out to me somehow, or if someone could give me some solid advice that will be fantastic. I have some screenshots and more info on the matter.

122,"For the past couple years or so I’ve felt completely isolated from everyone, I don’t know why, I’ve have people I talk to on a daily basis like my family and some people from classes, but it feels like nobody really knows me. I feel like I need someone who I can open up to and actually say how I feel but every time I start to get close to someone and show them who I am it feels like they start to avoid me. 

This has happened about 3 times with girls I was interested in who went on a couple dates with me, then on about the fourth or fifth dates when the conversations get more involved they completely stop caring about me. Two of them started ignoring me outright and one of them said she wanted to go back to being friends so I cut her out of my life because I knew she just felt bad for me.

I know it’s my fault because it keeps happening, but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I want to ask them but I know they’ll ignore me or I’ll just get a pitiful answer like “it’s not you it’s me”. It has even happened with a friend group who when I start to open up to them they ignore me, they even made a separate group chat to make plans without me that I know about but don’t want to say anything about because I know I couldn’t handle the confrontation. 

I don’t think I’m a bad person, I think I’m generally kind and thoughtful, I’m not stupid and am currently taking a business program at a decent university, I’m not in bad shape, I don’t think I’m ugly, I think Im a decently nice person, but for some reason I just repel every person that I try to get close to. 

Has anybody ever had a similar experience that can offer insight into what I’m doing wrong?

127,"Hey. So I don't know what to. 

It's his first year of middle school and all of his friends went to the other middle school in town so he has to make new friends. His way of doing that is asking if they want to play video games with him. Which is normally among us.

Apparently some kid told the whole school that he's a lying piece of sh*t and that he's horrible and mean and etc. My brother speculates it's because he killed the guy he was playing with (in among us) when my brother was the imposter. But still, that's how the game works.

Anyway, because of this bully, nobody wants to talk to him and in the classes that he doesn't have the bully and/or the bully's friends, he's afraid to try and become friends with anyone since he thinks they'll probably hate him too.

And he doesn't want to tell any teachers because he'll then be called a tattle tale and also he won't tell our parents. He said he's fine not having friends. But I know it's hurting him and how views school. He really like his extracurricular classes and I don't want that ruined for him. 

But truly. It sucks not having friends to hangout with at lunch. And having a bunch of rude boys out get you in woodshop and other classes. 

He doesn't want me to say anything to our parents and I just don't what to do. I want help him. He's struggling and all though he doesn't think that I love him, but I do. I don't want him to suffer like this. Getting bullied is rough.",19Oct2020,1

But recently, i’ve been having a hard time feeling anything. Not sure how to explain it. My bf M(22) has recently been pointing out that I don’t laugh anymore. He asks why i’m not happy like I used to be. I think he thinks it’s because of him, but it’s not. He is my best friend and I love him with my whole heart, and I don’t want him to feel this way. 

I have just been feeling numb, meh, out of it. I haven’t cried in so long, which is unusual for me. But I haven’t really felt sad either. I also know I don’t laugh and smile as much anymore. I don’t know. It’s been hard for me to get excited about doing anything I love. I’ve really been trying to push myself to do things I used to love doing. But i just feel uninterested.

Before COVID I thought what I was experiencing was normal because everyone online seems to make jokes about forgetting homework or attention and so on.

I'm 23 years old, and lately I've been thinking on quitting my job pretty seriously. For background. I'm currently working an engineering job in the New Project Integration area of a manufacturing company. I have been working there for almost 2 years now.

Almost ever since I started in this job, I was assigned specifically a project to develop and launch (on the manufacturing side) alongside some other co-workers. During my first months I had a lot of guidance and help from other co-workers, some of which I consider friends right now. 

At the beginning I felt good with my job, things weren't exactly easy, but most of the times I managed to come on top of the problems that came up feeling fulfilled and satisfied with the effort I was making, knowing that I was continuously learning new stuff and getting good at the job. 

The problem started some time ago. Ever since the project I was assigned to launched there have been a lot of issues, specifically related to the tooling, testing machines and other equipment. As I said before, at the beginning I was able to handle it well, trying to learn what I could from every problem. With time I started getting more and more frustrated with the issues that came up. Now, hear me out, I have never been one that gives up easily, but the problem here is that a lot of this problems are starting to feel unsolvable, and so far no one seems to know how to solve them. It feels like every time we find a ""solution"" it just works for a while, until the same issues happen again.

Lately, I dread going to work almost everyday. Sometimes it gets hard to even get out of bed to go to work. At work everyday I'm just constantly trying to pretend that everything is fine and just waiting for the time to go home. 

I being thinking on quitting my job, but I don't know if it would be a smart choice. I'm afraid of not finding any job, or getting a job where I'll just end up feeling the same. I don't know what to do.",19Oct2020,1

147,"A little back ground... I am a college graduate and 24. During high school and college I worked for a construction company as laborer. It was really hard work and at the time, but I was too busy thinking I needed to use my college degree in order to make myself happy/fulfilled. Looking back I really enjoyed the work. 

After graduating I continued to work as a laborer and eventually took a job as a field adjuster for insurance claims. For those who don’t know, the insurance claims industry is extremely fast paced and high stress to say the least. Most people don’t last. I did this gig for about two years where I learned a lot about what I like and don’t. I like appraising/estimating jobs  but I absolutely hate the insurance industry. I also learned that I thrive being out in the field but cannot stand being in the office doing office work. Realizing I love being in the field I enrolled in HVAC R school. I have been loving every minute of school and i am really enjoying the hands on work. 

After two years as a field adjuster I decided to apply for a role as a construction project manager for a restoration company . At my current role I am practically my own general contractor with my own book of business and I restore peoples homes after insurance claim (ie.a fire, plumbing leak or storm damage). 3 months in and 1 hurricane and a tornado later I am completely overwhelmed and overworked. One joke of an employee wouldn’t take any new jobs during storms so that left me and one other project manager to handle everything. I now have 50+ people’s homes to tend to and there is not enough time to do my role while going to school. My boss even told me he had no intention of loading me up with this many jobs being so new to a job. 

Being only a few months into this job I am really conflicted. I’ve never been  a PM before so I am learning learning as I go. Stressed beyond belief, stay up late dreading going to work, persistent anxiety, sometimes i can barely get out of bed to go to work, calls and text from people’s 7 days a week at any hour. Simply put miserable and dread. 

To wrap everything up, I really want to fully immerse myself in hvac.  my parents are saying to stay at my current role since I’ve only been there 4 months but they are unaware of my unhappiness and when I try to explain I still get the same response.  

Is it wrong to leave after 4 moths with so many projects? Would I be screwing them over with only 1 pm? Will I be Burning bridge? I’m paying for school out of pocket so why am I continuing to put myself through hell. I’ve been offered apprenticeships but I sadly declined because I thought  I would put my current company in a bad place. 

Sorry for the rambling but I could use some guidance",19Oct2020,1

I’ve been waking up several times when i sleep. Roughly every 1-2 hours. It makes it hard to get adequate sleep.

151,"I've recently left an abusive household and I can't go back. I'm also disabled which makes everything a bit more stressful. I'm currently having a very hard time being able to live up to the standard my university demands and while I'm not failing any of my classes but I am close. I feel like I could be losing ground and I'm trying my absolute hardest to get back on track. While I have been making very great strides I also feel like I need a backup plan. With my disabilities I cannot work for very long and I'm not sure I'd be able to really hold a job like I'd need to. I do get certain benefits but even then I wouldn't have enough money to afford rent, food and bills. I could potentially do art for money but I would also not be able to make the amount of money I need. I don't really have friends I can stay with nor do I know extended family well enough to go for that route.

155,"Alright this may be a bit of a long one. It’s less of a specific incident and more of a situation. I also want to try to give both sides of the story to the best of my ability. Also sorry in advanced, I’m on mobile. 

The situation: me (f22) and my fiancée (f22; “Sam”) invited our friend from college (f23; “Ana”) to come live with us. We just bought our first home and had an extra bedroom. She was living with her family back home after we graduated college. Her step dad is a jerk (not abusive, just rude and annoying) and her mom was defending him instead of Ana. Ana was very conflicted about leaving home, as she’s very close with her siblings, but she the situation with her mom and her stepdad was becoming a bit too much. Plus, Sam and I live in a city that most of our college friends moved to after graduation and Ana doesn’t have any friends in her family’s area. She stayed with us for a few weeks a couple of times before ultimately deciding to move in for the foreseeable future. 

Where things get messy: 
1) The money/rent issue. When Ana came to live here, I was in the process of leaving my job at a local bar and moving to an office job, I put in a good word with my old boss and she basically took over my old position at the bar. Perfect timing! Only problem is that job only gives her 6 hour shifts about 5 days a week. Thus, she only makes about $700/month. Sam and I are pretty understanding about that, and we don’t want to overwhelm her with bills. So we only made her pay $150 a month (that includes her rent and some grocery money). In reality, if we totaled up her third of everything (rent/utilities/groceries) it would be about $700 all on its own. We told her that each month we’ll increase the rent by $50 until she’s worked up to about $450 (again, she’s a really good friend and we don’t want to overwhelm her). However, there have been a lot of things happening recently that make us want to rethink that agreement. 

2) The car issue. 2 days before Ana was supposed to move in, Ana’s mom told her she wouldn’t let Ana bring her car with her when she moved out. Granted, the car was technically her mom’s, but Ana has had the car as “hers” for 6 years. Sam and I were a bit blindsided by that, but we said that we’d just come get her because we wanted her out of that situation at home. Sam drove 3 hours there, helped Ana load her stuff in the car, and drove 3 hours back home. Ana seemed hopeful that her mom would give in and give her the car once it was clear Ana would not be giving in to her mom’s tactics to convince her to stay. It’s been almost 4 months. Her mom hasn’t spoken to her since. Only once, to text her a half-hearted “happy birthday” a few weeks after she moved in. For the most part, Sam and I have had no problem with her using our car. We have a Prius which is great on gas, plus Sam and I both have work from home positions, so Ana could use the car to get to work and run out whenever she needed. (My car which is a 20 year old Honda, maybe worth $500, until recently was under my parents’ insurance, and I was forbidden from letting my friends drive it). Sam and I drove my car as needed, but we really prefer to drive the Prius. Ana occasionally puts gas in the car, but we fill it up just as often and drive it half as much as she does. It’s been almost 4 months, and Ana has said next to nothing about saving up for a new car. She seems to just be hoping her mom will give in despite their entire lack of communication. Recently she brought the Prius home with a flat tire (not her fault, just some metal or something in the road). Sam put a spare on it and told Ana we’d get the tire replaced over the weekend. She could drive on the spare, but she’s need to be careful. The next day, we get a text from her after she gets off work letting us know she’s gonna go “hang out” with our friends across town. Sam and I were really annoyed that she drove an extra 20 minutes on the spare, and wondered if she was driving responsibly with the spare at all. In general, she’ll often take the car over to those friends house without letting us know until she’s halfway there, and not coming home until the next morning. I’m not her mom. But I’d like to know where our car is. Meanwhile, I just put the insurance for the Honda in my name. And there is an expectation that Ana will be driving my car from now on, and that she’ll have to pay the insurance on it ($144) because we honestly wouldn’t even keep the car if she didn’t need it. I just don’t want to pay that insurance on a car I don’t even drive, especially since Sam and I are planning on getting a new car soon. Once we do that, we’re planning on just giving Ana the car for free, as long as she transfers everything into her name. 

3) The food issue. Like I said, we only make her pay $150 every month (increasing by $50 each month) and that includes only about $50 in groceries. She’s also welcome to use her own money to go out to eat or buy food she wants to keep for herself. The main issue is that she seems to expect Sam and I to cook every night. Like I said, she works at a bar so she gets home pretty late (around 10-11). Sam and I work until 7 and 8. After which we do chores and then hang out. Sometimes we just don’t feel like cooking or don’t have enough groceries in the house to make something. Whenever that happens, Ana will wonder into our office and say something like “so were you guys planning to do anything for dinner or..?” if we respond with “nah we aren’t really hungry” she’ll sort of passive-aggressively say something like “oh okay.. I guess I’ll figure something out then”. She never offers to cook dinner for all of us. And typically complains that there isn’t enough food at the house for her to just make something for herself. We told her that she should start picking out specific things that she’ll want to make when we all go to the grocery. I guess she just forgets to while we’re there? Honestly, I’m kind of picky so it isn’t like I want her to cook for me, I just don’t want her to lowkey expect me to cook for her all the time. From her perspective, i do cook a lot of the time so I guess it makes sense to expect dinner to be made, but I wish she wasn’t so annoying about it sometimes. 

4. The pet issue. the household has 3 animals. Sam and I have a dog and a cat, and Ana brought her cat with her. Our cat is sorta bitchy, but she gets along mostly fine with our dog but she doesn’t seem to like Ana’s cat. Our dog is high-strung, and a bit of a trouble maker but he’s honestly a sweetheart. Her cat is very sweet, but also very skittish. When she moved in, we all agreed she should keep her cat in her room for a while because the cat is anxious and would be in a new place. Over the months, we’ve introduced her cat to my dog and let them sniff each other. He always gets over-excited and scares her cat, which leads to hissing an sometimes an attempt at scratching. Ana has been getting sick of having her cat cooped up in her room (with a litterbox) I suggested we get rubber nail caps for both cats so that they couldn’t hurt each other or the dog. I ordered a pack and we put them on our cat. I gave Ana 10 for her cat, offered to help her put them on, but her cat wasn’t a fan of me trying to help. Ana said she’d just do it herself a few at a time. It’s been almost a month and her cat only ever had 3 on at most. I’m insisting that both cats can’t be roaming the house without the rubber nails. Ana still wanted to see how her cat would do with being out in the house for a few hours. So, we put our cat in an enclosed room and but we put a muzzle on our dog to protect him if Ana’s cat tried to scratch him. It mostly went fine, Ana’s cat would wander out and run away as she pleased, but we haven’t really revisited the idea. Meanwhile, like I said, my dog is.. a lot. we’ve paid $800 in training but he’s still young and acts up sometimes. He’ll steal food off the table if it’s left unattended and he’ll jump up on you and generally doesn’t listen all the time. But he’s genuinely a sweet dog. I can get why it’s hard to live with him, but Ana knew him going into the situation. Additionally, Sam and I have talked about getting a second dog to help occupy him. Every time we bring it up Ana acts like that would be a terrible idea and mentions that she wants to get another cat too. 

5. The chores issue. None of us like doing dishes, and we don’t have an automatic dishwasher. We decided to make it a rotating chore where each of us has to do all the dishes every couple of days when the sink gets full. We would make each of us just do their respective dishes, but we figured since we often share dinner it wouldn’t make sense when deciding who would have to wash pots and pans, etc. this works mostly okay, except that Sam and I always have to ask/remind Ana to do it when it’s her turn. She does it, but she always waits until an hour before she has to go to work and it always makes me feel like she might just not do it, so I feel like I have to ask. On top of that, she doesn’t do ANY other chores around the house. She took the trash out for the first time last week (after 3 months of living here) because Sam asked her to. She didn’t even know where we keep the trash bags (under the sink, like everyone does.) she’s never swept, never cleaned the bathroom, never done any general picking up outside of keeping her belongings in her own room. Sam and I talked to her about this 2 months ago, and she said she never knows what she should clean. We told her to just clean anything that seemed messy, sweep or whatever. We honestly didn’t think we’d have to ask her to help out more. When she came to visit she was always more than happy to help out around the house, but the minute she actually moved in that entire aspect changed. She doesn’t usually leave her room (because her cat can’t come out with her) so we don’t really expect her to clean the common areas that much, but NOTHING in 3 months? Feels a bit off to us..

6. The social issue. Like I said, she mostly stays in her room because the cat has to stay in there with the door shut. Every once in a while she’ll come out to use the bathroom or get food or whatever, but she doesn’t really “hang out” with us anymore. We had a family meeting a while ago (about a lot of these issues actually - clearly not much has changed or I wouldn’t be here) and she said she feels cut off from us because when she comes out of her room we’re working and our desks faced away from the door. We changed the layout of our office to be more inviting, and even brought a futon into the room so she could sit in there with us if she wanted (our jobs aren’t very labor-intensive, and we often have a show/YouTube playing throughout the day). Despite all of that, she still never comes in to just hang out. We’ve tried to make an effort to hang out with her more when we’re off work by inviting her to play video games with us (she someone who “doesn’t like” video games, but to Sam, that’s like saying you “don’t like” music, and you just haven’t found a type you like. We actually got her really into breath of the wild for a while.) but lately every time we try to play a game with her, it ends with her getting mad (she’s really competitive), getting overwhelmed (again, not a gamer), or refusing to actually try to play. Plus, we’re always kind of nervous to invite her to play with our friends because she always says something rude. She’ll call them an idiot for making a certain choice or whatever. If they knew each other it would be one thing, but she just acts like a totally different person when she’s around anyone besides us. It seems kind of hopeless. I’d do things she wants to do, but she never really does anything. She just reads or watches tv in her room (valid things, but not really group activities). 

7. Other random issues.
- when she moved in, she complained that she didn’t have any furniture to put her stuff in (we already had an extra bed that we bought for her to use when she was visiting but there was nothing else). We got a bedroom set from a friend for free so she’d have something to put her clothes in besides the closet. She complained about the aesthetic of the dresser set and bought new handles to make it look better (she can’t do any handy work so Sam and I put them on for her). She also wanted a China cabinet to store her books/kickbacks in. I found her one on Facebook marketplace and set up picking it up. She paid for the cabinet, but Sam and I ended up paying for the almost $100 Uhaul fee for all of that furniture. 
- sometimes she’s just outright mean. She’s a negative person in general, we knew that going in. We totally understand and like having a friendship where we can all shit on each other in good fun, but she says a lot of passive-aggressive/hurtful things that just get to me every once in a while. Sometimes I feel judged in my own house.
- she’s afraid of conflict. She dealt with a lot of abuse from her bio dad growing up, so conflict can be really triggering for her. She’ll often cry or lock herself up in her room when she’s overwhelmed (she also is clinically depressed and has anxiety) Sam and I know this, so we want to try not to be too hard on her when we’re trying to figure out all of this. But sometimes it feels like we’re being too easy on her and not making it clear that her living here is more of a burden than a positive thing a lot of the time. 

Altogether. I’m not sure what to do here. It sucks because Sam and I invited our best friend into our home because we thought it would be fun and would help her get out of her parent’s house. And we’re learning she’s a lot different from us. We’ve known her for 3 years and even lived with her in dorms for a semester, but we never had issues like this. We’re starting to regret the whole thing, but it’s not like we want to ruin our friendship. I don’t really have any other friends besides Ana..

We’re kind of at a point where we need to give her some kind of ultimatum where we’re responsible for a lot less of her day-to-day existence. She needs to clean up around the house more. She needs to buy/make her own food. She needs to figure out a car for herself or we’ll give her the Honda if she puts the insurance in her name. We just aren’t sure how to go about all of this. 

If anyone has additional questions (there’s a lot to unpack here, and I don’t think I did a great job at explaining both sides) I’m open to answering everything. If anyone has some advice I’d love to hear it.",19Oct2020,1

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now . We’ve been through so much together in just this 8 months. I really do love him with all my heart but the actions he keeps showing me demonstrate straight disrespect. I can’t help but to feel more and more insecure and unwanted by him daily . The first 6 months of dating we had incredible sex 1-2 times a day . He knows i like to have sex daily . These past three months a few things have risen up . In August , he re-added his ex - who I politely asked him to unadd -which he had no problem doing so . I found out because she showed up in my suggested friends and I clicked on her profile and he liked her most recent profile picture . I brought it up to him he says they don’t talk but he didn’t want to leave her hanging ? I’m fine with that because I know for a fact they really don’t. We started to have less and less sex since September started . We’ve had sex 4 times in the past month which is leaving me so deprived : I brought it up to him today and he shrugged it off!! . Well here’s where it really all started harming my mental health .. a few weeks ago I was using his phone because my phone was broken and I was closing out of the apps and I saw a random Instagram model in a bikini on the screen which kinda sent me to look at his recent searches . To my surprise more and more Instagram models . Specific ones . I was so hurt! It feels so much more personal he’s doing it for a Instagram girl and not a porno or something . We weren’t having sex like we used to it has slowed to 1-2 times a week. He told me when we first started dating he would never jerk off to another girls picture . He said I was the girl of his dreams blah blah blah  .. not to mention the fact I have taken collections and collections of nudes for him , I’m fine with porn , and I’m willing to have sex anytime he wants (I’m also definitely not boring in bed 🙄). I brought it up to him and he got furious , he slammed doors , called me crazy, changed his password and refuses to give it to me ever again (++ to this he knows this makes me upset and he jokes with me about it , bringing his phone into the gas station saying he doesn’t trust me with it) . I asked him why he has these girls on his Instagram and he admitted he jerks off to their pictures . I told him I understand but that it really hurts me because he told me he would never do that at one point in time and it causes me to overthink my insecurities and our sex/relationship. He said he would stop . Weve only had sex twice since then (which I’m not happy with!) .. I’ve given him BJ some days but he won’t do anything with me for my pleasure . Yesterday I asked him if we could have sex , he said he already jerked off the night before which really hurt me . So of course I gave him a snobby answer “oh yeah to who?” And he said “you of course.” My guts were telling me that was a lie but I had no way to prove he wasn’t and I actually was trusting he actually stopped . But .. last night I fell asleep earlier than him and I woke up in the night , his phone was right next to me unlocked and he was asleep . I couldn’t help but to check and see if he’s still jerking off to these girls since we’ve had so little sex .. I do feel very guilty for going on his phone but I couldn’t handle the uncertainty anymore . I found his old insta search history deleted but he had about 5 new searches of specific Instagram girls with the raciest pics I’ve ever seen damn near . Obviously indicating he’s doing this again . It also hurts that he’s searching up the same females  on Instagram that he personally knows over and over again but I haven’t brought that up yet. 

Now , I don’t know if what’s really bothering me is the fact that he can’t be honest and tell me how he really felt about his behaviors , if he saw nothing wrong w/ his actions he could’ve told me and then I could decide what I wanted to do from there . Or the fact that my needs aren’t being met because he would rather do it himself to an Instagram girl . 

This is really impacting me I’m struggling deciding what to do. I really don’t want to bring up the fact I looked through his phone again because it will definitely get turned around on me . But it’s really hurting me inside and I know this is really going to impact our future . I can’t stop thinking about it . I feel very unwanted by him when he’s the only man I crave . I don’t flick my bean to men on Instagram which is why I really don’t understand why he can’t just not do it.  Also I’m not unattractive I know that for a fact , I go to the gym I’m fit , I buy new lingerie a lot . I’m not doing anything wrong !! I don’t understand why these girls have more of his attention .

TL;DR boyfriend claimed he’d stop jerking off to random girls on Instagram , he lied and continues to do it which is impacting our relationship a lot little does he known.

I just want some guidance/advice on how I should go about this . Am I being insanely insecure or have I set reasonable boundaries that he violated and lied about ?",19Oct2020,1
160,"This is going to be a mess, sorry if it doesn't make to much sense, I'll probably start rambling on. I (16m) am very depending on any female attention, not including family, and since my gf cheated on me 6 months ago, I dont think I've fully been happy a single day. Everyday I feel cold, video games are starting to not help, and just make me more sad, and all I want is for someone to hold me. My standers are so low at this point, I'd take literally anyone is is slightly cute and would be nice to me and want to cuddle. But I cant talk to anyone because of online school, and I cant go anywhere to meet someone cuz I'm 16 like I said before. And i really dont want to wait until normal school to ask someone because i dont know if I'll make to then. And everytime I've talked about this people just say itll get better, you'll find someone, but it isnt true, all the people I have asked how so far have already been talking to someone or already has a partner. Litterly all I want in life is to have a female companion that'll hold me and cuddle me and sit and cuddle whatching movies for hours on end just enjoying time together but I cant have that because I cant meet anyone, i know it's not because I'm ugly because I'm not, I've been called cute a surprising amount of times and I would say I have a really nice personality, and I would only treat her the best possible ways.

I met his friends, he met my flatmates and friends too. I enjoyed his company and I'd like to think he did too.

Fast forward to the Christmas holidays and we messaged after the New Year but then something happened and which I won't get into but it has been resolved. I just want to express that he did nothing wrong in this case, it was just something unfortunate which happened to me. We share the same course as well so the first time we spoke after the holidays and exams was on the second day back in university. He said he still wanted to continue after the incident and I was grateful about. He also said that he wanted to be more involved in the salsa society which he attended almost everyday so he was quite busy. He wanted a break and I agreed, I was a bit upset about my exams anyway and wanted some time myself.

You see when he said he wanted a break, I thought he was just talking about sex. I thought we could still meet up every now and then to hang out. I mean we did do that last semester. In hindsight, I don't really understand why he said that he wanted a break. We weren't angry with each other and saying you want a 'break' from someone is what you'd say to a girlfriend who you've been having relationship issues with, not a friend...

Every other week, I’d invite him over to mine whether that is to study, watch Netflix or just talk but he’d either have something else at the moment, which is understandable. Or he would just ignore my message. He'd never initiate anything between January and March. I found it incredulous how we lived about a 10-15 minute walk from each other, take the same course and join the same club yet we were becoming strangers again. We'd even stop saying hi in lectures and it hurt. We were drifting apart and it felt so soon after being so intimate. I know friendships drift and shift but this felt so jarring. By mid-March, I became frustrated. We were planning to finally meet up but then COVID-19 and the lockdown was becoming more prevalent and my mum really wanted to know my plans for coming back home. With time running out I shared my thoughts about how I felt the last few weeks and a lot spilled out. He wasn’t happy and the next day we argued through texts messages. We haven’t communicated since then.

Today it has been over 7 months since I last saw him. Everything is online now and 2 days ago I heard he's in France. All I want is closure for why he basically ghosted me but I may need to accept the fact that I may probably never know why or see him again. I miss our conversations, his smile, confidence, dancing, free-spirited nature and his very being but I need to find peace with myself on this situation.

I believed that my friend with benefits would actually be my good friend. I’d rather have the friend part than the ‘benefits’ because I find friendships to be more valuable overall. I just feel used if he never felt the same about me.

So to anyone reading this, how do I move on?",19Oct2020,1

I don’t know how to start this but my parents always want me home by 10, I have my own car that I pay and my own insurance that I pay too but my parents still don’t let me go. Even when I had a girlfriend and they knew I was at her house they still wanted me to be home at 10.

It’s bullshit, I just want to be able to go out and have fun live a normal life. I don’t smoke and I don’t drink. I’m still in school, I get good grades and stuff. It was somewhat my parents fault my relationship with ex. She wanted to me to stay longer and I wanted to but my parents wouldn’t let me. They would just say we all work early tomorrow. 

I get that they work early but I’m not asking them to stay awake for me until I get home. I feel like in a fucking prison most of the times. 

Mom and dad woke up once I was gonna sneak off right now and they got fucking pissed. Especially my mom, she was saying that if I wanna leave whatever time I want that I should get my own place and balahahah. It pisses me off I can’t have a social life. Even with my cousins playing soccer they want me home early. The fucking soccer field is so fucking close you literally just cross the road and you’re there. I don’t know what to do no more.

170,"So I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for about 3years now we’ve been having problems and I had a conversation with her about the “long leash” rule that an OP taught me which is not being behind the girl every single moment, not being overprotective and basically not holding her back if she wants to leave. 

I told her that I was gonna start acting that way and she threatened to leave so I told her go for it and she left then came back two days later begging for a second chance and I gave it to her because she had given me many chances when I’ve messed up. But recently I just haven’t been really feeling the same with her anymore, stuff with her and me is just really awkward and it’s not the same as before.

I’ve been also talking with my female best friend I’ve known her for around four years and I kind of have feelings for her.

175,"Thanks in advance for anyone responding, even reading it is appreciated I will try to be as concise as possible.

In 2017, I met someone that is very near to my heart. We briefly worked together at the same place, which is how we met, but then shortly after got different jobs. We kept in touch though, and ended up going on a couple of dates. 

Another key piece of information is this was all before I finally got diagnosed with PTSD in the fall of 2018 (I had suspected, but for whatever reason I neglected to do anything about it for a long time). Long story short, when I spent time with her, it was one of the few times in the past few years that I can remember feeling truly happy. I was terrified. I was so scared of feeling at the possibility of having to be vulnerable with someone that I ran. I told her that I wasn't feeling things romantically, which was a lie. 

We have kept in contact, even after she moved back to California almost two years ago now. We just caught up on zoom last night and we still talk the same way we did when we first met. 

I have been in therapy since my diagnosis and I have made a great deal of progress in the past two years. Regret is amongst my greatest hits with my therapist, though. I have always been my own worst critic, and letting go of regret is especially tough. My therapist and I got on the subject of it again in our last meeting, and while he absolutely did not tell me that I should, he told me that sometimes being open with people, even if it is painful, is a way to move past regret. 

Today, I found myself drafting a letter to her coming clean that I lied when I told her I did not feel a romantic connection. I saved it on my computer, and who knows if I'll ever send it. I have no expectations or anything, especially since we live almost 2000 miles away now, and I don't know how she feels. I am concerned of how she will react. She is a wonderful person, and I don't want to do anything to hurt her. I am just trying to find some peace, and not be carrying so much regret all the time. 

To me it feels like I wrote that letter for myself and there may be no benefit to opening up to her about it 3 years later. Perhaps my therapist is right though, and being open with her may be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps some peace will follow. Just to reiterate, my therapist did NOT at all tell me to write her a letter nor did he tell me what to do.

Once again, thanks to anyone who reads or responds.",19Oct2020,1

I used to be able to do really well in school but I just can’t anymore.

178,"I am a senior in high school and my educational plans have been completely turned upside down by the pandemic. I saved all of my electives for senior year so I could breeze through, but now they aren’t offering any electives except for music, so I have to take advanced core classes instead. Among these is advanced chemistry. At first I was okay with this because our school’s chemistry teacher is notoriously awesome and everybody loves him, but he retired early due to the pandemic, so we have a new teacher. She did not teach science before, she taught French. Normally science is kind of my subject, but the way this teacher presents assignments is causing me to struggle quite a bit (I understand the ideas, but she is so disorganized with Google classroom that I never know what to do). She doesn’t give instruction, she just gives assignments. I have emailed her several times to request extra help or just to clarify what we are supposed to be doing, but she never responds. However, she responded almost immediately to my email asking about her late work policy. At first I assumed I was the only one struggling, but she accidentally left a picture of her gradebook open and as it turns out the highest grade in the class is a C- (coming from a kid who has otherwise had a 4.0 her entire high school career). At this point, she is actively neglecting teaching us and doesn’t seem to care a whole lot, and it is hurting her students. I don’t think we should face the consequences of her inaction, but I feel like if I tell her why everyone is struggling she will just hold it against me for the rest of the year, which is not something I need on my plate. I understand that she probably doesn’t like the position she’s put in either, but I don’t think that’s fair to us.

179,"First off I want to say anyone who takes the time to read this thank you. 

I’m a 20 year old who has finally came to the realization that my life dream is not a possibility and it’s time to grow up, problem is I never pictured myself living this long. I grew up to a single mother who always struggled to give us the best life possible and growing up since I could remember the only thing I wanted to do as become a professional video game player. As cringe and unrealistic it was it was all I wanted. When growing up people in school always ask you want you want to do and what you plan on studying but for me I could never answer this because I didn’t know. 



Fast forward to high school I started to develop social anxiety and started to become really self conscious of myself and even became depressed, I also practically gave up on focusing on school because in my head if I were to live long enough to get out of high school I would be pursuing becoming a esports athlete and if I didn’t I would be dead and wouldn’t need to worry about it. I spent years of high school playing a certain game like it was my job playing 8-12 hours a day trying to pursue my only hope for a job I would enjoy. 



Fast forward some more time to the present day, I have over 7k hours on the game and sadly have not progressed to the level I would need to be at for my age to have a chance to go pro. I’ve lost motivation to play the game and am facing the consequences of not preparing myself for the real world. I have no will to work or go to school nor do I any idea what I would want to do. I find myself just trying to stay positive but find it hard to wake up and live myself. All I want to do is not exist, I don’t wanna die I just don’t wanna feel this constant ache and pain inside hating who I am. 



The only time I find myself feeling happy is when I smoke weed which has motivated me enough to try and get a job, but I still feel so hopeless with no future. I feel like my life has no purpose nor do I want to give it purpose I just want to be alone some where without worrying about the world or people. I have not told anyone about these things and am just looked at a quiet kid who likes to play games, when in reality I fucking hate living and despise everyone except my mom. I don’t know what to do and I’m scared of falling down a slope of hard drugs and depression but just don’t have any will or want to do anything with my life.



Any advice would be appreciated thank you so much.",19Oct2020,1
180,"Throwaway account.

I’m 17 years old, currently completing grade 12. I should have graduated last June, but I had to take a few months off last year due to mental health reasons, and that made me fall way way behind, so now I’m technically graduating late.

I genuinely think that I’m an idiot. I can’t do simple maths, I need to use a calculator to do small multiplications and additions. Where I live, you learn how to do fractions when you’re in grade 7, cut to 6 years later and I have no clue how to do them, amongst other things. I rely on the internet to help me every time.

I guess I’m more book smart, and really love to write stories. But even then, it’s difficult and it takes a long time for me to sit down and actually focus on something.

I’m the youngest of 4, and all of my older siblings have since moved out and are going to university. They’re all really smart, and make fun of me for being the “dumb one of the family”. My mom doesn’t usually openly say these things, but I can tell that I’m such a huge disappointment. I don’t even have my learners permit because I’m too scared to take the written test.

At this rate, I don’t know if I even want to try to go to university. Knowing how hard it is for me to get through high school, I wouldn’t be able to handle uni. But not going basically confirms that I’m the failure of the family, and I’m so scared that I’m just gonna grow up to be some lowlife who didn’t succeed in anything.

181,"My best friend and I go to different schools that are very far apart (california to ny), but we text each other pretty much every day.

I understand that she’s busy and I know that it’s unfair to need very fast responses all the time (she’s still usually responding within a day, it just takes maybe 12-15 hours), but I also see she’s active on instagram for a significant amount of time. It makes me so sad to see her active on instagram multiple times when I dm’ed her something I thought she’d like, and she doesn’t respond for another 7 hours, especially because she’s told me in the past she takes much longer to respond to people she doesn’t want to hear from. Also, before this week, she usually responded to things within the hour, and she would never be active on social media if she took longer. I’m not sure if I should ask her about this or if I’m overreacting. I have OCD so I’m not sure if I’m just obsessing over this because of that, or if this is actually a warning sign that something is wrong with our friendship.",19Oct2020,1
182,"Hey there! I (16F) made myself a personal art Instagram account, mostly to share fun things I've been working on with a few of my friends. I have it as a public account, but I stay anonymous in it. Because of that anonymity and trust I have with my friends, I put some fairly personal things on it, which is where the problem starts. My mom somehow found my account and has been looking at what I post without my knowledge (until today). I'm fine with her seeing my artworks- I show them all to her anyways. It's the fact that I have some LGBTQIA+ stuff in my posts and bio that worries me. I realize earlier this year that I am asexual aromantic and a lot of the things I've been posting on my account have been ace themed. I also have ace and my pronouns in my bio, as well as a small pride flag in my icon. I'm out to all of the friends that know about the account, so it seemed like a safe move at the time to include and post these things. However, I got backed into a corner last month by my mom and told her I was aroace. She didn't accept that and told me I'm ""too young to know"". There's a whole other can of worms with that one, so I won't go into more detail with that. I kinda just ran back to the closet after that incident and never talked about it again. This is the main reason I don't want her to know about my account.

I need some advice moving forward from here. I could confront my mom and tell her about how I would like some personal space online, and that I'd appreciate her not checking out my Instagram? It seems like the most logical solution, but I'm not really ready to explain why I don't want her on it. I could also take the ace part out of my bio, but 1. that would be suspicious and 2. having it makes me happy. I could also block her, but that seems rude and may cause more problems than it solves.

But haven’t got much a response, which I know nothing I say or anyone says will make him stop until he actually wants to himself. But idk what to do. If I should keep nagging him about it, or it’s it’s worth it as he’s in a better mood while on it but I’m obviously scared about him ever ODing. But is it worth getting into a fight about it... as long as he not stealing my money for it or pawning any of my stuff for money for it (then I would be wilding and blow up about the subject to him) but I’m so confused how I should be feeling or reacting.  I wish saying I could leave him could be possible but I have no where else to go other then our apartment no family member/friends to take me in plus I kind of feel guilty I always said and am type woman be there for you ride or die through thick or thin.. plus we have a daughter together also.

197,My friends from work have shown me numerous videos of my son linking up with kids at parks and fighting them and also told me how my son would smoke at parks with friends. My friends told me their kids told them(their kids would be my sons peers) and i get its bad to smoke and fight and all but it honestly doesnt upset me. Obviously i care about my son and i dont want him doing these things but other parents act like its the end of the world and they feel so dissapponted at their kids and they have their heart broken by it and all but honestly i dont think its that big a deal.

198,"Hello everyone, first things first I hope you all are doing well and are safe with your loved ones during this pandemic!

Over this quarantine period I have just been working and chilling at home. I feel like I have slowly drifted away from my friends. They have cut connections with me and some of them have even lied to me in the process. I feel like one by one they are turning away and just slowly pushing me outside the friend group. When it happens I had many emotions going through my mind like ""am I the problem?"" And ""What did I do?"".

Because of covid-19 we haven't all hung out. They had a few get togethers without me... I figured all this out on social media. When I confronted one of them they lied to me and said ""are you sure? I'm pretty sure we invited you man.""

We dated for a little over a year. I was his first girlfriend because he said he was always shy before. We never had sex because he said that he wanted to respect me and not do that unless we ever got married.

When I broke up with him he said that he was disappointed but understood. Then, a few days later, I got a sweet text from him. He talked about some of the good times we had and then thanked me for being his first girlfriend. Then it said, “I hope you the best. I’ll always love you, Sierra.”

Thing is, I consider respect the most important thing in a relationship. So I went to her house to have a talk with her mom so she could get to know me well, got her my phone number and address,  so she wouldn't worry.

She's never been friendly to me. And I've been always respectful at her. I'm (26) and I have a good job, grew in a good family and I learned not to be mean never. Not to ever treat someone aggressively. So I invited her to come over and stay the night. She was here when suddenly my mom come (she does not live with me) and she is worried. My GFs mom sent messages threatening me because she was staying here. Now we are in an awkward situation and I'm considering my relationship because she offended my mom. Also her sister does not like me and her mom said mine called her a lot of bad things which I know my mom did not, but her sister is supporting her anyway.

My main issue is being confident in my role in these relationships, so like I’ll think we’re friends but I’m always thinking “I’m more invested in this than they are” or “they really don’t care if I’m here or not.” These are things that make my anxiety perk up and send me in a spiral.

Without going into too many details, I mentally can't live in such an open space, and I can't deal with sounds people will make, and don't get along with my family. I need utter privacy and safety. I need walls around me to box in my room. I'm lost on where to start. Blankets won't do it because of the type of people (snoopers, loud, chaotic) I live with.

I work and study online and need a setup that separates my ""room."" Besides those cheap paper panels at hardware stores, I can't seem to find anything that fits my needs. I'd prefer to get thick, sturdy panels, preferably 8' tall (a few inches below ceiling) and either included soundproofing or the ability to add something to the panels to dampen sound.

The area will be a corner, so two walls will be there already. I need to form an ""L"" shaped wall with materials. The dimensions of the area (my room) will be approximately 11' x 11'. If possible, I'd like to screw the ends of this ""L"" shape into the walls to secure it and create a passage. This is needed unfortunately to deter family that doesn't respect boundaries.

If anyone has suggestions on how to achieve this unique need, I'd appreciate it. The best way to describe what I'm looking to create is just a privacy solution that is solid, not thin paper.

As the title suggests, I've just been depressed lately about my living situation. Now, I'm not saying that I haven't been taking steps to fixing it, I've just been very down despite being patient. 

Living in a small room with no kitchen and trying to make ends meet has been what I've been doing for the past few years after being evicted recently. All I've been able to do is survive off fast food and frozen food, dieting as much as possible, exercising, and working hard to get promotions or better jobs. 

But even throughout all of this, I feel incredibly selfish and want to just stop living like this, despite not being able to make positive changes years from now. What can I do about these feelings?

I need to drop a class so I can retake it next semester and I have no idea how to tell my parents. In there eyes if I move out or drop out of college I will ruin my life and become a bum.

Background: I had a friend who sent me a very hurtful letter out of the blue in May, and it ended in a friendship over, blocking each other type of way. A month and a half passes by and I get a call from them trying to fix it. I talked with them and although they never blatantly apologized (they blamed it on outside factors making them feel like sending the letter) , I told them I forgave them and would be willing to work on our friendship. Long story short we don’t talk now, but that’s fine. 

I’m really seeking to find forgiveness in that person for myself. I told them I forgive them, which I thought would give me peace, yet I haven’t found it yet.

224,"hi, this is my first post under this sub and i’ve decided to make one because i’m in a serious emotional dilemma. i’m 16 (f) and i just recently moved in with my dad (i have severe mommy issues). my mom and dad were never married and broke up before i was actually born, and then after that they both moved on to new people, both of whom they would marry. my
mom’s husband abused me in multiple ways which has left me with a LOT of emotional scarring, trauma, and actual ptsd (this is a factor in the current problem). for my dad, on the other hand, he had married a woman he had been dating for a few years and they had a daughter together (she’s 5), but they recently divorced a few years back. 

now, with all the backstory out of the way: 
there’s a very strong possibility that my dad and his ex wife may get back together. i knew that i wasnt very fond of the idea, but i see now that i’m absolutely devastated over it (i just had a good cry about it). i left the situation with my mom because of the toxic dynamic that was going on: she and her husband had a son together and they were all very happy, except i was treated as my mom’s leftovers from her last relationship by her husband (he actually told me that i would always be a second priority in comparison to their son). as you can see, the set up now would be terrifyingly similar: 2 parents with their biological child and then the child of one of those parents. i feel like i left a situation just to wind up in the same one.

here’s why im seeking advice: 
this problem feels like such a huge weight on my shoulders, but i can’t exactly talk to either my dad OR his ex wife about it. if i talk to my dad and tell him how i really feel, i would feel completely selfish since he deserves to be happy as well (and i also feel like he would just brush it off and tell me that i don’t need to worry). i can’t talk to his ex because she’s one of *those* people who believes the stereotype that you can’t develop ptsd unless you’re a war vet because only then can you witness traumatic events, so she really wouldn’t be the person to go to for problems involving trauma. plus i think it would just be awkward for me to basically tell her that it would make me feel unhappy if she decided to start dating him again.

238,"Just wanna start by saying my father is my rock and the center of my world, he's held my family together for a very long time and he is honestly the most important person in my life. I have a 10+ year long friendship with one of best best friends, we usually hangout very often but has obviously slowed down a little because of the pandemic, plus we both work and have social lives involving family, friends, and boyfriends. I live in los angeles and covid cases here have been getting incredibly worse, but me and my friend both deal with it differently. I live with my 80 year old father and I am basically in a constant panic attack of bringing something home from work and infecting him, do not eat out at restaurants, avoid travel and stay home as much as possible, except when grocery shopping for my family. My friend is quite the opposite. She basically lives alone(has roommates that are never home) and she's posted on social media of her hanging out with crowds of 15+ people and has no problem going over to anyones house, goes out to eat and dines in the restaurant almost everyday, also while going to crowded places like malls and vegas casino's. Also should add all of her family/boyfriends family and friends do not believe in wearing masks so are more likely to be getting infected. Would it be wrong if I told her we cant hangout anymore for fear of possibly infecting my dad? I am not willing to take ANY risks in endangering my father's life and health",19Oct2020,1

This not a new dream, I wanted to try moving abroad but he did not btw. I do not have many friends, just a few and we do not hang out lots of  just text normally. Especially during covid, have no social event. Nothing would change. I will not be able to see my big family regularly and that’s really bad but I feel like should give it a try. Ok, I’ll be all alone when I move out, probably will work more than my colleagues to keep the job but will be great for my career and I do not have anything that I want to do right now.

241,"Got myself in a little bit of a silly situation. I came from doing relatively shit in high school think 3.4 gpa and not really trying/caring to community college. I started dropping semesters every winter. I got on anti depressants. Decided I want to go to med school. Went to university and got a 3.91 my first year. This year Covid happened and it’s thrown a wrench in things. Going to class was something I had down, and it helps tremendously. Now there’s no incentive. Plus I have my girlfriend doing homework which I’ve been copying. I’m kind of ashamed. Holding onto 2 A- right now. I don’t really know what’s going on. It started great until everything went online. Then I turned into a leach on my girlfriend bless her heart. I’m in a research lab, and 3 courses. Doing fuck all but studying for exams when I have to. 

Still better than 2 years + ago. But not better than last year. I feel lazy. I work out 3x a week. Not crazy workouts, but lifting weights. I’m obese, 190 lbs at 5’6. Oh and I have this dog that I don’t really like that she wants to keep and everything. He’s aggressive, and we have to avoid any person. Takes trazodone 250mg every day. I feel like I should be able to handle all of this better. Just under the surface of the water right now. Not necessarily sinking cause girlfriend keeps me up. 

I don’t question my motivation to be a doc much. I’ve thought very long and hard about it. I’ve made sacrifices. I don’t do any drugs nor do I drink. It’s been a couple years since weed and adderall, and only about a month since alcohol. I figured It can only hurt me. What’s my deal? It was all working organically until now. Do I need to swallow my struggles and trudge through? I’ve been trimming the fluff off my life, getting rid of bad habits and starting new ones. Getting a girlfriend that’s reliable and trustworthy. Getting the dog is a step back, but I should be able to handle it. I don’t hang out with friends much anymore, but they’re still there. Girlfriend doesn’t have many friends, and has a harder time making them. Maybe the dog is more of a problem then I let on. Had a relationship straining moment where I told her I don’t want him. That I don’t want an aggressive dog, and had I known he was aggressive I wouldn’t have gotten him. I honestly don’t have a problem putting him down. He’s better 2 people. I want to be a doctor, and part of me will crush things that get in the way. Sorry if it offends anyone. 

She’s pretty sensitive but sensible. Can’t see why I would want to throw away the dog now that we tried him out. Her telling me that getting rid of the dog will put a hole in her heart that will take a long time to come back from hurts more than 5 dogs. It was definitely a mistake getting him.

I remember just getting sick of talking to him so I started ignoring his calls and messages, and one day I just blocked him and decided not to talk to him again. 

I really regret what I did and I still feel horrible about it. I’m a freshman college student so a lot has probably changed in our lives since then. I’m heading to my former city next weekend and while I don’t think I’ll try to meet up with him, I do want to send him a message apologizing for what I did.

So, I’m in my third year of college and taking classes online. It has been awful. On top of that, my epilepsy is acting up. I have focal left temporal lobe epilepsy (if that matters) which means i don’t have convulsions but my seizures are more like: I can’t read, sometimes can’t speak, although I hear people talking I can’t comprehend what they say (words don’t form thoughts in my head), I can hallucinate, i physically feel like on the fall of a roller coaster (feeling of falling), forget how to use my computer, walk, use my phone, how to get to places, etc. 

Overall a shitty but very internal experience. This weekend I’ve only been awake for 18 hrs (?) and slept the rest because I literally couldn’t stay awake. When I was awake I had  the symptoms listed above. Not much doctors can do so I usually just buckle up and ride the seizures. 

HOWEVER, college. Not a fan of sharing this with my professors unless I have to. Currently taking 6 classes and I’ve had to tell 2. One of them is very bad at teaching which is a shame because he knows a LOT. So a month ago I had a really bad seizure and had a friend email him explaining and asking for an extension (couldn’t email him myself bc I couldn’t write nor read). He said no, that I could turn it in late but it would affect my grade. In my opinion that’s quite shitty because I do not control this shit and I don’t know how I was supposed to turn in an assignment if I couldn’t write, read nor use my computer but fine. He emailed me a few days later saying to reach out to the school’s mental health line if I feel like this again (?????). I did read the email my friend sent later and it was pretty clear. 

Flashforward to now and I have another of his assignments due tomorrow and I am feeling awful. Yes, I am writing but in what i call automatic pilot (meaning I do this almost subconsciously but i can’t always do it). Seizures leave me extremely tired for hours abd sometimes days and I don’t know what to do.

266,"I have a photography business, it’s brand new I started it in January of 2020 - now seems like a perfect time.

I have done it as a Sole Trader. I am the sole legal owner and everything is under my name.
Here’s the issue: My ageing Dad is my unOffical 2nd party. He has financed the thing. I already had my own self-bought $4,000 camera and lens set but we needed a studio setup with lights and backgrounds and great computers. He paid for them. He has all the connections I need to really get the most out of my sports and family photos. 

Yes I can do it alone and on my own but the time it would take would be more than double and he already has all these peoples trust that I’d go a great job for them. 
I have my own printing so that’s something o offer too. 

The main issue is this:
He refuses to have contracts.
I did a Business Diploma after high school because I didn’t know what to do and thought a Business Degree would look very good on my resume.  It has now come in handy.
The Diploma really nailed in the importance of a contract. It protects both parties. It’s the most simple of photography contracts as such:

•” Client deposited X amount for photographers time and date. Client will not get deposit back if client cancels date but will get deposit back if cancelled because of photographer” 

•”Client will get X amount of time for photoshoot and X amount of photos upon delivery” 

•”Client will get photos edited as included price of the photos selected by Photographer. Any additional photos selected by Client will incure a fee for editing” 

•”Client will NOT post photos on social media with a filer or their own edits. No Client nor other photographer is to edit photographers photos” 

Like I said, basic stuff. 
His issue is that “We know these people, they won’t do that”
Well I did a wedding for a cousin out of good faith. I got to use the photos for my business, which I have on multiple occasions, and they get free photos. I was unaware there were free, I thought I was getting $2,000 for easily $5,000 worth of coverage.

My fiancee and I had a bad argument this afternoon and she got really upset. We both said somethings we regret, but when things got heated, I said ‘If we hadn’t gotten engaged, you would still be a depressed slut.’ I regretted it instantly, especially knowing that her previous promiscuity was a response to her father’s sexual abuse as a child. So, yes, I am very well aware that I am in the wrong here.

She rightfully walked out of the house around 8 pm. I figured she would go to a friend’s house or go somewhere to sit for a while. It was slightly concerning though because she was in just a t-shirt and shorts when it was about 36 degrees and raining, but I was still heated at this point.

Around 9, I ran to get something from the store and when I came back I noticed her car was still home, her keys were still here, her phone was still here, her wallet was still here. At this point, I was beyond concerned because she all her friends that I know of live across town which is around a 5 mile walk.

I decided to call around to her friends and drive around the neighborhood to see if I could find her. Her friends said they didn’t see or hear from her and I couldn’t find her. So I went back home and was going to use her phone to call some other friends of hers and if that failed, I would call 911, but she was sitting outside the house because my dumbass locked the door on the way out.

She doesn’t seem mad anymore. She’s just kind of out-of-it. I asked her where she went and she just said she walked around. Her legs and elbows are scraped and bruised badly. Her hands are red and swollen too. I asked her what happened and she just said she didn't know. I almost wonder if she hit her head when she presumably fell. She's taken a shower, but she's still cold to the touch. I'm assuming she's going to get sick from this.

I don't know. I just feel awful about it and don't know what to do or how to make it up to her. I know I fucked up big time here. All advice and insults towards me are welcome.",19Oct2020,1
269,"Hi guys,

A couple of years ago (and a few other times before that), I had a major depressive episode,  and I felt as I was unable to really talk to people. Like, I felt like I wasn’t even able to get a sentence out because my thought process was so jumbled. Because of this, I feel that I’ve been extremely self-conscious/obsessive since then about how I speak to people, how I sound to people (my thoughts/opinions), etc. Even now as I write this I’m a little self-conscious about how a reader may perceive this or think about this. 

Lately though, I’ve been really thinking about how my responses in conversation between other people and I sound. When I speak with my mother and we have a conversation about something, for example, I feel like I have to get out my opinion or I have to correct her or one up her if I feel that there’s more to say on a certain subject. I’m not a mean person (at least I don’t think so lol), I just feel like if I go about speaking with her like that that I’ll be contributing more to the conversation. While I definitely do agree that I am, I feel like I’m not doing it in the right way. 

I’ve always just blurted out what’s on my mind in conversation, but as I’m getting older, I’m starting to realize how much of my psychee I’m giving out to people when I talk to them, and I don’t even realize it. I think I’ve missed out on certain cues in conversations in the past and I’ve failed to be a good listener towards certain people. I’m sure it’s affected my ability to make new friends and meet new girls and shit. 

Instead of taking what somebody says and just running with it or building off of it, I have to say whatever first comes to my head. I’ll hear people chatting and sort of catch into that vibe but I don’t feel I’ve necessarily made such a notice of that sort of thing until now. I’ve never really been able to tell people what I know they want to hear based on their response towards me in conversation.

And I feel that in doing this, people can see how self-conscious I am, or in the way that I feel or think without even having to really tell them. I’ve never picked up onto this until now. I guess I wear my heart on my sleeve? I don’t know if that’s the correct term.

What do you guys think? Any tips? I’m struggling to explain this through text, hopefully I’m able to help you understand what I’m saying through here.

270,"Okay so let me explain. I'm not try to be a lazy bum and act as if I'm listening to my classes while doing other stuff, quite the opposite. I want to fake classes while studying for my university entrance exam.

 The thing is, I did my exam this year, passed, paid half the yearly price(That's what they wanted) and after all that they added a rule that wasn't there before(I have images of the exact same page with the same link and all) which made it so my application didn't get accepted. I plan on taking legal actions later on(Don't think it'll work out tho) but for now I just want no one in my family to know what happened. I wanted to tell them what happened but they already spread it around the whole family and now I'm I feel like I have no more options left except just studying for next year.

After all this adventure and story we've had, and knowing that her and I will be going off to different colleges without compromise, what should I do? I have very obsessive feelings over her and whenever I think about my future I always inhale first knowing that she'll be gone.

276,"Hi! 
I have this friend, we are both girls and have known each other since kindergarten (we are seniors in high school now). Before, she wasn't exactly pretty because she never took care of her appearance but during our second year of high school she changed (we weren't very close during that time) then the next year we started getting closer again with her now calling me her best friend. Her behaviour had changed immensly she was more interested in boys' attention and would frequently abandon plans because of a boy she liked. She has only had one boyfriend and their relationship was 2 weeks. 

She's also extremely gullible and naïve which I think is why she tends to do what her more popular friends do i.e always looking for a guy's attention and then get upset he let them down.

It seems she calls me when she doesn't have anyone else to go out with and goes home early while with her other friends she stays late. As long as there are guys there she will stay and then tell me all about how they were joking with her and looking at her and whatever but never seems to care about my problems and I always feel like her psychologist.

Another thing that was actually my fault there were two guys who liked me and I don't know why I decided to ask her about one of them and she said she didn't like him for me because he was childish and unfunny. She was my closest friend at the time and I accepted her point of view which was a mistake but it was my fault to begin with I shouldn't have asked her.

So I don't know what to do we would probably go to different universities anyway and it would be over but should I start distancing myself now or even end the friendship entirely?",19Oct2020,1
277,"**The Situation:** 2 nights ago, while me and my bf were on a Facetime call, he asked me to search the web for something and when I told him that I do not have access into the file he was asking me to search for, he got very angry. He started raising his voice at me, and yelling, saying ""If I find it, I'm going to be so pissed."" Basically he was trying to say 'you better watch out.' During high-pressure situations I often get stressed (he knows I deal with anxiety) so I decided to look one more time to confirm what I already knew - that I did not have access to the file he was requesting me to find. I told him yet AGAIN that there is not possible way for him to find it either as the application does not allow you. In his mind, apparently I didn't understand and I was ""being stupid"" so he started going off on a tangent to lecture/yell at me. I didn't appreciate his tone and the fact that he was talking down to me so I interrupted him to tell him to watch his tongue. Instead, he got more mad and said ""Interrupt me again and watch me cancel your shoot tomorrow"" (I was having a photoshoot at his private property the next day) and then proceeded to say ""I need you to apologize for interrupting me right now."" I was hesitant at first but I ended up apologizing because I didn't want to escalate the situation. Mind you, he made me apologize 4-5 times because apparently it wasn't ""genuine."" However, after that he wanted me to apologize for being ""too incompetent and stupid to understand him"" and that's where I drew the line and got upset. I interrupted him again and told him that he can not talk down to me like that, and this led to him yelling in my face saying ""You can talk when I give you permission to talk."" And that's where I lost it and started yelling back and cut the call on his face. He tried to call me but I didn't pick up his calls and messaged him saying ""I can't believe you think it's okay to talk to me like that."" Instead of apologizing and recognizing his mistake, he actually told me ""not to bother coming tomorrow"" and that he was ""cancelling my shoot."" Now this is a shoot for my upcoming company that I'm super passionate about and he knows how much it means to me. For him to use that against me baffles me to my core.

**Post-fight:** Anyways, fast forward to the next day, he had talked to my friend who is also starting the company with me and decided to let us shoot on location. He messaged me the next morning gas-lighting me and saying ""I can't believe you didn't reach out to me or check up on me. You obviously don't care about my happiness. You ruined today."" I didn't respond. I went on-site to shoot and we didn't talk the whole day even though we were in each other's presence. He messaged me saying ""When you get home today, don't reach out."" And I haven't messaged/called him since. It's now been 48 hours with no apology. In fact, he believes that he is the one who deserves an apology, and that I ""wronged him."" In the past 2 days where there has been complete radio silence from him, I have been contemplating breaking up with him. For me, if my S/O doesn't have respect for me, then there is no relationship. The only thing stopping me is: (1) The time I've put into and invested into this relationship to the point where I actually thought I would end up marrying this man one day, (2) I am scared of heartbreak as this is my first relationship (we've been dating for a little over a year now) and this is a really stressful time for me as I am writing entrance exams, doing a full course load, and applying to grad school while managing my start-up and I don't have time nor room to have a bad day and mess up my future; (3) My mind keeps thinking of his good qualities even though they don't make up for the bad ones; (4) Scared I won't find someone better to match up to my expectations/standards and I'll regret my decision. Again, all insecurities of mine that aren't logically based but still mess with my mental state and courage.

***Advice:*** *I don't know whether I should wait a week of complete radio silence to break up to see if he even tries to reach out or just call him to break it off. He's never not talked to me for this long, he usually always reaches out one way or another. I also don't know the best way to break up as I've never done it before and I'm literally terrified. I feel like if I break-up with him I'll grow to regret my decision for some reason. Please help.*

**In the Past:** As I've been doing a lot of introspective thinking, I just to give you more context on this guy (my bf) but feel free to skip this part if you don't like reading. When we first started dating, he had recently gotten out of a long-term relationship (broke up with her over the phone) and dated me 1 and a half month after that break-up. I was apprehensive about that at first, but he assured me that he was completely over her and wanted to move forward with me seriously. I believed him and we started dating. During the first 6 months, I was in a very bad position in all areas of my life (2019 wasn't good to me) in terms of physical, emotional, and mental health and I feel that I was highly dependent on him to make me feel better or deal with my anxiety attacks. Early on, he would cuss me out if he got mad at me and this would sky rocket my anxiety and put me at an all-time low where I wouldn't move from my bed for days. I told him that if we were to be together, he could not verbally abuse me by calling me those names and after a couple of months he refrained but he would continuously remind me how much he was doing for me as he always cussed at his ex and never stopped. And how I should be grateful. He eventually resorted to using words like ""idiot"" and ""moron"" and ""stupid"" and when I told him I didn't appreciate that because those were still forms of verbal abuse, he said ""that's just how I express my feelings so either you deal with it or leave."" In the state that I was back then when I was so dependent on him, I didn't want to leave so I compromised and overlooked his shortcomings for the overall big picture and how ""he was responsible,"" ""he cared to call me every night,"" ""he helped me get back on track with school and work.""

He's also yelled at me in public on two separate outings. One time was where he was picking me up from work and closing up took longer than anticipated due to some last-min customers and he had to wait in the hot sun for 15 mins. He yelled at me in front of my then-manager. The second time was during our date when I made him walk too far for food as ""now we're running out of time and it's all because of you.""

He's also thrown multiple ultimatums at me to scare me into listening to him where he tells me ""listen to me or this happens"" ""pick up my call right now or this happens."" He's called me ""crazy"" and ""extra"" for getting annoyed at the way he treated me and sees no issue in being the way he is. He has acknowledged that he is rude and can be condescending but apparently ""you either accept me the way I am or you leave."" I have tried to change his habits numerous times and it always comes down to me not accepting him the way he is. Moreover, I don't think he's ever given me a sincere apology, and it's always me who compromises and apologizes after a fight where I was disrespected. The times where he has apologized, he will say something like ""I'm sorry for making you late but it's also your fault for taking this long to get ready, or there was so much traffic and you didn't know the directions."" He always turns it around on me.

**TDLR; Boyfriend disrespected me by yelling in my face and saying I am ""incompetent and stupid"" as well as ""you can only talk when I give you permission to talk"" and when I got mad proceeded to tell me that it was MY mistake and I needed to apologize to him. We haven't talked for the past 48 hrs and he has not once reached out to apologize. I am contemplating breaking up with him but am scared I'll grow to regret it. I am also confused on whether I should wait a week to see if he calls/msgs to apologize or do it right away.**",19Oct2020,1
278,"For a very long time I’ve know there was something wrong with me. I keep forgetting things, I have been having nightmares of old friends and situations I don’t want to be in. I want to go into therapy, but I don’t think I can do that. I have this huge fear of doctors and going outside by myself. Asking my parents isn’t an option because I’ve already expressed these concerns to them and them finding out that I’m possibly depressed will result in them forcing me to go back to church and at that point I don’t think I can go on in life anymore. Ive been having suicidal thoughts and the reality is, i have no one to help me. For the last few days I’ve been plagued with nightmares of going back to church and dreams of my childhood friends. We were broken up by our parents and religious reasons. I’m very sheltered and have fears of going outside by myself. I’ve been wanting to go out on walks by myself, but I don’t think I can. I’ve been trying my best to help myself, find friends who can support me, even tried telling my doctors that I haven’t been feeling myself. In all these years I’ve failed in doing things myself. I’m terrifyingly codependent and I just can’t do it all by myself. I’ve done things myself for years and i don’t think i can do that anymore.

280,"Throwaway account.

I'm 22(F) and this particular incident happened when I was 18. My family is pretty dysfunctional as my dad is pretty deadbeat and cheated on my mom on numerous occasions, most of them with females in their 20s-30s. He started being physically abusive towards my mom when she found out but she never left him cuz she loves him. This has been happening since I was a toddler and when I turned 9, my mom got a job in a different state and she moved out, leaving me with my dad. As she's gone, my dad used to take out his frustration on me. Thankfully it was never physical abuse, only emotional. But he was still my dad and I never had any hard feelings towards him. I just put up with it.

When I turned 17 I moved out for studies to a different state. I was the happiest girl alive because I didn't have to deal with my family issues as I'm away. Eventually I got my summer break (I turned 18) and I had to go back home. Before I get into the details, you should know that my family is very orthodox in nature. So we try to avoid physical contact by all means as it's tabooish. Even when my mom visits me, we just hug once and that's that. No more touching after that. So when I went home this time, my dad got a little touchy. It wasn't sexual parts but my arms, shoulders, and the sides of my thighs. It was always ""accidental"" when it came to thighs. It honestly made me really uncomfortable. I know the difference between a good touch and a bad touch and I definitely wasn't feeling good about it. I was getting very paranoid day by day. I made sure I was never alone with him but he was always around. He even kept asking questions like ""who are you texting?"", ""Who called you?"", Etc., Whenever  my best friend texts me or whenever I get a call from someone which was very unusual as he never bothered about stuff like that before. 

I eventually came back and got on a session with my therapist and told her about it. She was on my side and asked me to tell my mom about it first. And I did. But my mom was very skeptical. She told me she believes me but her ""are you sure?"" ""Your dad isn't like that"" ""maybe he missed you"" ""he loves you a lot"" made me think otherwise. She then told me she will come and be the judge of it during the next vacation. I was kind of heartbroken she didn't believe me and wanted me to go through it again just so that she can be the judge of it and I never went home again after that. And of course, she was pretty mad at me for it and I did (and still do) feel guilty about the whole thing.

After 2 years, I met my amazing boyfriend. He has been very supportive of me. He knew every dark secret of mine and not once did he judge me or look down at me. He treated me like an equal. A total opposite of how my father treats my mother. We have been going great and we trust each other with our lives. He always says one thing, ""no matter what, we should always be honest with each other, good or bad it doesn't matter. Our relationship is built on trust and we should be honest in order to keep it going"". I told him everything except this part of my life (he does know about my dad and my mom's relationship and how it all went down). I'm not sure if I should tell him about this because I myself am not sure if there was anything at all when I felt uncomfortable. What if it's all in my head and my mom's right? What if I was just overthinking? If he didn't have a history of cheating, would I have looked at it this way? If I'm wrong here, it would be a huge accusation and i don't know what I should do regarding this. But I feel guilty everyday for not telling him about it as he has always been 100% honest with me, even regarding his past. So I would appreciate a third person's advice regarding this because I can't ask/tell anyone about something like this.",19Oct2020,1
281,"I’m still pretty new to Reddit and it’s my first time posting here, so I apologize if I’m not quite doing this correctly. For background, I (27F) have a daughter (5yo). We live in the US near the México boarder. Since she was a baby, I have always encouraged her to love to learn about everything. We love PBS kids and their educational shows. “Let’s Go Luna” is kind of a newer one that helps teach kids about other cultures. She loves it, I love it, super fun educational show. Since she started watching it, she was telling me one day about how a couple years ago when it snowed here (super rare), I let her borrow my ushanka. I had to ask her what that is, I guess I missed the episode. It’s a Russian fur hat with ear flaps. I had purchased the hat she was referencing at the swap meet quite some years ago and just considered it a winter hat. She has also developed a love for China since watching the show and says she wants to go there when she’s older. (I let her watch the new Mulan because of this). I think it’s great. She is learning to love diversity and celebrate other cultures. Now, here’s where my dilemma kicks in. She also loves the movie Coco, which is a great movie. She told my mom the other day that she wants to set up an ofrenda for my late brother (he passed before she was born but knows who he is). She wants to celebrate dia de los muertos, which is something my family has never done. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that we live near the Mexico boarder in the US, so it’s not unfamiliar to me. I know a lot of people who do celebrate it. I ordered her a traditional Mexican dancing dress and headband with flowers tonight because she’s so interested in it and was sad that she didn’t have the proper dress to dance with the music. She understands that it is a traditional dress that is worn through out the movie and the Coco concert (can be watched on Disney+). I want to teach her to celebrate other cultures and diversity. However, I am concerned that it could be mistaken as cultural appropriation. Would celebrating dia de los muertos with my daughter and giving her a traditional Mexican dress be cultural appropriation? If we do celebrate it, I was planning on researching further to be culturally accurate. I don’t want to “steal” other people’s culture, but I want my daughter to learn about it. If the world wasn’t they way it is now, staying home and all that, I would take her to the celebrations in my town or with my friends who do celebrate it. I am helping my daughter celebrate other cultures or helping her appropriate them?",19Oct2020,1

i am not sure, i was very fucked up. i was at a small gathering with my boyfriend and his friends (5 people total). i knew two of the guys there, but a third one “Danny” I don’t know super well. 

My boyfriend and one of his friends drove off for an hour or so to pick up his mom. me, danny, and “bob” were left alone. bob took a nap inside, so it was just me and danny in the garage. i have no memory of that time. i’m pretty sure i passed out for some of it. i remember at the beginning we were just talking, and i remember him giving me some more beer. i didn’t want to drink more but he wanted me to shotgun with him? i don’t remember. 

i have weird snippets of being very close to him (cuddling close) but being confused of why we were close. normally i would never get that close to someone im not interested in while we are alone because it sends the wrong message.

Now she's secretly bragging to people in the church and outside about my virginity and openly (not around me at first, but when she hangs out with my mom my mother told me).

Today I saw her before service started again and she saw me and kept telling me how beautiful she thinks I am which is fine I guess, but she not happy with me talking to this guy that likes me at church (shes scared of me losing mt virginity to him I guess). But before service she introduced me to this new lady and the  first the she says about me after my name is shes starts bragging about me not having kids yet and kind of hinted to the new lady I'm a virign which really embarrassed and annoyed me. 

The new lady said ""well she needs to start having kids now"" and tried to ask me why I don't. I tried to attempt to say I do want kids until my moms and best freind jumped in and looked at me and said ""wait till marriage"" like thats not what I have been doing for 30 years already.

 This is creeping me out. I go to the same church as my mom, but should I start going to a different church? Why is a older woman so obsessed with another woman's virginity?

286,"This is a throw away account but I did something very uncharacteristic of myself and nearly died last night. 

My college roommate has a dab cartridge of weed that her dad gave her. She was telling me about it and showed it to me. When she left for her job, I decided to try some of it. I went in her desk and mixed some of it with butter and ate it. I don't  know what I was thinking.

287,"Hear me out,

Reasons why:

1) He has very narcissistic tendencies (loves to talk about himself, selfish motives, likes to depend on my mother and I for his financial stuff, loves to date women 40 years younger than him and party every night with his friends, etc) 

2) A few years ago, I needed my first car for school, he decided his old car was too old and too much money to fix so he sold it to my uncle. He promised me to get me a new one, never did. I saved up my money and my boyfriend helped me get one. That SAME exact car he sold, he bought it back from my uncle and decided to gift it to this 19 year old girl he was ""hanging"" out with. Keep in mind, this guy is 65 years old. 

3) He told my mother once, he couldn't wait til I was 18 so he can get rid of the responsibility of driving   me to and from school. 

4) He thought it was better to give me 20 bucks a week for uber instead of driving me. It wasn't even enough, so I was taking the train and bus to go to school. After a while, I had to keep asking him to keep giving me those 20 bucks, so I stopped. 

5) This guy is making 100,000 a year and blew it ALL off on girls and partying. While I was working different jobs to save up and graduate debt free. 

6) HE GOT COVID, for the love of God. Guess who had to take care of him? YEP. My mother and I. All of because of his damn lifestyle. 

PROS: well, he kind of raised me, he took care of me all my childhood. 

SO, back to the question, I am finally graduating next year, I don't want him at my graduation party. He has given me no support in my career and schooling and I know that he will just want to take credit and give people the illusion that he put in the work.

So, I lost my job from health issues and COVID so I was forced to move out of my apartment because there were no jobs available. 

Anyways, so I'm currently staying at my boyfriend's grandmother's to save some money and hopefully get back on my feet in the near future. I've been moved now for about two weeks. 

I spend hours a day trying to help to clean, cook and help with random tasks. My problem is I seem to be getting criticized over my weight and not going for as much walks as I ""should"" among other things. It hurts because I know a weight reduction would help me in the long run but I know I can't obtain these results quickly. I'm hearing comments that really hurt like if I crinkle chips or something I hear my boyfriend get asked question like did you eat chips last night? And when my bf threw out a bag of garbage from the bathroom she asked is that full of junk? (Implying junk food). 

My mental health is deteriorating and the criticism is not only about me but my boyfriend as well asking if hes up or to rake leaves at 10 am and if hes not up by a certain time getting phone calls. 

I really want to find a way to make this work because this is my only option to get ahead right now. I'm so grateful for the opportunity but I'm so down about the criticism. I talked to my boyfriend and he agrees it's a bit much but is kind of stuck as well because he doesn't want to stir up anything. Any advice would be so appreciated.

293,"This is a long story so bare with me. A while ago my girlfriend and i cut ties with all of our toxic friends for our benefit, unfortunately that happened to be almost all of our friends. Her best friend who she cut ties with has always had a unbelievably obsessive connection with her (can’t stand to see her in a relationship and does everything to ruin the ones she gets in, including ours). After my girlfriend cut ties with her she developed a hatred towards me for “ruining their friendship.” To get revenge she decided to tell my girlfriends mom that we have been doing drugs together, she told other people she did it because she cares but to us we know it’s because she’s jealous. She even told us that we got ourselves into this (implying we deserved to get our relationship ruined). We were on our way to stopping, but my girlfriend has a drug addiction. For me it was just occasionally for fun but it became something that i hated doing and something my girlfriend felt like she had to do to be happy. I was getting her to stop, but with addiction it takes time. Her ex best friend snitching resulted in my girlfriend being grounded and not allowed to see me for right now and it has put a strain in our relationship because now her family hates me and blames me because of these things since i am older than her. Her uncle even tried calling the cops on me to get me arrested for this. I honestly don’t know what to do because the things everyone close to her has said to me or about me makes me truly hate myself. Ever since she’s been grounded i feel a deep hatred towards myself for letting it get this far.  I’m miserable every single day. Ive been trying to get her help but she doesn’t want to because she doesn’t think she has a problem, and if she doesn’t get help everyone who loves her will continue to blame me for this situation when i’ve been doing everything in my power to get her to stop even before they knew about it. She also has developed an eating disorder that people blame me for, even though I’ve been trying to get her to eat, but there’s only so much i can do by myself. I feel so lost and to blame for all of this and i truly don’t know how to fix it.

296,"Hi,

Excuse my english grammar mistakes ( not native)

Little backstory before my question. I workout almost every day for the last 1.5 years. Because of this I am ripped. But I am shy in a way that I dont really want to get noticed. So the fact of me being ripped is pretty unknown to anyone. Expect a couple of close buddies. Talking to girls and approaching them is not a really big deal. But that not willing to be noticed part is a problem. So now to the advice I need. I also want you to know that I workout/sport 20 hours a week not for girl purposes but for the fact of being fit and feeling comfortable in my own body.

2 months ago I got a new girlfriend. She is super funny and sexy. We see each other alot but not like ""weird"" alot. We cuddle alot so after 1 week she started questioning me and try to put my shirt off. But I refused. It was just too early in my opinion. Then after 1 month we finally had sex and I took my shirt off. She was shocked in a weird way and we didnt continue to have sex. She was angry and mad that I did not share such a big part of my life. So this situation is really weird. I prob should have told her earlier, but I dont want girls that are only attracted to me for my body. That is what I told her. But she still mad.

Advice?

Thanks in advance and stay safe",19Oct2020,1

298,"Throwaway account

I need advice, I am 31M , i fell in love with a girl from different country and religion 3 years back when i was 28 , things got serious pretty soon. I told about us to my parents, and since I belonged to orthodox family, I was discouraged a lot, I told this to my gf that until they agree I cannot marry her because i loved my family a lot, there came a point that, I told her it wont be possible, and its better to break up, but we stayed together. Meanwhile, she went back to her country 1.5 years ago, and there was obviously lot of guilt and resentment for me, and I told her it will be hard to move on for me, she said the same thing, so although we were officially not together,  we acted like couple in a long distance relationship, I would keep her updated about everything, she would be jealous if I even talk to girls, I did not date anyone because of guilt and my love for her, she would enquire about everything, she would ask me I give her attentions, she was pretty possessive all time, to the point I only used to talk to her mostly, she would tell me I am her soulmate that even if we are not together, we cannot live without talking to each other, i used to believe that, and hated my family for so long and hated myself for not having courage to marry her and not care much about family, I last met her in april 2019 where i traveled to her country to meet her, on march 2020, I came to know that she was already dating someone from the time we last met, I was pretty heart broken, she was blunt in telling me that since u did not marry her she has right to find somone, I was furious that she was right but she could have just told me she is seeing someone, in all this time, I would send her gifts and money when she was in trouble. She told me she cant live alone, she needs someone , so if I want to marry her, she would leave this guy etc. I thought this was my mistake, I took things for granted, meanhilw, my family now realized I am not seeing anyone and its hard for me to forget her, they sort of okayed to me marrying whatever, but not 100 percent, despite of all this, I told her this, in june 2020, she said I am too late now, I cant leave him because she loved him a lot now, and she don't want to stay in different country or with my family (this was something new), I kept asking her, to the point I gave up, while things between her now bf was not working well, so she would call me and tell me that she wants to get back to me but later back track as soon as her fight between bf is over this happened 4-5 times, she recently finally ? broke up with him because he was abusive. which I knew, because she would call me and cry how abusive he is etc. 

Now, since she broke up, she wants to get back with me and work things out, I am still not over her, but I am confused if practically its a good choice. first she is not yet moved on , she said, I can help her move on. I am more worried about long term, at my age I want to settle, she is 25, she have plenty time to figure things out, I don't want to end up making wrong decision but I am still in love with her.

299,"Hi. My name is James. 24. 

Is there any real way to get out of my situation?
I never finished high school, dropped out due to depression of my brother passing. Wasted years inside my own head. My family isn't of any help cause they just leech off you and don't actually care at all for me. I have a mom 48. She is very sick, she has many medicines that cost a ton. She's on a program that helps her pay 70% but even the 100 or so $ is hard for me to get. I can't properly take care of her at this point so can someone point me in the direction where i can start? Maybe a step by step of how you came to getting out of being poor? 
I've sold a lot of my things already. I know people say to save up, I'm trying it. 

We live in very ghetto apartments. I've been robbed here, someone guy even pulled a gun out on someone else right out. I'm pulling my hair out trying to think how i can get out of this situation. Help my mom, buy a car cause i don't have one. Its all by bus. I'm overwhelmed.. In truth.
Im not asking for money, i just want advice on anything i can do to change my situation, fast as possible.
I would like to think there's a way out if i keep hopeful. I don't make a lot to begin with. So saving hasn't helped much.

302," I want to vent out about something.. I'm ashamed of what I had did though its been years... But trust me when I tell you it has took a huge on my life. Ill never be able to be in a relationship with this person again... I want to start back when I first started dating this girl (lets call her S.D.) When i first met this girl I was single and she wasn't. my group of friends saw her and her cousins strolling around the apartments we play soccer in.. We were all around the same age anyways so we hit it off real quick.. my squad talking with her squad. Eventually leading for me and S.D. to talk and hang out more she even broke up with her boyfriend for me a couple days later.. (That's where I should've seen the red flag because if she leaving him for me just like that she could  the same to me I bet). Yet i still dove right. lets say now we've been dating for 8 months+ now and just like every relationship we've had our ups and downs mainly due to me getting a job and moving us out from our parents house. (Easier said than done)but that was our motive because usually what I would have to do is sneak her in my room when my parents were sleeping and sneak her out before my parents would come back from work. after a while I just felt like I wasn't happy with her because I was in trade school she wasn't even in school unemployed. I just felt like everything was on me.. she even noticed and asked why I was so depressed and not happy around her.. but I never really told her straight up I would just kinda hint that she needs to work also but she would always say some excuse.. so I felt like this motive we had really  couldn't be accomplished first off she had gotten expelled and was sent straight to alternative school and eventually dropped out. When she knew expectations were not getting fulfilled  I guess that's when other guys or guy started to get her attention I found out because her sister took S.D. phone while she went to the bathroom and showed all the dirty messages she was having with this guy. I knew they were just using her for sex these guys truly didn't love her. I know  She knew that too and it broke my heart and yet I still stayed with her yeah I went off on her like anyone else would yet I still forgave her I was faithful 100% through out the relationship! I guess that's why I be shrugging off girls I see now at days. I don't see loyalty these days.. Anyways though she was having sex with other guys or just one guy (idk) I still forgave her and went back big mistake but After a while she finally broke up with me. saying that she doesn't find me attractive that she's seen ""all of me"" we were a year and 6 months in. after she broke up with me i ended up having this cringy depression.. I could've handled the situation better but whatever it is what it is. months later I left to Mexico for vacation Me and S.D. were just starting to talk again and we decided to catch up..  see how we had been.. she would tell me about new guys shed talk to and going out on dates with them but i think she realized they weren't like me she realized how much more I be giving her attention and how easy it was for her to just be herself around me compared to the other guys she had been hanging out with. Even though we had broken up at the time we were still facetiming each other.. by the time i had come back to from Mexico me and S.D. were seeing each other again well things quickly went down after that. I come back and we started to hang out in my place again like before sneaking her in when my parents were asleep and sneaking her out before my parents got to work.. only this time we weren't having sex or kissing she just wanted to sleep in my room but I remember I wanted to do make a move on her so we could go back to how we were. And so in the same bed I started acting like I was asleep but I was thinking how could I make her want me again?.. she thought I was asleep and that's when I slowly started touching her down.. I wanted to turn her on and wanted to make love to her and so there was a bit of struggle going on as I tried to kiss her and so I stopped as soon as I noticed she was frozen she was acting like she was asleep but I knew she wasn't she was just scared trying to be asleep so i wouldn't proceed but I stopped either way..  because this wasn't my intention I wasn't trying to sexually violate her, i was trying to make her fall in love with me gain.. later on she would tell me that i did violate her but I wasn't I explained I was trying to arouse her because I wanted her to love me again. But she didn't I don't blame her it wasn't cool and never did I do that again and I slept with other girls after this relationship. anyways she told some of my friends what I did  and my friend said she was trying to make them go against me but my friends just didn't do nothing they knew it was none of their business and they thought she was lying but I told them she wasn't and explained what happened even told them that if they don't want to be my friend that I would understand but my caring friends know that I'm no rapist! after the incident cooled down me and S.D. talked again and even got to see each other I told her how I was sorry almost crying she forgave me.. we even hugged it out and since then I was in this friendzone bubble things weren't the same anymore.. wed hang out go to thrift stores but id be feeling used because she would be asking me to always take her buy clothes/make-up or take her out for Starbucks. though I was friend zoned I was up to the challenge and was willing to do whatever it took just be her man but after so long of spending time money and energy on here just gave up i just stop talking to her and that's when she dated a guy who got her Prego and while she was Prego she broked up with her baby daddy and instead went out with one of my close friends from school... Introduced him as my best friend to S.D.! as soon as i saw them together on facebook in a photo I quickly sent her a message saying your dating him??? with laughing emojis acting like I wasn't hurt but low key was.. and since then i never talked to S.D. I don't think they're together today but who knows its been years and I still think about this girl everyday... I still see her Instagram page every now and then but I know its not healthy.. I recently just blocked her because I felt like I've been moving on better than before.. but still the memories hit home.. I never been the same ever since because now I live with the regret of what I did to S.D. I hope I also don't come to you as a rapist or abuser because I am far from it so much internal conflict I know I'm no rapist/ abuser because I've slept/dated with other women and never did i repeat the same thing i did to S.D. in bed AND NEVER WILL! I just wanted things to go back but i know it wont ever i want to talk to her again but that a more tougher challenge plus maturely speaking i think we just burnt each other out and its been so long she prolly moved on forgot about me while I'm the fool just repeating memories in my mind i dint want to bother her no more what if she has found peace i wouldn't want to ruin that plus she has a beautiful daughter now its like they say though if you truly love her you'd let go.. i let go but i just cant stop feeling from resurfacing i just cant let her out of my mind.. well do you think im a rapist and always will be? leave comments/opinions below..",19Oct2020,1

So basically the rumor became that he likes me and that we look cute together. And this all started because he had told someone. All I was told it's someone from management and I knew it's him. It became so obvious because he only offered extra help to me, the way he acted and talked to me pointed to signs of liking me. And did flirt back and forth many times. 

Being young and having a first job and no experience with having an actual boyfriend, I got scared. I got scared thinking what if he makes a move? And what if some how we both lose our jobs. And although many people are couples at the job and have family members working as well, I got scared and nervous. 

This is where I fucked up. I started to distance myself and eventually we stopped talking. You know when you have something real good with someone and then it's gone in a heart beat? That's what it felt like and still does. 

He caught on and one day when it was just us he told me I hurt him by doing so. To which I couldn't even respond to. I just stood there quiet and ended up saying that he was treating me the same (obviously it was my fault so of course he wouldn't talk to me either). I wish I said sorry that day, I really did. It's been so many months and sure we act normal and all but we have many many awkward moments. Sometimes I can't even say hi. I just feel bad for treating him like that when it wasn't really his fault either.


I am quitting in a few weeks and this does have to do with all this and another manager hating on me because of him liking me. I haven't told anyone about this except two of my close work friends. My anxiety started to get worse every time I would go in for my shift and I decided this was the best to do.

I contacted one of them on Discord and exchanged a lot of pictures. I was so out of my mind that I made a fucking Discord server where people would share underage nudes from ages 13-17 but no more younger than that.

My mom actually doesn't know PC is pregnant yet, but she's made it very clear in the past that if she or BCS ever got pregnant, they're gone. Unfortunately, we didn't get around to neutering BC fast enough since money has been very tight during the pandemic, and dumb luck had it that the last heat after we scheduled his appointment turned out to be what got PC pregnant. I've decided not to tell her until I have a good plan ready, or until she figures it out herself. It's only a matter of weeks before it's really obvious.

Ideally, I want to keep PC and let her have her kittens at home. When they're old enough for dry food, we send them to people who want to adopt or to a shelter. If that can't happen at our home, I can send her and her litter to my bf's house and she can raise them there (she is familiar with his home and family). Once the kittens are gone, PC comes back home to a neutered BC (his appointment is Nov. 3rd) 

PC is very attached to me and only me, so I'm afraid she'll suffer from stress related complications if she isn't somewhere she's comfortable. As for her kittens, if they have any chance of being adopted (they're... not exactly pedigree cats) they need to be well socialized, and that can't really happen at a shelter. Also, considering PC's temper around strangers, I wouldn't doubt that PC and her litter would be on the list for euthanasia.

Currently on leave twice a week for this month - he’s expectation was that he can still contact me / I’ll do small jobs. Last week I bluntly told him if he wants to still contact me repeatedly and expect me to still do work, then it’s not annual leave. 

Work is mentally effecting me where I can’t seem to switch work task on, I have immediate anxiety and stress attacks when I walk into the office. 

I’m in my final semester of uni, I’ve been doing some freelance work and I will still continue that. 

I just need a break. I haven’t ever not been employed since I was 14, now 25. I’ve always immediately rolled onto the next job. 

I’ve decided to quit, I have saved enough money to last me a year and half unemployed (not that I want to stay that unemployed for that long, but due to these circumstances) 

my question is: is it bad to have your final working day in December? Like is that a shitty time to quit? My boss knows my job role has no progression and he said that once I leave he most likely won’t rehire someone, just find an intern or train internal",19Oct2020,1

324,"Hey everyone,
I'm from Germany and want to start university this year. I wanted to study in Berlin which is 2 hours from home and went there last week to visit an apartment I could move to. I got immediatly homesick and couldn't eat for the rest of the day even after getting home. Since than I'm very depressed and feel unreal. 
I wanted to start fresh because my life sucks here at home even though I love my family. I don't have many friends and still never had a girlfriend and I'm already 24. I thought maybe I should study in the nearest town and move there than I would only be 20 minutes from home, but that wouldn't feel as fresh of a start. Maybe it would be easier, but I think I would still get homesick even though I know that city already.

327,"How do you handle losing a good girl friend? / recieving threats after being thrown under the bus? I cherish and value a lot of the female friendships that I have and in this instance everyone tells me that I did nothing wrong but I can’t help but think what might have been different... 

My friend blocked me on all platforms without a word. Instagram, Facebook, etc. We did get into a bit of a pickle in which she never apologized but her boyfriend talked to me and mentioned he didn’t agree with her actions and she was jealous.

She encouraged me to start streaming on Twitch and I hopped onto the platform after her (mind, she already has a large social media following already). I guess Twitch really took off and I’ve been streaming for fun since I play a lot of video games and I’ve been making a lot of new friends/having an outlet to express myself... especially since I’m a huge extrovert stuck at home due to social distancing. Its definitely helped my mental health and has provided me a space to socialize after work and school.

Anyways I guess my follower count surpassed hers and when that happened she texted a mutual to ask me to change my content in order to “diversify” because I was copying her. I added certain elements to my channel at the suggestions of my mods and followers and used default icons for my notifications (since Twitch is something I do for fun...I didn’t have the time to deck it out). I used a pikachu as my new follow icon and she asked why I had to use a pikachu and copy her. I just responded that I didn’t and these were all defaults. She then switched up the narrative and accused me of being a shitty friend because I didn’t check up on her enough when her boyfriend was in the hospital. The thing is, I was going through something of my own at the time and have talked to him separately to check up on him. I don’t know what consitutes as “checking in enough” on someone and I reached out to her multiple times throughout the day of and still remember her streaming online the day her boyfriend was discharged from the hospital... so I didn’t understand why she treated it as no big deal then but now switched it and made it seem huge. She kept bringing up how her boyfriend almost died and I didn’t care - but I felt like this was over exaggerated since I personally spoke to him and he said he was fine.

I asked her what that had to do with anything of this situation and she mentioned to me that her followers were the ones bothering her about how I grew my account faster than hers. She then told me she’d block me on twitch for the sake of her mental health but will continue on with our friendship as is outside of that. I agreed and told her whatever works best.

Afterwards I discovered that she messaged my moderator and offered to pay him. When he didn’t do work with her, she decided to name drop me on her stream and mentioned my mod... I got an influx of hate comments, messages, and even death threats from her community. It was brutal and I took a break from social media afterwards to recalibrate. She hasn’t said a word after name dropping me on her stream and mentioning that she’s extremely “transparent” with me and tells me everything. But literally afterwards she blocked me on everything.

She doesn’t realize the damage she’s done but is now playing the victim and idk why I feel bad. I’m just trying to process these comments because they do suck and its been taking a toll on my mental health. I love my Twitch community though, theyre all great people and its always a great time, but getting these dms from her following just sucks. I also partially feel guilty for sparking up issues between her and her bf since he acknowledges that she is in the wrong.",19Oct2020,1
328,"Some background (all this actually matters I promise): I (20F) am currently living in my first apartment with my two best friends (20F and 20M). My female roommate and I are both very small people, but my male roommate is a little heavier. We live on the second floor of our building. 

A few weeks ago, I found a note taped to our door that said something along the lines of ""idk if it's y'alls apartment but if it is whoever's walking around up there like you weigh 1000 pounds needs to just sit down."" I showed it to my female roommate, and we agreed that it was disgusting, and probably not directed at us, because we have a lot of neighbors who are WAY louder than us basically all the time. 

The past couple weeks, we've heard banging through the floor, like the people below us were banging on the ceiling. We thought it might be telling us to be quiet the first time, but then it got super random? Like we'd all be in zoom class at our desks and we'd hear banging on the floor? So we just assumed it wasn't on us because that didn't make any sense. 

This came to a head yesterday, when we heard banging on our floor after my male roommate walked down the hall and back to his room. He said ""I'm going to test something"" and jumped on the floor like three times. About a minute later one of the girls from downstairs knocked on our door (without a mask, we made her go get one before we answered) and proceeded to yell at us for not being quieter. It was around 7 pm. She had never interacted with any of us in the past other than through rude notes and random ceiling bangs. She implied that my slightly overweight roommate just living his daily life was causing her major life problems. 

There have been times that they have been playing music in their apartment that we could not just hear, but actually feel through our floor, a sensation that causes me to have panic attacks, and when asked to turn it down just a little have said that they should be able to do what they want in their home. 

My male roommate went and talked to them today and apologized for fighting with the one girl last night. He told them we just want to be good neighbors and gave them our contact information so they don't have to bang on the ceiling. They seem open to it. 

I am not. The one girl has been really fatphobic and insulting to my best friend, and has never attempted to be polite in any of her interactions. She has not been open to being flexible when we have asked them to be a little quieter. Neither have her roommates. I don't want to be fighting with these people, but I also want to stand up for how shittily they've treated my roommate. Any advice? Or should I just get over it?

TL;DR: my downstairs neighbors yelled at my roommate for walking too loud (he's on the heavier side). He wants to just let it go and try to be chill with them, but I don't know how to let go of seeing my friend treated like that",19Oct2020,1

330,"This is my first time posting on reddit, so forgive me if I did something wrong, but I don't really know where else to go about this since I no longer have anyone else IRL to go to about this, so I thought it would be best to anonymously ask among people who may have gone through the same thing, or something similar, as well as how they potentially handled it or what did they to change their situation for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 16M, overall I'm your typical boy, I lived a normal life I guess, but a lot of things were different cause of my sister. I'll just go over the events and then how it's all coming together now and I don't really know what to do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young, extremely young like nearly 1 year old, my family lived in this house with my family, and we had a beam in our home and my older sister threw me into it resulting in a cut in my eyebrow, and my face is slightly ""deformed"" not really deformed but one side of my face is slightly moved back compared to my other side, it's a big enough difference that when you look at one side compared to the other you can notice the difference. Nevertheless, we were both young so I guess it doesn't matter since a lot can happen between young kids so my parents didn't think much of it . Later on this led to a breathing problem of mine, so it's difficult for me to breathe normally out of my nose since the ""pipe"" I don't know what you call it is slightly smaller and swells up time to time, so it's difficult for me to do exercise sort of, back on track though.

&amp;#x200B;

Skipping through a lot of other things, since it's just casual siblings being rude to each other, we finally moved into a nicer home. This is where things start to change, I'm only 11, my older sister being 12, this is when things started to change a lot, she complained a lot about us moving into a nicer, larger, and more spacious home. I thought it was normal in a way since all she did was miss her friend, so it seemed normal, but she kept this going for an entire year, and when I mean an entire year I mean literally every week she'd blame my parents for her missing her friend, and the reason she was doing bad was cause of the new school, even though I was in the same school and doing completely fine, nothing new.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Skipping over to when she finally entered High School, she made a new friend, I'll call her Julia, of course I can't give her literal name. After she met Julia things started to change a lot, she started smoking, drinking, lying, going against especially me, and my entire family. She started not caring about School, grades, education, everything. While this was all happening I wasn't your typical boy I guess? I didn't go out much, and I was at home on a computer my father built together when we moved. I mainly just focus on being productive, learning to code or playing games with friends. I didn't also go out much since I have a breathing issue, so for me to consistently control my breathing while doing an exerting task was difficult, but I still did go out whenever I could.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know where to include this, but this is really where the differences in how we're treated started, so if just read from here if you don't want to read above. Above was just mainly a backstory, 

not sure if any of it helps though, but no harm in including it right?

&amp;#x200B;

So, after Julia came into play, my sister started getting very worse from her Sophomore to Junior year, at first it wasn't at bad, maybe she smoked, drank, or lied here and there, but overtime it started getting far worse, and I told my parents about it cause I was worried, in doing so my parents talked to my sister, but my parents always told her that I was the one that told them about my sister. When my sister first found out, she gave me a lot of shit for it, I told her directly that I was worried and it broke out into an argument, she got more aggravated than I've ever seen before, and she ended up throwing a computer mouse at me, and it wasn't too bad, left a bruise and the mouse cracked &amp; chipped a little from when it had fallen on the floor after it had hit my body. When I told my parents what happened, my parents didn't care about how I could've gotten hurt or what happened, they said I shouldn't of said anything and should've ignored her when she's angry, and then my Dad grabs my arm and smacks it hard enough to the point where there is his rashes/marks of his fingers on my arm. Then my Dad says I should never talk to my sister like that as in yell at her when we were arguing, and then my mom gives me a lecture on how I shouldn't of done anything and how it wasn't my problem and that I should only tell them what happens. Because of this specific situation, my sister goes around telling her friends, my friends, and practically anyone I knew that I was a ""snitch"" and that spread pretty quickly, and people I was getting close, as in my friends, new friends, or people I knew had a bad impression of me, and it resulted in a lot of different things, mainly socially. This made me more so just stay alone, independent, and not go out of my way for others. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I told my parents what I knew and this went on for sometime, and eventually my older sister got a boyfriend, she was 16 at the time, I was 14. She went around telling a lot of people in High School that our family was very wealthy, my parents had amazing paying jobs, and a lot of different lies just to everyone around her. I didn't know about this since me and my sister aren't very close. So this resulted in a lot of people saying I was lying, and ruining my reputation, pretty much people though I was trying to get sympathy from them and get things out of them when my family was so called ""wealthy"" even though we aren't. During this time, I had intentions of graduating early since I didn't want to be in School cause of the way people perceived me and how people thought I was. So I just stayed very independent, and focused on school more than ever. I was taking 10 classes that year, 5 each Semester. I woke up at 6, got to School at 7, and got out of school at 5, and it was a 2 hour walk home everyday, during this time my sister had a car, but she only picked me up once and lied to my parents about picking me up, normally she was out with her friends or her boyfriend, drinking, smoking, sex, drugs, etc. (I only know about the sex because of one my so called ""friends."" Don't want to go into depth there though. Long story short, the point of this is that I worked my ass off, like I really did, everyday I'd work my ass off for an entire year, and somedays it would get harder for me. With my sister having a car, she was responsible for dropping me to school, but my sister never cared about school, nor did she really care all that much, and a lot of times it would result in me getting late, or I'd miss an entire day sometimes cause she wouldn't take me, after she got unreliable for a while, like on and off I told my parents about it, and I was the one who got yelled at, disciplined, and I got my phone taken for being late for something which was entirely out of my control. All my sister was told is that she needed to get their on time with me. This didn't change anything though for her. If anything, I told my parents I'd walk to school in the morning, and with it being a 2 hour walk there, I woke up at 4:45, brushed my teeth, put on my clothes and left with my stuff. For about 2-3 weeks I never even saw my sister at the house, normally I'd see her post on her private story on snap about her with some boy, I'd tell my parents and at one point they yelled at me to an extent where I was terrified. I'm saying this from the perspective that yelling became a little normal and so did me getting my phone or computer taken for something I didn't do. So, when they yelled I was terrified since the yelling was very bad. The point I'm trying to get at here is that even though she made my life miserable and my parents knew about it, they didn't care really about what I was doing, even though my sister didn't care about school, education, a future. I still did, I went to school, and in my opinion at least I worked my ass off since I spent 10 hours a day in school, and then 4 hours total to go and get home from school. I did all of this while still maintaining good grades so I could keep my parents proud, and I didn't take easy classes either, I didn't take an elective my entire freshman year. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I turned 15, it was most likely the worse year in my life when looking at everything I had to go through cause of her. I won't get into depth too much since I explained all that above, but in this case my parents always gave my sister the car, I'm not jealous about the car or anything since that didn't matter much to me, just the biggest thing to me was that regardless of what I did we were both treated differently. Nevertheless, at this time I was in my Sophomore year, and I was taking 10 classes again, same as last year with the 2 hour walk to school and 2 hour walk back. Sister still drove off regardless of what happened and I stopped depending on her, I started working too since my parents weren't well off, my Dad lost his job due to corona and my mother doesn't make good money. I did my best to help out where I could, especially with my younger sisters want or needs, I'm not really like your average teen I guess, I always saved every penny I could, never wanted to waste or buy things I didn't need since I just want to be successful and not turn out the way my older sister did. During this time, my sister crashed the car my parents gave her, and I had to pay for all of it, I told my parents I didn't want to and it was my fault, but then I got yelled at, my phone and computer taken for being greedy, disrespectful, irresponsible, and not caring about my sister. I don't think I was being greedy though I just wanted to save my money, and I don't know how I was disrespectful, I don't yell at my parents even though they yell at me, and I try to be as responsible as I can be with my classes, school, and grades since both my parents work long hours so I don't get to talk to them all that much with my schedule. Also, I just don't be with my sister cause it'll effect my life academically, socially, and just put me in a mental state I don't want to be in. I had no say though, every penny I had went towards paying for the car repairs, and my sister was handed the keys again, and then 2 months later, she crashes the car again and same thing, the last 2 months of me working my ass off just gone down the drain every penny was gone. Then the same thing repeated for the third time and then my Dad finally took the car away from her. I finally turned 16 though, this past April of this year. I was suppose to get my Dad's old car, since I'm graduating early, I skipped my Junior year and went directly into my Senior year, and even with this I had to take College courses since there was no available courses I could take at my school cause of how far ahead I was, so I worked my hardest to work on my Dad's car which was a hybrid which we still have to this day as well as the other one my older sister kept wrecking, and I did my best to clean the entire car with with the bare minimum that we had, literally a rag, cloth, soapy water, and a vaccuum, I took out each of the seats, cleaned them thoroughly, wiped down the car, cleaned every bit of it, and I also painted the tires, fixed a few things with leaks and such that weren't fixed since my parents couldn't afford them, the way I fixed them was spending a bit of my own money on repairs with the little I had and I learned everything I could. If you're asking why a 16 year old needed a car, and I needed it to get to College, High School, and work. Even with corona I still did a lot of things for my parents, main thing was fixing the cars, and working. With my Dad losing his job and me having some extra time on my hands I did what I could for them, and I don't think I've actually had a real moment of just myself since I've always been chased by doing what I want for them. Anyways, even after all the work I put in for the cars, cleaning the cars, paying for everything, it still wasn't good enough my parents just handed the car keys, as in the hybrid that was meant for me to my sister, and she ended up cracking one of the rims by hitting the curb too hard, made a dent, and scratched the side of the car on a beam, and then when she gets home all she says is I did so and so, as in all the damages to the car and then right after my parents tell me to go out, buy everything and fix it, without even asking like, more so demanding me to, and it just felt like all the effort I put in, working my ass off is gone. Keep in mind she drinks, has sex, and drugs in this car while having it. She runs away for a few days at a time and only comes home when she needs something.   


The two things I mentioned above are just things that stood out to me a lot, but I won't make this too long since it's gotten long enough. There has been a lot of times where my sister has thrown, hit, lied, or hurt me some how physically or mentally. When I mean thrown things at me, she's pushed me down the stairs, and just recently at the time of writing this, in front of my Dad I just asked her if she could be quiet and she bursted out into rage and directly hit me in the head with a TV remote, and my Dad's phone. No clue but she hit me with both of them and I fell down the stairs, the way our house is setup she was able to hit me from the living room while I was standing on the stairs asking her to just be a little quieter, and I fell down, back first down the stairs, the TV Remote and my Dad's phone were both cracked, phone screen shattered, and my parents yelled at me for it, and my Dad smacked me for it. When I say my sister bursted out into rage, she was crying and all red as well as yelling at the top of her lungs. My parents give her water and treat to her while I'm at the bottom of the stairs on my back trying to hold it together, I ended up getting up and just going into my room. Just a heads up, my room is on the very bottom floor away from my entire family. We live in a 3 story town house and my parents moved me into the very bottom room, so I don't interact with them much since I'm either always working, school/college, or doing something they asked me to. Especially today with everything that has built up over the years it kind of just broke me and it makes me just think about regardless of what I've done so far it's just like no matter what I've never heard a thank you, I'm proud of you, or anything it's like my parents don't care about me even though I do whatever I can for my sisters, I help pay the bills, pay for them, and do everything I can all together and it's just breaking me inside at this point cause everything I do just goes to a waste. My Dad still doesn't have a job, and every penny I make I don't even get, I had $4,000 in savings and my parents spent all of it in my Sister's College classes instead of taking a loan, and even though the classes were paid for my sister still didn't care, and this was before what happened today, about a week or so ago, my sister took the car and she chased after some boy illegally driving all the way to Connecticut for him, and she came back yells at me giving me a whole load of shit and then threw the keys at me and I got a cut some how, and I just don't bother telling my parents about it anymore since I feel like they won't care about it anymore so I lost hope.  


Anyways, the point of me asking this is, what should I do? Is there anything I can even do about my sister to change, maybe it's too late I don't know, but all the effort I've put in my parents don't appreciate anything. Like what should I do to change things, I don't really have anyone else I can go to about this irl, and with the one friend I did have I guess? Kind of just gone at this point, I don't know what to do though and it's effecting me mentally and I just want to get better or improve with what's going on.",19Oct2020,1
331,A few days ago some people called me up saying they were holding our dog ransom after seeing our lost dog signs. I thought they were scammers since they didn't provide any photos but they just texted me not too long ago a photo of what looks a match for my dog asking for many hundreds of dollars if they returned them.  I called the police and said I could file a ransom report in the morning and they would tell me they would go from there.  They the desk person said they couldn't tell me anything more than that.  Being in a large city I don't know if they will bother to help me. I will send the photo to anyone who thinks they can analyze it for any clues. Other than go to the cops does anyone have any advice for a situation like this.

337,"Long post sorry.

My supervisor and I clicked from the day we met and sure I thought he was cute but I knew not to make a move. Just a few days after we met, my coworkers started asking if I'm in a relationship, to which I answered no and I knew this had to do with him. So basically the rumor became that he likes me and that we look cute together. And this all started because he had told someone. All I was told it's someone from management and I knew it's him. It became so obvious because he only offered extra help to me, the way he acted and talked to me pointed to signs of liking me. And did flirt back and forth many times. 

Being young and having a first job and no experience with having an actual boyfriend, I got scared. I got scared thinking what if he makes a move? And what if some how we both lose our jobs. And although many people are couples at the job and have family members working as well, I got scared and nervous. 

This is where I fucked up. I started to distance myself and eventually we stopped talking. You know when you have something real good with someone and then it's gone in a heart beat? That's what it felt like and still does. 

He caught on and one day when it was just us he told me I hurt him by doing so. To which I couldn't even respond to. I just stood there quiet and ended up saying that he was treating me the same (obviously it was my fault so of course he wouldn't talk to me either). I wish I said sorry that day, I really did. It's been so many months and sure we act normal and all but we have many many awkward moments. Sometimes I can't even say hi. I just feel bad for treating him like that when it wasn't really his fault either.


I am quitting in a few weeks and this does have to do with all this and another manager hating on me because of him liking me. I haven't told anyone about this except two of my close work friends. My anxiety started to get worse every time I would go in for my shift and I decided this was the best to do. He found out I'm leaving after I told my manager and came to talk (apparently he never goes around to say bye to people who quit, so of course I got asked by coworkers what he said and why he came). In that moment I felt so bad. I wanted to talk privately and say how I'm sorry for treating him the way I did since he is one of the nicest people there. 


So here is my question to the people of reddit.

Should I ask to talk to him privately one of these days before I leave? I don't wanna have any regrets. I'm already so emotional and sad about leaving because I really liked working with everyone there. Maybe it shouldn't matter so much after all these months but I'm an overthinker and I just wanna leave on good terms. Please help me.

338,"This is my first time posting on reddit, so forgive me if I did something wrong, but I don't really know where else to go about this since I no longer have anyone else IRL to go to about this, so I thought it would be best to anonymously ask among people who may have gone through the same thing, or something similar, as well as how they potentially handled it or what did they to change their situation for the better.

I'm a 16M, overall I'm your typical boy, I lived a normal life I guess, but a lot of things were different cause of my sister. I'll just go over the events and then how it's all coming together now and I don't really know what to do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young, extremely young like nearly 1 year old, my family lived in this house with my family, and we had a beam in our home and my older sister threw me into it resulting in a cut in my eyebrow, and my face is slightly ""deformed"" not really deformed but one side of my face is slightly moved back compared to my other side, it's a big enough difference that when you look at one side compared to the other you can notice the difference. Nevertheless, we were both young so I guess it doesn't matter since a lot can happen between young kids so my parents didn't think much of it . Later on this led to a breathing problem of mine, so it's difficult for me to breathe normally out of my nose since the ""pipe"" I don't know what you call it is slightly smaller and swells up time to time, so it's difficult for me to do exercise sort of, back on track though.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Skipping through a lot of other things, since it's just casual siblings being rude to each other, we finally moved into a nicer home. This is where things start to change, I'm only 11, my older sister being 12, this is when things started to change a lot, she complained a lot about us moving into a nicer, larger, and more spacious home. I thought it was normal in a way since all she did was miss her friend, so it seemed normal, but she kept this going for an entire year, and when I mean an entire year I mean literally every week she'd blame my parents for her missing her friend, and the reason she was doing bad was cause of the new school, even though I was in the same school and doing completely fine, nothing new.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Skipping over to when she finally entered High School, she made a new friend, I'll call her Julia, of course I can't give her literal name. After she met Julia things started to change a lot, she started smoking, drinking, lying, going against especially me, and my entire family. She started not caring about School, grades, education, everything. While this was all happening I wasn't your typical boy I guess? I didn't go out much, and I was at home on a computer my father built together when we moved. I mainly just focus on being productive, learning to code or playing games with friends. I didn't also go out much since I have a breathing issue, so for me to consistently control my breathing while doing an exerting task was difficult, but I still did go out whenever I could.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know where to include this, but this is really where the differences in how we're treated started, so if just read from here if you don't want to read above. Above was just mainly a backstory,

&amp;#x200B;

not sure if any of it helps though, but no harm in including it right?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, after Julia came into play, my sister started getting very worse from her Sophomore to Junior year, at first it wasn't at bad, maybe she smoked, drank, or lied here and there, but overtime it started getting far worse, and I told my parents about it cause I was worried, in doing so my parents talked to my sister, but my parents always told her that I was the one that told them about my sister. When my sister first found out, she gave me a lot of shit for it, I told her directly that I was worried and it broke out into an argument, she got more aggravated than I've ever seen before, and she ended up throwing a computer mouse at me, and it wasn't too bad, left a bruise and the mouse cracked &amp; chipped a little from when it had fallen on the floor after it had hit my body. When I told my parents what happened, my parents didn't care about how I could've gotten hurt or what happened, they said I shouldn't of said anything and should've ignored her when she's angry, and then my Dad grabs my arm and smacks it hard enough to the point where there is his rashes/marks of his fingers on my arm. Then my Dad says I should never talk to my sister like that as in yell at her when we were arguing, and then my mom gives me a lecture on how I shouldn't of done anything and how it wasn't my problem and that I should only tell them what happens. Because of this specific situation, my sister goes around telling her friends, my friends, and practically anyone I knew that I was a ""snitch"" and that spread pretty quickly, and people I was getting close, as in my friends, new friends, or people I knew had a bad impression of me, and it resulted in a lot of different things, mainly socially. This made me more so just stay alone, independent, and not go out of my way for others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I told my parents what I knew and this went on for sometime, and eventually my older sister got a boyfriend, she was 16 at the time, I was 14. She went around telling a lot of people in High School that our family was very wealthy, my parents had amazing paying jobs, and a lot of different lies just to everyone around her. I didn't know about this since me and my sister aren't very close. So this resulted in a lot of people saying I was lying, and ruining my reputation, pretty much people though I was trying to get sympathy from them and get things out of them when my family was so called ""wealthy"" even though we aren't. During this time, I had intentions of graduating early since I didn't want to be in School cause of the way people perceived me and how people thought I was. So I just stayed very independent, and focused on school more than ever. I was taking 10 classes that year, 5 each Semester. I woke up at 6, got to School at 7, and got out of school at 5, and it was a 2 hour walk home everyday, during this time my sister had a car, but she only picked me up once and lied to my parents about picking me up, normally she was out with her friends or her boyfriend, drinking, smoking, sex, drugs, etc. (I only know about the sex because of one my so called ""friends."" Don't want to go into depth there though.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, the point of this is that I worked my ass off, like I really did, everyday I'd work my ass off for an entire year, and somedays it would get harder for me. With my sister having a car, she was responsible for dropping me to school, but my sister never cared about school, nor did she really care all that much, and a lot of times it would result in me getting late, or I'd miss an entire day sometimes cause she wouldn't take me, after she got unreliable for a while, like on and off I told my parents about it, and I was the one who got yelled at, disciplined, and I got my phone taken for being late for something which was entirely out of my control. All my sister was told is that she needed to get their on time with me. This didn't change anything though for her. If anything, I told my parents I'd walk to school in the morning, and with it being a 2 hour walk there, I woke up at 4:45, brushed my teeth, put on my clothes and left with my stuff. For about 2-3 weeks I never even saw my sister at the house, normally I'd see her post on her private story on snap about her with some boy, I'd tell my parents and at one point they yelled at me to an extent where I was terrified. I'm saying this from the perspective that yelling became a little normal and so did me getting my phone or computer taken for something I didn't do. So, when they yelled I was terrified since the yelling was very bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to get at here is that even though she made my life miserable and my parents knew about it, they didn't care really about what I was doing, even though my sister didn't care about school, education, a future. I still did, I went to school, and in my opinion at least I worked my ass off since I spent 10 hours a day in school, and then 4 hours total to go and get home from school. I did all of this while still maintaining good grades so I could keep my parents proud, and I didn't take easy classes either, I didn't take an elective my entire freshman year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I turned 15, it was most likely the worse year in my life when looking at everything I had to go through cause of her. I won't get into depth too much since I explained all that above, but in this case my parents always gave my sister the car, I'm not jealous about the car or anything since that didn't matter much to me, just the biggest thing to me was that regardless of what I did we were both treated differently. Nevertheless, at this time I was in my Sophomore year, and I was taking 10 classes again, same as last year with the 2 hour walk to school and 2 hour walk back. Sister still drove off regardless of what happened and I stopped depending on her, I started working too since my parents weren't well off, my Dad lost his job due to corona and my mother doesn't make good money. I did my best to help out where I could, especially with my younger sisters want or needs, I'm not really like your average teen I guess, I always saved every penny I could, never wanted to waste or buy things I didn't need since I just want to be successful and not turn out the way my older sister did.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, my sister crashed the car my parents gave her, and I had to pay for all of it, I told my parents I didn't want to and it was my fault, but then I got yelled at, my phone and computer taken for being greedy, disrespectful, irresponsible, and not caring about my sister. I don't think I was being greedy though I just wanted to save my money, and I don't know how I was disrespectful, I don't yell at my parents even though they yell at me, and I try to be as responsible as I can be with my classes, school, and grades since both my parents work long hours so I don't get to talk to them all that much with my schedule. Also, I just don't be with my sister cause it'll effect my life academically, socially, and just put me in a mental state I don't want to be in. I had no say though, every penny I had went towards paying for the car repairs, and my sister was handed the keys again, and then 2 months later, she crashes the car again and same thing, the last 2 months of me working my ass off just gone down the drain every penny was gone. Then the same thing repeated for the third time and then my Dad finally took the car away from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally turned 16 though, this past April of this year. I was suppose to get my Dad's old car, since I'm graduating early, I skipped my Junior year and went directly into my Senior year, and even with this I had to take College courses since there was no available courses I could take at my school cause of how far ahead I was, so I worked my hardest to work on my Dad's car which was a hybrid which we still have to this day as well as the other one my older sister kept wrecking, and I did my best to clean the entire car with with the bare minimum that we had, literally a rag, cloth, soapy water, and a vacuum, I took out each of the seats, cleaned them thoroughly, wiped down the car, cleaned every bit of it, and I also painted the tires, fixed a few things with leaks and such that weren't fixed since my parents couldn't afford them, the way I fixed them was spending a bit of my own money on repairs with the little I had and I learned everything I could. If you're asking why a 16 year old needed a car, and I needed it to get to College, High School, and work. Even with corona I still did a lot of things for my parents, main thing was fixing the cars, and working. With my Dad losing his job and me having some extra time on my hands I did what I could for them, and I don't think I've actually had a real moment of just myself since I've always been chased by doing what I want for them. Anyways, even after all the work I put in for the cars, cleaning the cars, paying for everything, it still wasn't good enough my parents just handed the car keys, as in the hybrid that was meant for me to my sister, and she ended up cracking one of the rims by hitting the curb too hard, made a dent, and scratched the side of the car on a beam, and then when she gets home all she says is I did so and so, as in all the damages to the car and then right after my parents tell me to go out, buy everything and fix it, without even asking like, more so demanding me to, and it just felt like all the effort I put in, working my ass off is gone. Keep in mind she drinks, has sex, and drugs in this car while having it. She runs away for a few days at a time and only comes home when she needs something.

&amp;#x200B;

The two things I mentioned above are just things that stood out to me a lot, but I won't make this too long since it's gotten long enough. There has been a lot of times where my sister has thrown, hit, lied, or hurt me some how physically or mentally. When I mean thrown things at me, she's pushed me down the stairs, and just recently at the time of writing this, in front of my Dad I just asked her if she could be quiet and she bursted out into rage and directly hit me in the head with a TV remote, and my Dad's phone. No clue but she hit me with both of them and I fell down the stairs, the way our house is setup she was able to hit me from the living room while I was standing on the stairs asking her to just be a little quieter, and I fell down, back first down the stairs, the TV Remote and my Dad's phone were both cracked, phone screen shattered, and my parents yelled at me for it, and my Dad smacked me for it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I say my sister bursted out into rage, she was crying and all red as well as yelling at the top of her lungs. My parents give her water and treat to her while I'm at the bottom of the stairs on my back trying to hold it together, I ended up getting up and just going into my room. Just a heads up, my room is on the very bottom floor away from my entire family. We live in a 3 story town house and my parents moved me into the very bottom room, so I don't interact with them much since I'm either always working, school/college, or doing something they asked me to.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially today with everything that has built up over the years it kind of just broke me and it makes me just think about regardless of what I've done so far it's just like no matter what I've never heard a thank you, I'm proud of you, or anything it's like my parents don't care about me even though I do whatever I can for my sisters, I help pay the bills, pay for them, and do everything I can all together and it's just breaking me inside at this point cause everything I do just goes to a waste. My Dad still doesn't have a job, and every penny I make I don't even get, I had $4,000 in savings and my parents spent all of it in my Sister's College classes instead of taking a loan, and even though the classes were paid for my sister still didn't care, and this was before what happened today, about a week or so ago, my sister took the car and she chased after some boy illegally driving all the way to Connecticut for him, and she came back yells at me giving me a whole load of shit and then threw the keys at me and I got a cut some how, and I just don't bother telling my parents about it anymore since I feel like they won't care about it anymore so I lost hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the point of me asking this is, what should I do? Is there anything I can even do about my sister to change, maybe it's too late I don't know, but all the effort I've put in my parents don't appreciate anything. Like what should I do to change things, I don't really have anyone else I can go to about this irl, and with the one friend I did have I guess? Kind of just gone at this point, I don't know what to do though and it's effecting me mentally and I just want to get better or improve with what's going on. I just want is some help and some advice since I don't know where else to go.",19Oct2020,1

343,"Hi reddit! I know the title isn't very difficult to answer but the situation and my emotions in this matter are my biggest concern here. I'll also give context for this, I'm sorry it might be long but I really feel like the details are necessary.
This friend in question ""John""(M/23) used to be a very close friend of mine(F/23) &amp; my BF's(M/25). My BF has known John for years before I met him in their gaming friend group but when we did meet we hit it off and even decided to say we were each other's best friends. I've never had close friends stay for long so I basically latched onto the next person who treated me with the upmost respect (right next to BF). I'll also note that he lives in another country and we mostly just talk over PSN. Our friendship had its ups and downs but earlier this year (January) I had a life altering event happen to me that I'm 100% NOT ready to talk about with ANYONE aside from my BF since it included him. I was really out of it for a while and tried to explain to John at the time that I really didn't want to talk about it AT ALL. Honestly the only reason why we were talking about this event was because he kind of pried since I went AFK for a bit and didn't answer anyone, I tried to play it off but he had an idea it was something huge. I felt really bad because I didn't want to tell him but it was really nothing against him at all, this event IS huge to me and I really don't want to discuss it with anyone other than my BF. I thought it was the end of that and we moved on with our lives.
Until March came around where John started acting very strange and after a bit he finally admitted to me that he was holding onto a secret that ""would make you and BF break up, you and everyone in this friend group fall apart"" and he didn't want to talk about it. I started to think it was blackmail or something to hang over my head bc I didn't want to tell him about my shit going on, but he beat me to it before I even mentioned it by saying ""I know it sounds crazy but I promise it's not because you don't want to tell me your thing, this secret I have is really stressing me out."" I didn't want to pry because he seemed genuine and wanted to make it clear that something WAS bothering him but he didn't want to tell me. I completely respected it and told him if he wanted to tell me someday he could &amp; I wouldn't mind. This is where it started to get strange, because when I talk to him or anyone about serious things I tend to laugh nervously or chuckle because I don't like to be serious 100% of the time and if I can make the mood lighter (either for myself or everyone else) then I will. He shut me down immediately and told me that it wasn't a laughing matter, and that laughing meant I was making fun of his stress and that I was an asshole. Thoroughly confused and not wanting to argue I apologized and said I'll respect his privacy about this.
See, if this was something that was happening in his life that I had NO control over I wouldn't have minded, however, throughout the next few months he would make small comments about his secret and how ""it's getting harder to handle"". A few nights we'd have some fun drunk gaming sessions and mostly all of them would end in him saying ""oh god I didn't tell you the secret did I? I was so out of it I was afraid I did..."" or ""if I tell you the secret... it's not THAT bad actually but it has changed the way I see you as a person and it makes me really stressed out"" or ""this secret is a headache I wake up with everyday and I don't know how to handle it"" all of this I would give him the same response 'I'm sorry it's bothering you, if you want to tell me you can but I won't pry it out of you if you don't want me to' and so forth. His response would always be ""you can't help me even if I tell you. And you and BF would break up and we wouldn't be friends anymore."" This was starting to get to me however, I kept my cool and I continued on like it was nothing because he was really happy when I just ignored it or didn't talk about it anymore.
We recently had a big falling out when during one of our drunk sessions he lashed out at my BF for continuing to talk to his estranged sister (if anyone's curious I might post a separate story explaining what happened between BF &amp; his family but long story short we try not to talk to them for very big personal reasons) like it was no big deal. My BF does not like his sister was only on speaking terms with her in order to keep his youngest sister still in his life because he loves her and she's basically the only acceptable part of his family. John and BF's sister are exes, and her name is kind of a huge triggering point for him (unbeknownst to us at the time bc usually when we mention her we talk shit, have a laugh and get on with our lives) when he's drinking so he started to go off about how horrible of a person BF is for still speaking to his sister and called him every name off the dictionary you can think of. BF was obviously upset and they started yelling at each other over voice chat for a bit before I intervened and calmed them down. Long story short after all of us were sober enough we talked about it and my BF privately spoke with John about the nights events a few days after.
The reason why this was a falling out was because after their private sober talk my BF was very confrontational with me and started accusing me of sharing private stuff about us with John. I admitted to BF that I told John SOME private stuff (again, John was my best friend at the time) but nothing drastic. BF was obviously hurt and I felt horrible about it, but when I told John about issues BF and I were having in our relationship I told him in confidence. I was looking for support from someone who I thought genuinely cared for me. I needed a friend and advice at the time without my BF's opinion because well, it was about my BF and I'd like to admit John did help me during our rough patches. But when John told BF that I was telling him 'everything' and that John was basically on 'BF's side through everything &amp; if only you knew what she told me...' BF blew up and that's when I had to tell him exactly what we discussed. I don't regret confiding in John but I do regret not telling BF right away that I was telling John about our issues. I value trust and honesty in a relationship and I wasn't exactly holding true to my beliefs at that time. I was very mad at John for trying to cause a scene for no apparent reason but I wouldn't be lying if I said that because of that BF &amp; I are much closer than we were before and are doing much much better. 
Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, the reason why I'm asking for advice in the first place. I was playing an online game with John &amp; my friend ""Lily"" and we were having a fun night since I decided to ignore the fact that John had betrayed my trust as a friend and just wanted to play my favorite games with them. We decided to talk briefly about BF's sister/John's ex (she was friends with all of us at one point and has also wronged us in so many ways, again we talk shit then move on) and I stated that I was very glad that BF was no longer talking to the sister anymore and wasn't going to make an attempt at all and that this chapter in his life can be closed for good. John piped up saying that that is horrible and began crying. Lily and I were very confused and tried our best to calm him down, but the reason why he was crying was because ""if BF isn't talking to his family anymore he's gonna be all alone, and so are you DeadpanJukes."" I was floored completely by this response especially since he was sober. Lily &amp; I tried our best to calmly explain how toxic BF's family is and how all of us know why it's amazing that he's no longer in contact with them and how much happier BF is. John was very adamant and kept repeating that if he told us the secret the friend group would fall apart and me &amp; BF would be alone. He said that sometime years ago BF mentioned that family was very very important to him (and it very much still is, however he realized how toxic HIS family is and decided to distance himself from them) and that it made him upset that he wasn't talking to them anymore. I was almost at my breaking point of anger especially since he's basically insinuating that this secret has something to do with me or BF and how he's basically the 'make or break' of our relationship. Also because not very long ago he called BF an asshole for still talking to them??? I told John if he isn't gonna tell us then I'll genuinely think he's stressing about absolutely nothing and how insane it was to think that none of us could help him. I made the mistake of throwing in a nervous laugh to which he snapped at me ""don't you dare fucking laugh at this, this is very fucking serious how dare you think this is a joke."" I replied, very seriously this time that if he's gonna be mentioning this all the time then I'm going to act like it's nothing and that he enjoys giving himself stress over absolutely nothing and that I can't help him if he doesn't want to open up about it. He retorted that no one including me can help him with this secret, and that it'd be better if we all just pretended this never happened. I was visibly shaking with anger because he decided to make a huge debacle out of this that was obviously about me and BF and isn't going to tell me. (Poor Lily was just there now, completely silent and having nothing to do with it) I told John once again that if he's gonna stress then I'm just gonna think it's nothing because he isn't telling us what it is, and what finally pushed me to get off the chat was the fact that he said my life &amp; BF's life would be ruined if we ever found out that no one could help HIM (no not BF, John meant HIMSELF) and that it made him happy knowing that me and BF are oblivious and happy. That we were better off not knowing. This made me cry and I angrily got off chat and haven't spoken to him since. After that conversation I immediately called BF and cried and asked if there was anything he was keeping secret from me, because the way John had spoke in his wavering and crying tone made me think he was actually serious and he probably knew something I didn't. BF &amp; I had a very long heart to heart talk and ended it with throwing out conspiracies about what the secret could be. I don't want to sound ignorant but I'd like to think BF &amp; I don't keep a lot of secrets from each other especially since we live together and have each other's locations on. Me and him have multiple phones (no service and mostly for music and YouTube tbh) but we have the passwords to them and everything else you can think of. No one questions it when we are on the others phone and no one questions it when we make fun of how fast we're driving on the road. I don't think it's ever crossed my mind that he's unfaithful because of how open we are to each other. The worst thing he's ever kept from me was keeping a wet towel in the room for a few days after his shower and us arguing about it lol, and one of the worst things I've done was obviously trust in John about our private issues. Aside from that I stand by what I said earlier and that honesty and trust are two things I value the most in someone. BF has done wonders to not let this whole thing get to him, so much so that he still talks to John as if nothing happened but I can't bring myself to do that at all. I'm tired of pretending everything's alright and that nothing is going on. I want to talk about issues anyone is having with me upfront and try to come to some kind of understanding, I love confrontation and I love communicating calmly and clearly with people whenever we have a problem. After years of having and dealing with toxic relationships I've deducted that TALKING is one of the most greatest and simplest things to do. Anyone who isn't willing to come to a compromise just isn't worth the time then.
The thing is, I can't even begin to think about calmly talking to John. I am so fucking mad and I have absolutely no idea how to calm down. The thing that makes me mad is the fact that John truly believes in this secret so much, and that he basically admitted that he knows BF &amp; I better than we know ourselves and how he doesn't believe we can't get through just about anything. I've been through hell and back with BF, theres shit we've been through that I've never discussed with John and I'm sorry but a silly little secret isn't going to destroy us, lmao. 
Lily is taking John's advice and is acting as if this never happened, but she understands my frustration. She's being very neutral and I appreciate it. I don't want to involve Lily more than John already has because she must be just as confused as I am and this really isn't her issue. Another friend in our group reached out to me asking if I was alright because I haven't been online in weeks and I admitted that it had to do with John (no specifics) and that I wanted to talk to him soon but I'm just so mad but regardless I'm doing great. Friend hasn't gotten back to me but just gave me a thumbs up, it was mostly just a check up message anyways I appreciated it nonetheless. BF straight up tells me John is toxic and that if he's in chat then he'll talk with him but not for long. The more I think about it the more angrier I get and all my favorite distractions are starting to fade. The only way I see a resolve in this is to try and talk to John about this directly but god I'm so fucking pissed, calm confrontation is the last thing on my mind.
Can anyone help me decide another way to go about this? I really want closure and it's kind of eating me alive knowing that he's happy about me not knowing and that he knows EXACTLY how we will react to this huge secret.",19Oct2020,1
344,"Me and my girlfriend usually use condoms. One day about a week and a half maybe two weeks ago, I finished with a condom on and went to go pee and put it back in without a condom (after 20-30 mins) I didn’t finish though and it wasn’t for more than 3 minutes. We had sex again after maybe 3-7 days after where we started off with no condom but put one on after a couple minutes of being nervous. Her cycle used to start on the 28th of the month but after she got with me it starting coming on the 18th. Yesterday was the 18th and she hasn’t gotten her period yet. I’m kinda scared but not totally freaked out. I know for a fact that I did not finish in her. I am aware of precum but I have peed before every time I put it in without a condom. Recently I fingered her and felt that her cervix was easy to find and firm and I read that this is a sign that she hadn’t conceived but who knows.

Should I be nervous? Or is there really a low chance that she could be pregnant? We’re both 17 btw",19Oct2020,1
345,"To be honest I need help, so this is my story. 

Very recently a dear friend of mine made a terrible decision and hurt me in the process. I’m going to do my best to spare you all of the horrific details but I have been traumatized on a level I never thought I would see. I don’t especially want to relive any of this, but I can no longer ignore the fact that I genuinely could use some good advice from people who may have been at least close to in my shoes. 

(Warning graphic from here out) 
(Also a little back story) 

So a friend of mine (x-military), who I was very close to, had been living out of my state for quite a few years. After a couple years he was discharged. According to him he was sent to a military rehab of sorts for alcohol. I didn’t know what happened and still don’t fully know what happened but something bad happened during his time in the military and it changed him more than I could ever imagine. 

Shortly after his stint in the military and his discharge, he actually went completely missing for a few months. Finally after a couple months he reached out to me along with a few select other friends and let us know he was ok but he had been off the deep end on some hard drugs. 

Fast forward a couple months and my friend has called again telling me he’s now in a completely new state living in a sober living house. 

Fast forward a few more months and I get a call that he is traveling through my state on his way north. He stops by, still sober for the most part but drinking here and there (fine with me as long as it wasn’t heroin like before). He visits me for one night and leaves the next day. 

Fast forward about 6 more months to what is pretty much current day. He apparently is living with some step-family up north and working and doing good. Said he was drinking and smoking weed but clean otherwise. 

Well my friend calls me out of the blue (as was his style at this point) and says his family is going to the beach in my state and invites me to join them. He abruptly drives over 12 hours to get to my house. His family already at the beach as far as I was told. 

Upon arrival both he and I were both over joyed to see each other and the day starts out great. We decide to hang at my house for the night and leave for the beach the next morning. During this time we are drinking and smoking and even have some company stop by here and there as we are swimming and enjoying our day. 

As the day went on I noticed he was becoming more and more quiet and possibly even depressed. He really stopped talking pretty much all together and was surely in his head. Me and this friend again were very close so I sat with him on a swing as nightfall came and consoled him the best I could for probably 2+ hours. He really wouldn’t say anything, and that was ok with me, I knew something had happened in the military but I didn’t know what and I didn’t feel the need to pry it out of him. So I sat there with my arm around him, told him how much I loved him and how happy I was he finally back home and safe with his friends. He was emotional yet still silent, at one point even crying on my shoulder briefly. 

At this point in the story he and I are sharing the bench while 2 of my other friends stand across from us on the other side of an unlit fire pit. This is the part where things go very bad very quickly. 

(Graphic warning) 

My friend had stood up from the swing and moved to my right simply standing up, I didn’t pay much mind to it at all. I’m talking to my other 2 friends who are there and one of them is walking off to my left as this happens. As I’m looking to my left and talking to my other friend as he heads inside, I hear my x-military friend yell “FUCK” at the same time as I hear glass break. I turn my head back towards my friend who I had been sitting with comforting, thinking he must have knocked a bottle onto the pool deck. What I turned to see was much worse. 

It was very dark at this point and my friend was facing away from me but by the time I look over it appears that he’s got something near his throat. I could really only see his silhouette, as the only lights out there were actually by the pool pointed at the ground and on the opposite side of my friend as I. So I look over to see his silhouette doing the unimaginable. He had broken a beer bottle and was attacking his own throat with it.

Before I could think, I reacted. I was a few feet away and I jumped and grabbed him trying to stop him from what ever he was doing. It was so dark I couldn’t even see what if anything was in his hands. I grabbed his right hand with my right hand and without thinking put my other hand in between him and what ever he was trying to hurt himself with. At this point and in time I didn’t even realize I was in danger or how severe the situation had become. 

(WARNING VERY GRAPHIC) 

In just the blink of an eye, I’ve managed to wrestle him to the ground, but I was far too late. The damage he had already done was gut wrenching. I knew deep down in the instant I could finally see him that this was very very bad. Worse than any movie could try and picture. This was no small slit, his throat had been completely torn away. 

It is at this point as I try and hold him back together and scream for help that I realize I can no longer move my fingers. As I look down at my blood soaked hands I realize my fingers are barely hanging onto the bone, and that my other arm/hand had somehow been cut/stabbed multiple times in the attempt to stop him. I can only assume he had picked up glass in both hands. 

I start to pass out from blood loss. I’m barely strong enough to call out for help and as I start to see grey pinhole vision. finally another friend has jumped into action and started to help hold him together. At this point I’m dragged a few feet from the hurt friend, and I pass out for at least a couple seconds. I come back to and crawl back over to my friend and I hold him and beg him to stay with me. 

Fast forward, finally he’s into an ambulance and was still alive as the emts carted him away. At this point I’m barely able to stay conscious as I await my own ambulance. I’m forced to go alone due to covid, no shoes and in a wet bathing suit and shirtless, unable To use either of my hands. I spend 4 hours in the ER having my hands reconstructed and prepared for future surgery. 

My left hand is fucked. 

Both flexor and extensor tendons as well as the nerves, were severed across 3 fingers on my left hand. Furthermore a deep puncture on top of my right hand had severed the tendon and nerve headed towards my pointer/first finger. 

It pains me to say that my friend didn’t make it. Shortly after getting home just before sunrise, the local police show up again and let me know my friend is dead and force to me to go downtown and make a full statement. Which I did (though it did suck considering the extreme pain both physically and mentally.) finally I’m home before noon the next day. 

I barely knew the mans family to begin with but was forced to relive it over and over with several of his family members as naturally they wanted to know what the hell happened. They have treated me like the enemy the entire time and implied it’s my fault allowing him to drink, despite the fact that he had been drinking and smoking prior to this. Part of me understands they want someone to blame.  

In the end I’ve lost a brother. 

We were both musicians both in our 20s, and now I’ve lost the use of my left fingers. I’m currently heading towards almost 2 months out of microscopic surgery and I’m just beginning to be able to bend my fingers. Some worse than others. 

The weight the entire experience has been unbearable. 

After the fact I come to learn via one or two people that he had attempted not too long ago. And that he had something terrible happen to him while he was across seas. I didn’t know any of this until after  everything had already happened. 

Anyway I do carry an unfair amount of guilt, though I know he did this, I can’t escape the pain of him doing this in my presence. My heart was so full he was home to begin with. Idk... it all feels so surreal. 

It will be possibly years before I can play any of my instruments again. I’m living in a constant state of flashback. My depression and anxiety have reached all time highs. I actually just left my mothers house for the first time since the incident last night and attended a social function thrown together by some close friends at our local botanical gardens. 

Anyway.... it’s hard to imagine ever being normal again. Last night was hard. Every waking moment has been hard. I’ve been at rock bottom while dealing with the worst physical injuries of my life, in a constant state of physical and emotional turmoil and pain. 

The advice I’m looking for is how to move forward. I understand that it’s in the past. I understand I could spend my entire life wondering why and never know. I understand he didn’t mean to hurt me. I’m just looking for genuine advice on how to escape the tightness in my chest. How to not look at every beer bottle as a weapon. How to appreciate life’s many splendors despite the horrors that come along with it. 

TL:DR - My dear friend broke a beer bottle, attacked him self. I tried to stop him and was hurt badly and at the same time unable to stop my friend. Looking for advice on how to move forward.",19Oct2020,1

I genuinely don’t know how to feel about the situation I have with my family. 

My mom is alright, I mean, she buys food, actively takes care of our family and is constantly taking care of things. But at the same time, she randomly stopped liking my friends, constantly says she doesn’t like what I wear (even though she buys it) and I generally just feel like I can’t tell her anything. I talk to my aunt more about my problems than her because I feel like if I say something she’ll shut me down or won’t do anything about it.

My step-dad is a complete narcissistic asshole. A black Hebrew Israelite that hates anyone that isn’t exactly like them. Not only has he fucking solidified his presence in our house, he constantly gets into arguments with my mom and manipulates her. He pretends to care about me, my mom and my brother, but in reality he’s looking for a new wife to control. He’s been divorced 3 times already.

My little brother is a baby. Not much said here. He’s too young to understand what’s appending now, but I constantly get anxious because when I leave for college, he’ll be all alone and will have to deal with my mom and step-dad’s bullshit.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not being physically abused, starved, or anything horrible like that, but I’m so mentally drained, I can’t stand being around my family to the point where I’m mostly in my room now. Please help. I really need advice on this.",19Oct2020,1

351,"There’s this girl I’ve had my eyes on for a while now, but have yet to message her. I’m not necessarily nervous or anything, but I don’t want to waste an opportunity on her. Honestly she’s very attractive and fits the perfect looking girl type for me. And judging from when I knew her and from what she posts, we share a lot in common. 

     We knew each other back in middle school, but haven’t had any classes together in high school. When my interest in her sparked last year (10th grade) once I followed her on instagram, my friend convinced me to ask her out as a Valentine to see what’d she say. I did end up doing it, but it was a wasted opportunity because my profile only had one video of my skate clip, so I’m guessing she only remembered how I looked in middle school. And she obviously didn’t know me well enough to actually consider it. So she rejected me in a pretty nice way so I just jokingly replied by asking, “it’s alright, maybe next year?” and she left it off with “hopefully”. 

The point is I want to actually get to know her without being shut down. I’m not gonna lose sleep over it if it happens again, but I just don’t wanna look back on it as another wasted opportunity. So, I plan on updating my IG with more skate edits and a different profile pic. I’ve also recently been posting a few stories to try and hint how I share the same interests as her. For example, posting my cat, or some of my skate clips.

I’m a 16m, 5’8-5’9, and around may of this year, I was 160, and I’m pretty sure that’s my good weight. Throughout quarantine I’ve been quite the pig and I ate my way to 210 at my highest. I have no trouble losing weight and I’ve done it before, but this is the most I’ve ever lost.

353,"I have not had a single friend since I was 9 years old. No exaggeration here. Not a single one.

My parents divorced when I was 12. It was really bad. Both of my parents ranted to me for a year straight about how awful the other parent was. Sometimes they'd have a full mental breakdown right in front of me. I was just an innocent 12 year old who wanted to get my homework done so I could play Minecraft and watch YouTube. And yet instead of handling it like an adult, they ask ME for advice on things and if I think the other parent is awful or not.

To this day, I wish they were still together. Just writing this is making me really sad. 

A few more things to add:

I have no motivation to go to college. I'll probably fail and drop out because I'm too stupid. And I won't make friends because I'm too socially awkward.

I have never even been on a date before.

I am now failing two of my classes and it's my senior year. Who knows if I will even graduate on time at this point? I simply don't care anymore however, as it's evident my life will never improve.

360,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Basically, I love my dad and have always been a 'dad's boy' since birth, really. My parents have not been 'together' for as long as I can remember, but have lived together, due to lack of money for one of them to move out. With the death of my grandparents on my maternal side, my mum inherited some money which has allowed her to move out and get her own place, which is happening in the next week or so.

As I said before, there 'relationship' has always been rocky, with my dad being found on various chat sites over the course of a few years; not necessarily to find women, just to talk (at least from what I can gather). But this entails using a fake name, and fake age. With my mum moving out next week, she has found him on another one of these sites and showed it to me basically saying, 'I don't want you to mention this to your dad'. She knows it's my dad since he has sent her photos of himself, and I've seen this.

I really don't know how to feel, I still love him, and feel as if I should feel something more than 'oh well'. It's just very strange because I know I'd kick off at my mum if I found her on one of those sites.

361,"30M. I'm pretty much a failure.

It wasn't always like this though. Graduated from a top 20 university in 2012. Couldn't find a job without experience, became depressed and addicted to weed. During my time in college I wrote school papers and did assignments for international students to make some money. I come from a poor family and needed to make ends meet. I kept at it and it was very convenient. Get high all day, work when I want to from the comforts of home. Most community colleges offer online classes and having the login for blackboard/canvas was enough to complete all necessary courses to transfer for these students. The pay was good too.

Anyway, at this point in life I don't want to keep doing what I'm doing. I quit smoking about a month ago because I wanted to get my life together. Getting high all day, doing jack shit and working from home pretty much made me a recluse. I don't like what I do for a living despite the money.  I'm responsible for getting hundreds of international students into top universities, depriving the opportunity for hard working students that deserve it more than those rich Chinese kids that buy their way into these schools. But since I have no legitimate work experience, it seems impossible to start a fresh career (econ major accounting minor). I'm debating between graduate school and working abroad. I feel that graduate school would make me a more attractive candidate for work since employers tend to favor fresh graduates. On the other hand, I've always wanted to travel. Maybe teach English in Korea or Japan for a year. Perhaps I just want to get away from it all and start fresh, see the world rather than wasting my life away. What do you guys think?",19Oct2020,1
362,"Okay, to start this off, I'm a 22 year old male and I've dealt with adhd since I was way younger. I started medication around age 10 and didn't change my prescription up until I was like 21, so I was on the same concerta for 11 years. Due to this I'm pretty much fully addicted to my ADHD meds, and I'm also taking antidepressants and impulse control meds which really aren't working. I dropped out of college a while back because I couldn't show up to classes or do my work, but I've never lost a job because of attendance- the only job I've not left from on my own terms was when I was let go from a driving job (best job I've had) due to two instances of scraping a work truck on accident. 

Back in May I started working at a multibillion dollar company that has a reputation for bad work environments- and i have to say, people were wrong at least where this warehouse is concerned. One thing they do is allow VTO, which is when they have too many people/ not enough work and send people home for no pay, but no penalty otherwise. 

Recently business has dropped at our warehouse and they've been allowing vtos at the beginning of the shift. The shift is 4 days a week 1230 am- 11 pm, and the job is great except for one big thing- its braindead as hell. Its just a bunch of sorting boxes into bags so they can be delivered. Now its something id love to do because its easy as hell but as a safety precaution they don't allow headphones and they can't play music due to building volume levels, and so its 7 hours of straight silence with breaks, thinking about how much I hate myself pretty much. For a while I would work until 8 and vto, not tell my mom and hide in my car until 11. However recently its gotten so bad that ill go a full week without going to work. 

However, that translates as no money on my paycheck,and my mom monitors my money. I have a seperate work account where all my money goes first anx I used to transfer money over and say I was using my seperate account for other purchases- until I stopped working entirely. Now I use my gf, who recently moved out with friends, as a scapegoat, saying I'm paying for her Lyfts to work and helping with her bills and claiming one member didn't pay for the bills. At first she was okay with this but she grew to find it really uncomfortable, and while I'm an anxious depressed broken mess and maybe an asshole im not an unreasonable asshole, so of course I promised myself this week I would stop using her as an excuse. However work now is very minimal and they've resulted in ""social distancing"" which is keeping workers in the break room until they have something to do. That drove me even more crazy so I vtoed two days in a row, mom is super disappointed and I really need money.

The question is I need advice on how to convince myself to stay and work. Or maybe how to drown out my negative thoughts. I like the job, great pay and the 4 day schedule is great so I dont want to leave but I also don't know how to fix myself, especially since meds aren't helping. Any advice? Thank you!

I could get into a lot but I’ll make this simple: 
My life didn’t start till I was 21 when I got my greencard, I was undocumented all my life so I couldn’t work. I worked and made friends then by 23 I finally got my license and went to college. I’m hoping to finish my associates in 4 years or less. (I’m paying out of pocket to avoid debt and there are a multitude of pre-requisites I must take before going)

I am horribly upset at myself for my own mediocracy. I come from a long line of great people. My grandfather was a mayor, the other one an architect. I grew up to be a lowly nurse. I am furious that I am unintelligent, unattractive, awkward, and uneducated. 

Sometimes when my friends talk about other girls or other people being super cool I will literally not respond or try to walk away and convince myself never to respond again, even though I never really do. I think what I’ll have to do is muster up some excuse to truly cut them off and save them the trouble for having to deal with me ( I don’t talk about my concerns or my insecurities with them because I know no one is responsible for my inferiority except for myself) 

I don’t hate myself despite how it may sound, instead I know I am capable of being something amazing, something bigger than I could even mention. But I find myself fighting me all the time. I tell myself I’m worthless if I don’t get 85% on a test or higher (I try to aim for 100) I tell myself I’m useless and disgusting and that there are so many people better than me and all I have to do is grind and feel uncomfortable to achieve self worth.  I’m not happy, I’m not sad, I’m uncomfortable, but I’ve attached productivity with negativity and I don’t know how to disarm myself. 

Sometimes I reach clarity. Like the other night I thought “ hey - is this really working of you’re not cleaning up or doing xyz? Maybe self hating isn’t helpful” AND I AM STILL SELF HATING’

I tried therapy but cliches like “ hey don’t worry you’ve got time you’re young” doesn’t remove the fact that people called me worthless for working my job and being late in life. It doesn’t change the fact that by the time I’ll be worth dating there will likely be no one worth dating.

Thanks to COVID , my regular job as an usher was put on hold (hopefully we’ll be up and running again by November), so I was looking for a second job. 
Fast forward a few months, and I was finally successful in gaining a job at an arcade sort of place. The manager told me that the work would only be casual, which was fine. At least I had work. 

However, for the first couple of shifts I had, I had extreme anxiety about going into work, and nagging feelings that something would go wrong during work. Sometimes it would be fine, but for about four of the six/seven shifts that I had in total, some issues did occur. Also, the manager, as I found out, was not always the nicest person. They would be cheerful and chatty one minute, then snide and rude the next, and given that I suffer from mild anxiety, it made me nervous to be around them, but I always remained polite and did anything they told be to do.

The main issue happened almost a month ago. All employees were emailed the roster sheet to fill in their availability for the next two weeks. I filled mine in, sent it off, and have heard nothing back. No texts, no calls, no emails. I didn’t think too much about it at first, but as time has gone on, I’m beginning to loose hope. I have been an employee there for about six weeks, if not less. I’m hurt too, because this is not the first time something like this has happened to me. 

I feel like I should just go for it and send the manager that I’m leaving.",19Oct2020,1

370,"I want advice because he may have given it to me knowingly. It's not an incredibly visible one but it can be spread through even just kissing, apparently. I feel violated and ruined right out of the gate. I tried to approach this before but he became pretty defensive and told me that he really had no idea, except the way that he spoke about it was honestly as if he'd given it a lot of thought before. I remember that when we first started dating, he said he was a germaphobe because he never shared food/drinks with anyone but now it honestly seems like he did it because he knew he was contagious.

That said, I really care about him and if I put myself in the shoes of someone who has this, as someone who now very likely has it herself, I can sort of understand why someone would choose to keep it hidden, as horrible as that is. I just wish that I had been given a choice.

371,"I don't know how or what to describe (in the sense that I don't know what information may be needed to identify what's wrong with me) this. I'm 21M. I won't go too much into my past. Just something in short:
I have severely toxic and narcissistic parents,  any my entire childhood and teenage passed with having to witness their daily (and I mean, DAILY) violent verbal/physical fights. Once upon a time, they used to force me to pick sides regularly, and make me their punching bag.
Half a year back, I broke up with my ex. Since day one, she's been severely toxic, but I chose to ignore the red flags because I thought I needed love, and 'certain sacrifices' must be made for it. She never took every SINGLE opportunity to humiliate me by mentioning her long line of rich and hot exes. That shit broke me. And understand, that this happened after every 2 days or so. She always threatened to break up with me. It was only around June this year, after she had pulled off months of an almost no-contact with me (on the context that I once confronted her with posting something that I thought was about one of her exes, and that day, I've had enough, and I unloaded my months of suppressed rage on her. No, I don't mean physically. I mean, over a phone call.)

Anyways, coming to the present problem. With each passing day, I feel that there's this void inside me that I cannot fill with anything. I'm not static/lazy in life, and I devote almost all of my waking hours to learning some stuff (keeping that confidential here) so as to both move on and gain financial independence from my shit parents (I live in a country where there are almost 0 ways for someone of 21 to earn any sustainable amount of money). I've dreams, of gaining independence, and exploring the world, and living life like it's meant to be. But, the void keeps getting bigger and bigger. I cannot find happiness in almost all of the things that other normal people can. I don't have friends, I just have people who talk to me and I talk to them. Nobody converses with me like I hear people do in movies/web series/novels/real life, etc, because I know that people find me mentally repulsive. I cannot talk about things that people do.

Some have said on Reddit earlier that I might be having PTSD. I know it for a fact that I've been severely depressed since almost a decade.

Can somebody please recommend me what to do?",19Oct2020,1

Long post sorry.

My supervisor and I clicked from the day we met and sure I thought he was cute but I knew not to make a move. Just a few days after we met, my coworkers started asking if I'm in a relationship, to which I answered no and I knew this had to do with him. So basically the rumor became that he likes me and that we look cute together. And this all started because he had told someone. All I was told it's someone from management and I knew it's him. It became so obvious because he only offered extra help to me, the way he acted and talked to me pointed to signs of liking me. And did flirt back and forth many times. 

Being young and having a first job and no experience with having an actual boyfriend, I got scared. I got scared thinking what if he makes a move? And what if some how we both lose our jobs. And although many people are couples at the job and have family members working as well, I got scared and nervous. 

This is where I fucked up. I started to distance myself and eventually we stopped talking. You know when you have something real good with someone and then it's gone in a heart beat? That's what it felt like and still does. 

He caught on and one day when it was just us he told me I hurt him by doing so. To which I couldn't even respond to. I just stood there quiet and ended up saying that he was treating me the same (obviously it was my fault so of course he wouldn't talk to me either). I wish I said sorry that day, I really did. It's been so many months and sure we act normal and all but we have many many awkward moments. Sometimes I can't even say hi. I just feel bad for treating him like that when it wasn't really his fault either.


I am quitting in a few weeks and this does have to do with all this and another manager hating on me because of him liking me. I haven't told anyone about this except two of my close work friends. My anxiety started to get worse every time I would go in for my shift and I decided this was the best to do. He found out I'm leaving after I told my manager and came to talk (apparently he never goes around to say bye to people who quit, so of course I got asked by coworkers what he said and why he came). In that moment I felt so bad. I wanted to talk privately and say how I'm sorry for treating him the way I did since he is one of the nicest people there. 


So here is my question to the people of reddit.

Should I ask to talk to him privately one of these days before I leave? I don't wanna have any regrets. I'm already so emotional and sad about leaving because I really liked working with everyone there. Maybe it shouldn't matter so much after all these months but I'm an overthinker and I just wanna leave on good terms. Please help me.


TLDR: supervisor and I stopped talking due to a misunderstanding and I'm wondering if I should say sorry before I quit.",19Oct2020,1
374,"Hi I'm 17M and I'm basketball player and that is where problem starts. I am from small city where I went to school and had very good grades. I played basketball there. Then very good basketball club from big city near my city offered me to come and play. And I accepted. I'm one month in living without my parents and going to school here in big city and training. Problem is I don't have passion and love for basketball anymore, but my parents are so proud of me and they want me to train here because it is better club. I have 3 trainings a day and I have to go to school. I can't sleep well I don't have time, school is a lot harder here and I need to study a lot more but I don't have a time.

375,"Okay so before I get into it, here’s just some important background info. I’m a 24F and I’m living with my parents until I save up enough to move out. My parents were married when they were 18 but got divorced when I was 3. My parents co parented pretty much my entire life and recently got back together and remarried.
I believe the relationship I have between my parents is very toxic and is making me resent them a little and I’m not sure how it happened. Maybe I’m the problem, maybe they are. I’m just at my breaking point with this drama and my mental health is slowly just progressing downhill. My parents have started or have been my whole life behaving negatively towards me and have been super controlling. 
I started noticing this behavior about a month ago when my mom calls me while I’m giving a friend a ride to work and says, “Get your ass home now! And I mean now!”. I couldn’t just stop what I was doing because I promised my friend I would take her to work. I didn’t understand what I had done wrong or why I needed to come home right now. I was scared to go home because i felt like I was in a lot of trouble, but for what exactly? My friend told me to call her back and ask why I needed to come home and explain that I had already committed to taking her to work and state that I haven’t done anything wrong. This worked and I felt great after that. My mom even apologized to me because she knew she was wrong. Her excuse was that she just wanted to make sure that I do chores around the house today. But it kept getting worse. My parents ended up giving me a curfew of 9pm because I was hanging with friends at night. A week ago they took my car away because I was 3 minutes late for curfew. My parents have security cameras everywhere around the house that watch my every move. I feel like everything has been taken away from me and I have no control over my life anymore. I’m not allowed to go anywhere without their permission anymore. They threatened to take my bedroom door (which is a violation of my privacy). They have forbid me to see my boyfriend anymore and even recommend his parents send him to a mental institution against his will. My parents wants all three of us to go to group counseling but doesn’t want me to talk to a counselor without them being there. 
My mom’s behavior has raised red flags to me as well. My mom even admitted to me she was a control freak. I was coloring her hair and the entire time she just complained and told me how I wasn’t doing it right. I felt like nothing I did was going to be enough for her and she just kept apologizing but not correcting the behavior. Both my parents make me feel like I’m not enough for them. My mom has also started mocking me, patronizing me, cussing, and throwing things during arguments. She says I’m the reason she does those things. 
My dad doesn’t speak much. He doesn’t talk about emotion and doesn’t care to hear about mine. He blames me for having to get a part time job at Lowes along with his full time job as the deputy chief of Public Safety at the airport. I sense some resentment as well from him because I was fired from my EMS job because I couldn’t afford recertification and I couldn’t afford it because I went out on FMLA for 3 months for mental health and my insurance company refused to approve my Short Term Disability claim even though I had evidence that my condition met their disability requirements. I went without any income for about 4 months because of that.
I’m at the point where I’m done trying to mend my relationship with them because I resent them for taking everything away from me and treating me this way. I mean I’m sure that I’ve played my part in this drama. I yell, I cuss, I act erratic, I lie. I’m working on fixing those issues with me. My parents just see it as they’re right and I’m wrong, but when I prove that they’re wrong, they deflect and get angry.
Are my parents toxic? Am I to blame or are they to blame? What can I do? Any and all advice is accepted!

I started working remotely for my company around 7 months ago. They knew I would be in different time zones and still wanted to employ me because of my experience and product knowledge. The agreed hours were 10am to 6pm (mine 7am to 3pm). After 3 months they asked me to start an hour early such that I would be present in the daily morning meetings tgat start at 9am. These meetings are an hour of everyone taking turns is telling what they got on for the day. I have not missed/ been late to a single meeting.

Due to daylight savings the time difference has increased. What before was a 6am meeting will now be a 5am meeting my time which would require me to start my day at 4.30am.

I have suggested moving the timings of the meeting but my boss is inflexible because she wants people to come in before 9am.

We have another team meeting at 12pm (now 8am my time) where we go through urgent tasks and prioritisation.

I have told my boss that its not physically possible for me start that early but she keeps sending long emails saying that if I want to be part of the team its critical that I participate.

My work doesn't require me to be online at a particular time. The only reason I work their hours is so that I can support other junior staff in the company who need my help. Most of my days goes in helping others and pickinf up other people's slack. I always end up working 10 to 15 hours extra each week to catch up on my own work and I dont even get paid overtime.

How do I tell my boss (again) that I can't be available that early. It's just unreasonable. Even if I agree to it, i'll never get a thank you or be appreciated for it because she is never satisfied or happy with staff performance. We are just slaves in her eyes.

397,"Apologies Reddit this will be a long one but here we go!

So a few years ago I (26M) was in a relationship with my then partner (24F) who was undergoing some severe mental health issues. The first year or so of our relationship was fantastic, when we met we just clicked unlike anything I’ve ever experienced and it was like we had known each other for years. We could spend endless amounts of time in each other’s company and all of our friends remarked on how we both had something truly special. I knew about her issues when we got together but as a young naive man who’d never experienced anything like this I thought I would be able to help her totally and it not affect the relationship and for the first year or so, she was in a really good place and I just assumed that was as bad as it would get, again extremely naively. But after this time, her mental health totally spiralled, she would be extremely depressed, send me messages telling me that I didn’t care about her or the relationship and never did, hallucinate nightmarish events that never happened, be hospitalised several times and attempt suicide on multiple occasions. I tried my best to help her and it was made very clear to me by her that I was the only thing keeping her alive. I tried as much as I could but eventually the stress and staying up night after night trying to convince her to not attempt suicide again and that I did care caught up with me and I crashed HARD. I was physically exhausted all the time, had almost no emotion for a few months and felt like I was running on autopilot before I eventually had a total crying breakdown to her about how I couldn’t cope. My mental health has been up and down ever since even to this day, despite never having any issues before this. I felt dreadful as I knew what I was dealing with was less than 5% of what she was going through but I had hit my limit and broke it off, terrified that she would try and commit suicide again now that she had lost me from her support network. We tried to stay friends afterwards but as we had many mutual friends when she had a mental health issue she would come to us and she would still focus the issue on me and I ended up carrying almost as much emotional weight as before. Finally this all came to a head when she went missing for a day and we all suspected the worst. The police got involved, thinking that I might have been involved somehow before she was found having tried to kill herself again by one of my friends after which when she regained composure she started messaging me about how I never cared again. At this point I decided to cut her out of my life totally. My friends, unprompted by me, but seeing how she had treated them and me did the same and I haven’t seen or spoken to her in years. 

A lot of time has passed since then. We’ve both had counselling for our issues, gone our separate ways, live in separate cities and have had other relationships. Recently, her flatmate who I still talk to every 6 months or so as we became quite close through everything, said that my Ex has been talking about me a lot recently and that she had only good things to say about me still and that she would want to talk to me should the situation arise. He added that she had more of an understanding of her condition now but that she still struggled quite a lot. He also said that she had never found anything quite like what we had in that first year we were together and that she fully supports me in putting myself first when I did. Now, she has been on my mind almost daily since we broke up because of a combination of how traumatic a lot of it was but also because of what could have been and that I miss the connection that we had in that first year that I’m worried I might not find again. I was also 99.9% convinced that she hated me after everything so knowing she doesn’t is a huge relief. But given how the last conversation we had was a confused angry spiel from a hospital bed I’ve never had any closure from everything that happened and I think it’s still affecting me really badly. Would it be a terrible idea to take her up on her offer, meet and have a conversation and talk things over? Or would it be best to just leave things as they are and never speak to her again? I’m not sure I can cope with supporting her again, but I miss what we had and don’t want to leave it on that note for the rest of my life.

I’m not sure what I’d say to her and I don’t regret my choice to walk away when I did but I feel like I should face up to this and not run away from her and my past like I have been for the last few years, especially as I’ve only ever spoken in detail about what happened to one councillor for 6 weeks and nobody else. 

Tldr: Had a very traumatic end to a very special relationship that affected me really badly and we haven’t spoken since. She’s now reached out and offered to have a conversation. Should I do it or stay away?",19Oct2020,1
398,"Im embarrassed to even ask this but I want to know if it's just me over reacting or I'm actually for years being abused.

I'm a 16yr transgender male with that lives with my two older brothers and single mother.
I've notice more harsher reactions from my mother since I was 10 when my mum and dad split up and my mum was seeing another man durring her relationship with my dad. She would say things like ""your the reason why dad left"" and be super mean and  me cry to the point I was having trouble breathing and couldn't see well due to my eyes being red and puffy. One night she broke up with her boyfriend and I waited for her till 2am to come home and when she got home she started to Chuck bottles at me and say that I ruined her relationship because I didn't like her boyfriend and ever since then things have been getting worse each year.

 When I first got into high school (I was 12 at this time) I was depressed I started putting on alot of weight and my mother noticed and said I needed to go to the gym so I went with her but time past and I started to lose weight and feel good about myself again but my mum comments put me back into my depressed saying ""you look like a school bus with how much you weight"" and "" no one will ever love you if you don't lose weight"" but then she wouldn't take me back to the gym because I was ""ruining her time there"" so I stopped going and with mums comments I began to eat alot more to the point I was morbidly obese for my age and begin to self harm to deal with my family life and especially my mum and also durring this time I again to realise I'm transgender.

During year 8 to year 9 I was heavy into self harm and having thoughts of suicide because of my appearance and my mum. During thing time she began to show more aggression towards me such as locking me in my room and not letting me out for hours. Taking away my phone so I can contact my father. Screaming at me for hours about how I'm a no good child and that I should die. She would bang her head against the wall as a way of her making me accept her apology when I didn't after she made me cry for hours Saying that I'm lying about the stuff she says to me such as the fat comment she made.

Year 10 and now is where I'm thinking that this is a problem. She starts to say I'm useless and that I would just "" euthanize into myself to make it better for everyone"" and finds out I've been selfharming and saying I'm doing it for attention and a way to get back at her. During this time I came out to her as transgender and she doesn't accept me nor believe me because "" I don't like the way I am because I'm fat"". And when she angry at me she will use my dead name and call me a girl and say that I'll still be a women in her eyes. She has kicked me out of her house more then 3 times this year and Everytime I come back she attack me again. I can't leave home yet because of my financial problems and without a job I can't make money and she'll make comments like ""if you hate it her so bad then leave you can do it"" when she knows I can't.  Recently she has begin to physically hurt me. Yesterday she tried to kick me down the stairs because me and her got into an argument about cleaning my room and today when I got home she started to whip me with a tea cloth because I didn't clean my room because I was crying. She says that she doesn't do anything wrong and this is normal and I deserve it. but everytime I go over to my friends house I look at there relationships with there mother and see how well they get along and get jealous then me and my mum can't be like that.

I'm sorry to concern you guys with my problem but I'm wondering if it's counts as abuse and is even enough to get any help at all because I feel like it's just me being over dramatic but apart of me feels like I'm not crazy and I'll like some advice",19Oct2020,1
399,"Hi everyone!
I (F16), and I have just gotten out of a long termish relationship with this guy I was madly in love with. It has been around 4 months, and I felt like I was ready to move on, because he started to see other people. So I’ve been talking to this guy, who may be the sweetest person ever. But I can’t help but feel very guilty for some reason. Any sort of physical or emotional connection I would feel gets me really anxious and scared. I do feel like I like him, but hanging out or going on a date with him makes me really uncomfortable for some reason. Is this a mental thing and how do I overcome this?",19Oct2020,1
400,"So, around this time last year I got hired after 3 months of applying for jobs. As you can imagine, I was really happy and proud of myself. This was the second job in my career. I was hired as a copywriter for a really small firm (husband and pregnant wife), to work for a client of theirs. They stated they had a lot of clients, but I doubt that to this day. It wouldn’t be a short term job, so I wouldn’t just replace his wife for a few months. We would be working together, he would help me whenever, there were lots of extralegal benefits... it would be a long term job. Cool!

After a day of explaining by his wife, I was left in this brand new function I didn’t have any experience in (social media manager, email,...). After a week, I hadn’t done anything right in his eyes. Everything was off, I had lied during my interview, my LinkedIn recommendations were not true. And I was incapable of doing the work I was hired to do. I worked my absolute best and he was infuriated with me, Fast forward one month and there wasn’t anything left to do. He wasn’t around most of the time, 6-8 hours a week. He mostly ignored my messages of me asking for work, begging that he would give me things to do. I needed an explanation for some tasks his wife gave me, but never received anything. He wanted to boost my productivity and installed Hubstaff on my pc. That’s a tool that takes screenshots, mouse/keyboard activity and the programs/websites you use. After a month of Hubstaff, i got fired but immediately got hired by the client we worked for. According to my now ex-boss, he made up dozens of things to make sure I could start working there. 

Fast forward one year, to me writing this post. My ex-boss keeps persisting that I STILL use Hubstaff out of respect for him, of which my current boss doesn’t have any knowledge of according to me. There still are days that are less busy, but most of the time I’m working as a regular employee. He still controls me to this day, even when I’m working at the office. As mentioned before, he never shows up, not even pre-COVID. It’s really killing my motivation and it’s an intrusion of my privacy. 

What’s your advice in this situation?",19Oct2020,1

So I have liked this girl I have meet through my friend group for about a year now

She apparently really enjoyed hanging out with them and likes my company and the other day me, her and couple of our friends were hanging out she wanted to see me mostly and wanted me to walk her home 

^ even with this I have a lot of doubts that she likes me romantically and it’s more just a friend thing.

We are friends but not close and don’t talk very often cus We live in different areas. I want to start messaging her more because I’m not going to make any progress hanging out with her and friends once every few months but I can’t carry a conversation well.

One “convo” we had was like 4 messages and then it ended. The fear of me running out of things to say and it happening again. Also scared of forcing a conversation without even realising it.

The only things I can think of is just asking her if she wants to ask questions to get to know each other better but my friend who has known her for a few years thinks it’s not the best idea and other than that I don’t know what to do. I’m in a stage where I really want it to work out but have no idea what to do because I can’t carry a convo. I don’t want to get rejected as well because of the reason that it make things awkward with friends hanging out etc

404,"Ok so this is a loooong one!!

In 2006 my (f34) close friend, Hayden, murdered his father and step mother. At the time, 2006, we were 19/20 and I was pregnant, about 8 months along. We (my ex hubby and I) were living with his parents in a very rural town and Hayden was living not far from us with his father and step mother. This town is tiny and full of locals that have been there for generations so everyone knows everyone. Also we were in Central Queensland Australia. Ok, scene set...

So my ex...we will call him D...and I were trying to help Hayden get back on his feet. He had been having issues with substance abuse and mental health issues. Combined he was not in a great way. Hayden had just come back from living with his mother in NZ. He got back to Qld by stealing his mum’s credit card and booking himself a one way ticket “home”. He crashed with mates down Brissy for a bit before he decided to come up to his Dad and Step mums place. Our mate had called us to say watch out for Hayden he isn’t the same and is sketchy af! So Hayden comes back and we all start hanging out, no worries. 

So one weekend we hang with Hayden and some other friends at a bbq. Come Monday morning Hayden just walks on into our downstairs living area and smoked the last of D’s weed. So I go off at him! We argue and he says chill I’ll buy him more. Hayden proceeded to come and go throughout the day. Once coming over in his fathers work Ute then again on his fathers prized Harley Davidson motorcycle. I had a really bad feeling and knew something was off. Hayden kept trying to get me to go with him and me being huge and pregnant, was not keen. 

Tuesday evening D, Hayden and I head into town to get some weed for the boys. Hayden pulls out a huge wad of cash!! Reckons his parents are away for a conference and that cash is for while they are away to feed the animals and stuff (Hayden’s dad had a huge property right on top of a mountain, closest neighbours were about 30-50km away) 

Wednesday D had got Hayden a job interview with the company he was working for...Hayden never showed up. 

On our way home from town that day we noticed an undercover detective car in our small town. Not a regular thing at all! We both kinda had a bad feeling. Get home to find a detective card on our door. We both said “what’s Hayden done”!?!?” Without knowing a shred of anything. 

Next thing we know we are being questioned by the detectives. Having the house searched. Spent about 48 hours all up in the station being questioned. We were suspected of helping him with the murders because of all the contact we had with him. 

For clarification he killed his dad and step mom on the Sunday evening. So that Monday that he came over and we argued??? He had just finished burying his parents. 

I had Child Protection Services called on me to let me know if I didn’t tell them where the bodies are and I’ll never see or hold my unborn child. They grilled the shit out of us!! 

In the end, the police told Hayden what me and D were going through. Hayden drew a mud map and said maybe try looking there....first and only thing he said during interrogation. 

So once they found where the bodies were buried, in a 6 foot hole dug in an old mine shaft on the property. Probably about 100 meters from the house. We were in the clear. But we did have to testify against him in court. 

He got 2 consecutive life sentences. In Australia that’s 25 years one after the other so we will all be about 60-70 when he gets out. 

He tried to contact me a couple of times but my husband wouldn’t allow it. He also sent us a letter but my mother in law burnt it before we even knew about it!

I don’t have any expectations in regards to contacting him and I’m definitely not looking to rekindle any sort of friendship but I feel if I don’t try and just ask...wtf??? I’ll regret it forever but then I feel like I should just let it all go and try to forget. I just don’t know....

So people of reddit...do I try to contact and ask wtf? Or just keep trying to move past it???

405,"Hey y'all, I have a delicate situation I need help with. 

My good friend of 13 years is really annoying me. He is like one of my brothers but recently (last three years) is a borderline alcoholic and a major pothead. He had a rough upbringing essentially having to live on his own since he was a teenager.

We used to go out a lot when we were younger (I'm 26 now, he's 29) and it was a good time. There's a brewery in town and this is where the problem began. 

He became a local at the brewery because he's there at least 3 days a week. He became friendly with the staff who hook him up with free beers and let him smoke weed in the parking lot. My friend also became friends with the other locals at this brewery and let's just say they aren't the best crowd to be with either. This is the only place he wants to go to when we do hang.

My friend hits me up every weekend to go out and hang out at this brewery. He doesn't drive so I usually have to pick him up, drive him there and drop him off when the nights done. About two years ago, I got into a car accident after dropping him off and from then on, I needed to make a change in my life.

I no longer wanted to go out and drink every weekend. I have a decent job, good healthy and I don't want risk getting a dui or something. I told my friend this and he just didn't understand. He began to guilt trip me by saying that ”I don't want to hang with him and that he feels like some type of way about it”.

I went several months sober and felt amazing. I felt bad for not hanging with my friend and eventually hung out with him. But it turned into a once in a while thing which is fine with me. 

Recently with pandemic restrictions being lifted, he’s been hitting me up every weekend asking me to go drink. Usually I've been saying no but agree probably once every few weeks. 

When we do go, he's with his shady friends and usually leaves me along at the table so he can go smoke with them. I don't smoke weed. I don't have a good tolerance for beer anymore and they all are basically champion beer drinkers because they’re there everyday. This is not a group I want to be associated with.

Since I still have to pick him and drop him off, I'm afraid of getting into a DUI or car accident. I know I can Uber but my friend is cheap and doesn't like getting ubers.

Note, I'm also bit of introvert and have social anxiety every now and then. It's been really difficult making friends with other people. My alcoholic friend is my only childhood friend that is left around as the others moved. I would love to hang out with people that share my interests and passions (I guess this is why I like Reddit so much). The only thing my friend wants to do is drink and smoke weed. We don't have many things in common anymore besides we both watch UFC.

Long story short, how do I get my friend to understand that hanging out with him isn't bringing out the best version of myself and that I honestly don't want to be associated with him and his shady friends?

TD;LR - I have a friend who's a bad influence, I don't want to be associated with him, how do I communicate this to him?",19Oct2020,1
406,"because i’m having this conflict with this person that i’ve been friends with for a year. she has always been selfish in her own needs for intimacy (we’re only friends) while i on the other hand prefer to have space. however, when we talked about it she was too stubborn to see herself in it because «she’s just like that and won’t change it».

bruh

me liking space and being unable to say «i love you» due to the past is me being me. why are my emotions not focosed on? i’ve struggled with having friends that i help and focus more than myself on while others doesn’t even give a crap about me unless i’m not with them - in my whole life. i’ve been stepped on my people for too long. i’m so tired. it’s like everything bottled up, and that friend is going through everything.

i feel like i wanna apologize, but there’s problems between that friend and the rest of the squad as well. i know for a fact that we shouldn’t forgive her.

especially as she regulary slutshames me for something i didn’t want to do. she manipulated me to tell her things, and i said countlessly times told her that i couldn’t speak more. she must be oblivious if she thinks it’s okay to mock me for it.

she also said that i changed. i didn’t. actually i wasn’t my true self last year - not that it’s this huge difference. i’m a pretty laid-back person and i have no enegy until 9 pm or later. my friend, however, she has energy kicks 24/7, but she’s extremely sleepy at 10 pm and could probably sleep for 14 hours. if you think about that: i tried to match her energy sometimes because she countlessly called me boring and stuff like that. why? i was the new one in the squad - so i wanted to fit in. i’m actually really sorry for not being true, but i did confront her about it, but she didn’t even listen to it because of her stubborness.

i think that’s a bad trait, and i want to end our friendship. i hate conflicts &amp; i give up when i know i’m right. we’re literally opposites! and that doesn’t really work - especially as she’s not the smartest one (she’s stubborn about things she’s just heard or just thought - pathetic. also, she can’t accept being wrong. at least she avoid the topic becuase it’s embarressing).


i hate ignoring her, but i get nauseas about the thought to confront her. i know she’s not going to listen, and now a mutal friend of us seems to dislike me because of it. he’s the nicest person i know, and i hate disappointing him.

she has always critized things she doesn’t like or doesn’t know, and she doesn’t talk about things that doesn’t interest her. actually, she sent me a tiktok of «i like every type of music» - «except for kpop» and then she wrote «i will never like kpop». i don’t even speak about kpop, and she still sends it to me? it was in a serious way, but she probably doesn’t remember me telling her that i like kpop, but is not like obsessed.

our mutal friend likes Conan Grey, so the first thing i did was to check him out. he’s amazing. my friend did not, and she probably found his music through (straight) tiktok. she probably only know maniac. i also watched friends because of her since she loves the series. i do these things and she doesn’t even try to do an effort to get to know me.

maybe i’m the bad person?",19Oct2020,1
407,"Hello reddit

So first: using a throwaway account because I, of course, do not want my flatmate to see this post.

So here's my problem: I currently live with two friends in England. Let's call the girl Abby and the guy Simon. So Abby goes out \*a lot\*. A few days ago, **she started coughing**. She also has a running nose, so she says it's just the flu. Simon and I told her to be cautious, but she keeps going out, saying she is seeing people outdoors either way, that she is not hanging out with any vulnerable (&gt;65 years old) people, and that she also thinks that everybody will end up having the virus regardless, so there is no point in self-isolating. Simon and I tried to argue, but we realized she would not change her mind and that in the end, as he was not coughing a lot and had a running nose,  maybe it was just the flu indeed.

Abby and I play football together, and on Wednesday, we had a football social in a bar. I would like to specify that Abby went there although she was coughing a little bit, and it was an **indoor social**. On Friday, we went out to an outdoor bar, where there were many many people. A girl from our team, let's call her Olivia, was there.

Well turns out **Olivia was tested positive for the Covid-19 on Saturday**. Which means she probably was sick on Wednesday, during the football social, and was certainly sick on Friday night. I personally started coughing and having a sore throat on Saturday, and I have a runny nose as well. So when we learned the news, Simon and I said it was best for us to cancel our plans, stay home, and self-isolate as much as possible. Well, **Abby does not agree**. She still goes out to see friends, is going to university, is planning on having lunch with some friends... And she will not listen to Simon and me. In fact, she even went to a food market yesterday, where **most people are elderlies**.

Simon and I both booked a test for Tuesday. I decided not to go to my classes today, and am isolating in my flat. Abby, on the other hand, does not want to be tested at university, because she is afraid that ""if the test comes out positive, the university will force her to self-isolate and she would not be able to go on campus anymore"".  What I got from this is that if she knows she has the virus, she will still go out anyway. **She would lie about having it if she had to so that she could still go out.**

I'm not sure what to do at this point. On one hand, it may just be a flu, and I honestly don't think any of us have the virus, as I already had it and know how it feels to have it. On the other hand, it's such a small effort to make to stop going out and protect others. **What can I say to her to make her realise her behaviour is putting others at risk?**",19Oct2020,1
408,"Hey everyone, throwaway here. Mainly because I don't like discussing my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I live in a small town, and sadly my job isn't in said town. I'd have to drive 30 minutes, and I don't even have a driver's license. Usually my parent always drove me but after a work week they're starting to get really crazy. It'd take me a while to fully explain what happened, but basically I denied to do something that my brother should've, since I was so tired after doing work I just wanted to sleep, and that started issues. The yelling match got to me a little, I won't lie, and I said some things I didn't want to say. Needless to say, I don't really think it's salvageable, and that hurts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to pay taxes, I don't know how I'm going to get a ride, I don't know how I'm going to take care of the animals here. Groceries, I might be able to take care of. I could just slip on a backpack and ride into town on a bike (which, I'd have to learn, but at least it's a bandaid until I could *somehow* learn to drive and get a permit). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I'm practically going into circles at this point, but I've little options. My parent ostracized us from the rest of our extended family that I'm scared to reach out to them, and there's no friends local in the area that I really communicate with anymore. As a ditch effort I could reach out to either of them, but I'm not all too hopeful on that front. I want to try setting something up that I myself can independently take care of. Honestly, it's a fucked situation, I live in a damn small town and I don't even know how to drive; what little resources I have are stripped away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to my job, maybe I could find someone to carpool with or something. I highly doubt it, considering my job highly discourages it thanks to COVID and, even if that wasn't an obstacle, I don't think there would be anyone from around my area. I'm thinking about just quitting, or perhaps saying I've gotten COVID in order to buy myself like two weeks to figure shit out. Or see if this is something that blows over. It isn't the first time that my parent has done something like this, but I rather not bank on that fact. Even if that did happen, I'd want to get myself independent and move out ASAP from them so that I have my own liberty/freedom that they can't control.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a complicated issue, but the bottom line basically is - how do I become an adult when I don't have that many resources to go to? Paying taxes, driving, all that stuff. And honestly, even if it doesn't fit, any advice is wanted.

I'm a very impressionable person I believe (is that the word?). During the relationship, I caught a lot of her habits, sayings, ways of thinking, her likes and dislikes, etc., but this was my first serious relationship so maybe that's how relationships work? I basically became her to an extent.

Lately, I have been watching a ton of videos about how to get over a toxic relationship. 

In my case, both of us were toxic, but it has me wondering if I started becoming manipulative and unknowingly using the tactics that she used like self-deprecation, self-harm, my depression/anxiety, etc. to keep her around like she essentially did with me? I was always emotionally drained during the relationship-I just loved her so much that I put all of it aside and paused my life for her.

So I came home from work (5-11PM) and my dog was giving birth after I had started my shift so I wasn’t there to see for myself. 

My sister and I both came home late, and my mom took the thought that we were gonna take over watching over our dog.. even though she had a day off and wasn’t on her feet almost all day. 

So she gave birth to 4, but there was a little bubble coming out of her genitals, but my mom said that “google” said that it takes 4 hours in between. So I was extremely exhausted and I had a headache all day, doing runs for my mom before work because she wanted to watch my dog. 

I laid down and took basically a 10 minute nap after I checked up on her. My sister comes running to me asking me to check on one of the pups. I go in, and the last bubble had burst and the baby was born, but it wasn’t moving or breathing. I put on gloves and touched it gently, and I could feel how cold it was. This was a bad sign so I tried warming it up just a little. 

When no success I woke up my mom who then proceeds to scold me saying how we shouldn’t have took her place (as if we offered it..) and how we should’ve never interfered. 

I know she’s blaming me but isn’t trying to directly tell me. I know in most parts this is probably my fault, but I also just feel like this could’ve been avoided if my mom listened to me when I was trying to tel her to put them on a heating pad for a little or bring my dog in to the vet.

I always had a large group of friends, and I used to go out minimum twice a week, game with friends almost daily, play basketball at least 2 times a week, all while doing pretty decent at school and university. However, in high-school, I realised that I have no one that I can consider a close friend. No one I can really depend on or open up to or trust. It was all fun and games, but when it comes to serious things, I had no one to turn to. 

Fast forward to about 4 years ago, I met this girl and we hit it off instantly. We go out weekly, Skype almost daily, etc. She opened up to me and I did the same. Within a few months it felt like I've known her forever, and we started dating pretty quickly. It was amazing. Not just fun and games. It was serious. A couple years in we start talking about our future, and we both wanted the same things. I obviously didn't push my friends away. I grew distant from a few cuz they went abroad for university but mostly my friendships stayed the same with almost the same hangouts, and my girlfriend had very similar interests so that was a plus. 

Just before I graduated university at the end of 2019, things started getting shaky in my relationship. We have had arguments before, but things were getting worse and worse. The moment I realised things might end is when we spent our 3rd anniversary not talking to each other cuz of an argument. I sat with her and started talking seriously about us and what we need and what we should do, and we made it clear to each other what the other needs and that both of us still love each other and are willing to work on things. 
Anyway, fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we broke up. 

Since then I've been feeling alone and miserable. Yeah thats normal after a breakup, but its worse. Its been a week since I last talked to anyone that isn't living in the same house as me. 
The pandemic is really helping with things, as it caused a lockdown so going out isn't the best option, I have been unemployed and broke this entire year, and countless companies either ignore my applications or straight up reject me. I managed to get one internship but they had to terminate the internship program half way through cuz of the pandemic (about 11 interns were let go). My parents are going through a rough time with work with pay cuts AND late salaries (my dad hasn't been payed for 2 months cuz its delayed). I've cut down outings cuz while our situation is much better than others since we have a decent amount in the savings account, i still am cutting down as much spending as possible until things get better. 

I cant afford to do online lessons cuz almost all the lessons relevant to my major (Chemical Engineering) are paid. 

Im trying to keep myself as busy as possible. So I just spend my time on LinkedIn, sending emails to companies, and YouTube trying to expand my knowledge beyond just chemical engineering. I go to the gym daily, I try to play drums as much as I can but its mostly a couple hours a week cuz my brother has online classes and my mom works from home so its online meetings all day and I cant be loud. Since the locksown started I've gained around 10kgs, which im working on losing in the gym, but its a slow process. 

Basically what im trying to say is, i don't know what im doing with my life. The one person I can talk to has me blocked on every platform. I struggle to get out of bed cuz I dont see the point. I'm stuck in my room all day except when im at the gym which is a 5 minute walk from here. I find myself just staring at walls and tearing up randomly but I guess thats from the break up.",19Oct2020,1

421,"So like the title suggests I'm dealing with not having my precious baby girl (who is a dog) with me. I do have plans on bringing her over but I need to have some semblance of stability to do so and at the moment that doesn't seem possible for at least 6 months to year more at least. I miss her so much I have to constantly distract myself or I'll spend the day crying.  She's in good hands of course and perfectly content and happy but I've been a dog mom for 10 years, and even before that I've always had pets of some sort. So right now I feel like I'm going batshit crazy without a pet. I keep looking online for pets I can adopt until I get my baby here and they can be friends but I logically don't really want that because it's selfish and I don't want to play with a life. So I've been looking into fostering or pet sitting but I just found out that because of my visa standing I literally cannot legally do any of those things. My heart is broken in a million pieces and Idk what to do. How do I cope with this crippling loneliness? Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of people I care for with me, I'm not actually on my own or want any human company but I love animals and I feel like something really important to me in missing and I'm lost. Idk what to do. On top of that I might move to a different country in a foreseeable future (could be this year or the next) which is more reason I can't just impulsively get a pet. Can anyone give me any advice? At least in any ways I may be able to cope? I can't even think straight when it comes to this anymore.",19Oct2020,1
422,"So my ex isn't a bad person but he basically met someone and then left me. It made me feel really worthless and hurt. Now sometimes my best friend hangs out with them both and I kind of feel unhappy. But also like maybe she's happy and how does it even matter right? And in these difficult times, maybe we need all the friends we can get. I don't know, I just feel like everyone prefers her so much and she really does seem better in every way so I shouldn't blame my friend but it also makes me upset.",19Oct2020,1
423,"Hi, so I started talking to this girl in the beginning of September but we never officially gotten together only talked. I really liked/like her, honestly I saw something in her but there were also some things I disliked about her. 

Some of those things being her calling her best friend a re-tard and a f-ggot which made me extremely uncomfortable. She also would get on online chatsites just to bully kids (her being 19). It just didn’t feel right and I would bring that up to her and she would say sometimes brush it off. 

I asked her if she could stop saying those certain words and perhaps try to not bully people, in which she agreed but she also told me that she didn’t really like how I was pushing her to change. Which I agree, I shouldn’t push her to change but I also feel like she should take into consideration my discomfort. I really wanted be with her but I am scared that she would drag this online negatvity to real life. 

Since we are both 19 I feel like there should be no reason for her to act this way. It’s very childish and confusing. 

Yesterday me, her, and her bff were on the chatsite and I watched as she bullied these random kids. I went offline for a bit but once I got back on I saw her call her friend a re-tard. She thought I wasn’t there so she went ahead and said it. And gosh that upsetted me. We then texted and I mentioned I was kinda dissapointed that she didn’t try, she ended up saying that she only said that she wont say those words infront me.

So I came into conclusion that maybe this isn’t right, I shouldn’t have to ask a person to change. If she truly did want to become a kinder person she would change for herself, not me. I do understand that change takes awhile, but I really didn’t see any effort coming from her. I therefore ended whatever we had, although I feel so down. I really liked her, but did I make the wrong choice? Was I overreacting? She didn’t really care when I explained why I was upset, and why it might not work out.",19Oct2020,1
424,"I met a guy on Bumble in Nyc, during Christmas 2019. Turned out he was visiting from California, so I wrote it off. However, We hit it off and spent a majority of the next 4 days together. He slept at my apartment, woke up early to go to Central Park with me and my dog, we went out for a romantic dinner at Chumley’s, we laughed, we really had a lovely time. He left, and I was sad but knew it was impossible, he doesn’t live here. 

However he started to text daily. We spoke daily for over a month before I decided I wanted to visit him.
In late February I went to see him, and we had a great 5 days. He was different than anyone I had been with and so was our relationship. We did have a gentleman’s agreement in place, we understood we lived in different places and could date different people. We were not to discuss this, unless asked outright about it, but over all when we were together, we were together. Corona hit hard soon after my trip. We texted daily, had a handful of phone calls (he hates talking on the phone and he won’t FaceTime). So obviously communicating was difficult at times. 
He got a week in late August off from work and we planned his trip back to NY. When he came, it was perfect. We both were so happy, he understood how hard it was for me to show him all these places around my city during corona (and my anxieties about it). My best friend met him when I surprised him with a boat ride, and even in the two hours they hung out, she could tell how much he liked me and how different this was compared to any relationship I had been in for the past 16 years. Before he left we made plans for me to visit him for thanksgiving. 

Those three months felt like an eternity away, but it would be worth it. He was going to pick me up in another city, and we would drive down the coast together, have a mini road trip/ adventure before spending the holiday week together. So while unemployed, I booked a ticket after I confirmed with him. I joked he had 24 hours to change his mind (based on the airlines rules), and he said why would I? And said he would pay for part of the ticket. However I was actually apprehensive, he was oddly moody with me, he felt like I was pulling away, he never sent me money for the ticket, I stopped caring about texting things out, and I decided, I was still going to see him. We’d have a last goodbye... a bittersweet ending, because while I cared about him soo much, long term we couldn’t make this work without one of us relocating (which is not happening)... and yet this trip was still the one thing I had to forward to daily. 

WELL FF to October 17th. We’re doing our usually morning texts and when I ask about his day he writes oh just watching some college sports, and having a date. Well I was floored, in our 10 month’s especially because of the gentleman’s agreement, we never spoke about dates. My best friend was on her way to my house, and was shocked when I told her. She told me he was probably being an oaf (he is literally the definition, but in such a sweet almost naive way). I told her what I thought, he’s been pulling away and I couldn’t figure out why, but this is why, he’s getting serious with someone else. 
Unfortunately I was right, when we spoke the next day, I literally had to drag it out of him. He told me he wasn’t sure if it would get to them being exclusive by my arrival in 5 weeks, and couldn’t understand why I couldn’t come, since only sex was off the table... and the kicker, it’s not like he planned to have a connection with someone else, he doesn’t just want to lose me, and isnt sure about what he wants. I explained what my plan was to humanely end things, how I was blindsided and heartbroken, how I of course had met other people and still put things aside before his trip (this was true I pushed a guy away because I had to make a choice over which relationship was important to me, and in reality he was), that I know and he knows (he agreed) if I was in the same city we would be dating exclusively, and we need an end, he could still have a beginning with this new person, but he and I needed that closure to remain friends in each others life ... as we both don’t want to just lose the other person. 
We got off the phone with the plan he needed to let me know why he actually wanted, I told him I was giving him this power. I would still do whatever I wanted/ needed to do for me; but I wanted him to be clear with his emotions (something he is admittedly awful at). I also needed to know we could still be “us” even if “us” had changed... and after like two minutes of us texting, not about what just happened... he stopped texting completely. I know he’ll text today, he didn’t really ghost, but based on that, I’m now doubting how we can ever really be friends if he wasn’t there when I needed to hear from him most. 

So do I just cancel my ticket, for my own self worth and cut my losses, or do I go?",19Oct2020,1
425,"My(28F) sister(40F) just moved to our city from the big New York. She lived there for 15 years alone. She did things there, alone and she was happy with that life. She had to move here because she had to leave her job. She is a front liner. Apparently, some of her co workers decided to take off because they were ""afraid of covid"". Her manager was so used to using her to cover for these people, as they do this a lot, all the time and my sister got tired of it. So, for the first time, she said no. Her manager did not like it very much, so she got written up for the first time in 15 years. My sister did not like that kind of pressure, so she decided to quit and move to our city. She now lives with my other sister(49) and her 12 yo daughter. 

The thing about it is, my other sister and her daughter hasn't been a very good host. My newly moved sister had talked to me about this. I offered her to stay with me but she said she did not want me to have conflict with my other sister, plus, she knows that I also have problems with my living situation. She wasn't used to this, having other people in the house, the mother and daughter quarrelling everyday, the purchasing of a car to get to places, deciding what car insurance to get, and getting a new job, everything about it makes her worry about all the decisions she made. Her finances are okay, but she is worried about all her purchases and if she made the right purchases. She was starting to regret moving here. She's contemplating in moving back. I don't want her to move back because I know things are going to be okay once she gets settled, have a job and have a place of her own. All her anxiety and panic because of her current living situation with my other sister. I told her those things are temporary, that change is temporary but she is worried.

They are emotionally abusive (so is my dad that i dont live with). The frat isnt too expensive. It cost $125 each semester. I like talking to the people in it.

436,"have been thinking about this for a while, and wondering where to post it, finally decided to post it here, as it's  a question for advice as well.

I feel like the World is becoming sicker and sicker regarding sexual intercourse, and I blame the sheer over-sexualization in media.

Everywhere you look there's metaphors or direct reference to sex: ads, TV shows and movies, games, music (with what I feel like 99,9 percent of songs about sexual topics in metaphors or especially in modern rap direct references)

In the last few years, I haven't met a single person (and I admit there at least must be few, I just haven't met them) who have all their knowledge about sex form pornography.
Like women wanting to be basically abused, hit, choked, treated like the objects that they claim not to be when partaking in feminist demonstrations.

Men who have no idea about actually dating and could as well swing theor dicks out at sight, and technically only want what they see on pornhub and somilar sites.

The point for me is that people became numb towards sex, it has no actual value anymore, there are like a hundred apps out there for people to meet up for sex without even knowing the partner, before or after the act.

I think and my question is basically if I am the only one, that sex lost all its value and specialness, and humans kind of evolve backwards to the point where they just wanna mate like animals, not even trying to keep and maintain social relationships.

This world makes me sick, and personally I am at the point whefe I don't even wanna meet any potwntial partners anymore, because these days it seems like sex is everything that counts.

Don't get me wrong by the way, I am still aware that Sex IS important, but it's by far not as important as those people and the media makes us believe in my opinion. 

Am I the only one? How can I meet people who actually want to maintain relationships, not only mindless fucking? And am I part of a generation going extinct with my views on that topic?",19Oct2020,1

My roommate and I are really close and I don't want any resentment to build between us if one of us feels like the other one isn't paying a fair amount.

438,"We do not live in America. We live in a place where therapy is like $300 a session and no insurance plan covers it. My friend cannot afford therapy. She has depression and she is overweight and she does not have a job. I am a full time student in college and I exercise and go to the gym 4 times a week. She asked me to help her lose weight and I said no problem and I helped put together a workout plan for her and I told her absolutely no junk food. Then she went and had McDonalds like a week into it and I gave her shit for it.  


Now a week later her boyfriend is telling me that she is purging after every meal, even healthy ones and barely eats anything and doesn't do her workouts. I confronted her about this and she said she just isn't interested in food. I don't have any experience with eating disorders so I told her boyfriend to keep track of what she eats and I will keep track of her exercise. I also went out and bought some stickers and a journal for her to write what exercise she does every day, what she eats every day, 5 reasons why she is still here every day and a ""Dear Future Self"" space for her to write to every day. I'm hoping that these will give her a reason to stay on track and give her something to read when she is having a depressive episode.  


I'm hesitant to tell her family because there is a large possibility that they are adding to her body image problems.

443,"My daughter has always known who her dad was but ultimately he decided against ever meeting her. He said that when she got older he would be apart of her life IF she decided she wanted to meet him. 

Well, for the first time in 8 years she has asked to see him. I already made a promise to her that in the event of her wanting to meet him I would contact him immediately for her sake. She has absolutely every right to meet him and I would never deny her this. 

Now, I stood true to my promise. I contacted him. I was on the phone with him for 45 minutes and arranged a meeting for next weekend. A public place. My girl got to talk to her dad and hear his voice for the first time. However, after my daughter gave me the phone back she made a comment.. ""Why did he sound normal but now he sounds weird?"" I didnt think anything of it at first. 

However... after I got back onto the phone even I noticed the drastic change. He did sound normal at first but when I heard his voice after he spoke with my child, his words were slurred and he sounded extremely raspy. He then goes on and on about how he is a good guy and then, repeatedly (like 30 fucking times) said, ""We are really meeting right? I need this."" Just kept repeating ""I need this"", over and over and over again. 

I hung up the phone a short while later and reached out to a girlfriend to vent about it. She had no idea that I had arranged a call with my ex or that this plan was even happening because I did not discuss it beforehand with anyone. That and we had not spoke of this man in years. My daughter asking for him was random. Well, my friend went on to tell me that my ex is an alcoholic, hes always at the bar and taking home various women and apparently dabbles with drugs socially. All of which I did not know prior. 

I made some excuse to call him back and we got to talking about WHERE we would meet. Now, at some point or another he asked me what I was doing and I fibbed. I said I was drinking a beer, trying to get him to open up about the possible alcohol issue my friend had mentioned. Well, he did. He immediately was like ""Oh, you drink? Awesome! I thought you would have a problem with me meeting my kid because I drink every night but now that I know you drink too I dont feel so bad."" So I asked him how much he drank a night and he said about a 12 to 18 rack OR a pint of whiskey. 

Now I'm reconsidering this meeting. Obviously I assume he will be sober for the meeting BUT at this point I would never leave my child with him overnight or for weekend visits because if he drinks that much a night than he will not be able to take care of a child. People also do extremely stupid shit while wasted and alcoholics have a tendency to get mean. I do NOT trust him.

Mina's mom and dad are very strict borderline abusive parents. She didn't think they would support her in this situation.

He backed off that day while saying nonsense like mein kisi se nhi darta and all. In the end he said sorry and said he'll never call her again.

Vinod and other people got the number from his friend. This friend was the brother of the guy in Mina's class. 


As a gamer I have never been a part of something like this. I was the quiet guy in school. 



Today My sister told me about the whole situation. And I think this is very broken strategy. While Mina has to go through all this harrassment. And he doesn't face any repercussions for his actions. 


So, guys I have their numbers and I want them to go through the same experience that my students went through? what should be the best course of actions for this situation.",19Oct2020,1
445,"I used to go to school with this guy. I remember he used to have tons of pets and they would always run away/get run over/etc. One time I distinctly remember him telling me that a bed fell on his two new kittens. I was too young to understand what any of this meant. I'm now finding out that he used to open them up because he""enjoyed watching the squirm"". He's now also started sexually assaulting one of my female friends. He used to be employed by a procate security firm and got his gun licence through them as well.

I know that his parents know but I don't think his sibling does. Yesterday (18/10/2020) his sibling posted a story on Instagram asking if anyone has seen their cat that has gone missing.

Is there anywhere or anyone I can report my concerns to?

447,"Hello,

Me and my girlfriend recently got a puppy, but a few days ago we delivered it back to the owner of it. It started with my girlfriend wanting a puppy, so we found a seller online and went to get it. After having it for a few days, my girlfriend started regretting the decision because it was so much responsibility, but even her parents wanted to help out by taking care of it until we're both finished with our university degrees (In 1 1/2 years). My girlfriends dad got really upset with her and haven't spoken to her properly since it got delivered back because he also started caring for it. My girlfriend is pretty depressed about the whole thing, and now we want the puppy back, we're both ready to take care of it, and we won't even have to take care of it full time since we're studying, her parents will also help out and look after it almost the whole week until we're done with our education. The question here is, is it responsible for us to contact the seller of the puppy and ask for it back? My girlfriend feels like she is dumb and immature for changing her mind so quickly, so what do you think?",19Oct2020,1

The reason I bring this topic up is that when applying for a recent professional job, I was quite shocked to find I was the only white person in the section. My peers were all minorities in this company. This didn't really bother me until I realised that I wouldn't get the close networking relationships I have with people of my own race which were mostly banter and in jokes that fall flat when you have different life experiences. I felt like an outsider and so close to the place I've called home my entire life. I'm quite anxious after this, I wouldn't feel so bad if there was even just one person like me there so I could i feel a little more safe. I wasn't worried about race until this happened and now I worry that I will never be able to have family I want because I'm threatened.

459,"So my boyfriend and I (both late 20s) live in a shared house with 5 other people (all in their 20s). One of our housemates, J, got a COVID test last week which came back positive. This isn't the issue, the problem is with how they have acted since receiving the diagnosis.

* They told us a day after they found out that they were positive, this lead to my boyfriend unknowingly going to his busy workplace where he could have potentially infected many people or shut the whole place down.
* J would continue to walk around the house with a fashion face mask on (one of those really thin ones) but always under their nose.
* We asked them to post in the group chat whenever they would use common areas so we could avoid coming into contact during the isolation period, they seem to pick and choose when this applies and we have come face to face with them when we thought they would be in their room.
* They have called us paranoid and says they have told the police and contacted a lawyer about our ""harassment"".
* I was cooking the other day and they didn't understand why I left the kitchen when they walked in and said I was bullying.
* They haven't been cleaning shared appliances such as the kettle and microwave or wearing gloves.

The thing is I like J and would have offered to do their shopping, prepare food, get them drinks etc but all of this has made me very uncomfortable.

My boyfriend went for a test straight after work, he was so angry that he could have infected people because J hadn't said anything. Luckily his test came back negative but he wouldn't have gone into work at all if he had known which he felt very guilty about while waiting for the results over the weekend.

We have spoken to them numerous times, often devolving into arguments as they just cannot see our point of view. I have tried to explain that they are being inconsiderate of our health and anyone else they have come into contact with but they just think we are being antagonistic and bullying them.

I always liked J as a person, it is not their fault that they have COVID and luckily don't have any symptoms (since they went for the test) but I am feeling frustrated by their lack of thought regarding the rest of us in the house. The other housemates either always stay in their room anyway or are scared of confrontation but say they agree with us.

We have messaged them regarding what would make us feel safe and the official restrictions, spoke to them through doors and even face to face (with masks and at a distance) and they won't listen and continue to play the victim. I hope this hasn't just come off as a rant but I'm at my wits end and would appreciate any advice on how we could possibly proceed.

463,"I'm gonna call these girls A and B. I met both of them (separately)just over a year ago and was attracted to both, but both were just casual friends and I wasn't interested in dating anyone. I ended up texting A more and more frequently, we had loads in common and the same sense of humour. We became close friends and feelings got involved, I asked if she wanted to date and she said yes, we're still together nearly a year later and everything's been going great. I feel so at ease when I'm with her (which is not like me, I'm usually a bag of nerves) and we have a lot of fun. I feel supported and content and it's the first time it feels like I can really be myself in a relationship. 

The only problem is B. I don't have much contact with B or see her very often, she's not a close friend exactly but she's involved in my social group enough for me to not really be able to avoid seeing her once in a while. I still find her attractive, and never stopped, I just didn't really think about it much because I didn't see her often. 

In the last few weeks I've noticed myself thinking about B a fair amount, I'm not sure why really because nothing has changed. I haven't spoken to her more often, or had any problems with A. I started noticing feeling a bit of a rush when she liked my social media posts, then noticed myself picturing her in my head when I was listening to this love song (I usually think about A when I do that but now it's sometimes B), then I even had a dream we were dating a few days ago. The whole time I haven't enjoyed being with A any less, it feels like part of me wants both. Thinking back, I don't think my brain has ever been monogamous, even though I've never cheated or been in a poly situation. I don't think I'd even want to really.

I sometimes have temporary fixations on certain people and want to impress them and get their validation, this has happened with friendships as well as crushes, so I'm wondering if this is just that again. I've had one experience before where I was physically attracted to a friend as well as emotionally fixated and I'm still not sure if it was a crush or a combination of these two things. What eventually happened is I became better friends with this person and the physical attraction declined as we hung out more often.

Basically, I'm prone to these fixations and I'm struggling to tell if they're crushes or something else. I don't want to sabotage good relationships because of them. Any advice?",19Oct2020,1

470," I live in a religious family and I myself am religious muslim family but cant practice my religion well yet and my mom always hated me for that. I got involved with a boy in university and fell in love with him and my mom figured it out, by reading my texts and I was gonna die from fear when I found out she is checking my phone, my blood pressure exploded and my heart was beating in my throat and ear, but she decided that it is fine even tho I am young and shouldn’t be focused on relationships and should focus on studying. She stayed closely monitoring everything I do with this boy which I hated and kept putting so many rules on how I should act, my boyfriend was understanding but many times he asked me to try break the rules a bit like call him when mom’s out or such. And I complied cuz I was so frustrated with all the rules mom Is putting on me making me unable to talk or meet or actually be with that boy at all

Instead of appreciating that my mom accepted that I am in a relationship I stupidly started getting more and more involved with this boy, till we started texting inappropriate messages and meeting alone in a car. This only happened a very little amount of times and starting from the second time I resented myself and resented what I am doing and felt ashamed, but I was worried that if I keep telling my boyfriend no over and over like how I keep telling him no when my mom refuses to let us meet and talk and text he will get bored with me and leave, and he has helped me through so much I cant afford to lose him as he is my only true support. One day however we got caught in the car and I felt so shitty that I decided enough, no more meeting alone and no more of the sexts, and I talked with him so seriously about it and gave a clear no and he said he agrees and that he is ashamed too as this is all sinful behavior in our religion.

And as I was proud of myself going home as I finally ended this dilemma i go back to my mom having read all of my texts crying and screaming at me, I felt beyond ashamed and embarrassed. My mom basically disowned me emotionally and I am to stay at home and 1) never to text anyone 2) never to talk to any boys again, specially my boyfriend not even tell any friend why I disappeared 3) not attend my lectures at university and just attend the online ones 4) have no social media 5) always show her my screen and what I am doing online as I am using my laptop to study 6)do nothing but study 7) sleep with her in the room

471,"**Tl:dr** \- *my teenage sweetheart (3 years together aged 15 - 18, knew each other from the age of 4) recently passed away from suicide.  I hadn't seen him or his family in 20 years as they moved away. I am heartbroken at the news - I always loved him.  He was married with four children which I only just found out a couple of years ago.  Is it inappropriate to send his mother a letter passing deep condolences and sharing some fond memories?  Worried that with him being a married father it might be somehow disrespectful to his wife although of course I'm not going to go raging in on how I loved him.  Just that he touched my soul and I've always carried that with me.*

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;dr** says most of it, additional information is that we were together in a day before mobile / cell phones and internet.  When you lost touch you lost touch.  I did try to find him over the years but he didn't maintain an online presence.  I learned about 2 years ago that he was married with children and, of course, stopped looking for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel alone in my grief.  There is no one in my life today who knew him so I have no one to share a feeling or memory of him with.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering sending his mother a letter expressing my condolences and sharing how important he was to me as my first love - not in a gushing, disrespectful way - more in a ""you raised a beautiful son and I was too young to thank you for that"" kind of way.  He was a very special person, very talented in music and a sensitive, loving soul.  I just want her to know how highly he's always been thought of and would, of course, acknowledge that I'm so happy that he met and married his soulmate and had beautiful children.

Would this be inappropriate?  I appreciate any thoughts, views or the benefit of anyone's experience.

473,"It started I when 14 years old and she would dress and put on bra’s and lingeries to ask me if it ‘looked good’ on her breasts for her date night.
My father left us when i was 13 years old he had a lot of problems from his childhood and military and my mother has a restraining order against him and his brothers.. And I never ever bonded deeply with any family members and felt so alone my whole life.
And I had a lot of anxiety and fear my entire life I don’t know why. But When a teacher of mine saw my notebook and saw all the suicide ideation on my notes she called the school administrators and they called police and and they put me in a hospital geared towards teenager who are suicidal like me.. been there 5 days and left..

All of these took a heavy mental toll on my mother who is also single and gave up on dating guys when i was 15.I guess she could feel attached to them emotionally or couldn’t allow anyone to get near me anymore.She loved me so much. When she looks into my eyes she always  has the 1000 yard soldier stair in her beatiful blue eyes.Like she put up with everything to get me to where I am today.. Like she gave up her career and life..

For the last 2 months she asked about my relationship with girls and she said you don’t have to feel isolated in your school and you can try dating girls you can be sexual with them now that you’re 16 years of age and feel teenage love and this may help you get over your teenage anxiety 😟 

And i believe this was a move on her part to ‘get sexual with me maybe??’ To me opening up to her about my sexual feelings?? Idk. 
 And after we had this conversation she said I love you so much honey and i feel so alone and I also need your emotional support and feel your presence right beside me ‘so I bond with my beatiful boy’ 

After that we started to sleep in the same bed and we started hugging each other first when we were facing each other. Then we would turn other way and sleep. After a week has gone by and she started pushing her butt against my groin to get close to me? I guess..

The next morning when i came home she was so interested in helping me out ‘find a girlfriend’ she was acting like a friend of mine rather than a mother .. she is 38 years old but this time started acting weird and like a teenager.

She asked me questions like do you know how to french kiss? (Btw we have french ancestry)
I said no. And she started caressing me saying it’s OK that i should practice and learn to be more confident to get a girlfriend in school so I not feeling alone when I am not with her anymore..

We first started to kiss each other on the lips i said sorry countless times. And she would hold my head towards her to lock our lips and massage my lips . After that i couldn’t look her in the eye but i got rock hard while doing that...

Exactly same night we went into the terrace and she gave me wine and some fruits so i drank the wine she poured more and more again...

She said I am gonna sleep i am waiting for you honey and i got sleepy after the wine..
So i get there to the bed and she was in the bed with her bras and lingerie..
She again started to grind on me while in the bed and i hugged her from behind and said I LOVE YOU SO MUCH while i am half drunk..
She said it’s ok honey i love you too my handsome part.?
She put her hands inside my boxters and started jerking me off and i started getting so horny and because while she was masturbating me my penis always touched her ass cheeks.and i couldn’t handle myself and i seperated her buttcheeks and she let me put it in and i came inside of her 2 minutes in... later I hugged her from behind and slept. 

It has been 1 week and i don’t know what to do guys? I feel so guilty? I am 16 years old. I don’t have anybody other than my mom... 

Please help me how should i behave with my mom ? I think this is wrong and this may end up with me having sex with her.Pls help me I am serious.

She started calling me handsome when i am with her.Inside our house I always walk around with goosebump all over my body.And i have rosacea too I have red cheeks all the time.
Should i continue this relationship this way? I know this is not normal but i felt totally connected to someone for the first time in my life? And like I talked to a psychiatrist that my hospital referred me to and I talked to her on the phone she says she is gonna call the police and I begged and cryed for half an hour on the phone to not get my jewel mom arrested because she is the only diamond i have in this world.If i am seperated from her I will definitely cut my wrists I told my psychiatrist and she decided not to call anyone.And i know with this much bond with me and my mom I would’ve harmed myself if I were to seperated from her.

So heres my issue, my parents have had this friend, lets call her Jess, forever now. Jess is in her early 30s, and Ive known her since I was very young.

Im 19 now and ill be 20 in a few weeks. Well I haven't seen her in quite awhile, 4 or 5 years give or take. Though my parents have stayed in touch with her and my mom has visited her regularly as of recent. 

Well recently Jess went through a nasty break up and needed abit of emotional support and my parents decided to bring her over to hang out. This was the first time Ive seen her in years as previously mentioned. Well needless to say, we've both changed a great deal.

It was nice seeing her again and catch up, drinking the night away. Well after that when she she went home with my Mom in toe I was talking with my dad reminiscing about some of my childhood memories I had of her.

My father in passing brought up how all her previous boyfriends weren't the best people and suggested that I could be her romantically with her and just set her on the right path, ""it benefit both of you"" he said. At first I laughed it off thinking he was just joking but then I realised he was being serious.

I immediately shot down the idea, explaining that even though im into women older than me, the memories and history between us just wouldn't make it work. He laughed about my 'flustered' reaction and backed off about it. 

But since then I haven't stopped thinking about it, thinking about her. Im beginning to get these feelings about her and I dont know what to do.

476,"Hello to anyone willing to read this. 

I'm a 22 year old male in college and I'm struggling here. 

Basically, I grew up in an anti-sex religious household. All I knew about sex growing up was what I learned from EXTREMELY sketchy porn at the ripe age of 13. It wasn't discussed in my house, church, school, or anywhere else I happened to be, except with my peers, who were *not* good for me. 

From the moment I hit puberty and began developing sexual feelings, I was a misogynist and an absolute tool. I (verbally) sexually harassed multiple classmates when I was in middle school/early high school. I remember being ""talked to"" by the principle but NEVER truly punished, and as you'd likely imagine, I didn't stop until I was old enough (15 or so) to realize that not only was it legally damning to act that way, but it also didn't ""work"" on my female peers. 

I developed a slew of mental health problem throught my high school career, and as such I withdrew socially. I had an eating disorder (anorexia, and later bulimia) which caused me to lose weight. I showered, but I didn't comb my hair *at all*. I was physically, mentally, and emotionally a mess and, around the time my classmates were becoming sexually active, I was stealing my dad's whiskey and drinking alone. I remained a virgin throughout high school and into college because I simply didn't have the confidence to talk to girls, and because of a fear that I'd inadvertently sexually harass someone again (I didn't realize at this point that just *asking* was okay, it was the *persistance* or gross comments that weren't). So I never tried to get with anyone; in fact, I avoided it. Then I met my ex. 

We hit it off, and pretty much instantly jumped in bed together. Things developed into a relationship which lasted for two years, and I did a lot that I wasn't proud of. 

Early into the relationship, there was one or two occasions where the usually-frequent sex slowed down, and upon rejection in these instances I remember flipping my lid. I did NOT force her to do anything, but I did mope around, demand that I get it ""soon"", and basically tried to convince her she was withholding something I ""needed"". She almost complied one of these times, and I'm damn glad she didn't. 

I was also extremely jealous of her high body count, which obviously I had no comparison to, since she was my first. I would ask questions, pry, and just be an insecure asshole. She would sometimes tell me what I wanted to know, and sometimes she wouldnt, but I was always upset about what I heard, and *jelous* that she could *possibly* have slept with more people than I had. 

Anyway, I'm sure it's a major shock to the reader that the relationship eventually ended, and it was , of course, my fault. But after that, things got weird. 

I honestly wasn't upset about the breakup. I understood her reasons, and I decided I was a ""free man"", able to satisfy my never-really-explored sexual fantasies with any consenting adult I could find. I decided I had an opportunity now, one which allowed me to bury my insecurities under piles of women. So I downloaded tinder and did better than expected. I've been hooking up with women, and continuing to do so, at every possible opportunity. If they are 18+ and attractive, I shoot my shot. All the while, caring only about one thing: my body count. I'm practically carving notches in my bedpost, trying to prove to myself that I'm desirable, jealous that other people got a head start. I feel *entitled* to what I feel like ""everyone else has"" (experience). I'm worried I may be crawling down the rabbit hole of sex addiction, and I KNOW I'm lying to these women by not telling them that I'm a POS who only wants to say I've f-cked a lot of women (I do at least make it clear that I'm not looking for a relationship). 

So, yeah. Long story. I've never been a great human being, and it all for the most part comes right back to sex. I'm not sure what to do or if I deserve to live. Really, I'm just confused and angry, and extremely guilty. I'm not sure if I can stop the rampant promiscuity either, as it's filling the hole of self-loathing by expanding my ego. I'm lost, scared, and most definately alone. I don't even know how to ask for help, so here I am.",19Oct2020,1

478,"I have 2 close friends in my class. Recently, I feel that I want to make more friends and get to know more people. However, one of my friends is extremely sensitive and gets mad whenever I do something as small as talking to someone else. The other friend avoids the subject (making more friends) whenever I bring it up. The people in my class are all very friendly and nothing bad about them. I never ditch my 2 friends, but the sensitive friend sees every interaction with someone else, as ditching. That friend would then ignore me. The thing is, I want all three of us to make friends together, and still stay as good friends. I just don't know how to convince them. If they can't be convinced (and I've been trying for a while), I have the choice of actually ditching them (which is still sad, because they are after all close friends), or staying with them and feeling lonely every day, or trying to be friends with other people and return to my friend group to find them all ignoring me. I just don't want to hurt anyone's feelings!

479,"I went to a friends place last night. I decided not to drive into town and parked my car near a tram/train station. It was about 7pm. I thought I had to leave by 11:50 to catch the last tram back but my mistake was not realising that the last tram hours are different for Sunday. The last one was at 11:20. 

I was meant to leave earlier last night to meet a guy I've been getting to know the last couple of weeks. I've known him last year so there was friendship there too. However, he cancelled on me because of a headache and said to reschedule. It was a last minute thing so I didn't mind. I stayed at my friends longer, left when the time for the last tram showed and only to get there and realise it was an inbound one. 

I was texting him throughout the evening and had said that I missed it. I heavily implied for a lift home.I was too embarrassed to ask for one. He didn't live too far so it was perfect. I assumed that since it was 12am and in the middle of the city that he'd say yes. But he said his headache was too bad etc etc etc. I went back to my friends place and just stayed the night until everything opened again. 

Yes there are taxis but I'm a student and I'd rather spend the 20-30pounds on my petrol instead one ride home. 

I'm not too upset since this was last night. I'm not sure if I'm upset because I would have taken him home anyway, headache or not (I have before). Or because I had no one to call for some rescuing. He mentioned that he went to the doctors this morning and that it was just stress related. I feel like I'm going to pull back from being too close to him now. A big thing for me is being to depend on people and he's one of two that I know who own a car (the other broke it so no chance). Maybe I'm just overthinking it?..

Am I overreacting?.",19Oct2020,1

He is a very smart handsome caring stable person and overall a sweetheart  that made me fall more and more in love with him and later asked me to be his girlfriend.

In his room he has flags hung up and there was a gap open I’ve never really asked him why.  I would always rant to him about how horrible trump was and he would agree with me. one day during a ft call I saw a trump flag hung up where the open gap was. All I said was “I know I’m blind but that better not be a trump flag” and he hung up.

we didn’t speak for the rest of the day. Until I texted him that it would be best that we went out separate ways and we both cried (a lot) but said he wont change his political stance. At this point I didn’t contact him for a week but still had a lot of his things at my house and wanted to return them to him. I texted but he didn’t respond so I drove to his house and put them outside but he saw me and begged for me stay with him but deep down I knew I couldn’t.

The general goal of our committee is to promote diversity in our program and educate our classmates on racial disparities in medicine. We’ve been working on getting this committee approved as an extension of SGA for several months now. 

We now have a student who regularly wears a Trump 2020 mask requesting membership. We gave him our new member questionnaire and his responses indicated that he did not feel our committee was necessary and that he would attempt to dismantle the changes we have already implemented. 

Do we allow this person to join our committee when he has demonstrated that he does not agree with our values and does not feel our committee is important/necessary? How can a committee whose purpose is inclusion and diversity reject someone with different beliefs?",19Oct2020,1

The quizzes we take are very fast pace and only contain 5-7 questions. Mistakes I make include: entering the wrong data from a table into my calculator or even simple addition miscalculations. When taking large assessments It usually does not bother me as these mistakes do not affect my overall grade.

After he left, I asked my sister what the deal was and she got very upset and felt like she had to justify her decision to me, because I was one of the many people who supported her when she was devastated over him cheating on her.

498,"25 year old guy here. This stuff is from when I was 21 or younger:  
I found a ton of old conversations today. I cannot believe how immature I was. The more forgiving parts were really cringe political opinions, memes and stupid shit like that right?

But what bothered me was passive aggressiveness, immaturity, arguments and things like that. I would wallow in self-pity while doing little to fix my life. I think a lot of people dislike me. I don't think anything I've said or done breaks any laws but god damn I would not be friends with me.

Going further back were me not taking no for an answer when I had a crush, it seemed like it was borderline creepy behavior to keep giving chase, I feel extremely ashamed for having done this sort of thing. It was many years ago. I feel like I owe people an apology although most people still keep contact with me and are fine?

I'm extremely confused on whether or not they dislike me. I want to ask but also realizing my immature behavior I feel like its better off I don't say anything to them at all and find new people with whom I can behave like a proper adult. I'm also very scared of what they would tell me or think that I'm just attention seeking

I don't like to use the word survivor but I faced a ton of abuse(physical and mental) as a young kid and it really fucked me up. I was constantly depressed and suicidal in my teenage years up until recently. I got diagnosed with OCD(responsibility subtype) and currently in therapy. I really can't begin to explain how ashamed of myself I am. I don't know why was this way and even scarier is if I still behave this way and don't realize it.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

1 - How do I find out if I still behave like a manchild. And how do I change?

2 - Should I apologize to people I behaved badly with? Or am I just blowing this out of proportion. I really don't want to be the source of anyone's sadness in the past, present or future :(",19Oct2020,1

I’m a 30 y/o male who enjoys crossdressing (dressing and acting as a woman). When I actually do it it brings me joy, and I really fell happy. It also brings me to talking to people who I would not normally talk to and I usually enjoy the conversation. No one knows about it and I don’t want anyone I’m close to knowing about it. I would also never tell a girlfriend about it, and usually when I have a girlfriend or am dating someone I do not have the urges to crossdress. I guess I sometimes view it as “if I can’t find a girlfriend, I’ll be my own”. It sounds dumb to me but helps me justify it. 

Anyway I hate doing it. I feel an enormous amount of shame for doing it and I usually genuinely hate myself in the aftermath. However after a day or so the urges come back and I do it all over again and of course while I’m crossdressing I feel really happy. I’m positive I’m not trans, I really do enjoy being a guy. I just hate crossdressing (not the people, just me doing it). 

Any advice on how to stop? Or perhaps even advice on how to embrace it?",19Oct2020,1

516,"So initially I was going to homeschool, but to apply to college/universities I wanted better predicted grades for a  certain subject which is important for the field I decided i want to pursue. Eventually it was decided I'd go for half the year and continue on if I feel its worth it.

After being told if I make good progress then I would get a higher predicted, my teacher told me that that doesnt exist and we can only evaluate u based on external exams, and bcz of Corona I only had exams in jan and for that specific subject I happened to get a bad grade which I worked on nonstop throughout the summer. I enjoyed learning when it wasn't in school and made real progress, now its just stress and I dont have anytime to absorb any content, nor give myself a moment to breathe.

I want to leave as the whole reason I joined was never going to happen.

BUT my parents might have to pay the term's fees (3000$)

I dont want to waste that money but I feel worst results are due if I do continue (learning wise and healthwise) and I simply am not gaining any benefits from staying and infact the opposite

What do I do?",19Oct2020,1
518,"I've looked up this question multiple times but I can't seem to relate to any of the answers so here's why I'm asking:

I am a simple teenager. I do things that a teen would normally do, but I realized that about a year ago I started to become more forgetful and restless. More fidgety and just off. For years I was always calm, collected, and timid but lately, I have been this unpredictable ball of energy. Sometimes I'm talking and then move onto a topic like it's nothing, and moments later I would apologize about it every five minutes. I feel the need to do some things on impulse, and a lot of the things I do on impulse I'm not proud of. I forget things so much my parents constantly use that against me 25/8. I was wondering why I am like this and realized I could go to the doctor about this and see what's up. I figured it could be ADHD but I didn't want to self-diagnose so again I wanted to see a doctor. The only thing is that I have to ask my parents. My parents are the type to think I'm overreacting about something and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's for money or maybe it's to not cause stress but I hate it. It sucks because when I was dealing with anxiety and a depressive episode they had thought I was ""doing too much"". They claim I can come to them about anything but that isn't true.  I don't have anyone to really talk to about this so my last resort would, unfortunately, have to be asking my parents. So how? Anything will truly help. :,)",19Oct2020,1
519,"Hey guys, this is my first post on this sub and I'm not sure if this is the right spot but I need advice lol. 

So basically, I'm a sophomore in virtual college right now. I decided to take a health class online so that I wouldn't have to take gym in college (ew) and I figured it would be an easy A (all freshmen, basic content, etc.). 

This professor is a female, but very misogynistic (women are more emotional, men shouldn't do housework, etc.). She is also very strict with basically everything and got angry when I told her I had to miss class once (we're in the middle of a pandemic!!). Not liking her as a person is fine. However, her first project has really crossed a line for me. She assigned a ""family tree"" type of thing. It's basically a list of the entire health history for every family member we know of, in addition to info about us personally. To be honest, this just makes me uncomfortable. I don't have contact with some of my family, and I'm not super close with the rest of my extended family. I don't want to ask them about their personal health issues. My mom also had cancer when I was in high school and I really hate talking about it. I also have struggled with body image issues for a while, and divulging my health habits, weight, etc. is not something I want to do (especially knowing how judgmental she is). 

I don't want to share private details like that with such a sexist and rude person. Even if she was the best professor ever, this is invasive. However, nobody in the class has really complained and it seems like a project she's been doing for years. I'm just at a loss. I really don't want to talk to her, she's not very understanding and she already dislikes me for missing class. I feel like reporting her would be dramatic though. Do you guys think that this project crosses a line? Am I just being unreasonably stubborn? What should I do?",19Oct2020,1
520,"This is my first “real” job out of college after I graduated in 2019. Currently, due to the pandemic climate, we are working from home. In theory, this sounds like it would be amazing, but unfortunately I have been working over my scheduled 40 hour weeks (no overtime pay) just to complete my workload while new work continues to get piled on. My job does require a lot of mental power/responsibility and is not something that can be completed aimlessly (which in itself can be taxing) 

I have repeatedly discussed having a full workload, not having time for extra projects, etc. yet the insurmountable flow keeps coming, and I do not know how to cope, no matter how many times I say “I can’t”.

I feel like my job is completely taking over my life, with no reprise due to being locked down. On top of that, others coworkers are taking advantage of the situation with lighter workloads and being “unavailable” at random points throughout the day, while they pile more onto me. 

I’m at the point of feeling extremely depressed and wanting to quit my job (and my life honesty), but unfortunately I need this pay to get by.

I need serious advice on how to set these boundaries and express how impaired my QoL and overall mental health is due to my career and current world situation, since apparently what I’ve been doing is not enough. I worry about going to HR and just don’t know what to do.

Any advice from veterans of the 9-5 world (especially an agency setting) would be appreciated :(",19Oct2020,1
521,"I (22) live with my roommate(30), and I asked him if he could meet me my boyfriend because I had to stop home to grab a shirt and it would only take like 5 minutes. My roommate said “I’m not sure that a great idea..” I asked him why and he didn’t respond. My roommate said he would meet him when I first moved in(a month ago) Should I confront him face to face ?

523,"My boyfriend has been working third shift for almost 2 years now and went back to school this fall to start his journey to become a master electrician. He sleep schedule is extremely chaotic now since starting classes to the point where he can’t fall asleep for almost 1-2 hours after he gets in bed. Maybe getting 5-6 hours of bad sleep a day. I was curious as to if anyone had gone through this as well or had any advice as to what he can do to help get some more better, quality sleep. I’d like to help him as much as I can, it’s hard to see him struggle to get through all this with little sleep.",19Oct2020,1
525,"So last year I was involved with a guy I thought I could trust, we exchanged nude pictures. A couple months later, we broke up. Fast forward to now I’ve been notified that he has been showing people those pictures. Is there anything I can do? I live in NY and I don’t think he can be a charged, we don’t have revenge porn laws (that I know of), but can I sue him? 
A lot has happened because of this, losing friendships, crying myself to sleep, and he’s not even the least bit sorry. 

Thank you for any help!",19Oct2020,1
526,"I (20f) don’t necessarily have a close relationship with my brother (40m) but I have noticed he has periods of completely changing his attitude and behavior. My sister self-diagnosed him with bipolar personality disorder and I wished we could take him for proper diagnosis and therapy but that option is off the table. Both him and my parents believe that there is nothing wrong.

He has long periods where he will be the nicest brother. He’ll be taking care of the family and himself. However, there are periods where he’ll just do a 180 turn and become very angry and resentful. He starts going down a downward spiral of drugs, wasting money and becomes verbally and borderline physically abusive. This has been going on for 10 years now and the periods take longer to return.

I was wondering if anyone deals with someone with this disorder, and how to deal with it? It really just feels like I’ve lost a brother and it’s really painful to watch. It’s really scary to be with him at his worst.",19Oct2020,1
