0,"I feel guilty for fetishising black men

I am 22m have been in a long distance relationship with my 22gf for about 2 years and usually we get to visit each other more often, but due to covid and work we have not been seeing eachother nearly as often. 

We opened the relationship up about a year ago, but never really acted on it. I’m pretty introverted and she is very extroverted, but we both just never really met anyone we trusted enough to hook up.

My gf was at the protests last week and met a group from another college around that area (Atlanta) and most of the guys happened to be black. My gf always found black guys attractive, but never had a black bf or fwb or anything.

She ended up hooking up and having sex with one of the guys she met and was nervous to tell me, but ended up telling me at the end of last weekend.

I, to her surprise, was extremely turned on and she was actually relieved that I wasn’t mad or jealous. 

I don’t see her for another 2 weeks and the rush of getting all the details is so overwhelming and surprisingly a turn on and I feel really weird about it. I don’t mean to stereotype and fetishise  another race, but my gf was happy to tell details and has seen him once again one night this past week. I feel so messed up and like I’m part of the problem, but I am not purposely doing this.

TLDR: I feel guilty and have extremely mixed views about my girlfriend experiencing a black guy sexually.",15Jun2020,1

3,"My grandmother has a pretty sizable collection of mammy dolls and another racist caricature memorabilia. They are displayed rather prominently in her home. Shes had the collection for many years, well before I was born. I remember being a small child getting yelled at for playing with/accidentally breaking them because they were ""extremely valuable."" Since becoming old enough to understand what they represent and how offensive they are I have been nagging her to get rid of them but she refuses. She claims that they are not racist and are just historical. We have had several arguments about them over the last few years and it's getting to the point that I cant conscionably allow such offensive items to exist not only in my world but in the world in general. I was wondering if any Redditors may have some creative solutions as to help convince her to get rid of them. And if I do if there is some sort of charity or organization that could use them as educational tools. 

I know that many people will read this and tell me to steal that stuff in the night and stop speaking to my racist grandmother, which trust me I have considered more than once. But that's not an option for many reasons, the main being that I am the absolute only family she has left. I regularly call out her offensive comments and have honestly made a lot of progress towards undoing her prejudice but can't seem to make any headway with the dolls. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. 

Oh, and we live in a major south Texas city for those wondering.",15Jun2020,4
5,I saw her smoking a few times outside but she never saw me. Then this afternoon she was in the hot tub with my dad and she was smoking. My dad SEES THIS. when were they going to tell me if he was aware with it?  My mom saw that i looked. What do i say. Do i confront her on it? I want her to stop j really do and ive been telling her smoking can cause cancer and its the exact thing that killed my nanny (her mom) i dont know if its cigarettes or a vape but either way it harms the lungs. Im only 16 and i don't want to lose my parents (my dad has heart issues) and i want my children one day to have grandparents. .. what do i do?,15Jun2020,1
6,"I'm 23 years old and still in college. I'll be graduating this December and hope to land a full-time position before that, or shortly after. I currently live with a family friend (who is basically my other grandma lol) due to my dad becoming rather abusive to my siblings and I. My mom actually lives next door with a friend she's known since my siblings and I were babies. This is how I have gotten to know the woman I now live with since February.

However, my mom has been complaining about living there. Mind you, that house is not in the best shape. It has holes in the roof, the other roommates do not know how to clean as it's always filthy (e.g., spiderwebs, dog pee, etc.), and she's just sick of being there in general. Another thing to note is that she and my dad are going through a divorce and if things go well, she could end up with a decent amount of money to help with getting herself a place down the line.

It's not that I wouldn't mind living with her it's just the fact that I am my own person. I love her to bits and we're very close. I just believe she's kind of depending on me but I'm only young once and I would eventually want my own place and do my own thing (e.g., date, socialize, etc.).

Am I in the wrong? Am I being selfish? I would be the one out of my siblings and I to help her out down the line, no doubt (I wouldn't mind of course), but right now when I'm young, I just want to do my own thing. I might even have to move out of state for a job, get married, who knows.",15Jun2020,1
8,"So basically I’m in this argument with my friends and a new member of our friend group I’ll call her Dianne came into the group. I had heard a lot of things about her previously like how she was kinda a liar and really manipulative kind of person. Her whole friend group previously kinda had to let her go because of all the drama that she caused from what I’ve heard. But then we started hanging out because I didn’t want to believe all the rumors and she came into our group. Basically how the situation started was she asked if she could hookup with my ex... and then I said yes because I was put in a weird position and she ended up doing a lot more than I thought she would and never told me about it. When I heard about all this other stuff she did with him that she didn’t tell me about, we were in a group setting where I couldn’t just flat out start drama. I basically ranted about it to a few people there (which I understand now was wrong) and then she overheard it and stuff and then she like got all mad and kinda went batshit on me. After words she was sitting on my ex’s lap and that’s when I got like mad. So I kinda was like I’ll admit raising my voice at her and shit and then when we had a private conversation with each other and she drove me home she literally was going off, she was twisting my words  and clearly telling me she was so sorry... then the next day all my friends were mad at me. Because she clearly twisted my words and manipulated the situation. She then tells me she was not okay to have this conversation w me to make amends until a week later. Once a week passed we had a huge meeting with all my friends and she said everything was fine right.. and then she didn’t invite me to the group hangout. Basically calls me yesterday and literally was just spitting lies out on the phone while my best friend was with her. And then admits to lying when she texted me. And then I found out she had asked the guy I have a thing w questions about me and if I talked to him about the situation.... asked a lot of other people I know... kinda just twisted everything around. She said that I was being “sus” when I asked the ex that she hooked up with if we could talk because before he hooked up w her he told me he still had feelings for me.... the whole thing is just blown out of porportion I’m done with dealing with it. But this girl Dianne keeps twisting my words and manipulating my friends and I don’t know what to do... how can I get to my friends at all? I just don’t know what to do.",15Jun2020,1
9,I have no idea if this is the right place for this. But I guess I’m just using this as a platform to see others thoughts. With all the events occurring around America I am realizing that I’m very ignorant to racism.  I never really was brought up to think about the challenges of other races or of the people that I was told were different. I’m a 21 year old white male for context. I never even acknowledged that I had white privilege until just recently. I was however raised to treat others equally and I try to listen to others if they notice a bias I do not. I just want to be as fair and be the best person I can be. I’m not so sure what to do with such a heavy realization. Does anyone know how to handle something of this magnitude? I welcome everyone’s responses good and bad. I just wanted to speak on my experiences even though they are few. Thank you for reading.,15Jun2020,1
10,"I want to be a good neighbor and leave my neighbors alone.  A lot are retired, some are independently weathy and don't work.  I see them having fires and socializing and feel left out.  I got lots of problems in my mind, mainly constant negative thoughts, but I mow my yard and pay my bills, but I get so bored with consuming media and staring at screens.

I do have a little garden and new tenants moving in, but I don't have a posse or a tribe.  I just passive income and a depreciating asset.  I know I am not a bad person, but I feel so useless most of the time.  I used to self medicate, but being sober just allows me to recognize my loneliness.  My family supports me on the phone, but I would someone in real space/ real time.  I do, I have my neighbors.  The world is big and mysterious esp.  with the internet.

16,"So a couple of months ago I had an argument with a friend of mine. I don’t remember exactly what started the argument, but it ended up being har telling me that I was selfish for not considering it was hard also hard for her having a suicidal friend (me). And I get that, but It’s not my fault that I am, and I’m not in a position to take care of other people’s mental health (since I can barely take care of my own). After that we ended up not talking for months. Of course there is more to the argument, but that’s the summary.

The other day she texted me this:

(My name)
It’s been pretty long since I’ve texted and I don’t completely know how you feel about me. You’re allowed to be mad at me. I know I’ve been passively watching you stories and post (referring to Instagram) and I don’t feel very good about that. Last time we texted I didn’t get the feeling that you wanted anything to do with me. I would like to start hanging out with you again if you want to. If you don’t that’s also okay. We can also just begin to text. I just want to know how you feel about me right now, since I’m not completely sure after last time we talked ❤️


I don’t really know how to feel about it. And it may seem weird to you that I can’t just text her, but i have recently been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome (autism) and I really have no clue. I just feel stuck. The only thing I can really think of telling her is just to fuck off. But yeah, I don’t want to be rude, and I can’t think of how to politely tell her that I’m not interested in friendship.",15Jun2020,2

19,"Here’s some background of me (21F) and this person (20M) (sorry if it’s not detailed enough, my mind is racing):
I’ve been talking to this guy for a few months. I was in a bad place when we started talking, I was talking to other people so I was a bit distracted and trying to not focus on my last relationship which absolutely destroyed me. I was not really caring about how often we talked and such since I had other people I was talking to. Then I decided to push away these guys and to focus on myself. Focus on classes! Find new hobbies! Baking! Painting! Yoga! Go running! 
But then he messaged me more and .... 
He started Facetiming me every night and I had a feeling something was wrong because he was messaging me more and that didn’t seem normal to me. My friends would say it’s probably because he likes me but I couldn’t help but feel like something was wrong. He would give hints and he seems similar to me. I would avoid it, I’m not sure why i did, and I kinda regret it now. Then he suddenly says he’s having a hard time and that he needed to be alone for a bit. I stopped replying and then he started messaging me more again. He did bring up how something was bothering him and this time I tried asking and when he said it was too personal I didn’t pry. I don’t like prying but I had a feeling I should’ve asked more about it. He has said some things that makes me think that he’s maybe not over his ex.. I don’t really know much about it, just that he said he feels insecure about himself since that relationship, that they ended on good terms but some things could have been avoided, and a few other things.
This had been making really anxious. I stopped replying last week and he would send an extra text and everytime i’d respond I’d get more nervous. So this time (a few days ago) I told him I wouldn’t be responding for a while because I wasn’t sure what to say anymore because I feel nervous with how everything has switched so quickly. He said he understood.

Now: 
When I’m ready to talk again, I’m not sure what to say. Should I tell him how I feel? I’m not even sure how I feel tbh. I do think he’s one of the coolest people I’ve ever met. I really really like him but also it’s hard to feel anything at the moment because I’m very afraid of getting close to someone and then getting hurt again. (I’ve already told him the part of being afraid to get attached before so I’m not sure if I should say it again ? ) I hate that I’m afraid, and I wish I wasn’t. I feel stupid. 

Or should I just talk to him like nothing happened? I see people say to not act desperate and to not try or it will scare someone away. I also see people say that I should talk to more than one person, but I don’t wanna do that! I don’t have the energy anymore.  

Or should I just disappear and block him on everything? 


I just remembered something. When he started talking to me more he opened up. Something happened to him, and what happened to him was similar as to what happened to me in the past, and its my biggest secret ever, but I told him about it. I kinda regret telling him, but in that moment I felt like I should. I told myself I wouldn’t tell someone unless I’ve been with them for longer or if it felt right. Immediately after this I cried lmao. I think this part is what has been making me more overwhelmed too. I tell myself it’s okay because I didn’t go into detail.

Ah. Also just remembered that I should add that I’m home now (a few hours away). I’m afraid we’ll stop talking because I’m not sure how long I’ll be staying home. It was supposed to be only for a few weeks, but I’m thinking about staying for the whole summer.",15Jun2020,1

22,"I apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language, so there might be a few errors in this/ sometimes I can't really articulate what I mean exactly. I hope you can still make sense of it :),
I'd like to clarify before the actual post that I'm aware of the fact that taste is subjective. I wouldn't post on here if a movie she recommended to me simply wasn't my favourite. 

Maybe some of you know the movie ""365 days"". It recently became available on Netflix and is basically a Polish version of 50 Shades of Grey. I don't want to spoil too much or write paragraphs about the plot, but there's a bunch of things objectively bad about the movie, starting with the plot itself. It's basically about a mafia boss who stalks and kidnaps a girl and gives her a year to fall in love with him. She may do whatever she wants and he promises to not touch her/ do anything without her consent (which, by the way, he is saying while touching her inappropriately without her consent and he also does not keep that promise).

SPOILER: She ends up falling in love with him and even gets pregnant with his child

There are so many really uncomfortable scenes, the movie is sexist and romanticizes kidnapping and the way he treats her is supposed to be sexy, I think, but the dom/sub dynamic they were going for just feels weird because he forces her to do a lot of things and they never really have chemistry throughout the movie plus the fact that all of the writers' efforts to make the male protagonist likeable fail. It's humiliating and weird and the message they send with it is bad as well. 
Now, my friend, on the other  hand, loves that movie. She's watched it several times and is indeed very much ok with all of this. She finds it hot, even. I can understand what would turn her on about it, I think,  it is almost straight up porn, but I cannot believe she only has positive feelings about this movie. She never even mentioned the messed-up stuff. She even said she thought I'd like this movie, which is baffling to me.
I feel like I have to address the fact that some parts of this movie are unacceptable. If she asks me how I liked it, I don't want to lie to her, but I also don't want to hurt her feelings. Should I just bite my tongue and not go on about why I didnt like the movie or should I tell her the truth. If so, how the heck do I express my concerns with the movie without sounding like I'm judging her for her taste in movies or something?
I'd love to get some help with this. Thanks in advance.",15Jun2020,1
24,"Hey Reddit, first post.

I have a fantastic roommate but he's very very messy.. We live in a small apartment and have a poorly set up kitchen. This is unfortunate because my roommate loves to cook, and is very good at it, but often times I will come home or go downstairs to the kitchen and there is trash covering the floor, dishes and food piled in the sink and the countertops covered with grime or random things. Most of the time the kitchen looks like a tornado ran through it. The living room is also like this and he has clothes and shoes all over it so I'll usually just go to my room.

Ever since we moved in, I primarily use paper plates and plastic utensils. The only food I'll cook will be bacon, sausage and eggs. Most of the time if I use any dish or pan, I clean it immediately after before I leave the kitchen. My roommate occasionally cooks for me (sometimes once a week) and usually after I will take my dirty dishes to the sink, wipe them off, and place them in dishwasher.

In the past few months however, my roommate has been asking me to do the dishes more and try too keep the kitchen cleaner. However, I don't think I should have to clean the dishes when 1) I don't use them, 2) They are usually piled up and overflow onto the counter, and 3) the sink often gets clogged deep in the drain because of all the food he throws in the sink.

I'm more than okay with helping with dishes if he cooked something for me or if I *actually* contributed to the mess, but most of the time he'll bring it up a day later when he had either cooked the meal for himself or I wasn't even home at home when he had cooked anything. I just don't see how it would be my responsibility to clean up my roommates messes if I had no contribution to them and when I do end up cleaning the kitchen, the next time I look its just back to a wreck. Again, I love my roommate, but the only clean room in the apartment is my room and any mess that I myself make, I clean up, so I don't see how he wants me to clean up his messes.

Any advice? Thank you!

it started in december, but he started asking me for things and i have an issue with boundaries so i got him what he wanted. it started off with just CDs and small things, but it eventually progressed

 at first i thought nothing of it, but last week i let him use my paypal to attach to his depop and i started noticing money going missing, and he hadn’t made any sales yet.  

when i confronted him about it he said he’d pay me back, but then started being snappish and not talking to me as much when i told him i wasn’t comfortable with him using my paypal anymore 

i asked my other friends about it (18M, 15F, 14M)  and they all said i should drop him? i’m conflicted as he means a lot to me but my trust in him depleted a lot after this.

BTW as examples of things i’ve bought him: i pay for his spotify premium, i bought him my chemical romance tickets ($170) and i’ve paid for other things here and there. i was fine with occasional things, but i’ve been uneasy since he’s never once offered to pay me back and i noticed the money going missing from my paypal. i’m not sure if he’s intentionally stealing from me or if he just doesn’t get it?

I don't feel like I'm good enough or capable enough to please him.

So when I was 16 we were on holiday. One night when I came out of my room to goto the bathroom I saw my mum and bf on sofa in the caravan and he had his penis out his pants and my mum sat next to my ex bf. I didn't stop to question then I just ran away from the caravan for a few hours this was at night time. They did come out looking for me because I could hear them calling my name I was that upset because at that age I though I loved him when I finally went back to the caravan my mum was angry at me for running off and tried saying what I saw was in my head and I believed them. So after the holiday when we went home everything went back to normal but in my head something just kept bothering me I got paranoid all the time I use to have my boyfriend stay over but my mum said he wasn't aloud to sleep in my room and he would spend the night in her room with the door shut I'm thinking that is suspicious plus I could sometimes hear moaning coming from her room I mean if you ain't doing anything why have the bedroom door shut and locked. I didn't question then about it incase I was told I was hearing things in then end a big wedge came in-between me and my mum I broke up with my then bf. And they weird thing is when I met my husband now after I had my second son I found out that they were together. All my family knew and his family knew apart from me I found out thru my sister.

TD;LR: my white brother-in-law wants a book or reading recommendation to understand institutionalized racism / systematic oppression that led to the BLM protests across USA. I’m worried that I’m going to recommend the wrong thing and end up doing more damage than good (I.e. him being defensive and not wanting to learn more) 


I need help. My white BIL asked me for a book recommendation or readings about race. BIL said that doesn’t understand the social justice movement, black lives matter movement, and why protests has erupted across USA over the killing of George Floyd. He wants to learn and he wants to be more knowledgeable. He wants to learn the history of institutionalized racism / systematic oppression in USA. I am ecstatic and worried at the same time. 

I am ecstatic that he, a white dude who grew up super privileged and has lived in a white bubble all his life, is not brushing this off. He acknowledges that he doesn’t know enough and wants to learn. 

I am worried that I’m going to recommend the wrong thing and fuck this up. What if I recommend something that is too challenging / too in your face / too combative and he immediately gets defensive and turns off? Then I may have ruined my only opportunity to help him grow and do more damage than good. 

He mentioned that every time he tried to google / find something, he ends up with a reading that feels like he is being screamed at / lectured at by a 20 year old liberal (He is a conservative. Not sure if he is republican or democratic. My SIL, his wife, is a staunch republican and makes it known. He never really revealed his party affiliation). He is also very busy with work and his kids (4 kids under the age of 11), so he can only read for an hour or so before bed each day. When things return to normal after covid-19, he will also listen to books on tape during his commute. 

He wants to know the history and the historical events that led up to the current flashing point of protests and riots across the country. He wants to understand why people are so angry. I was thinking of recommending the book White Rage by Carol Anderson. It focuses on historical events and how white America purposely suppressed black progress in one form or another, leading to the institutionalized racism and systematic oppression we see today. I know he likes history and I think he will see the citing of historical events as convincing evidence. 


A little background: 
I am pretty sure I am the first non-white person he has some form of a relationship with that is not acquittance like. We didn’t get off on the best foot, but we are cordial. The first time I met him, he made a series of racist jokes. My partner was mad, but the rest of the family thought it was no big deal. He and my partner’s family is not overtly racist, but they are definitely wrapped up in willful ignorance / subscribe to racist thoughts. For example, another brother doesn’t believe in the concept of white privilege and thinks PoC should stop making excuses for why their struggles. As a result of these things, my partner and I don’t really see the family anymore. But that’s another topic for another day.

Now you may ask how come my BIl didn’t ask his sister, my white partner, for help? So my partner is really combative with her family. Another story another day. But on this race issue, she calls them out every time they commit a microagression and say something racist. She is very in their face and needless  to say, they do not take it well and it always end up with them being defensive and calling my partner an asshole. I think that’s why he came to me.",15Jun2020,2

39,"This happened about 2 weeks ago, and I just can't get it out of my mind. I really don't have anyone to talk about this kind of stuff with, so I thought Reddit would be the best way to get advice. Since kindergarten, I have had two best friends. For the sake of keeping their identities private, I'll call them B and N. B and N are identical twin brothers. To explain the dynamic of our friendship, we've always had a very physical and open one. We would never really shy away from discussing super personal things, or hold back on physical contact. I mean we all pretend to flirt with each other, I've even kissed them before as a joke, but in the end we were all just guys being guys and the both of them have girlfriends. This is stupid and selfish of me to say, but when quarantine began, the most we did was spend 2 weeks away from each other before hanging out. The day it happened, their mom was out of town in order to take care of their grandmother. They invited me over for booze to celebrate us graduating highschool. I agreed in less than a second. My mom worked the night shift that day so after she left I picked up some more alcohol for us and headed over. I knocked on the door like usual and B's girlfriend welcomed me inside. We headed to their basement and began our little get together with some more close friends they invited over. By the end of it, everyone was much too drunk to safely drive home, so about half of the kids left via uber and the other half decided to stay. Most of everyone that stayed was out cold so we kinda just tossed them on whatever soft cushion there was. I was still pretty sober so me, B and N decided to continue to drink in another room. We spent that time just talking to each other and reminiscing about all the time we spent together. Maybe it was the alcohol, but the topic of losing our virginity came out. I won't share what they said, but by the end of N's turn we were all pretty hard. When they asked me to share I sorta just shrugged my shoulders and told them I hadn't yet. The both of them stayed silent for a while, I remembered I had been embarrassed by the fact no one was talking. Finally, N broke the silence by laughing at me and told me I had to drink for my lack of a story. Since we were all still hard we decided to put on some porn. I could tell the two of them weren't really into it, but I just wanted my stiffy to go away. I couldn't properly relieve myself, no matter what I did it just wouldn't work. That's when I heard N from the other side of me ask if I wanted him to do it. I just jokingly managed to slur, ""Yes please."" before both went all quiet again. That's when I felt a hand on me. I somewhat sobered up, and looked towards N. He was looking directly into my eyes, that's when I noticed he already had his hand on his too. I couldn't even squeak out a response by how shocked I was. He then whispered in my ear to not make any noise or else I would wake up the others, that's when I ended up ejaculating in his hand. Afterwards I couldn't believe what I had done, then N asked me if I was disgusted. The worst part about that statement is that I wasn't, I liked it alot. I ended up passing out after both receiving and giving my first blowjobs. I woke up that morning ass naked in the same room as them. I quickly left while everyone was asleep, but I cried the entire ride home.

I know this post is ridiculously long, but I wanted whoever can help me to know the full extent of my situation. I don't know what to do or say. They've tried contacting me, but how am I supposed to answer them? They've visited a couple of times but I've never opened the door. I'm too afraid to face them. I'm so scared we stupidly ruined years worth of friendship and their relationships because we got shitfaced. I'm not even sure if I'm fucking straight anymore, or if I've now developed feelings for my bestfriends. Please, someone tell me how to fix this.",15Jun2020,1
40,"My sister (21F) and four years older than me (17F) has always been unkind. Any tender moment we may have had was because she needed something from me. She bullies me about my weight, and taunts my every insecurity. She outed my sexuality to my family right in front of me (I have never told her I was gay, although she’s not wrong). I try to be above it and not let her get to me but she knows just how to push my buttons and does so just for the fun of it. Even when she’s not going after me, her personality rubs me up the wrong way - she’s egocentric and pretends to be dumb because it’s “cute”.

Thankfully, she left home two years ago, but after yet another miserable family gathering two weeks ago, I do not want to visit her with the rest of my family her this weekend. My mum always makes excuses for her, and my dad is entirely ignorant when it comes to our relationship. My brother (19M) is great when she’s not around, but when she is he often buddies up with her to taunt me.

Should I go to make my mum happy, and not rustle any feathers? I love my parents and my older brother (most of the time) and I don’t want to be the one who never sees the family when we all get older. Nevertheless, I hate every second I spend with my sister, so I think I will make up an excuse and stay home.

45,"I don't know how to bring up to my boss how much I don't want the responsibility they are trying to put on me (not even getting a raise). My current role doesn't have any role or responsibilities that can't be fixed the next day or week is something goes wrong. I am also not in charge of anyone.

They want me to take over the logistics role in our company so that the logistics person can take over another role (the person in that role was recently diagnosed with cancer and will be leaving).

It is work that could cost of thousands if I mess up when filling out customs stuff when we ship things (we move 2-3 containers a week from the US and South America).

I will have to start coordinating with dozens of people. Brokers, shippers, manufacturing plants, and customers (businesses not individual people)

AND I would be in charge of our driver. I would have to tell him when and where to pick up containers. I would have to call him for updates. If he does something that is violating whatever rules rig drivers have to follow, I will have to talk with him about it (maybe reprimand him?). I'll also be in charge of contacting Ryder if something goes wrong with the truck (I think we have a contract with him).

To top it all off, the person teaching me is TERRIBLE at teaching. She doesn't know why she does a lot of stuff, she is horribly disorganized (the two filing cabinets she has are a mess), and she just vaguely shows me how to do things at random. I have learned how to do a few things that just require data entry (the ISF for incoming shipment and paperwork for our shipments to the South American plants). It feels like I learned how to do those in spite of her.

54,"Okay I hardly post on reddit so sorry if this doesn’t make sense, but I’m genuinely confused on what to do. I know this is probably dumb, but last night I (17 f) had a very uncomfortable interaction with one of my former close guy friends. Me and this dude used to be super close, and he used to be very sweet and kind. A couple months ago this all changed, when at a movie party he continually moved my hand to his crotch despite me constantly pulling away and saying no. Despite this, I was still his friend afterwards because I figured it was just an off night for him or something. However, last night, I was at a friends birthday party when he asked if I wanted to go see his new car. It was already almost past my curfew, and the guy who was driving me home was ready to leave as well. But, I went with him thinking it would only be a minute. He said we were gunna go on a spin around the neighborhood so he could show me the car, and that it would be quick. Thinking that’s all it was, I got in. However he pulled into a random cul de saq and turned his headlights off then proceeded to try to pressure me into performing a sexual act. I continually said no, and asked him to take me back to the party so I could go home. He kept begging and saying some manipulative bullshit for about 10 minutes until he finally got mad and drove me back. While the situation was messy as a whole, the worse part about it is that the excuse he made is that “he’s going to ask this girl out tomorrow so I need to do it cause it’s his last chance.” Normally I wouldn’t say anything about stuff like this, but that makes me feel awful. I don’t want the girl he’s about to date to go through similar stuff or date a guy not knowing that this is the shit he was pulling yesterday. I’m not sure if it’s my place to let her know. We aren’t really friends, but we’ve spoken a couple times and have mutual friends. What should I do?

55,"Hello all, apologies for the upcoming wall of text.

I don't think I have ever been happy in my life.

I grew up in a household with my parents arguing and being violent towards eachother. They eventually split up and I went to live with my dad, he was unhappy and violent towards me, he used to say he never wanted me to live with him, that I was a burden and it would have been better if I lived with my mom. After years of physical and verbal abuse, I ended up moving back in with my mom after he stole some of my belongings.

Because of this whole situation, I moved schools a lot as a kid so I never got the hang of making or keeping friends. I'm shy and have always been bad at small talk. I think this makes me appear aloof or at least hard to approach and I have difficulty maintaining social relationships because of that.

In my teens I still didn't fit in, this was difficult for me and didn't help my self esteem. I saw people around me in school going to parties and getting into their first romantic relationships, which I've never experienced. I desperately want to experience what love feels like. I would love to meet someone and become romantically involved but truth be told, I don't know any girls, let alone how to talk to them. 

I left school and did a few odd jobs with no real direction in life, I still live with my mom. I've seen schoolmates become very successful and some even settle down and have kids. I am embarrassed that I'm 23 with no romantic experience whatsoever. I wouldn't have any idea where to start or how to intiate or maintain a romantic relationship. Anytime family or friends bring up the fact I haven't met anyone, I do my best to change the topic or laugh it off but it hurts deep inside.

I don't have that many friends and I don't have anyone I could call a close friend. Over the years I tried to convince myself that I didn't need friends and that I was just a loner. I don't really have any hobbies other than video games.

Looking back, I feel like I've completely missed out on some things that every teenager or young adult should experience. They say school is the best years of your life but it definitely wasn't for me. l'll never experience young/teen love you see in movies or go to prom with someone or go to high school or college parties. I've been feeling overwhelmed to the point of tears at the prospect of this recently.

I hope this post didn't come across as too whiny. I understand my problems are small compared to others on this subreddit.






Tl;dr I'm intolerably sad and lonely and I have regrets about how I've lived my life up until now. I feel abnormal at best or a failure or social freak at worst. I realise I need to make changes to improve my life and to be happy.


How can I improve my situation?
What steps can I take to stop feeling so awful all of the time?

So, a little while after posting this we had a mutual breakup. They realized that they had been irrational about everything in our relationship and have put me through an incredible amount of hurt. We ended things on good terms over the phone and felt good about our breakup.

However, the next day, some information came to light. Apparently, they had been misdiagnosed with bipolar in high school (roughly 6 years ago) and prescribed medication for it in VERY high doses. However, what this does to someone without bipolar is makes them have irrational feelings, causes cognitive dissonance, anger issues, and many many other things. The point is that this is 100% an explanation for what they did to me throughout our relationship.

Of course, I acknowledge that they've figured out pretty much every issue in their life and our relationship, but that doesn't take away what happen. We've agreed to not let this change the split up but maybe things could work out again in the future after we both spend quality time in therapy. I saw my therapist for the first time last week (before our breakup), and will see her again In 4 days.

I'm conflicted. I know that there's an explanation for everything now (not an excuse, but a legitimate explanation) and they still take responsibility for their actions, but I can't help but still be scared of the idea of being with them. I don't know what's them and what's the medicine, and it scares me. The only thing giving me any kind of insight is the fact that we almost never fought when they were off their medicine.

TLDR: My irrational combative ex was that way because of a medicated psychiatric misdiagnosis and wants to explore the possibility of getting back together in the future after long term therapy. I don't know what I want.",15Jun2020,1
57,"Originally posted on relationship_advice, posting here as idk how much attention the other post is going to get. 

First, some background context. My parents homeschooled me for most of my childhood, and had me skip a couple of grades in elementary school. I went to a regular high school in my junior year, graduated there at 16, and have just finished my first year of college. My boyfriend is a genius and got let in around the age cutoff, so he's a year ahead as well. We were in the same grade and he has also just finished his first year of college. We started dating at the start of senior year and have been dating for almost 2 years at this point (when we started, I was 15 and he was 16).

He grew up in Canada, and I was born in the US, so by the time we started dating we were exclusively applying to universities in these countries. As the months passed, we came to terms with the fact that this would be a long distance relationship after high school, and went to separate countries to continue our education. We have been long distance for just over a year at this point. He goes to university in southern Ontario, and me in Washington DC, so there is a fair 500-mile bit of distance between us.

Now here is where the religious parents part comes in. His parents are devoutly Muslim, and always have been (my boyfriend is ethnically Egyptian). Religion is a huge part of their lives, and my bf's 3 sisters and his many extended relatives all adhere to the religious guidelines. My boyfriend realized that he was not Muslim many years ago, but due to us living/going to high school in a very religious Middle Eastern country at the time and a fear of being disowned has pretended to go along with all of the things required by the religion ever since then. He's more open about it with his friends in college, but in high school I was one of maybe 3 people to know that he was actually not religious (he pretended to be a Muslim who does not adhere really to the guidelines to his friends). This is fine by me as I am agnostic myself, but obviously it was a little weird to see him do all of these things to keep up appearances and know it was all fake.

The fact that his parents are devoutly religious has led to us having to be extremely secretive with our relationship. His parents do not know that I exist or even that me and my boyfriend were ever friends in high school. I cannot post anything on social media relating to our relationship save for a private snap story consisting only of people he approves. He does not want his face to be in my streaks when I'm visiting or for me to show clearly that I'm at his house. Most people in our grade in high school knew that we were dating, and that was okay as they'd have no reason to contact his siblings (one is older and a university student, the other one is in middle school). I was always fine with doing all of this, because I knew that the situation could be dire if his parents found out for monetary reasons. His parents are generally less restrictive of his actions than most, and are very kind people, but he has no way of knowing how this reveal could play out since no one's done it before. I've reassured him over and over that I understand.

However, being long distance while he maintains this facade has been extremely difficult. He lives in an apartment and previously has had to ""sneak"" me in while I'm on my spring/fall breaks and none of his family are staying with him. It's insanely hard for him to convince his parents to support him for flights to ""visit friends"" because obviously they don't see that as being important enough for him to spend money and time on. I just found out that the Canadian border is still open for Canadians to fly freely to and from the country and was immediately thrilled because it meant that there was nothing separating us anymore... except that he wouldn't be able to convince his parents to support him to fly in the current world situation. With all of these restrictions in place, we have spent exactly 26 days seeing each other in person over the past 365.

The part that gets me with all of this is that me and my boyfriend really love each other. We swear we've found the one and he's been there to support me through some of my darkest moments. He is extremely emotionally intelligent and sweet and fun to spend time with, I love him more than anything else. We know that things are liable to change, but as of now if the relationship keeps being nice we want to stay together through college and move in together once I graduate. He always swears up and down to me that he'll ""come out"" to his parents as soon as he is physically able to... but I'm starting to doubt that and it worries me, since it's caused so much stress and kept us apart from each other for so long.

The primary reason I always saw this as being the case, as I mentioned, was finance. For obvious reasons, my bf does not want to lose his primary method of financial support should the worst happen and he is disowned/loses financial support. He is majoring as a software engineer and getting very good grades along with it, and his university is special in that it has a ""co-op"" program that allows him to alternate work and study semesters. Meaning that, in between each school semester, he will have a chance to earn money working a software job. He has an account in his name with about 14k USD in it, and the rest of his schooling will cost about 36k USD. Taking into account that he has friends in the area to stay with in the worst case, that he will be able to work and earn money, and most importantly that my parents are wealthy and willing to financially support him to get back on his feet, it is entirely feasible for him to graduate with only somewhere close to $10k in loans even if all of that is not enough. In his field, he will pay off this amount in no time at all--the vast majority of people in his selective program, most of which have grades not as high as his, end up with well paying jobs right out of the gate. In addition, I am also going into a fairly lucrative field, and would likely be able to contribute to his payments.

I guess at this point I just want him to choose. He has financial independence within his grasp but does not want to take it. For almost 2 years, I fought my disapproving parents tooth and nail for countless hours just to have them support my relationship and allow me and him to spend time together. It's paid off immensely, as they are now much more accepting of us: they aren't religious, just didn't want me to date before college. I feel like if he will make this promise to me over and over again, and swear he will do anything to have us be together again, why isn't he going through with it? He has a safety net in my parents. We'll get to be together for as much as we want. So many restrictions will be made obsolete. Is he afraid to go through with it? He shuts down discussions about how plausible it would be and just says ""I'm not doing it anytime soon"". This is the only thing in our relationship that bothers me: I don't want to be kept a secret after dating for so long and I don't want us to be kept apart by something fixable. How can I communicate this?

TL; DR: My boyfriend's parents are religious and do not approve of dating. He is now able to be financially stable on his own, but still refuses to come out to them after almost 2 years.",15Jun2020,1

60,"Over the past week I've had an ""identity crisis"" of sorts and realized that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life or any direction I want to go in, and I don't know what to do about it.

A little bit of background: I grew up in an abusive household. My parents were completely authoritarian and I essentially wasn't allowed to have hobbies or interests unless they deemed them ""useful"", and if they were useful I was expected to be perfect at them and/or monetize them. They picked my career path (medicine) and my undergrad degree (biomedical engineering) and the college I went to, which was conveniently less than a mile away from their house. I didn't have a say in the matter because I went to college before I turned 18. I honestly didn't have a say in pretty much anything growing up; I was more of a doll than anything else. My parents even picked the bedspread I had and any material possessions I owned with little regard to anything I actually wanted. 

As you can imagine I had major damage from this and had a complete (inevitable) mental breakdown when I went to college. I dropped out and essentially ran away at age 18. I then spent the next 5 years of my life basically just doing whatever I could to make ends meet, so it's not like I had a bunch of time to figure out what I enjoy doing or choose a career path. I mostly just worked whatever job I could get that paid the best. (I also did a LOT of therapy.)

I'm 24 now, and I managed to get a stable job working in supply chain for a miscellaneous tech company whose contributions (or lack thereof) to the world I fundamentally disagree with. I've worked here for a year, and it's the first time I've had a job that actually paid enough for me to be comfortable. With that comfort has come this sense of anxiety, because I've realized that I do not give a single shit about supply chain or the work I'm doing and I want to do something with my life from a career standpoint that actually makes some sort of difference in the world.

The problem with that is that I have absolutely no idea what I am passionate about or how to figure that out. I've never had the chance to have something to be devoted to in my life. I don't even really have any consistent hobbies. I tend to be into something for maybe a few days to a week, and then my interest fades and I move onto something else. I have a few causes I feel deeply about (child abuse, the effects of trauma and social justice being a few of the big ones for maybe obvious reasons), but in my time working a bunch of odd jobs I've had to face the fact that I'm just not a people person. I will never be able to do community organization or anything like that. It's not that I hate people, it just causes me an immense amount of stress to work with more than a small, constant group of people that doesn't involve external clients.

When I was like 15 and I still had dreams (haha) I wanted to be a professor, and I love to learn pretty much anything. But honestly, I feel like most professors just get stuck in an academic circle and don't make much of an impact, and that's the opposite of what I want.

Because I don't have a degree, I don't really have any useful skills to bring to a field. I've worked so many different jobs that it's not like I've spent a lot of time developing one single skill (or my work in a certain field) either--I never worked in supply chain before my current job. If anything one of my greatest skills is that I am incredibly charming in one on one conversations, and that's what has gotten me this far. I've aced interviews for jobs that I was definitely not qualified for. 

So I'm at a loss. I don't even know where to start to figure this out. My therapist (I am still in therapy) says I should take a bunch of various classes to figure out what I enjoy, but I feel like I need a little more constructive direction than that. And, yeah - I know I'm still relatively young and you could say that I have time to figure it out, but it's important for me to have some sort of goal to be working towards or a direction in life, even if it takes me 10 years to get there. I don't even know where to start just to contemplate what I would want to do, and I know it would be easy to put it off and just continue building a comfortable career in supply chain.

Also, I know that you can make a difference without needing it to be a career, but I do personally need it to be a career. I don't have a lot of energy outside of work to put towards other things and I hate feeling like I'm selling my soul for a paycheck.

Thoughts, advice, etc would be amazing. I'm not necessarily looking for an exact answer (although by all means if you've read this and think you've found the perfect career for me let me know) as much as some direction to start. I've done the google search on how to find your calling, but it's not really helpful when you don't even know what your interests are in the first place.

tldr; I never had the chance to develop passions or interests as a kid, and now as an adult I have no idea what I want to do with my life.",15Jun2020,1

2) if we are going any project we always start and he has to go potty right then leaving the project or the hard part for me to do. 

3) telling me how much I should eat.(I'm not on a diet or anything)

4) says something and then doesn't do it. Or says he didn't say that. 

5) telling me we will have a wedding until his mom said she didn't understand why we needed one and now the wedding is off. It would have been on our 5th year of marriage renewal.

67,"So I was unexpectedly laid off this past Wednesday and it was such a shock. 

During the very short meeting with my manager, he basically just went over the departure process and to be honest I was very emotional as I was still processing everything. I didn’t know what to say or ask. 

Tomorrow I am just planning to email him to acknowledge my appreciation for having the chance to work with him and thank him for being such a wonderful manager. 

But I don’t know what else to include. I loved the job very much so I would certainly go back in a heartbeat, but I don’t know if it is acceptable to ask whether they’d hire me back at some point? 

Should I see if he’s willing to be a reference? Should I ask if he has any contacts or advice in my job search? 

I am kind of clueless when it comes to things like this. But I do need all the help I can get in finding a new job. Especially during a pandemic, and in NYC of all places :/",15Jun2020,1
68,"So I’m kinda unsure whether this is really the right place to ask this kind of question but I’m not sure where else to ask.

I’ll give some backstory, about two years ago I suffered with major depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. The people around me weren’t aware of this as I was generally an emotionally closed off person. During that time I was living with some roommates who up until the day I moved in I had never met before, over the year I lived with them they pushed me to go out more, take care of myself and genuinely supported me a lot. 

Unfortunately due to family reasons I had to move out at the end of the year and my contact with them slowly faded which I don’t blame them for as I had moved 6 hours away.
Recently I’ve come to terms with who I am and can say that I am genuinely happy and content with life. Part of this revelation I guess, I can firmly associate as them helping me to get there. 

Now I’ve been thinking about reaching out to them to basically voice my appreciation, I mainly want to tell them that they helped me through a really difficult period in my life unknowingly and that even though we don’t speak much anymore that I genuinely wish them to be happy as they deserve to be happy in my mind.

The only reason I’ve held off is I’m thinking it will probably be pretty weird for me to send that kind of message after no contact from me now for nearly a year and as we are all young guys they might think less of me? 

I want to know peoples opinion on if they were in their shoes whether they would appreciate that kind of message, or if I would be better off keeping it unspoken.

Just to add on I’m in my mid twenties from the uk, same with them if that helps at all",15Jun2020,1
69,"In order for you to understand, and attempt to give advice, you'll need a little background info. So I'm going to try and say this at detailed yet simple as possible. 


My sister had a best friend (let's call her Maggie) who was like family. Maggie joined us on vacations to Disneyland, sat at my table at graduation, and hung out at our house even without my sister there. At one point, Maggie had a toxic relationship. He was mentally and physically abusing her to the point where she was scared for her life. my sister had moved away, so I was Maggie's rock throughout the abuse she endured. I remember one night Maggie came over and I held her while she cried, and she was afraid to go back home. So I let her stay with me.

Fast forward a week from that night. and maggie would go on to sleep with my boyfriend, who I was in a relationship for 6 years with. Keep in mind, it wasn't the most healthy relationship. But it was still a shock that either of them could do this to me.

Obviously I cut ties with both of them after I found out he had cheated with her. They had actually hid it from me for 2 months. I only found out because her boyfriend told me after she admitted it to him. 

Time has passed now. It's been 3 years. I am in a very happy and secure new relationship. My ex is in the past. And she is now a mom. 

My sister and maggie recently reconnected and it's made me feel uncomfortable and resent my sister. I guess I am hurt that she will spend time with someone who hurt me like that. I don't understand why she would. No matter how much time has gone by.. 

Anyways, can someone give me advice on how to move on? How to be more accepting? Do I confront my sister? Or do I learn to let go of the hurt and give Maggie a second chance.",15Jun2020,2
70,"I am 23 years old and I feel like I am lost. Me and my girlfriend recently broke up and It is hurting me more than I thought it would. She was truly my best friend and we spent every day together. Towards the end of the relationship we would fight often but I sometimes feel like we did this because we were like an old married couple who were together so long you are bound to bicker. This part of my life is bringing me down and I don’t know how to respond. I feel lonely and I don’t even know how to move on or in the future put myself out there again to find love. I am not sure if she was really the love of my life or if breaking up was really something that is best for me. 

When it comes to my job I hate it. The job I have now caused me to have anxiety attacks for the first time in my life. My boss routinely belittles me and try’s to make me feel like I’m worthless. Some of my coworkers are extremely rude to me and do their best to try to make me feel like I’m a pos and I am the cause of the whole branches problems. One employee flicks me off every morning, another calls me a bitch, one just walks by me without saying hello. I come into work everyday and all I have ever done is give people smiles and kindness and I’m not sure why they treat my the way they do. While some people I work with are very friendly, some really make me feel like I’m worthless sometimes. One coworker only talks to me when he wants to criticize me. They don’t think it bothers me but it does. Every day it gets worse and worse and I’m almost to the point that I don’t even want to go to work anymore. This job just makes me feel very worthless and I don’t want to be in the position for much longer but I feel like I’m stuck.

I don’t know what I want but I know I want to be successful, I want to be an entrepreneur, I want to find true love, and I want to be happy again. I live alone in a one bedroom apartment in a city that the only reason I am here is because the women I thought I would be spending the rest of my life with lives here. I haven’t been had sex with in other girl In 2 1/2 years and I don’t even know how to make myself even get to that point. I tried talking to other girls but I feel nothing. I don’t even feel excited to communicate with other girls. I try to keep moving forward. Working out, learning adobe photoshop, reading, writing, listening to podcasts are some things I do to try to move forward but I still feel stuck and these only do so much. I feel like I’m in a time in my life where I am supposed to feel like this and this has happened to multiple people. Like I’m supposed to have no idea wtf it is I want out of this life, but I really want to figure it out. If no one respond to this that’s fine I just wanted to get this off of my chest.

He’s going across the country and we’ll likely never see each other again. Quarantine has been rough but it still hurts a lot and losing my best friend is something I’m really not looking forward to even tho it needs to happen for both of our well being. I don’t have a job and was already looking to change fields cause I hated my job anyways. No friends really. So I’m completely starting over. I need to get therapy and I need to look I to going back to school and figuring out what job I wanna do. I’ve also been struggling with my sexuality, which is probably another reason for my boyfriend and I falling apart. I stopped talking. It’s already been hard for me to open up to people but he told me I complain too much. So I didn’t tak so much maybe cause of that. But he still told me I complained or bitched all the time. Maybe I do. I’ve had a hard life filled with chronic depression and it’s not easy for me a lot. I have a lot of anxiety and when people are negative towards me I shut down. I don’t know how to handle it. I’m trying to work on it but it just feels like a lot has piled up. My boyfriend told me last week too that he thinks I’ll never be happy.

77,"To start off, I know that all of thoughts I’m about to explain are irrational and selfish. I don’t want to feel this way which is why I’m posting here. 

I (F24) left home about 6 months ago because of family issues and in the process I had to leave my cat behind. I’ve moved from place to place and couch-surfed quite a bit in those 6 months and I knew it wasn’t fair to bring her along for that. However, my family adopted her when I was about 11-12. From the very beginning, she was my cat. She would follow me around, she was shy and skittish but was never afraid of me, I was the only one who could cuddle her, etc. And while I struggled with family issues while I was still living there, she would always be in my room and she was always so comforting to me. She was my baby, and I know it sounds silly but I really love her like she’s my baby. Leaving her behind was so hard but I knew that I couldn’t take her and I couldn’t stay in that environment either. 

Now, six months later, I have a boyfriend (M34) who I’ve been with for a few months. However, quarantine definitely seems to have fast tracked our relationship. He shares a house with his parents and sibling because his parents would likely not be able to afford the cost of living without him and his sibling. They invited me to stay with them at the start of the quarantine so I wouldn’t be alone and I’ve since been invited to move in indefinitely. 

I LOVE his family, they are all so kind and welcoming to me. I especially have a great relationship with his mother, and in the months that my boyfriend and I have been living so close to each other (and sharing a bedroom) we’ve had some arguments and tiffs but our relationship has never struggled because of it. We learned quickly how to communicate with each other and I really feel like it’s been going amazingly. 

So, recently, I asked what he would think of me taking my cat and bringing her here with me. I’ve been going through a lot of emotional stress and have been since I left home, and I can’t help but feel emotional every time I think of her because of how much I miss her.

Although he is somewhat allergic to cats, he said he didn’t mind and would take allergy pills if needed because he knows what a huge loss this has been for me. 

But because he lives with his family, the whole family would need to OK it. His mother ended up saying “no” because of the allergy aspect and because the family currently has a small dog. And even though he’s small, he’s a nutcase and goes berserk over every little thing and has also tried to attack me a handful of times since I’ve been here. I tried the idea of just keeping her in our room and having a gate at the bedroom door but they said the dog would know she’s in the room and would be freaking out all the time about not seeing her. So basically, it can’t happen. 

I totally understand why they said no and I’m not angry at them but the thought of never having my cat again is devastating to me. And I know as long as she’s alive, I’ll be thinking about it. And when she does die, I can’t stand the thought of not being the one that’s there for her. I just don’t know how to make peace with this. 

It’s been hard for me already, having limited freedom because like I said, decisions like that need to be OK’d by the entire family because we all share the house and his mom has a lot of health limitations. Sometimes it makes me wish that my boyfriend and I could just live on our own and not have to worry about things like this but he said he could never leave them to pretty much fend for themselves because he knows they wouldn’t be able to so he has to stay to help them. 

And again, I totally get it and I don’t disagree. And I know this makes me sound selfish, but I just feel like it really puts a strain on the relationship sometimes. He’s so important to me and I do love his family so I deal with things usually but for some reason, this- not being able to have my baby with me- is really messing with me and I don’t know how to get over it.",15Jun2020,2

85,"Brief backstory: My mom and dad have been married for more than 20 years. They do not love each other. They fight constantly. However, sometimes it seems like they at least respect each other. So there’s that.

Last night, I was sitting down near my dad (his computer screen was facing me because I was kinda behind him, watching tv) and I noticed a weird chat thing on his screen. So I literally just glance at the logo, trying not to miss the movie that’s playing, and it says Match.com. 

He was texting two women. Over the years I’ve had brief wonders if he has 100% faithful, but I never put any real thought in them. This is... shocking. My father is an extremely moral person. I can’t believe he would do something like this. But I saw it clearly. I even checked to make sure the logo was the same on laptop format. It was. He was on match.com, definitely, talking to two other women. 

My mother is the strongest person I know. She is kick ass. I love her and I would do anything for her. So I decided to not make any impulsive decisions. 

I went up to her and asked her to schedule an appointment with a therapist. To get professional, confidential, advice. I think that was the right decision. I have been suicidal in the past (not to my parents knowledge) and am recovering from a second episode of depression and suicidal thoughts. This is causing me extreme distress. I am 15. I usually was the person to mediate arguments between the two of them but this... this is a different level. This is infidelity and is strictly their relationship. I understand that.

But she’s my mother and I love her very very much. The thought of hurting anyone makes me burst into tears. Does using a dating site even warrant it as cheating? Do I tell my mother and risk their marriage? Or do I confront my father, with no concrete proof besides what I saw, and give him a chance to come clean? Should I go by whatever the therapist says, or by instinct? 

Please help. I am conflicted and I’ll have to wait with this knowledge weighing me down until Tuesday, at the appointment.

So I am a film student who is about to graduate and where I live filmmakers need a secondary job to earn their bread and butter and thanks to Coronavirus there we are entering a recession and everything is at stop.

Now to my story.

I have known this indie filmmaker who has been a source of inspiration for me and she asked me to assist her on a number of web series and short films and she was paying me a heavy amout before the Pamdemic but those projects never went into production because the investors pulled out and I was bummed but not three month in quarantine she approached me again with another offer she wants me to Assist her in a small Webseries that is going into production soon (during the pandemic) and she told me that the crew is real small so I agreed to do it just to build my portfolio.

Okay so she added me the in WhatsApp group and I saw the people I was gonna work with but a few days ago she added more people in that group and introduced them and I found out that a guy named let's say D B is also part of the project now me and D B we have history.
D B was dating one of my best friends and she was so in love with him but then something happened they broke up and my friend was depressed even attempted suicide and after few days she met me told because almost everything.

But then few months ago she opened up and in detail wrote what happened between them.
In short that guy raped her
Got her drunk enough to exploit her and after that ghosted her, manipulated her and told her he doesn't love her anymore and is back with his ex (a total asshole move).

So now before accepting this job I didn't know that this guy would be also part of the job and now we are going on the floor (set) in a few days and I can't back out and I am afraid that after doing this project my relationship with my friend will be changed in a bad way.
Also: No one should lose their income no matter what they did they should be punished for their crimes.

PS: Being a filmmaker in Pakistan is really hard and you can't earn you bread and butter. The monopolization of the film industry at the hands of few corporate giants is the reason for mass unemployment, low wages and exploitation in this industry.

I am thinking of doing this project to earn some money coz everybody needs money and to build my profolio and if I back out now this person who has offered me jobs multiple times won't ever ask me again I am risking my life and the lives of my loved ones (CORONAVIRUS IS ON PEAK) and my relationship with my friend just to earn money and build my career and I feel like total shit but we live in a society.

They are so loud and so annoying. I can’t do either of the two obvious suggestions: approach them and ask them to stop, or call the cops. Yes fireworks are illegal in my state but I live in the worst part of the city and approaching the neighbors could get me shot kill knifed screamed at my car vandalized etc. Calling the cops is pointless.

97,"My friend was in a very toxic relationship for almost three years with a really strange dude. We went to school together K-8 and he was always really quiet and a good boy if that makes sense. From what she has told me, he is not a very good boy anymore. He was very against just having regular sex because of his own personal reasons, but saw no problem with anal stuff. He told her that’s what he wanted, she told him she didn’t want that, and he pressured her into it. Not long after that she left him. Not long after that, she told her mother what he did to her. Her mother is so disappointed in her, but she feels like she was raped. I am 100% on my friend’s side. My friend hates her mother’s guts at this point. What advice can I give to my friend to help fix the relationship between her and her mother? It kills me to see her so unhappy.",15Jun2020,1
98,"Quick background, I recently bought a cheap tablet online as I wanted a device that I could run android apps on. The tablet has been fine for the most part, works pretty good for the $12 or so I spent on it. Except recently it's been acting pretty weird. Randomly it will play this shrill screech sound. I thought it was a sound effect of an app or some shit like that but I have always kept the thing on mute and it occurs no matter what app I'm playing and even when I'm not playing at all. I know for a fact this isn't the charging noise or what not because the noise sounds completely different from that + it's a shrill screech. not something I would assume to be used + from what I've seen nobody else has reported this sound. It's been happening every night from 1am-5am and I am unsure what to do. Maybe it's nothing and I'm overreacting but I think the previous owner might still have access to the tablet SOMEHOW and is using it to scare the crap out of me in the middle of the night.

I'm going to try to record it happening in the act but since it happens at complete random (usually while I'm sleeping) it seems unlikely I will. Any advice on how I can check and see if someone has access to my tablet. I hate the idea of being spied on.",15Jun2020,1
99,"For context: 

 I am 16 (M) years old, I have in mind to go to another country to study at 18 (university) and most likely I will be far from her when I leave but we will be able to meet during breaks. 

We dated for 8 months and now that school is over (9th june) our communication that was quite common (we were from the same class) is slowing fading away. 

We are going to be in different classes because of different courses and in my country the preparation begins now. 

I am afraid of losing her but I also have that feeling that I will continue to lose part of my adolescence if I hold on to someone who doesn't treat me as well as I treat someone else. I never did anything wrong that offended her, I was always very supportive in everything she did, and she also helped me. But now it stopped I recently noticed a lack of interest in her part, I usually start the conversation and I try to continue it but it gets difficult because she always says things ""my day is always what you know"". It is difficult and I am afraid, she is the most important person for me, but her actions hurt me.",15Jun2020,2

101,"I bought a dress for an event that was canceled due to COVID. Under normal circumstances I had a 14 day return window. I picked up the Dress on February 26th  so that would make my return date March 11th. 
COVID happened and the stores closed. 
Within a week or 2  my friend notified me she was canceling her event. I immediately contacted them. Only way to contact them is via text which is super frustrating, their phone lines auto direct you to text and then hang up. 
After getting in contact they say it’s absolutely not an issue (Late March , and I have these texts) and that I should be able to return my dress on the expected opening date of April 3rd. 
Obviously things get worse and it’s moved to May 15th. This entire time I’m keeping in contact and they say it will be totally fine. The store ends up opening finally this month on the 3rd. I text again to be sure that I will be able to return via text with a rep because the store was supposed to open on the 1st and when I got there it was closed and said there will be no returns for pickups before the 15th of March and I only have 14 days form opening which will be this coming Wednesday June 17th

I notify the text rep I had picked up my dress prior to the date posted on the building and would it still be ok to return? She said absolutely no issue. 
I call the store as well. First girl I spoke with was very very rude and said ABSOLUTELY NOT , she made it very clear it was not going to happen and I could only do an I store exchange.

I was upset because I had been told I could return and I had $200 in this dress I did not need and right now the money was more needed. I literally picked it up and it has sat in the plastic in my closet.
Anyway I text the reps again and they said AGAIN absolutely no issue at all that the policies have changed and I can return and ask to speak with the manager. If she doesn’t complain ask them to call the district manager 
I call back to the store and it’s later to see if the manager would be around. This girl was very nice and she told me the manager was leaving but after explaining again my situation NO PROBLEM come down tomorrow

I come first thing in the AM and the manager now I think who I spoke with the first time I called  said ABSOLUTELY NO WAY. I could see she didn’t even want to deal with me. I showed her the texts and she was super dismissive and rolled her eyes when I said well can’t you ask the district manager. 
I knew she wasn’t going to be doing me any favors and I’m not confrontational so I asked her what my options where. She said in store exchange only. I said I can’t get like a gift card or store credit because they have a lot more options online and she said no... in store exchange only which was stupid because I overhear others there and they had to make an appointment and couldn’t even look around or try on things (which is be hesitant about anyway) or even browse due to COVID. Needless to say I brought the dress home

I’ve tried emailing them twice , messaging them on FB they tell me to text or email. (With the texts of multiple reps saying it can be returned) I was told a week ago now a manager would contact me in 48 hours and they never have... now it’s been three days since I reached out again. Every time I bring it up the reps stop replying. I don’t want this stupid dress!!
I want my money back, I don’t want to be forced into buying something I don’t even want to use the money within a certain amount of time.

I had a fallout with this friend too not because of this but everything’s been stressful and it honestly is upsetting to even look at. What are my options to return or what can I do? I looked on BBB and as some

We spent the night together a little less than a week ago at her family's beach house but we didn't get intimate because ""the house was too full"". I was kinda taken aback but obviously I respected her wishes since she said she felt weird (family members in the room next to us, the room below us, etc.). I invited her over to my house tomorrow since no one was home. She was happy to come over but texted me tonight saying she is on her period. Am I being paranoid or is she making excuses to not have sex?",15Jun2020,2
104,"Hello everyone, I simply need some help. So first off, I am going to give you some information, then say the story, then say what happened today. Then please comment what I should do from here.

Information: I turned 13 in September, and am a Male. She is a Female and turned 12 in October. We do not go to the same schools and are both year-round swimmers. We were on the same swim team until August 2019. I started crushing on her in January 2019. Then in Summer 2019, I knew I had a chance.

Story: So in early July 2019 we started hanging out a lot more at competitions. At one meet I was with her a lot of the time. And at practices she actually touched me a lot not on accident. Then at another meet in later July 2019, it was in another swimming region so it was long drive. I had family who owned a house right next to the pool that the competition was at. They were on vacation and let me (with my mom and little brother who drove me there and watched the competition) stay there for five days. The competition was four days long. So basically after the first day of swimming she came over to the house to chill after a day of swimming. My family had a pool in their backyard and my little brother, her little sister, she, and I all swam in there for three hours straight. Afterward my fingertips were literally green. During the swim, we were together and had tickle fights in the pool (please don't judge me). And later once we dried off and went inside and watched YouTube. I brought my sleeping bag and was laying down inside and asked her if she wants to join me. Surprisingly, she came inside and we held hands and hugged. It could have been the best day of my life. Then the other three days of the competition we hung out a ton again. Examples: we massaged each other (please don't judge me), we walked around the city together, we took selfies together, we had a lot of meals together, and so on. Then the next swim meet was in early August 2019. It was kind of like an All-Star meet. Only some of the fastest swimmers in the region were invited to go. It was in Oregon, USA at the time. So we had to travel on plane to get there with the other swimmers. No parents came. The chaperones made boys in separate hotel rooms and girls; which wasn't unexpected. We sat next to each other on the bus though. One time she leaned on my shoulder and these two girls saw and laughed at us. I wanted to kill them so bad. So we hung out a ton and at the end of the competition there was a fun day at this place. So I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend officially. After annoying pressure and annoying other kids, I became a wuss and didn't ask her out because apparantly, I thought to myself, I didn't like her anymore. I pulled an all-nighter the night before the plane trip so I was half-dead during TSA and during the plane. I fell asleep. She took pictures of me on the plane. I thought it was kind of funny. She was in the seat across of the aisle on the plane. Anyway, the next day I regret everything. I realize I made a stupid mistake and should have asked her. So then I text her and say what I thought. And it got very awkward. And so since then I haven't really talked to her and it has been very awkward.

Currently: A couple weeks ago my mom sings ne up to this exercise with my coach and I know she is going to be there. I try to look good and everything and it was still awkward. I planned on talking to her but the parents were watching us the whole time. I went to the dryland the next week and last week too. Today, I texted her that I missed her, have changed, am so sorry for not asking her and being a wuss (it was pretty long). All she replied with was that she doesn't like me anymore, we are still friends, and it was rude of her to not talk to me at the recent exercises. I was so heartbroken today even though I probably should have been a long time ago. I want to cry and do not know what to do now.

Question: After all that has happened and you have read this story, what should I do now? Should I keep trying to get her? Or should I let it go? I have absolute no interest in any other girl I know. We are going to the same high school but will be two grades apart. Please help me I need advice. I can reply even more details to a comment if needed. Thank you so much!",15Jun2020,2
105,"To preface this question: When I was a teen I went through a low key gender identity crisis. I wasn't sure I identified as female. I didn't feel 100% comfortable with being female, but I still loved dresses and pretty things, but I was also into menswear and boyish activities. I actually dressed pretty simply at that time, men's shirts and jeans, but I would also wear like chunk heel boots that were like 3-6in. It was a weird time. But through all that, I discovered that I ultimately didn't care what gender I was. I guess people would call me gender-fluid? I've never really thought too much about it to put a name to it. Some days I feel more masculine, some days I feel feminine, and some days I feel neither.

So onto the question: Because of my not feeling like any particular gender, I've always maintained that I just don't actually have a pronoun preference. I honestly think caring about pronouns is a little silly, but I still respect that it matters to people.

Lately, though, I've begun to worry about it. For example, I started a new DBT group and the group leader asked us to introduce ourselves and tell our preferred pronouns. When it got to me I was honest and just said ""I have no preferred pronouns, you can call me whatever you'd like"" and I didn't really go beyond that. But after my group appointment, I was kind of sitting back and it occurred to me that that might come off as pretentious? And also like my not having a preferred pronoun was somehow transphobic?

I don't like to wear those preferred pronoun pins because I don't have a preferred pronoun, but I know people have said that when more people wear those pins, it's better (and maybe safer?) for the trans community to wear them. As a way to normalize them.

So should I just pick a pronoun instead of just being like, ""I don't care what you call me!""?",15Jun2020,1
106,"So when I left high school I initially went to one college. I loved it there everything was great except for one course. I wanted to drop it and take a different one for a year because my teacher (of said course) said it had been done before in previous years. However my tutor told me that the idea was impossible and I had to just stick with my course choices.

The issue with this is, I was so incredibly shit at this course that if I had stayed with it, it would've ruined my grades for trying to go to a decent university. 

So I dropped out and reapplied to a second college. And things were going pretty alright except I took a different course as a place holder but I hate it. And since quarantine I've realised just how bad I am at it. I feel like if I stay im going to fuck everything up again. 

So now I want to go to YET ANOTHER COLLEGE and I feel like that's risky. One because I'm going to have to take courses all over again and I'm also worried they'll be like ""you've dropped out twice there's no fucking way we're having you""

I really need advice if this is a good idea or if I should just stick out another whole year with what I've got.",15Jun2020,1

110,"So I'm not sure this is the place for this exactly, but I'm not sure where else this would go.

So for years I've vented my anger by writing. It started in middle school where bullying and beatings led me to writing those ""letters that you don't send"" things that you sometimes saw on sitcoms. It was therapeutic: I could let out everything I wanted to say without confronting the aggressors and risking further pain. Telling teachers and counselors didn't do anything, if anything it only seemed to encourage the bullies because aside from a stern talking to or an occasional detention, they never received any repercussion for basically putting me on suicide watch.

As the years passed, the bullying kept going and writing the letters stopped helping, and by sophomore year I had given up on the letters and just kind of accepted that the next three years until I graduated would be hell. When I was 17 or 18, I got super into the Ms. Marple series by Agatha Christie, which led to kind of an obsession with murder mysteries in general. I binged any movie based off of books by Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Mary Roberts Reinhart, I watched Murder She Wrote whenever it was on television, I cleaned out the school libraries mystery section, if a story had a corpse found in a British countryside, I was all over it.

And then, it happened. During lunch, one of my longtime tormentors dumped ketchup into my hoodie and then flipped it onto my head. I had ketchup in my hair for the rest of the day. The bullies only got a stern talking to. Didn't even get detention. When I got home, I sat in front of my computer and wrote. And wrote. And wrote. By 11 p.m. that night, I had a ten page short story where a tormented boy hunted down and murdered his three aggressors before being outed by an amateur detective who then has to wrestle the boy to the ground and break his leg before the police take him away. And I felt better.

So that's how it started, and it's continued for years now. Whenever someone pushes my last nerve, I create a character about them and kill them in a short story. I never use the exact person, I change their name, their appearance, sometimes even their gender, and always push the clock back to like the 1920's or 30's. But the story is always more or less the same--victim is a douche to 4 or 5 people, SURPRISE they're murdered, and then a detective goes through the suspects and finds which one is the killer. I feel I should point out that I NEVER MAKE MYSELF THE KILLER, but my frustration is used as a motive for why so-and-so MAY have wanted to kill the victim. 

I have a huge collection of short stories on my computer now, each written after a major blow in my life. Big fight and break up with lousy exe? He's in a story. Brother's wife blindsides him with a divorce and destroys his life? She's in a story. Karen hits me when I'm not doing my job fast enough? She's in a story. Snobby college professors, smug cops, entitled brats, corrupt politicians, I've written over two dozen short stories over the past five years, all based on people who just royally piss me off.

I recently thought of maybe trying my hand at a full length book, maybe getting it published, so I shared a few of my stories with close friends and family to get their opinion. A couple asked how I come up with the stories and I admitted it was a coping mechanism to deal with my problems without confronting the person or making a scene. And now they're telling me that's not healthy and I should look at other coping techniques, or one person even suggested therapy.

So now I'm a bundle of nerves because I feel like I'm not right in the head. Is this unhealthy? I would never act on these stories, they aren't blue prints for how I'm going to go on a murderous rampage. And it's not like I write a story every time I get angry, like I've never written a story after arguing with my family or a disagreement with a coworker, it's only for when I'm outright furious with someone. Even then, I've scrapped several stories just because I've simply stopped being mad at them or forgiven them. But I do admit, when someone tries my nerve, it's almost become a habit to just start plotting how I'm going to murder them on paper. I mentally go through ways to kill them, wondering if they should have something slow like drowning or a quick and clean bullet? And I'll spend days or even weeks on these stories, but once I put the last period on the last sentence and reread the whole thing from beginning to end, I just feel so at peace.

So...is this unhealthy, reddit? Should I seek some other way to vent? Anyone do anything similar?",15Jun2020,3
112,"I work as a restaurant host and it’s my very first job (I’m 18), so there’s a lot of social stuff I still need to learn. 
Part of my job is to assemble to-go orders and hand them off to people. A customer came to pick up his order and asked for a lot of sauces, so I was preparing them at the counter in front of him, and he was going off about several of my coworkers to me (remarks about how the manager is such a dick, is the server always this mean, etc..) The entire restaurant was insanely busy so the people he talked to on his way in directed him over in a hurry, which I guess he didn’t like. Since I had a mask on and it was a bit loud, I got away with a bit of shrugging and apologizing, and he tipped me (hosts don’t usually get tips, and to give me one at this stage of the transaction was strange) then left.

I never thought I would be writing something like this.  My mom (58) has abused alcohol for years- I would feel uncomfortable labeling her an alcoholic because she does not drink everyday and does not need alcohol to function. But I may be mistaking and she could very well be an alcoholic and I’m in denial...

Quick background:
Financial issues- always 
My oldest brother passed away from cancer-1995
Had an erupted placenta at 7 months pregnant- baby died- year before I was born- 1992
Divorced from my father after 33 years- 2013
Became a nurse late in life- 2017

We have had incidents with her drinking in the past and her behavior was very poor- however my older brother and sister in law (who’s father is/was an alcoholic) just had their first child. They were over today to our house (I live with my mom and her soon to be husband- who’s a great guy, but doesn’t put his foot down with her at all) and my mom was already drunk by 2pm. She knew better than to ask to hold the baby as she could barely walk. But I got the phone call that I knew would come one day and that they no longer feel comfortable leaving the baby with her alone. 

She’s been getting sneaky with her alcohol intake lately and it’s becoming more of a concern. And if you confront her- she will deny it. My brother and I spoke for over 2 hours after they left today and decided we will talk to our soon-to-be-stepdad first and then all discuss this with her later this week. 

Any tips on how to handle this situation? 

I don’t believe she needs rehab but definitely needs counseling. Would AA be an appropriate place to start? 

I would move mountains to help my mom but I know I can’t want this more for her than she wants it for herself. Thank you for reading this and for any advice or experience you can share.",15Jun2020,2

I have always been a careful planner because I want things to go perfectly so it's hard for me to make an important decision like this when so many things can go wrong. I always find the negatives about any major I'm interested in and focus how it won't work out for me.

124,"Long story short, my sister thought I was mad at her. Instead of confronting me about it in a mature way, she decided to make aggressive comments about me in front of my family and walked away like it was my fault. This sent me into a panic attack so I hid in the bathroom, while she was texting me and telling me I was making my mom anxious, basically implying I shouldn’t have left the room after she did.

I haven’t spoken to her all day because the thought of it makes me anxious. I honestly don’t believe she’s a bad person and I’d like to repair my relationship with her. However, I’m afraid of confronting her about the comments she made about me because I have a feeling she’ll either victimize herself or be aggressive towards me again. 

In the past, we had an incident like this where she made an aggressive comment towards me and she belittled me when I started avoiding her. When this happened, she texted and said I should’ve just confronted her for the aggressive comment. 

I want to confront her again about the aggressive comments she made last night, but I don’t really know how to go about it. I don’t want her to take it personally, but I want to stand up for myself and let her know what she said really hurt me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",15Jun2020,1

126,"So in senior year of high school and through my gap year I became best friends with a girl, later on through our relationship I started to believe that she actually disliked me and that she only hung out with me out of pity due to my ""severe mental disorder"" which I had never been diagnosed with. At the time I had no clue if I had some mental disorder or if I was just plain stupid or what but I was fully aware that something was up in my brain and it's prevented me from developing any form of self esteem. I hated myself and couldn't see why anyone would actually choose to be around me because I couldn't fathom the idea that people felt differently towards me than I did.

Anyways in our first year of college I decided that she did in fact that me but she couldn't bring herself to cut ties, so I did it for her. I stopped messaging her, she didn't message me either as I had grown pretty closed off from her in person. 

Two years later I dropped out of college and got diagnosed with ADD, a couple symptom of which is low self esteem and the knowing that your brain doesn't work quite the same as other people, hence the assumption that I was mentally handicapped.

Now I've been on treatment for a year and I was just thinking about her and how shitty I was to her. Should I message her, even though it's been 3 years? Should I apologize? What do I say?

tl;dr: due to undiagnosed ADD I cut ties with my best friend because I thought it's what she wanted. Now my mental health is no longer in shambles, should I apologize?",15Jun2020,2
127,"I (16F) have friends, 3 to be exact. One of them I can’t stand, because she constantly puts me down and gets angry at me for tiny things, one of them I’ve known for about 12 years but I don’t trust her at all because she’s mean behind her other friend’s backs, so she’s probably mocking me behind my back as well, But she’s fun to talk to and I don’t think she means any harm. And then there’s my last friend who I really like, she’s funny, we like the same things, and she tells me everything about herself. But it’s like I’m incapable of doing the same. If she’s sad about something she’ll text me and I’ll do my best to cheer her up. If she needs advice, I’ll give it. I’ve shared her highs and her lows, but I never find myself able to share anything about myself. If I have a problem or I’m upset about something I just hope that it goes away, or if I want to tell somebody something I just don’t.

My mum, when she split with my dad started coming to me with all of her issues. I’ve hugged her while she’s cried. I’ve told her everything’s going to be okay and that we’d be better off just me and her, I’ve reassured her when she gets upset about not being able to spend time with me anymore.

My friend who talks about others behind her back talks to me about everything. I’ve consoled her about her parents marital issues, I’ve let her cry on my shoulder too many times to count, in the middle of the night or early morning if she texts me asking to talk I’m right there. 

My friend who puts me down comes to me with everything. When her grandpa died I was on call with her for hours, and I checked in almost every day for weeks after and let her unload on me. When she had a breakdown in school I skipped class with her and sat with her in the music rooms because she’d be embarrassed if people saw her cry. 

Whenever I talk to any of these people about any of my problems, even briefly to test the water, they dismiss me or laugh it off. Except for my mum who just starts crying and blaming herself when I briefly mention that I’m not 100% happy and satisfied with my life.


All of these relationships, are purely one sided. And I know it’s my fault, but I don’t know how to not be like this. I receive comments on how put together I am, but I’m like that metaphor about the duck and how it’s legs are going absolutely nuts below the surface. Some days I just want to disappear, I feel like nothing I do is good enough, and that there’s no point in bothering when I have no good future ahead of me.
I’m sad and I miss my dad and I don’t want to spend 90% of my week alone in an empty house eating microwaved crap and watching shitty tv while other people are making something of themselves. A little less than a year ago I spent a week researching different methods of suicide, before deciding that It would upset my mum too much and It would be selfish of me.

I want to be able to talk to people. I want to talk to my friends, I want to talk to my mum, I want people to listen if I tell them how I feel, I want them to offer me advice and tell me it’s all okay and that they’re there for me. Any time I go on reddit looking for advice I’m told to talk to somebody physical, and they make it sound so easy, but whenever I bring up my problems or my feelings I’m dismissed or I upset somebody.

TLDR: I don’t know how to talk about my feelings without my friends laughing at me or dismissing me so any tips would be appreciated",15Jun2020,2

Also, very DEPRESSING post that could be a TRIGGER for people SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION OR RELATED ILLNESS OR SITUATIONS. If you are depressed or sad STRONGLY ADVICE DO NOT READ IT.

There's something really wrong with me and i can fix it because i don't what it's and people don't tell me when i ask.

I'm not depressed (not anymore) neither sad (not happy but definitely not sad). Is just i got to a point of my life i can't deny anymore: is me. There's no way that the entire world (not entire but 10 country are a lot) is wrong and i'm right.

And because i don't know how to solve it, now is became really really painfull. And the way i always meet a new person knowing (with 100% sure) that i going to be rejected - and i'm! - just destroyed any structure left in my ego. I feel like i going to a test and i fail everytime.

Just saying i'm not cringe, obnoxious, inappropriate, fanatic, unhygienic (i smell good). I know and respect personal space, i'm unable to been mean and insensitive. Just saying that because people can try to help me saying what can i change. And i don't know what to change.

I just know however is wrong is obvious because people treat me really really bad at first sight. And no.Thats is not paranoid or just me. I'm that kind of person. The natural doormat (that's so depressing and so embarrassing).

So many times people said i should to change. Be more open, more social. But, camon, i always did my best and don't run well.

Been really shy all my life and have a debilitating social anxiety i'm right now pretty well with nearly to zero social interactions. But the few ones fell one by one and each one was sooooo painfull. Good lord. That shit hurts. So i'm going to stop all my social interactions from now one.

People who did that how it is? Is possible to keep yourself sane? The pain of to be alone is smaller than the pain of to be rejected?

144,"I'm 20 years old, have no job experience and no skills whatsoever. I've always been unambitious and not really passionate about anything. I've been living off of a pension for the last couple of years, dealing with some health issues and trying to figure out what I wanna do with my life. Around when I turned 20 last august, I started a tourism course, but soon I realized that it wasn't going anywhere (I didn't really care about what I was learning, I was underperforming, and I realized that there wasn't really much of a market for this). Problem is, I'll stop getting my pension when I turn 21. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after about a semester I decided to quit the course, move to a smaller more affordable city and look for a job. I handed printouts of my resumee all over town, sent a bunch of emails, and even scored an interview. And then the coronavirus hit. Now no one in town is hiring, and in a couple of months I'll lose my only source of income, and I won't be able to pay rent or feed myself anymore. So I'm desperate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a lot of people work remotely, but I don't personally know anyone who does it and I'm not tech savvy at all, so I've never considered looking for an online job, but now it seems like it might be my only option.

145,"As the title suggests. I'll give some context.

My job does me for now, it pays okay and it suits my living situation, but at the same time it's restrictive.

I've internally agreed with myself that I'll stay here for the duration of my dog's life.

I work at a vet practice, where I rescued my dog from, he's got a medical condition and because of this can't be left alone and requires routine medication throughout the day. I work nights and my partner works days so my dog is always safe, gets what he needs and I know he'll always have somewhere to go that will help him if his condition gets outwith our capabilities (my work).

But I don't want to stay here, I'm happy to sacrifice a few years of my life to give my dog the best life he can have. However, the job brings me no satisfaction, frankly it depresses me. There's no chance for improvement or promotion it's just this. Thankfully I don't have to work myself into the ground and I think the fact I get so much time off between work is what makes it tolerable at this point.

Like I said, it pays okay, but not enough to save or learn a new thing (get a house, learn to drive etc.).

So I'll stay here for my dog's lifetime, after that I want to move on but I fear that at that point I won't know anything else. My degree from uni is useless.. I have no goals or aspirations job wise, I just want a job that I wake up to each day and don't dread or scream into my pillow over. I don't want to be rich, but I want to be comfortable and able to improve upon my life; or have the means to.

But, the further down this path I go I worry I'm going to be too far passed a point of change and I don't know what to do.

I can't afford to go back and study and have too many commitments that demand me having an income, so I'm somewhat at a loss.

I live in a 100 yr old house. We just ripped out all the wallpaper and carpet and replaced it with a new coat of paint for the walls and laminate flooring.

After the renos, I noticed that the air in the room was not good. I would be able to smell something and also feel it in my chest. I do have allergies and may be super sensitive to particles in the air. Nevertheless, I can’t sleep there until the air is purified.

Problem is, I don’t know how I can clean the air. I’ve tried putting onions and baking soda all around the room to absorb any odours or chemicals. I’ve opened the windows although there is a window screen that doesn’t fully open the window but still brings in the air. I’ve turned on my Levoit air purifier (my next step will be to change to filter and see if it helps). I’ve clean the ducts. 

Do you have any ideas on how I can clean the air? I’m at a point where I think I may need to reach out to professionals but am trying to do what I can before dishing out a lot more money to have an assessment and treatment for the room. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",15Jun2020,1

154,"Ever felt like you made a mistake, and now the rest of your life will be ruined by it? that’s how i feel right now 

Break ups are very difficult for everyone. But usually, they are justified and needed. Some people just aren’t meant for each other. So why did I break up with the perfect girl for me? I’ve been asking that question to myself for months...

It all goes back to when her and i were very very young. My mother was sick with cancer and her family took care of mine in our time of need. Our sisters were very close friends. Our families had a bond. Sadly, my mother passed, but her and her family stuck around. Her and i went to school together until the fifth grade.

After we went to different schools, we lost touch, but regained it rapidly in high school. We instantly fell for each other. I think i fell in love with her the first time i saw her and she smiled at me. I’ve never seen something so perfect in all my life. 

Our relationship took off faster than anything I’ve ever seen and it was incredible. We had tons of laughter, joy and pure love. It was heaven on earth. 

Things got a bit bumpy a few months in, but nothing we couldn’t handle. As she opened more and more up to me, I was getting a sense of anxiety and mental issues, something I’m all too familiar with. 

For some back story, the girlfriend i had before her had very serious depression and thought about ending her life. She was hospitalized and sent away to a hospital for a month. I’ve never felt so betrayed.

Back to the story, I began to get very concerned, even though i didn’t really have a reason to. Her issues weren’t anything major, but just months before i had a girlfriend in the hospital for it so obviously i was paranoid. But i overcame this as none of her issues were unsolvable. We solved them as a team and grew stronger and I have never loved someone like i love her. Everything was smooth sailing then... until college hit.

Going off to college was the perfect storm for a disaster, and even worse, she didn’t go off to college but rather she commuted close to home, but I went to another state. We were ready to take this on, though, our future together was already planned. We weren’t going to let anything get in the way.

Within days, I become swamped with work, stress and the challenge of learning to live on my own and adapt to a whole new life. But she went home everyday and expected constant attention like it was still high school. I’ll come back to this later but I believe some more information can be used here.

Ever since my mom passed and my dad had to work his ass off as a police officer to provide for us, I became very independent. I grew up learning how to solve my own problems and expected no help from anyone. This is how I still am today. Her, on the other hand, seemed to be completely dependent on me. She came to me with every little problem she had and expected help from me. I didn’t have a problem with this, I loved helping her in any way that I could. This only became a problem when I left for college and had to tackle all of my problems, and what felt like all of hers too.

Obviously I wasn’t solving her problems for her, but she came to me for emotional support over everything and she cried almost everyday. Sirens were going off in my head. I didn’t know what to do. How was i to excel in school, make all these new friends, live on my own and still manage to take care of her from another state? Our relationship became very one sided. Here is me tackling every problem i had and bottling up my stress and emotions, and here is here unloading all of hers onto me. I’ve always been the lone wolf. I take care of myself and don’t expect help. But this was too much. I didn’t let her help in any way, and actually drove her away. I wasn’t able to take on everything on my own.

It got to the point where i didn’t want to talk to her anymore. We were both going through such dramatic life changes, but she was unloading everything onto me and i was bottling up my own problems. As I became more distant, she became even more upset. I just didn’t think I could do it anymore, so I ended it. It only took a month of college to destroy something so sacred to me; a bond that felt like it was meant to last forever.

She was perfect in every other way. I wasn’t the perfect boyfriend either. I never opened up to her about my emotions because I’ve always dealt with them on my own. We were polar opposites when it come to that. She’d share every thought she had when Id hold everything in. But it felt like yin and yang.

After the breakup, it didn’t feel right. I kind of always knew we were meant to be, even though i was stressed out of my mind when i was with her. We reconnected a few months after and she desperately wanted to get back together, but i was unsure. I couldn’t break up with her twice! I was unsure that if when I went back to school after the break, i wouldn’t be overloaded with stress and i didn’t want to be put right back in the same position. 

After that, she blocked me on everything. Her entire family unfollowed me on everything, which I understand, but I’m just illustrating how serious this is. It’s been a few months since this happened, and there hasn’t been a day or even an hour where i haven’t thought about her. She’s probably out with other guys or something, but i do want her to be happy and I did break her heart. So why am i so heartbroken right now? 

Everytime i think of my future life, she is in EVERY scenario i think of. She’s the one. I’m head over heels in love with this girl. But i broke up with her. And she probably despises me for my mistakes. Who can blame her? 

Because of this, I have given up on dating altogether. I’m still only 18, but how could I in good conscience date other girls when I’m still deeply in love with another? But the person I love probably hates me. 

I’m punishing myself for not trying to push through college with her. She wanted to, but I thought it was too much for me. But now that all communication is lost, and I’m looking back on my past, everything I broke up with her for was unimportant in the long run. I wish i tried to communicate more. She’s the love of my life... and I ripped her heart out.

I won’t get over her. It’s not possible. But I don’t deserve a THIRD chance. I’ve done this to myself, and there is no forgiving me. I’ve given up on finding someone else because they will never be her. I don’t know what I’m going to do.",15Jun2020,4

My nephew has lived with me off and on since her death. Her is controlling, verbally abusive, narcissistic, and a complete sweetheart. I know he can't be both. He actually is. When you can strip away the BS he's got a heart of gold. Loving caring funny sweet empathetic fun. But you have to strip it away (only if he lives with you) to outsiders he's funny, helpful and smart.

Now. My great-nephew(J) is a teen. He's hoping to join the military. But. He's truly just a really easy going, laid back, fun kiddo. He looks for the good in others and is trusting. Therein lies the problem.

T&amp;P plan to live together when though they are oil and water because J ""needs to toughen up"" if he really wants to join the military. P who has raised exactly zero kids thinks he's the best man for the job. He who throws a tantrum of you question his logic at all(he over thinks stuff often making a project way more complicated). 

He's going to toughen up J. This will ruin their relationship. I guarantee it will. When around children he'll play and be fun but when he's done you'd be wise to listen or he starts yelling. This will not be good for J.

And then there is the whole he has zero respect for his sister, ""she's stupid, she's a drama queen, she likes making problems, she is too immature"" which is fine except when you are approaching her to live together with no support system around!

So I moved back to the same state as most of my family a year ago, anyways I’ve started reuniting with my cousins and I hadn’t seen this cousins family since about 4 years ago at our grandmas funeral. So anyways we went over to his families house we’re all drinking, hanging out having an awesome time and me and him keep joking around. Well I’m super attracted to guys who can make me laugh so the drunker I got the more I was like getting flirty with him and just getting really into him. 

Finally after awhile we’re outside talking and he lifts me up to sit me on the car so our faces got really close to each other and he tried to kiss me, I pushed him back jokingly and started laughing and we made a joke out of it. So then later we’re on the other side of the car and again I’m not sure how it happened that we got close and we kissed and it was good lmao but it was literally like a small kiss not a whole make out session or anything like that. Well after another little while we kiss again. Again something small nothing to crazy but omg I’m not going to lie I wanted to fuck him so bad and I know he did me aswell. Well anyways he ends up getting into a fight with his brothers cause we’re all drunk af by now so as another cousin is pulling him into the car so they can leave I’m trying to help calm him down too so I sit him in the car and he tries to kiss me again, there where more cousins in the car at this point so we didn’t and no one noticed. So then he leaves and the rest of us and my aunt are all talking and she says awe you and your cousin got along great like when you where little, you guys have always had a cute bond, like you’ve always pulled towards each other. 

Ofcourse she doesn’t know we spent all night trying not to fuck each other and kissing lol so anyways today I woke up feeling horrible about it, I’ve never kissed a cousin before and we’re like old af now so we should know better or idk. And even that bond my aunt talks about it was because since I was so shy he would always try to joke with me and make me laugh so I guess out of everyone I felt most comfortable with him. So now should I feel like a POS person or just let it go as a drunken night mistake? Help me guys.

Ps. So I guess some cousins did end up noticing we had kissed and they’re like out of their mind about it like super pissed and etc. Also he is a first cousin our dads are brothers",15Jun2020,1
158,"So tomorrow I'm an adult. I don't have any friends, never been to a party, never gone out for dinner with some buddies. Never had a girlfriend, never held a girls hand, never kissed a girl, never had sex, never even flirted or gone on a date. When I say I have no friends, I'm serious. I have never had a friend, never had someone over to my house, never shot the shit over lunch, nada. All of this isn't for a lack of trying. I'm quite smart, relatively attractive, I have hobbies, play sports and instruments. I'm anxious socially but push myself to talk to people. People seem to like me, but never want to be a friend. I'm finished high school my graduation is next week, online, socially distanced. I don't even get to say bye to my teachers. The people around me have girlfriends and they go out to parties, go surfing and skiing together. I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. I don't want sex I just want someone to love, someone to hold and just talk with. Before you say the people in my high school are probably just drunk teenage assholes, they aren't. The vast majority of people in my grade are great, cool, talented people. I don't know where I went wrong. When I was a sophomore I told myself it was about how I looked so I cleaned up, got a new wardrobe and got super fit. I used to be insecure about my height even though I'm 5'11"". I've grown out of that stage and I understand that it's about how you act more than how you look. Thing is I act well. I'm kind and empathetic to everyone. When there are group projects I pull my own, but I am not bossy. We did a French class where we described everyone in the class in french anonymously, people said I was funny and sweet. I just don't get it. I feel like I have missed out on high school, and before you say highschool is lame and not worth anything, it sure feels like it matters right now. I'm 18 in a couple of hours, don't have anybody to spend it with. I don't have a party, not that I want one. I was supposed to go to university next year, and I thought it would be a fresh start. Turns out engineering will be fully online. I don't get to go to the campus, I won't be able to live in dorms won't get that experience either. For the next year, I will be sitting in my basement bedroom doing classes online. Won't be starting anew, just sitting here wasting my life. I'm fucking tired. I just want to be around someone.

161,"Apologies for writing so much, it's just that I just need to get this all out and I don't know what is wrong with me or what has been wrong with me since I was a kid. I feel like I have some sort of mental illness or that I'm a defective human and I don't know what to do. I should state that my childhood was technically perfect. I had it all. Loving parents, I went out, I had a lot of toys, had friends at an early age (I'll get to that later). However aside from all that on retrospect my mind was completely messed up and I've been tracing back a very long series of mental issues with me and they go as far back as I can remember. This includes both dark violent and sexual thoughts.  

At what I think was the age of 5 or 6 I used to think about violent things including maiming someone with a saw blade. I had a tendency to think about the worst whenever I saw something dangerous such as a cliff, or sharp objects. I used to think about what it would be like to actually push someone off it or hurt them. I also tended to be a very very low-key sadistic bully to a younger kid at the park. Nothing horrible, but just very mean psychological pranks on him or hiding his favorite toy just to see his reaction and giggling when he started crying. This disappeared and it returned for a brief moment when I was about 11 and I did some very mean things to a kitten that I rather not talk about. This being said I absolutely love animals and everything I did back then I regret. I grew up with pets and still have cats and I can't ever imagine myself doing something like that to anyone at any moment. 

However things get weirder since I remember liking to be tied up, or confined in cramped plastic boxes while naked as early as 5, as well as feeling restricted and not being able to move and while playing with my dad at the same age I once brought up the idea of putting naked people in a room while naked while the walls were closing in slowly. These weird obsessions continued and I remember my dad once jokingly complaining about how I only talked about violence and naked people when I was about 9. Throughout that time period I also started developing a self bondage thing and I'd lock myself in the bathroom and tie myself up for long periods of time even if it meant I had to pee on the floor and then clean it up before anyone noticed.  I also locked myself in extremely narrow places and even tried hanging myself upside down with an extension cord when I was 10.  I need to point out my family was extremely conservative and I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING about sex or any related subjects and I wouldn't have 'the talk' till I was 12.  I also had no access to internet so nothing influenced me. 
At about 13 I experimented with unusual ways of self harm and started becoming obsessed with obscure sexual kinks as I had internet access then. Then suddenly, it stopped. It disappeared. I became a normal person, and have been since around 15. It's like everything went back to normal, and although I have some emotional problems everything is alright. Reoccurring violent nightmares stopped, as well (I forgot to mention the nightmares where I'd get shot or stabbed or chased as well as the abstract nightmares I used to get). I also stopped getting fevers every Christmas as I did for my first 15 years.  

I also want to mention how I was homeschooled my whole life. I used to have a lot of friends as a child but at 7 we moved away to an isolated house in the country where I pretty much interacted with no one other than the occasional relatives for the next decade. The reason for the homeschooling was my parents extreme religious beliefs. I should also mention that I suffered from moderate Tourettes Syndrome throughout my childhood which went undiagnosed. It is still present but it also sort of disappeared when I was 15. The ticks would be both vocal and physical and sometimes slightly harmful.  I never thought twice about these things. But I am now 21 and I'm suffering with depression as well as recently coming out as bisexual and possibly gender dysphoric which has lead me down a dark line of thought about self contemplation. 

I don't know if I have a crippling mental illness or if I'm just a psychopath. I've also had a very scary disturbing thought that maybe I could have been molested at a young age which has made me lose trust in my parents and relatives. Otherwise I don't know what is wrong with me...  
Sorry for the long post but thank you if you've read this far.   I should note that despite all that I am a normal person now and trying to get past all of that, including my suicidal phase. I'm a kind loving person which makes some of the things I said extremely ups",15Jun2020,1

I always hated attention, more then anything. I always was silent, never liked talking much. Talking takes too much effort and gives people an irreversible idea of you. Seems risky. 

However as i am getting older i am starting to realize that silence is an answer too. 

People are pitying me all the time because i was quiet. I have friends but they still pity me, most interaction that i had with them was probably playing games and texting. I am starting to realize i have no actual friends. And when i attempt to talk people always talk over me or start to get shocked. Probably because i dont talk much. always got called the quiet kid

The next year i was trying to talk to people more, i always try to ask them questions and talk to them, After about 6 months in school i thought i was doing pretty good for my self. However when a girl called me the quiet boy i realized that i am still that. I still dont get it i try so hard all the time. I am beginning to realize noone talked to me out of themself, I never get greeted. Only when i greet someone do i get greeted back.

169,"Okay so basically as the title says, I have no idea what I want. I mean I thought I did but now it’s just like things changed. I (F17) broke up with my ex (M17) about 3 weeks ago, I broke up with him because long story short he was looking at my ex friends nudes via her private snap. 

It was at the heat of the moment and I broke up with him that same day I found out, I was beyond hurt (and maybe I should have taken time to reflect first but ughhh I’m stupid). I felt like all the things I did for him went to waste, I felt lied to. How could he do this behind my back when I put my everything in this relationship? To give some context this ex friend of mine and him were fuck buddies, so that’s why it really hit me when I found this out. (I don’t know if this matters but this ex friend had asked out my  ex in the past but he only turned her down, so I’m assuming he never saw himself in a relationship with her. Even before me and him got together I would tease him about him and my ex friend and he’d get defensive and deny the “relationship” he had with her) 

I’ll acknowledge my flaws and that I probably shouldn’t have trusted this ex friend a 100% since she didn’t really show any good evidence and I just took her word (since she had no idea that me and my ex were dating at all, only like 3 friends knew and they all don’t like this ex friend it just made sense). I accused my ex of cheating to which he denied of ever doing and did acknowledge that he shouldn’t have been on her private to begin with. 

Now here’s the thing that’s been stuck in my head leaving me awake at night. I don’t know if I should consider what he did cheating? I mean I guess he emotionally cheated? From what I was told from this ex friend is that they would talk a lot and he’d send her suspicious memes like “this is for the girl with the nicest ass” shit like that, you know? Again she didn’t really provide proof of the conversation, if you count a screen shot of her talking to her other friend about the conversation between her and my ex abt the meme as “evidence”.  But from what my ex has told me is that he would try to shut down her attempts and that all the conversations were always started by my ex friend again he didn’t provide evidence of this. 

So is it cheating?

I’ve been friends with my ex for over two years and I considered him one of my best friends, so when we broke up it took a huge toll on me. I missed talking with him and overall I thought we were better as friends. So we started talking again just like before we started going out. Eventually I invite him to hang out with me and my friend, that goes a bit awkward but it’s nice, next thing you know he’s at my place and I’m putting makeup on him. 

It’s nice, just like old times. 

Things lead to another and then before you know it we’re cuddling and making out. After he leaves my place he sends me a text saying “I love u” and I didn’t know what to say, I was lost. I thought I didn’t want to continue a relationship with him but here we are, what is this? I respond with “Oh wow” and the conversation changes to something else, the days after he sends that text his messages start to lessen. He isn’t really texting me anymore like he use to and it’s weird and it’s confusing me, why is this affecting me so much? Why do I care that he isn’t texting me? We aren’t dating right? 

I don’t know what I want anymore to be completely honest, I was set on not having a relationship with him again but now it’s like ???  

Please help me, sorry if my thoughts all over the place and about my shitty grammar.",15Jun2020,1

173,"Been told on very short notice and without debate that we're moving from remote, back to in-office work this coming week, despite concerns voiced from senior staff (myself included). I've honestly excelled with remote work, personally and professionally, not sure I can go back to the rat race life, and my state's work guidance is that everyone that can work remotely, should work remotely. Additionaly, my girlfriend is considered immune compromised, so we're taking precautions similarly to seniors (a point I've made about why I'd prefer to stay at home). The owner of the company also seems to believe this is all going to blow over any day now, so we're definitely not going to see any real in-office precautions.

The current situation is potentially sort of a catalyst for change; I'm burned out on the leadership of the company in general for many other reasons, but I'm feeling disrespected as a human that we're being asked to come back in as productivity has practically remained the same throughout the shutdown for us.

I suppose I'm weighing the safety of guaranteed income at a time of economic uncertainty vs safety at work, and general discontent with the workplace. My plan A would be to start my own business in the same industry; something I had planned on doing within the next year or so, but with a bit more savings, and not in a time of such economic uncertainty. I've also got savings where I could just take a hiatus through the rest of the year, probably much much longer if I started selling some of my toys/ found a part time or gig job. I'd probably work on my house a lot; I'm hoping to sell/ move soon, and could basically work full time at that as an option as well, then start my business in a potentially more favorable economic environment (or much worse?!). Here's a few of my options as I see them:

1. Stay
2. Jump in head first and start a business
3. Hiatus/ work on my house full time

&amp;#x200B;

the most fascinating thing about life, in my opinion, is its unpredictability.  
we keep planning a future but we don't know whether we're a part of it or not. we continue to worry about things that happened in the past. every day we try to get closer to a destination but we don't know what even is that destination. and the funny thing is that we get so caught up in trying to create a future which isn't even guaranteed to us, dwelling over former events which have left us now, that we forget to savor the beauty of the small things that we have. we entirely forget to be grateful for the only thing that we have - this moment. we are so occupied aspiring to reach a destination that we forget to sit back, relax, and take a look at our journey so far. it won't hurt to sometimes take a pause and stop counting up all the big things that change our life and rather, we appreciate the beauty of those small things that we fail to acknowledge every day.  


learn to enjoy that feeling of comfort and coziness as all your tiredness washes away when you slip under the covers after a long, exhausting day. or the mornings when it's the sound of birds tweeting that you wake up to, not the cries of an alarm clock. the pleasant sound of raindrops tapping the ground rhythmically and the captivating smell of earth just after a rain shower. that crisp evening breeze that takes away all your concerns of the day and leaves you floating on cloud nine. and don't forget to appreciate those nights when you're graced by the beauty of the sky filled with stars that leaves your heart feeling content.   


take notice of all those special things in life that mostly go unseen. be thankful for those little things that make your life so precious. go for your destination but don't forget to enjoy the journey of reaching there. most importantly, be grateful that today you woke up because many people weren't able to do that. life is unpredictable, your tomorrow can abandon you and your yesterday is also gone. all you have is today. live it while you still can because *life is unpredictable*.",15Jun2020,1

I am M20

Behind the anonymity of reddit or the internet in general, I feel fine.  I also tend to do well in specific situations and environments where meeting people is the goal, like orientations.  When it comes to opening up, I tend to go one of two ways: I either say too much too fast, or I say nothing at all and keep people at a distance.

This isn't usually much of a problem, although I'll admit I've found it very difficult to make friends because I'm afraid of deep conversations (or rather, potential backlash from them) and I am awful at small talk.

I've recently found my stride in college, especially after joining clubs and a frat.  But then COVID hit and without an easy-access environment, I kind of went dark.  I haven't talked to or texted my friends from college in months, aside from the times when other people reach out first (which is few and far between).

To make matters a little worse, I've always struggled with girls and relationships.  To date, I (M20) have never had a girlfriend (not for lack of trying), and only recently had sex for the first time.  And a few times after that.  And none of those experiences were pleasant on my end.  I've passed up opportunities to have one night stands because I don't want to have another negative sexual experience, especially when it's ultimately meaningless.  But herein lies the problem:

I don't really take initiative in relationships, friendships, or with women.  It's pretty simple to logically conclude: just text someone, just call someone, but for some reason it feels difficult.  I don't know if it's a lingering fear of rejection or disappointment or what.  I know I'm average looking, I'm considered smart, but for whatever reason I can't approach people and have a normal conversation.  I know practice makes perfect and that I'll get more comfortable the more I practice, but it's hard to kind of take that leap of faith.  I don't really know what to do.

I've talked with my parent about it and they offered to get me a therapist, but I don't really think that'll help.  At the end of the day, that's just someone paid to be your friend, and if you say anything borderline they cover their own ass and either prescribe meds that make you feel miserable (I hated being on anti-depressants) or worse (speaking from experience).  I don't really think I'm depressed either, because I still smile and laugh and I'm able to get work done.  I feel like I have meaning and purpose and I work every day to try to make myself a better person, even if I have to take babysteps.

I just kind of don't know what to do about my demeanor.  If I sit by passively, I feel like I'll just be lonely.  I wouldn't say I'm particularly lonely, I've always been more reserved, but it's kind of hard to work up the courage to ask someone out or run for leadership positions when I hardly take initiative or talk to people.  It certainly doesn't help that I feel like the longer I go without talking to people, the more awkward it will be when I do try to.  But I don't feel comfortable just biting the bullet and giving someone a call.  I'm hoping that when I go back to college and see my friends in person, the situation will resolve itself, but usually when I hide in my shell, it takes forever to get comfortable again, even around people that I know and like.  The same can be said about girls, where I can't really introduce myself, and unless I get comfortable being around them, I'll struggle to start and carry a conversation.  I have this weird dichotomy where I simultaneously feel like I need to control a conversation, but I also hate talking.  I feel like people don't like talking to me because of it.  Honestly, I don't really know the point of this post, it might just be catharsis, but if anyone has any advice, it's certainly welcome.  I just hate this feeling of never being able to take initiative, wishing I had, and then beating myself up because everyone else seems to do so easily without overthinking everything.

He doesn't rinse, doesn't wipe the grease off, just leaves them for later. For example, he ate three times today and there are three knives, somehow four bowls (guessing he used them for cooking) and several other plates/utensils in the sink. I prefer to just wash something then and there if I know I will use it again. I explained this philosophy to him yet he still fills the sink daily and expects the dishwasher to handle dishes with little to no prewash.

How can I tell him he needs to change this behavior? I'm used to having an empty sink with cutlery either drying or being in its place. Am I being unreasonable with my train of thought and if I am, how do I learn to live with it?

tl;dr: My roommate leaves masses of dirty dishes and doesn't prewash them for the dishwasher.",15Jun2020,2
183,"I’ll try to keep this short as possible. I live with 2 other people in a house. The other day I had to go to the dentist and they wrote me up a prescription for Hydrocodone, 10 pills to be exact (I even counted) I never needed to take them because my pain died down quickly the night of my visit. I kept the bottle on the table beside my bed. Fast forward to a few days later I notice the pills on my table and for whatever reason I open to look at them. I notice the quantity of pills has gone down. I pull them out to count and I have 8 pills, meaning 2 are missing. 

I never touched them meaning somebody stole 2 of them out of my room. I’m about to move out soon, next month to be exact. And I’m curious if I should say something or let it go considering I’m about to be out. Two things come into play here: 
A.) obviously stealing narcotics that aren’t prescribed to you 
B.) Going into my room when I’m not there without my permission. 

My sense of privacy has been swept out from me. I know I only have a month left on my lease but I am super fucking frustrated and annoyed. What should I do?",15Jun2020,1
184,"So I'm 26 F, I recently ended things with a dude who was quite insecure about my past because I was his first everything. I know that this was more of a him problem, than a me problem, but it really made me nervous about this sort of thing happening again in the future.

I don't think I really have much of a past, it's mostly normal. Including my ex, I had been with 5 people. 3 of those people were relationships, and 2 were flings. 

I feel like now I can't tell the next person how many people I've been with. I simply do not want to be defined by a number, but I feel like people always want to know about your past. I'm afraid the next person is going to ask me my number, and I'm going to just straight up not want to answer. I'm also Indian and want to end up with an Indian man but there's a large majority that are super judgmental where I almost feel like the answer is to lie about the number of people I've been with. I know a lot of girls who have told their partners they've only been with 1 person or they were virgins when that was far from the truth. I also can't imagine lying though, what is the point of having a relationship founded on lies. Are people willing to accept you not divulging your past? Is it okay if I just straight up say ""I don't want to discuss my past because it's not relevant."" I just don't even know. 

tl;dr Insecure about my number because of my ex judging me and feel like I won't be able to talk to my past to anyone. I think this is ridiculous of course but don't know how to navigate these feelings.",15Jun2020,1
185,"Bit of background, I dropped out of highschool due to medical issues and ended up doing tertiary to get into uni and got into an adv math and comp sci course. 2 years in I had to break up with my girlfriend and move back home due to not having enough money myself, and my parents not having any either. To help out I decided to drop uni temporarily and start working. 3 years later I'm on a 6 figure salary with no formal education except in Networking and Security (both of which are intro certificates).

I've had a side business that I've been working on since I left uni that I started with my ex girlfriend, and am wanting to work on it full time to replace my current salary and have saved up about 40k to put towards it. I was going to take 6 months off to focus on it and see how it goes, if it doesn't work out I was going to go back to university and get my bachelors or go back to working a 9-5.

My parents are trying to force me to not take the 6 months off, rather do university or even ""just do 1 subject, how hard can it be?"". Not to be picky, but 1 subject would be easy, but that's not the point - I'm wanting to do something for myself, without having to do shit ontop of it that makes me depressed on a daily basis.

To top it all off, all I am constantly hearing is ""Look at the fantastic job your brother got because of his degree"", ""you will be out of work soon as grad hires will replace you"", etc.

I feel as if I have never been able to do what I wanted to, and now that I'm finally trying everyone is throwing in a black cloud and trying to reel me back in.",15Jun2020,1
187,"Right so my mum knows I’m seeing someone and things are getting serious; she always been strict but she’s very protective over boys and almost bit my head off when she thought he was coming into the house(obviously I was gonna make him wait outside).

We both know I’m almost 20 so I feel like I should just be able to go and spend a romantic evening with him. I’m just nervous about asking because I know it’s either a flat No or an I don’t approve, I refuse to lie to her and honestly I need a good approach to this to make her acknowledge that I’m gonna be able to spend time with him in a few months when I move out.

188,"Hey guys, so I’m 16M. I have very strict parents but my mom is lenient sometimes. But my dad never is. He’s stuck in the past with the old mentality and he is ALWAYS working around the house, he’s retired. 

I’m a very good respectful kid. Learned the HARD way, every time. But the thing that absolutely bothers me to death is my dad waking me up very early doesn’t matter if it’s school, a day off or the weekend. He wakes me up, then tells me to get dressed and go outside. And you know what that means, doing labour intensive work for a minimum of 5 hours EACH DAY! Also he always pressures me when working with him to go fast or else he’ll get mad or take my phone or console away, even though I’m not doing anything wrong. 

But it gets better, I also have a part time job, and so I go to school, then work then do chores after all that. But the best part is when I work a ton of days and then get that glorious few days “off”. Guess what, next morning I’m up at 8 AM to head outside, in the garage, on the roof, doing hard chores around the house for a lot of hours a day. And that’s my day off, then I go back to work, and if I finish work early I’m back to doing the labour outside or fixing shit with him. I’ve told him many times to just please let me have a day off, like literally. But he says I’m too spoiled and I need to LEARN the hard 1920 way, where all you do is work and nothing else. He says he doesn’t care and if I complain he’ll kick me out despite me never arguing with him and accepting the work every time wether I like it or not. 

He’s always been like this. Even when I was a kid. But he puts way to much pressure on me. I have my own stresses to worry about and my own stuff to do. I never have time to have free time for myself like other teens yet I still try to stay positive even though I can’t. 

He’s never going to change and when I approach him of this situation he thinks I’m threatening him or being rude or disrespectful. Which in turn makes him aggressive towards me and guess what? Outside you go... I also have to pay rent as well. 

Man, idk but if you’ve read this far thank you. I’ve really got a rough life. 😒",15Jun2020,1
191,"I live on a dead end street in low income housing. My neighbors play loud music, ride dirt bikes, yell (swear), drink and smoke in the street, and lately shoot off fireworks (MASSIVE fireworks).

I tried politely asking them to stop. Then I tried yelling at them. Then I tried informing the police. All I want is to enjoy my home for a few hours and get a good night's rest.  

I'm already worried my actions will incite retaliation (in my opinion if you don't think having your 5 and 11 year old out at midnight on a sunday shooting massive fireworks is wrong; then you probably don't think keying a car, slashing a tire, or breaking a window is a big deal.) 

I feel as if I have no course of action in this situation.  Besides fighting noise with noise, I can't think of a way to make them realize how insane they are.  Even then, I would never vandalize or get in a physical altercation but in my opinion the other party would.",15Jun2020,1

193,"I (16M) have always been very close with two of my cousins, one being 9 and the other being 3. The older one has alot of the same mental issues as me, so we can relate on alot, and my autism helps when I'm connecting with the youngest, as it fuels my imagination and helps me make fun games for him. These two kids are like my siblings and I love them so much. It's important to note that the 9 year old has very bad anger controlling issues.

But I'm stuck on what to do right now. About a year ago now, my aunt and my uncle divorced, and my aunt won custody. My uncle couldn't show up alot to fight for his children, as he got a brain tumour and spent alot of time in hospital or resting at home, so my aunt got the upper hand. 

My aunt has always been an entitled jerk. Ever since she joined the family, she's hated me and blamed me for everything that went wrong in her oldest child's (13F) life. She constantly makes me feel bad and plays on my mental issues and personal home issues to get what she wants for her kid. But the truth is, she has openly admitted that she doesn't like her other two. Her daughter is her angel, a basic clone of her, but her sons are less than perfect in her eyes. 

Since the divorce, she's resorted to alcohol and drugs, and gets money for basic survival by sleeping around (my aunt is admittedly quite pretty). Her house is a shithole, with no carpets and stained walls and flooring. There's plates and bowls just laying around, covered in moulding food, and there's even some disgusting forgotten snacks in small cracks everywhere. Her house constantly smells of smoke so strong it gives you a headache if you stand around in it for too long. She'll leave her kids alone at home if she's bored, or she abandons them at my nan's so my uncle (still recovering from that tumour) can unexpectedly babysit while I'm away. Any other times, they're pushed into my arms. All but her daughter, she lets her go anywhere anytime with her friends, never even questioning anything or making her take her phone. Like I said, the daughter is a pampered princess. Meanwhile, when no one can watch the boys, she lets them stay at home and play 18+ games like GTA. While concerning at first, it didn't make me get too mad until they started acting on what they saw. The 9 year old started acting more violent, swearing at people and throwing things at them, and once he even grabbed a knife before I snatched it from him and gave him a talk on why it was wrong. The 3 year old screams death threats at people when he's angry, and when playing with his toys, he acts out murders and assault. It's worth mentioning he's absolutely terrified of helicopters, and whenever he hears them, he bursts into tears and grabs me, crying about how he doesn't want them to kill him. 

Many inappropriate things have been noticed in their house. There was a syringe found in the washing machine (which my aunt claimed was for her homemade tattooing), and she's been caught in the act of inviting strangers in and sneaking them out again on several occasions. She hits the 9 year old whenever he brings it up, yells at the 3 year old if he does, but of course, leaves the eldest alone for it. Now, sometimes the perfect angel does things a typical entitled sibling will do, and annoys her 9 year old brother for all its worth, just so he'll get mad at her, because he's the only one who ever gets punished for it. 

The latest incident hurt me most though. I was hanging out as friends with my 9 year old cousin, when his mother came up to us, grabbed him like he was a stolen toy and she was a child claiming it, and she told me that he wouldn't come out for a few days because she ""doesn't want the sun to damage his brain like his retarded father's"" before dragging the screeching child home. A few days later (yesterday), when both sons were thrusted under my eyes yet again, even during a pandemic, I tried to talk to the eldest of the two about the other day. He told me that she had found out about him telling his friends about how evil she is (his big sister tattletaled), and beat him before locking him in the house for days to teach him a lesson, stopping him from seeing his friends. During the summer, when it's boiling hot. I mentioned telling someone about all this, he begged me not to, because he does still love his mother, and as his dad isn't able to look after the three kids, they would go into care, which they're terrified of. I can't even just yell at her alone, because I know she'll never let me see those kids again, and they need me more than ever now. 

I don't want anything bad to happen, but I just can't figure out what's right, I'm not good at these types of things. Please, what should I do? Do I report her to someone anonymously? Or do I just look after them as much as possible until someone else can take custody? My anxiety is crippling, I can't handle social situations very well, so I can't even just let them stay with me because it'll trigger alot of nervous breakdowns. Please help, and thank you in advance.",15Jun2020,1
195,"So I have a kink. As you can probably guess from the title it’s DDLG. I can help it. It’s such a turn on. The only people who knew were people that I’ve slept with. And just the ones I’ve trusted enough. I’ve never even told my BFF.

So because of a incident that happen a week ago. I transferred to a different area of my company. I was being train by let’s call him Jim. Jim is definitely weird and socially awkward. But not the adorable socially awkward. The socially awkward you just want to run away from. He has no boundaries. Like he’ll burp and fart in front of you. He’ll telling you he needs to go shit. I’m just like I’ve just met you not even a week ago and that’s way TMI. Now it’s a different paperwork then my old department but most of the reports are the same. Except I need to focus on other parts of the reports. So I picked up on it fast. 

By the third day(which was Thursday) I felt comfortable enough that I told him I would work on my own and asked for help if I needed anything. What he ended up telling me was “I’ll decide when you’ll work on your own not the other way around. I’m in charged of your training.” his voice was so strict and deep and commanding. It did unfortunately turn me on. I don’t know how but he picked up on it.

I’m usually turn on when you men give me no argument directions. But over the years I’ve gotten really good at hiding it. I don’t know if my eyes dilated. Did I gasp? Or what happened because we were working on the same desk and I definitely didn’t expect it. I ignored it prayed it would go away.

Friday passed and nothing out of the ordinary happen.  We are usually off on the weekends. But they asked us to come in on Sunday for a few hours to catch up. I’m the new person to the team so I definitely couldn’t say no when everybody else said yes.

We were only behind by five reports and they should take on average two to three hours per person. So we figured we’ll all work one and that last one could be started by the person who finishes their report first And we would all take turns completing that last report. Because we could leave the moment we where done and would still get paid for the whole day. I started working on my report. Because I felt like I would take the longest. I wasn’t paying attention to what they were talking about. I wanted to get out as fast as possible. Jim walks behind me and says little girl aren’t you paying attention I asked if you wanted coffee. And the bastard was smirking at me when I look up. 

I looked around and no one heard him. His stupid smirk grew bigger when he noticed I was looking around to see if anyone heard him. I refuse to go to HR or have anyone else at work find out. 

I really enjoy working for this company. I’ve worked here for 5 years and had never had a problem until this month. I can’t asked to be moved again. I just transferred from a different area. But I don’t think I could handle it if he doesn’t stop. So how do I get him to stop? Every time I try to think of what to tell him. I just ended up screaming at him in my head. What do I say?

197,"A little background. We are a middle eastern Muslim family and a big one at that. My bastard of a first cousin (23M) told one of my three older brothers to seek my sister's hand in marriage for him. My father and mother agreed and everyone in my extended family also agreed. I (24M) am 100% not okay with this. I was hoping California wasn't a state that allows first-cousin marriages but that is simply not the case. I believe that my sister is going to regret this decision heavily and told her about the consequence of her decision. Like many conservative Muslims, he believes that domestic violence is just family disputes and is a poor fucken bum still living with my oldest brother who is his brother-in-law! That's right my oldest and second oldest brothers married his sisters and out of 10 children made by these couples, 1 died in the womb, 1 died by SID, 2 are born with mild mental disabilities (1 of the 2 has a lazy eye and is slowly going blind), 2 were born with aggressive temperaments, and the youngest one had to be feed through a feeding tube for nearly a year after their birth. I have reminded her of these events and she is still moving forward with marrying this bastard. He smokes and chews Khat. He went to a school in Dubai and failed. When he came to America I helped him get into the local community college classes and he failed the lowest math and English courses. He couldn't even add correctly. I've seen his high school math it is in English so he should be able to fucken add at least! He now does Doordash and Caviar, but can't even save a fucken dime. He is broke! I told her and should her his statements and she still wants to move forwards. He is also not a citizen mind you. But she was born here, unlike the rest of us in the family who were naturalized. I told her he was just trying to get her citizenship. But she still wants to move forward. He wasn't even her first choice he was going to ask someone from my father's side of the family but they rejected him. That cousin of mine is also 18! I told her this to and she still wants to marry him!? Like how the fuck is this sister of mine so fucken stupid? How? I helped her get into my university, UC Berkeley, she is going to study bioengineering and business (am studying CS and math and getting an MS in CS) I don't know what to do, she is making the worst mistake in her life. If he is like anything like this family of mind she is going to have a miserable marriage. All my aunts and sisters-in-law's talk on a regular base how they wish they never married their husband. For at least two of my aunt, I stepped up and helped them do this a husband should be doing. From hospital pick-up and drop-off to as the easiest shit like grocery shopping. Both of these aunts have at least 5+ kids each and a husband who is jobless and only works to buy Khat and smoke throughout the day. I've seen them cry and the look of defeat from look at who they married all the time is just sad. But they are adamant to stay with those sacks of shit because of the children and this shit religion. My sister has never had any real freedom due to family and religious constraints and I know getting married to him won't change that either. I explained this as well but she still wants to move forward. I have been molested in this family and I believe this run throughout this family. I mean she just turn 18 less than 2 months ago and he is 23 turning 24. WTF I've told her to at least wait until graduation, hoping she could clear her head and see how insane she is, but that's not going to be the cast. I have always been the black sheep of this family, first to attend a 4 year, first to leave the hen (18) and I am also gay (but nobody knows). I still have 2 brothers in their 30s still living off my parents and having their nearly 70 old mother do the cooking and cleaning for them. They are both married but to women in our home country with multiple kids. I need some validation and to have people judge the situation. Am I blind somewhere? I will always love my sister, unlike the rest, but I told her my thoughts and feeling about this. She knows I love her but won't be participating or accepting her decision to be the right one.

201,"Okay, so let me start this off by saying that I (17F) just graduated from high school. I graduated with a 3.2 unweighted GPA but was taking dual-enrolled college classes, Advanced Placement (AP) classes, and advanced courses throughout the entire four years. I applied to a couple of colleges in the state and got into the majority of those. However, there wasn't a specific college that I was particularly set on - (the one that I was invested in for a while openly had a staff member on a panel insult me publicly and say that I should ""go back to my home country for opportunities for 'people like me'"").  


I was stressed about it for a really long time because I couldn't decide what I wanted to choose for a major and a minor - much less where I wanted to go specifically to study those. I've been smoking a lot to try and relieve my anxiety and I can't get a job as a minor, especially with the coronavirus, so I've been feeling like a total bum. It's like if I'm not constantly doing something productive I feel worthless and I'm scared that high school will end up being where I peaked.   


I know I should be happy and celebrating the fact that I was a decently smart kid, my graduation, the fact that I got a new car, etc. But I'm very stressed out about college and deciding what I'm going to do. But I ended up deciding to go to a college in the nearby city about 10 minutes from where I live now. It's a pretty good university and they've worked with me so that tuition is down to 11k so I'm super glad for that. I already paid my enrollment deposit to try and set my plans in stone and I feel okay about being dedicated to that. I'm nervous about how I'll end up paying 11k per year, but I;m even more nervous that I haven't decided what I want to do with my life just yet so I feel like going into college I'm just going to go ahead and get those general classes out of the way during my first and second year.   


I've been considering a lot of different choices. I've thought anywhere from pursuing majoring in Fine Arts, Business/Finance Studies, Medical/Forensics, and English/Writing professionally. I feel like I could adapt to whatever I really put my mind to but I don't exactly know what I'd be super passionate about.

205,"I thought talking about this would get easier as I got older, but alas... some hurts never go away, I suppose! To be honest, I’d say it gets harder and harder to talk about as time goes on!

For some background, I am a 21 (going on 22) year old male with Aspergers (will probably help explain a lot of things and behaviors). I was raised in West Florida by my single mother and abusive father and stepmother. My mom isn’t necessarily a feminist in the traditional sense! But she did implement a lot of “respect women” lessons into my life (must not do the Pewdiepie thing...). Dad was about the same, maybe a bit more understanding in that regard. But he did implement similar teachings! Most of my family was in the same boat as the two, more or less! And I have plenty of friends, female and otherwise (my best friend is a woman, though she’s far more... naive and carefree then me)

So now with that out of the way, it’s time to talk about what went wrong!

I suppose the problems started in middle school. I had a “girlfriend” at the beginning, though we rarely saw each other. That eventually lead to me considering us done and moving on! I ended up ditching her for someone who rejected me. So that happened!

But after that, it started going downhill at a startling speed! 

During my time in middle school, I was accused of stalking on two major occasions. The first time involved two young girls and me, who had no clue what stalking was, nor that waiting for people outside of bathrooms is pretty creepy!

The second time was my attempt at not making the same mistakes and instead, making new ones! This was when my confidence hit rock bottom and I was worried about upsetting people and constantly asked about it. But anyways, this case involved a different young girl which ended in a pretty big fight that they ended up reporting to the school itself... in this argument, I said some, less then pleasant things about people that I regret and some words that I haven’t said ever since then...

I think the big problem in middle school was my inability to pick up on signals and how to properly discuss my feelings. But honestly, this was poultry compared to what came next.

This is the part that I still have trouble talking about to this day. But I need to talk about it and figure out how to respond to it.

It happened when I was 15 and at a party that I invitation was... complicated (wasn’t then was).

The setting was in a pool, where literally everyone was  “playing around” in the teenager kind of way. This involved grinding on each other, raunchy convos, a lot more body contact then I was used too, etc.

The setting was a stressful one on me, because I had a crap ton of emotions and thoughts going through me at once! And in the heat of the moment, I grabbed one of the girls breasts...

Now for a little context, the girl in question, we’ll call S, was a major crush of mine that everyone there jokingly shipped with me. I mostly just wrote it off until I actually began to develop feelings for her. It went about as well as you’d expect and she rejected me plain and simple, I got emotional, began crying, etc. She and I had a convo about it and I understood her reasoning. It’s all you can do in those situations! But deep down, those feelings never left... honestly, the entire time I was with that group felt like a series of awkward events. I literally got a face full of a nip slip once and utterly floored by one too many pranks...

I don’t know what made me think this was a good idea, but I remember immediately realizing the mistake I made and freaking out! There was some drama there for awhile, but I eventually patched things up there with everyone, including s (the victim), who eventually forgave me for pretty much everything!

Everyone in that case forgave me, with one notable exception.

Once the whole “Metoo” fiasco began, the memories began relapsing as I learned the full extent of what I did (sexual assault). To this day, I still can’t forgive myself for what happened no matter what I do. So I guess that’s why I came here.

Because of this event, and my consistent track record of rejections in romance, it’s hard for me to to see this as some form of punishment or “curse” if you will. I know, that’s stupid and all, but at this point, when you’re watching everyone around either getting married, having kids, or having happy relationships. It’s kind of hard not to feel like somethings wrong with you...

But after this, a few minor incidents in contrast happened. There was a time I used a term during an intense argument with my mother that you shouldn’t use unless you’re Australian or British talking to your mytes/mates. I remember that put me in a pretty bummed state for a few days where I felt nothing but guilt. I suppose just because it’s commonly used in parts of the world and online doesn’t make it right, especially not if used towards your own mother... Haven’t used that term since, or really had all that many arguments with my mom lately! Quite happy about that!

There was another case were a feared I was racist because I didn’t feel attracted to most of the “black” women I met in life (I’m white, btw). But that was quickly dealt with when I met a few “black” women that just so happened to interest me! I’m actually proud of myself for how I handled those situations and actually talked to them!

And then finally, an argument with an ex-friend over how periods are viewed by guys (I tried explaining that most of the men I’ve met in life wouldn’t do this and how educating people may help). But I went about saying it in the wrong way because I angry that day!
Still have people yelling at me over that one!

But those are, once again, minor compared to the major case that was the “pool party” incident (as I refer too it).

So I must ask, what can I do to redeem myself after
Doing something so heinous? How can I make things right again and finally move on and let it go?

How can I redeem myself after everything I’ve done?",15Jun2020,1
206,"Hi everyone I have been going to community college in my area and this will be my 4th year attending. I have been trying to leave and transfer but I am extremely lost and losing hope. Out of high school I was planning on going to UC Davis for biochemistry after being accepted and wanted to pursue research or lab work. However due to my parents divorcing and lots of other stuff happening that year, all that flew out the window and I opted to go to the community college in my area instead so I can work and help out at home as well as pay for everything on my own as my family can no longer help me out. 

Trying to continue school is honestly becoming so discouraging and I want to give up and try and pursue something else. I am doing fine though in classes and as of now I have a 3.78 GPA and am two semesters away from the associates/transferring in biology. However, all of my family issues and trying to balance school and working full time (and at one point two jobs) has become mentally taxing and I am giving up on this especially since I still cannot afford to go to any school I want to and don't really have a clear career path on what I want to do afterwards. 

Recently I have been looking into trade schools and other things to that have come my way like becoming a corrections office.  I just want to know if I should switch my pursuits in something else or if you think I should continue aiming for this degree.",15Jun2020,2
207,"LONG POST.

Around one year ago, I got very close to a girl that I worked with. We became best friends, always hanging out, telling each other everything, helping with problems etc. She went through a break up, and me and her started dating.

Naturally I was the one to give her rides (she doesn’t have a car) and we would hang out almost every day. We only dated for around 4 months before breaking up for unrelated reasons. We vowed to stay friends.

Recently, after we broke up, she said she needed a break from hanging out which I understand fully. It has been around a month. We still text plenty. However, here are the issues.

She wants to hang out again soon, not there yet though. Whenever I ask her about how she is doing, or try to talk about my feelings (because I didn’t want a break from seeing her after everything) she gets mad at me. She takes it very personally, and argues with me when I just try to talk to her. 

She has also started hanging out with other friends. Not an issue, however one of her friends is someone who I don’t like at all. Whenever they are together, she hides and lies about it, which makes me feel she is not being a good friend. They are together all the time, and she will never FaceTime me and will find excuses because they are together.

I have been going crazy recently... I have nobody to talk to besides her, and she gets upset at me. She constantly hides who she’s with and lies about it to me, and gets mad at me for asking about hanging out. Just tonight I said “so we’re on the same page, how are you doin with things?” And she sent me a paragraph and got very upset. I feel that she is not being a good friend.

She has told me she wants me to be her main ride again soon, however honestly with the daily lies and getting mad at me for talking to her I’m not even sure I wanna do that anymore...

More than anything I want to remain her friend. She wants to be friends as well. How can I do this with all this going on? How can I convince myself it’ll end up okay? I just feel very alone, and I’m not sure what to do anymore",15Jun2020,1

Basically what it is in the title.  


I'm writing this a few minutes before my 28th birthday, so far my life has been better than most, I have a career, I work in the family business, have good friends around me and I'm all around grateful for the good in my life (even while living in such a bleak country like Venezuela).

&amp;#x200B;

Still, existence, or the possibilities of my future, irk me and I can't explain why. The only way I can possibly think to describe it is finally deciding to shatter whatever delusions of grandeur I had? Like, put the remaining hopes of being special in some way to rest, and I feel like all I'm left with is an ordinary life.  


Now, I'm not judging people that feel like an ordinary, picket fence life is their calling; because what I mean by ordinary life is that regardless of whatever path I pick, be it to dedicate myself to build the ideal Picket fence life, save enough money to travel around the world, or do whatever, I will never truly amount to being an extraordinary man.  


Feels like the dice have been cast, my lot in life already decided and I'm just going to be working and dedicated to enjoy the ""little things"" until I die.  


It might be absurd, but what I need is advice on how to be at peace with that, I already consciously know that we are nothing but a speck of dirt drifting in the cosmos and all that jazz, what I need to learn now is how to be apathetic to this situation.",15Jun2020,1
210,"Hey there, everyone! This is my first time posting onto this subreddit.

For context, my mother and father had a nasty divorce years ago, partly due to my father’s infidelity and emotional abuse towards my mother. This was also practically stressful because of my father refusing to provide child support for my mother.

My relationship with him has been on and off.  His past actions towards my mom and the family have left me with some bitter grudges towards him. Though we are trying to re-establish a better relationship, his effort hasn’t been as dedicating as I’d hope.
A few years back, I made a mistake that resulted in me getting deregistered from college. I had no choice but to wait until next semester to go back to school. This was devastating for me as I had been struggling to pick myself up for months at the time; dealing with debilitating anxiety and depression. I didn’t want to disappoint my family and that fear of failure was a really stressful period in my life. 
So I thought to confide in my father, with panicked text messages asking for help: what should I do and what should be the next step. He calmed me down by saying that everything would be okay and to stay strong. I felt better, hopeful even, and I continued to go to school the following semester.
After deep cleaning my mother’s house this past month (with COVID-19 and all), I came upon documents of screenshots of those private text messages between my father and me. I asked my mother about it and she confirmed it was sent to her lawyer from my father and step-mother. She said they were trying to use these screenshots of the conversation as evidence to prove that I was not in college anymore which was enough for me to be ineligible for child support. 
I’m feeling hurt, betrayed, and angry. I had no idea my father did this just to get out of paying child support. Despite this happening a few years ago, I can’t help but feel used.
Now with Father’s Day around the corner, I’m supposed to be visiting him and my step mother. I don’t know how to even approach this. Maybe I should let it go since this happened a few years back. However, this realization seems to be the boiling point as my grudges towards him on what he did to our family and actions he never apologized for, have seemed to resurface again. 
Would I be selfish to bring this up to him even though this happened years ago? How should I even go about this? On Father’s Day or as soon as possible or after the holiday? 

Thank you to anyone reading, I really appreciate it. Any advice I’m willing to read. Thank you very much for your time. Stay safe.",15Jun2020,1

214,"I've got 5 best friends and I love them all so much. They mean the world to me and I always want the best for them. Before I met them, I didn't have many friends I could talk to about my personal life. They also live pretty far away from me and so I don't get to see them very often.

Starting off the list of toxic behaviors I've been exhibiting is that I have a bit of an ego. I'm probably the smartest of the group and definitely the most logical. Whenever they have an issue, I usually pose the most reasonable answer, and I tend to be correct a lot of the time. However, the issue comes in when I get angry when they ignore the advice I give. I hate it when they go against what I say and then put themselves in a worse situation. I try not to get so heated over small things such as these, but for some reason, I become so furious when this happens.

Another issue with my ego is that I constantly look down on them. I constantly feel like they're stupid for not knowing something or failing to handle a situation properly. 

I also notice that I'm quite possessive. I have a feeling this might be because I never had close friends before. I constantly get jealous whenever they tell me that they were talking to somebody else or they decide to hang out with somebody other than me. One of my friends hung out with a girl he really liked. I honestly thought that I would've been happy to see him hanging out with her, but honestly, I was kinda pissed that he flaked on me for her, especially since we don't see each other that often. Another friend of mine replaced me as his best friend on snapchat with his crush. I tried joking these off by saying I'm friends with a bunch of simps, but it honestly hurts my feelings.

At first, I blamed these things on them. It's only now that I realize that I'm the bad friend. These guys are living their life trying to figure things out for themselves and I'm acting like some total control freak. I hate myself for being so mad and jealous of them and I really want to change. Luckily, they haven't noticed these behaviors about me, but if I keep this up, I'm sure they will. I really need some advice on how to change and be a better friend if I want to keep them in my life.",15Jun2020,1
215,"I (34F) as looking for a video I watched with my partner (35m) when I came across his search history. Search terms like 'blond slut' , 'whore' etc. Months ago, I found him masturbating in the toilet. He confessed that while I lay naked in his bed, he'd been masturbating in the toilet for months. At the time, I was absolutely gutted. I felt humiliated and betrayed. I was ready to have sex with him yet he was choosing porn??? He swore he wanted me, not these girls. I thought I'd give it another go. 

Anyway, so now, I've asked him about what I found on his computer and he said he was looking up blonds out of spite. To get back at me if (quote) ""I left the peanut butter spoon on the bench"" or, ""chopped on the wrong side of the chopping board"". WTF. 

I'm at a complete loss as to how to respond. Who would look up porn to deliberately yet indirectly hurt their partner? I'm a brunette. He says he's sorry and is desperate to 'make it right'....

Just jerking off instead?

I'm a fourteen-year-old girl. 



My mother very strongly believes that if I cry, it's manipulation and a sign of attention-garnering. 

The stigma surrounding someone my age struggling, mentally, is so overused. My mother is an avid Facebook user and she sees this all the time, so when I cry she punishes me. She keeps telling me to shut up, talking about how I was supposed to be smart. 

I think that she's just shocked right now, really. It came out tonight that I've been struggling with an eating disorder for a few years, but I couldn't call it that. I was sobbing and she kept pretending to spit at me and threatening to call my dad and tell him how much of a whiny bitch I was being to her; her words, not mine. I kept referring to it as ""this"". I thought I was going to throw up, from all the crying, but it just makes her angry when I cry. 

This happened because she knows I'm really sensitive about calories and body shaming. I hate being this way but I've been trying so hard to recover. I've made it about two months so far, but she really loves to talk about it to me. 

I want to say more but I've started crying again and my mind blocks it away anyways, about 20-10 minutes after our arguments. 

She turned off the Internet, literally. To the whole house. She said that maybe when I grow up some more, then... but it doesn't matter because she just really likes to hit me. A lot. 

I'm so sad because I know that if I ever talk to someone, they will just see me like she does. They will think that I just do this for attention or something, and I don't want to go through that again. 

I'm ready to kill myself. 

I couldn't help it, and I mentioned it tonight, during the argument. My mother was so appalled that she told me she hopes that I'll do it. I know she didn't mean that, but I can't help but to hold it against her. It scares me, too, because I haven't really loved her for a long time. 

My father is out of the picture. There is nowhere for me to go but into the foster system. 

I think I'd rather take the suicide. It's been so long and I just can't do this anymore. I don't want to die, but I already cut up my thighs. And my stomach. But not my wrists, because she checks there. I feel like an invalid and she wants to see me suffer.

220,"My (F/34) 12 year old son is on the Autism Spectrum. He struggles with how he is perceived by his peers and strives to be the “popular kid”. Part of gaining popularity is to have a girlfriend. 

He is not allowed on social media, but he does have a cellphone. I randomly check his phone to monitor activity. He’s always been a rule follower, so when I am reading his text messages, it is with the intention of helping him have healthy relationships with his peers. He already struggles with having a normal conversation in real life, so I worry about how his tone might be misinterpreted through text.

Tonight I read message after message between him and a few friends in which he’s discussing various girlfriends he has or had. And then I found a meme about how girls always go for the bad guy. 

His cell phone usage will be addressed accordingly. 

The topic of the texts solely revolve around girls. Nothing inappropriate, just about being his girlfriend and how he is nothing but the perfect guy. It all just seems very “nice guy”, but he’s also 12. His normal conversations with his buddies revolve around sports but there’s not much to discuss at this point. 

Is this typical 12 year old boy? Or is this more extreme? My initial reaction is to just remove all access to communicating online by taking away his phone and iPad. But I’m wondering if installing a monitoring program (with his knowledge) is a more appropriate approach. How would you address his behavior?",15Jun2020,1

I'm having problems with my family and GF due to addictions on both sides. I am recovering from alcohol and marijauana addiction but my brother, mother as well as my girlfriend also have these addictions and it's very difficult to continue with these relationships (that I want to keep, I love them). Basically, I live with my mother (Alcoholic) and brother (weed addict) and have a 5 year relationship with my girlfriend (addicted to both).

My mother would drink about 4-5 litres of vodka a week and due to her disabilities in her leg, requires me to get her the shopping of the house. When I go out to get the shopping, I have to buy her the vodka which I hate because I know it's enabling her but I'm guilt-tripped and bullied into getting her what she wants. I feel like a hypocrite because I also drink a lot, not as much as her but as reguarly as her and I can't approach the problem as well. My brother also has to buy her it as well when I'm not around, but he's unemployed, 30 and smokes far too much weed that he is also hypocritical in his condemnation of her. I also can't condemn him because I've also smoked the same amount as him (Although I've quit now). My father is very similar to me, he also struggles, but he can also quit when he wants, but I can't live with him despite me wanting to. Hes not only a COVID-19 survivor but a cancer survivor and has a traumatic past (he grew up during a war, same as my mother which can also explain her problems, they both suffer from mental health issues) I think the best course of action to take is to leave the house but as I said she is disabled and needs someone to help her out but she refuses to change and I can't just abandon her. She has had previous alcoholic issues and it was horrible during my early teenage years after her breaking up with my dad, in fact one Christmas morning, I went down stairs but rather than presents, what I saw was my mother sprawled over the couch in a drunken state. I just went up to bed and went back to sleep, on Christmas morning. 

Onto my girlfriend, who is a lovely girl and I don't want to break up with her, but she also refuses to change and is pretty much worse than all my family. She drinks, smokes and pretty much takes any powdered substance up the nose when she can take it (cocaine, MDMA, whatever is on offer). She can't go a night without it, she's depressed and has anxiety which I understand but as much as I try to help her she just doesn't even try. I was sitting with her tonight with my brothers GFs child and she asked me was she allowed to take an ecstacy tablet (keep in mind, we're sitting with a 12 year old watching a movie and she wants to take a pill) she just can't go through life without a drug or drink and it's heavily affecting me to the point were I self harm just to avoid relapsing. She broke up with me because I wanted her to leave rather than have a drunken argument, called me a f*gg*t, shouted etc... she can't wait till she is sober and rather than get a taxi she walked home just to make me seem as if I'm the big bad guy who kicked her out at night when she refused to phone a cab. I only want what is best for my family and girlfriend.

The problem with my brother is, I don't mind if he is 30 and addicted to weed, or unemployed. That's his business and he can sort it out himself, he's a big boy and he doesn't need me to look after him and he's taking very good steps to sort himself out. The problem is, he's a bully. It's almost as if he gets off on demeaning people in outsider company, if he's on the phone and I say something he doesn't like, he will demean me while the person on the phone can hear. A while ago after an argument, as I left the house to get away from him, he stood at the front door and shouted abuse at me in front of the street and neighbours. He's seven years older than me and he's calling me, once again, a f*gg*t which I don't like, I'm just skinny and more recluse than others, but it really brings me down and emasculates me (Which is why I assume my girlfriend called me it earlier) EDIT: She literally just found a bag in the street and licked the inside of it.

I don't know what to do. I love them at their best and at their worst their horrible. I'm no saint, I can be a real grump and I'm not easy to talk to, but I can't help but blame them for this. I'm not like this around my friends nor was I like this around my girlfriend (Ex? she's drunk so I'm not even going to take her seriously until she sobers up, she does this sometimes but drunkenly breaking up a 5 year relationship over text is just the last straw for me, which is why I'm writing this post)

At some point I ask myself, it has to be me? If everyone is having these problems with me, it can't be all them, but at the same time the evidence is there that it *is* them. My mother is an alcoholic who drinks herself to sleep every night, my brother can't go a night without smoking it and I walk on egg shells not to piss him off or he'll literally go on the offensive and act aggressive and bullying and my girlfriend does both and can be like a hybrid of the two. I don't want to be a hypocrite in that I condemn them because I did (do) it too, but I just want advice or help or whatever. It's getting to the point where I'm suicidal.

I’ve already been accepted to a college and told them that I plan to attend, however, I have not filled out the paperwork for my high school that would graduate me a year early. Without those forms in a few weeks, my acceptance to college could be withdrawn. 

I’ve told my parents I want to go to college. In the past, they’ve said that I’m lazy and need to show more emotional and social growth before they will let me go to college. The truth is, our relationship isn’t great and I’m not particularly fond of my parents so I do my best to avoid them during the day, which means staying in my room a lot. So without the guarantee that they’ll let me attend college, I am hesitant to “graduate” high school this year which would either allow me to go to college or be trapped at home for another year without school as an escape.

When they first started dating she didn't tell us about him, my older sister was also living with us at the time and he was trying to get with her before my mom, so naturally this put the family on edge for almost a year, she moved him in without consulting with me and my sisters so that also made us feel some kind of way. Fast foward a bit and we tell my mom we don't feel comfortable with this guy just coming into our lives the way it happened, there was other reason as well like his perverted jokes about my mom and quickness to anger, so we decided he should at least go away for awhile and see how things go with the family. Almost a year passes and mom says he's coming back, for me I didn't know how to feel about this situation, my older sister has moved out by now and gotten her own place so its just me and my younger sister here, I know I got to look out for her but I also want my mom to be happy so we decided it was ok for him to come back. It's been about a week or 2 since he's been back and I am super on edge right now, my younger sister is off with my aunt on a vacation so it's me, my mom and him. It's like nothing even changed from last time he was he, he gets into fights about stupid things with my mom, he talks to her in a way I don't like, and he still gets upset real quick, I been holding my tounge when I see all this because I'm trying to see if my moms gonna say anything about it. I know he's afraid of me because everytime I walk into the room when he's upset about something he shuts up and ends the argument by saying ""sorry you're right"" to my mom and he doesn't look at me when I talk to him/he talks to me, I've been thinking about talking to him about his behavior and how it's not gonna fly when my younger sister gets back I'm not sure how to approach this though. I'm trying to give him a chance to change but he's making it very difficult to like him, he's also one of those types of people that will complain to my mom about us (us being my sisters and aunt) not liking him and he's one of those ""pity me"" people. I've spoken up about it to him in the past like when I caught him yelling at my mom and older sister in the past I shut him down on the spot telling him to stop talking to my family like that and he shut up quick and went to my moms room, recently when the riots were happening he told my mom he wanted to get a gun, he's a white guy and he said ""since they want to attack white people I want to be able to defend myself"" his words not mine, that's the topic that made me seek advice since I don't trust him with a firearm around my family, he doesn't have one yet but he does things without telling my mom first so I'm sure he will buy one in the near future. I don't know how to approach this situation right now, do i talk to my mom and tell her my problems with him, should I confront him and tell him about the problems I have with him or something else? Any advice would be great. (Sorry if this is hard to read/follow it's 11:00pm and my mind is racing right now because of this)",15Jun2020,1

237,"So Im A 17 year old male and in year 11 at school, I think thats sophmore year i the US? PS: Im an Aussie. Anyway the story starts a few months ago, My Ex and I broke up after her parents caught us in her bed, to make a long story short we were done as my parents also found out. Fast forward a week or so and she calls me attempting to get me back, I explain that its not going to happen, she is clearly upset nd hurt by this but I had to make the call. We don’t talk again for a month; in this time I begin to lose feelings for her. However, during this time, only 2 weeks after we broke up, she starts texting my mates trying to get in their pants. Most of them respect me and tell her to get lost but one of my best friends agrees and she gives him head. I only found out from a different friend a few days after, when she told a bunch of people and so did he. I chose not to act at the time as I valued out friendship and I didn’t want her to have succeeded in messing with my lads. Later she attempts to get me back again, and I denied, reasoning that I have lost feelings for her. She responds with denial and fantasies about us being together. I stay by my word and say no. Presently 1 month has passed and they still don’t think I know what happened. I am still very angry, and there is obviously a tension in the air. I am very good at hiding my emotions but whenever I see my friend I want to kill him. All I feel at the moment is anger. My question is, should I set the record straight, or continue with the white lie to avoid conflict. Thanks for the help, any advice is appreciated.",15Jun2020,1
241,"She has threatened to brake up with me 8 times in the last 2 days and this second day is young. Yesterday This all started because I didn’t answer her first call yesterday morning because I was sleeping, her second call woke me up and I answered it. After that she though I didn’t answer because I was cheating on her with someone and asked me to read my messages. She told me to read entire conversations with a few of my female friends after I was reading for an hour non stop I said this is enough can I stop now and she said no, I must be hiding something and that at if I stop she’ll leave me. So I ended up reading for 5 hours and was so tried I couldn’t talk after that! 

That evening we played Minecraft and she was so nice and calm 🥰 it was so fun! Then this morning I slept in and when I woke up I saw that she said she’ll break up with me because I didn’t answer her calls and also she called my friend and told her to text me. 

Idk what I should do, I know a lot of you would suggest I should break up with her but that’s why I do all that hard stuff, so I can keep her because I love her. I want to change her so that she’s not so mean anymore and trusts me more but I heard it’s wrong to want to change your partner.

246,"Was thinking about writing this and then everything went to shit.
For context I’m a recovering bulimic and today was really rough. I ate a bunch of brownie this morning and didn’t puke it up, which has made me feel upset/ apathetic throughout the entire day

I’d also decided to give up smoking weed for the next week because I thought I was becoming overly dependent on it, however I was thinking about drinking instead.

I felt really guilty for wanting to drink because it makes me feel like I’m turning into my dad (who’s kicked all of us out when he was drunk a few times) but I also really didn’t want to be in my head.

I decided to take a really long shower and just cry it out. Dealing with my emotions healthily right? The reason I took a shower was because I didn’t want my mom to see me crying. When she sees me cry she tends to try to pamper me (ie buying me stuff, using this baby voice, generally not leaving me alone) and while I ge the intention i really wanted some fucking privacy


Anyways she saw my on the floor of the bathroom at the height of my crying session and wanted me to get out so we can talk it over. I refused to leave the shower and I started having a panic attack because I was really hoping this time I’d be left alone right. 

She insisted that I turned iff the shower (not sure why, she said it didn’t have to do with the water bill) and periodically checked on me while I was sitting in my cold empty shower. She left the door to my bathroom open so I didn’t feel comfortable moving out of it until q couple hours had gone by, and she had finally left my room. 

As of right now I’m in the water closet because it’s the only door in my room thag locks. I’m planning on sleeping in here but I really need a way to

the vacation is only one week out of the 8 week class so i know it isn’t THAT bad. but i don’t want to slack and fall behind. 
i also have a test on one of the days i’ll be on vacation so i don’t know how i am gonna manage this but i’m stressed as hell. 
one benefit though, tests are open note. so i figure if i just have good notes and practice a couple hours each day i should be ok.


i was thinking how i can somehow manage my time by waking up early and getting work done (i’m not a morning person) but!!! i can always sleep on the beach while i tan lmaoo 

if you’ve gone through this situation while taking a summer course, what have you done to manage good grades?? or if you’ve had a job while managing college courses, how do you find time and be efficient???

248,"Im 5'3 107lbs and was walking my 100lbs dog at night in a residential suburban area (pitch black and no one is outside after 10pm)

I asked my husband to join me but he said no. He usually lets me walk her late at night even at 1am thinking its a big dog and safe area.

Anyways a few months back, i felt like i was followed by some guy in a pick up truck on an afternoon walk. Told my husband about it and brother who said not to walk the dog there. So stopped taking the dog there. So today at 11pm i walk my dog and near my house around the block, this same colour pick up truck comes along. The guy slows down before the stop sign and i see his face not clearly but enough to see a guy in his 40s turning out of his seat, slowing down to look at me. Now im in baggy clothes with a bulky jacket and hood. Nothing appealing for any guy to take a glance at. So i found that weird, i turn around the corner, and noticed the car stopped 4 houses in front of mine when i stop, he starts to reverse but a car comes around so he stops and remains there. I slow down near my property but dont go in cause i dont want him to know where i live. I wait around acting like my dog is sniffing the grass and walk two houses forward and text my husband to come out. My battery dies so i freak out and run. As soon as i am running back, the guy speds off. My husband came out when he sped off. He wasnt overly worried, while my brother was upset. Hes like why do you walk her late at night, its disrespectful of your husband. 

My husband thinks they are not empowering me to be stronger. I should scream and etc but i have been harassed before on a train and i froze and didnt scream or say anything. I just tried to move away, i freeze when in a panic or afraid. I said so to my husband. He said you can walk her alone at 8pm. 

Im not sure how i feel about my husbands response where he feels like i have a big dog that should be able to protect me but i know my dog is a barker not a biter.

•not allowed to facetime

•no hosting/ going to birthday parties
•no movie theatres

In my house, I am not allowed to talk about anything besides school and God. I will get called ungrateful/spoiled. 

This has caused me to not be able to tell my parents about other things that’s bothering me with the fear of being judged. 

My parents are African. If I say I feel like I should see a therapist they would condemn me. I struggle with some self harm thoughts very rarely. I don’t know who to talk to. 

I am literally not allowed to have a social life. I have about 3 friends and one doesn’t even live near me. 

I’ve never been allowed to go simple places like theatres, SixFlags, waterparks etc

They always talk about how bad friends are for me and that I shouldn’t have any. I told my dad I had 3 and he got so mad at me. Said it was bad. That they would do more harm than good. 

They are always comparing me to other kids saying how more successful and hardworking they are than me. I try so so so so hard in school. I brought my GPA in Semester 1 from an 82 to a 93 second semester. 

My dad was not satisfied and it crushed me. It is now summer vacation and my dad is making me study. I just want a break. Of course I will study over the summer especially for the SAT etc but he makes it daily. 

They even treat my brother better than me. 

This has caused me to not be able to make eye contact with people yet I am over affectionate because I lack it and want to give it to other people. I stutter, always need reassurance from people or validation, It has caused me to be very secretive and an elite liar. Arguing is pointless, I will be yelled at.

As soon as he sent something this person said ""I've got you now fuckboy"" and demanded money or they were going to share what he had sent them and tag him in everything. 


When he said he didnt have any money they told him to take it out of our moms purse. They asked for bank information or credit card information. They said if he couldn't get those they wanted him to take cash and buy iTunes gift cards and send them the codes. 


When he realized they were serious he went to our mom and told her he was in trouble. The state police has been called as well as the center for missing and exploited children so everything is covered from that angle but is there anything I can do or say to help him in this time?

I always want my hair to look good and my makeup to look perfect and when I leave the house I always wear nice fitting clothes. I just don’t have effortless beauty. But she keeps telling me that for me “nothing is where good enough” and “you always want to look perfect, you could look worse.” 

And like I know she’s just trying to help but it just makes me more insecure. I can’t just not put effort into perfect hair and perfect face and perfect look. If I don’t have these things then the only thing people will notice about me is my weight. And nothing else. 

Idk how to tell her to just stop after having already tried. And idk how to let it not bother me. Because she is my mom and she may never stop. But idk how to just not care. I just always feel like she sees me like some spoiled brat who just can’t leave the house with makeup on.

Ok so me and my freinds family are really close to the point where not only his parents but his aunts, ubcles and grandparents tell me Im part of the family and can visit even if im not freinds with him anymore. I visit them without my freind sometimes too.

Anyways over the course of the past years iv gotten to know her more and at the beggining of my senior year I developed major feelings to her.

Things have happened with my biological family and now over the course of this summer I'm living with my freinds family or my other family. Because of this we have gotten to really spend time with one another and we even hanged out seprealty. She drove 400 miles with me to go to a restraunt that had a stupid name in one day because my best freind didn't want to go and she thought it would be fun.

It feels weird to talk with her when my freind or the family is around but when its just me and her I feel like we could talk for hours about anything really. We even talked about different experiences we had when we were drunk. She agreed that next time me and my freind  or her brother go camping she want to come too and she knows we drink.

Ok here is where I need advice, she knows her brother will be with his girlfriend and the only other person there she barley knows so she will be hanging out with me. Does all this hint towards the possibility that she likes me? I don't want to ask her until we go camling maybe but idk if I should do that either.

258,"Hello Reddit, 

So not even 10 minutes ago I got into a big fight with my dad. My dad left the front door open which in turn let my cats out (I got one but haven't found the other yet), went to look for said cat, came inside and when he asked me where I was I told him ""looking for the cat since you left the door open"" which then turned to him being sarcastic and kind of an asshole saying ""ohh looks like I godda adjust my life to a fucking cat, I can't even leave my damn door open wtf"" and look I understand where he is coming from, it's his house, I'm 19 and living with him rent free, but it's the least he can do, especially since he has his girlfriend's two dogs as well. 

So anyway I shook my head and was going to go to my room when he begins yelling and saying that it's his house and he should be able to leave his door open yada yada yada, me awhile I told him ""look I'm sorry I took in a couple cats but at least I'm financially taking care of them and being overall responsible"" and he was still yelling about how he can't keep his door open so I just went to my room, he then proceeded to ask if he was doing something wrong in which I told him no, in fact he wasn't I was just being stupid and that made him even more pissed off and he eventually suggested I leave. I asked if he was kicking me out and he said no and once again left.

At this point I godda get outta here. I'm tired of dealing with him and his anger. He's tipsy hence why he's probably yelling and being stupid, but yeah I godda get out of here. I have money saved but my car (aka his car), phone and some other things are under his name and I have nowhere to start in terms of how to get out. Plus I have my two cats I don't wanna leave behind or get rid of, they're not just junk, I can sell off my material possessions and everything else, I don't care about that, but the cats are staying with me. 

Anybody got any advice as to how I should start? I'm in California, not in college and also transitioning (female to male). Since he didn't outright kick me out I can't say I'm homeless or anything so no help there, plus again I have two cats and I'm in California. Please help",15Jun2020,1

261,"Ok so as the title says I’m very confused... I’ve always been slightly feminine, and always preferred my mom over my dad, and I’ve had mostly girl friends growing up. I’ve had girlfriends over the past and I’ve been attracted to them sexually/romantically but I’ve been the same way towards guys with never actually dating one? My parents were always pushy trying to *make* me gay or at least that’s how I felt, they were always supportive, but I feel like they were trying to push it on me? They aren’t the reason I’m questioning my sexuality, but I would like some advice... 

Now that I’ve had my intro.. I stumbled upon gay porn at a very young age and I liked it.. I never understood but I did, but I also liked straight porn.. Obviously I was very young, and for starters shouldn’t have even been looking at that but I did. I’ve never actually had a *crush* on a guy until recently, I’ve looked at guys in that way, but I’ve never met anyone I liked.. Recently I’ve met a friend that I’ve been very attracted too.. I’ve always identified as straight, and so has he, but I feel like he might be into guys too, but I am way too scared to say/do anything because all of my friends are VERY homophobic and I live in the south, which sounds very stereotypical, but I’m living it. Also I would like to apologize for the grammar as I’m on mobile.. anyways my stepdad is also very homophobic and has called me a f*g before during an argument.. he knows that I’m “straight” but I feel like my mom has mentioned something from my past to him.. Back on topic, all the guys my age “pretend” to be “gay” not like how they act or look, but they will flirt with other guys jokingly and say sexual things to each other but obviously not mean it.. They don’t mean any harm by it, but they do it... All of my friends that are girls are very supportive and are probably questioning my sexuality, but yeah... I feel nice inside when this specific friend says “gay” things to me jokingly, and I know he’s joking but part of me is wondering if he isn’t? It may just be me wanting him to mean it so bad that I’m thinking that but.. It doesn’t help that I’m ugly and even if he was into guys I probably wouldn’t be one of them...

264,"I'll try to keep this quick.

I've gotten to know one of my followers on Twitter. He's a smart, witty guy. He also has a number of conditions, both physical and mental, along with an autoimmune disorder that keeps him homebound. For the most part, he's largely been abandoned by his family and a few close friends.

I can't really do much of anything because he and I live in different states (closest I'll say is Northeast for me, Northern Midwest for him).

Recently, the power went out in his home and most of his food spoiled. He's extremely short on money and, as I said, he can't really leave home and has few, if any, connections to do it for him.

He does have a GoFundMe, which I've contributed to and tried to promote on my account - with the goal that I wouldn't be carrying this on my own - but I've been ignored as well. I should mention he has 2,000 followers on Twitter and only three or four have donated. As of this writing, he's raised about a 1/3 of what he needs.

His posts have become much darker and more cynical over the past few days. He's a nice guy, blunt some of the time, but I have unintentionally pressed his buttons at times and risked getting blocked. I don't want to blow this because I said something stupid. He's angry enough that he virtually doesn't care if he dies, as long as he's not in any pain anymore (I doubt he's suicidal).

He's said that most homeless groups in the area have failed him, so I don't know how to ask about that. He appears to have severe anxiety; one of the few responses I gained from one of the last times I posted about this suggested he film a video. He did, but he said it was a major struggle to do it, both physically and emotionally, and it go virtually no reaction, so I don't want to push him to do it or anything else to stress him out too much.

I feel like I am failing him, and I have no idea what to do.

The most I feel like I could be doing is stocking up on food and sending him some, but I don't know how to do that or if it would even make it to him. Or if it's even in my interest to do that.

265,"Yo, I became friends with a classmate girl some time ago. She already had a boyfriend at the time but it was still really early in the relationship, so she invested in my friendship. Let‘s just say I made some errors that showed her that I may be into her. 
Not quite sure if that had anything to do with it, but she distanced herself. Her realationship became more solid so that might just be why she did, maybe she also doesn‘t want none of my crush shit. We still treat eachother normally, don‘t know what exactly she‘s thinking.

Now if I don‘t talk to her or start a convo, the friendship is sort of quiet.  That means I‘d have to invest a lot and probably talk to her about how I‘m not happy with the friendship and I wanna improve it etc.. and what‘s going on etc..

Well, I don‘t know if that‘s a good thing to do. I value her connection to me but at the same time, I don‘t feel like crawling after her like: Can we please be friends again? Thinking about it makes me cringe. Beacause probably, any girl could give me what I‘m looking for in her.

I‘d like to find a middle ground or some new mindset rhat helps me see her as a neutral person. I don‘t think I‘m losing a valuable friend by not actively engaging with her right? Cause otherwise she would put some effort in,,, What would you do? Should I be going for a big rescue conversation? Because as it is right now, I‘m like this guy that got dumped but he‘s still hitting her up because he wants the old „friendship“ back, and he‘s really excited when she texts back and so on. I wanna rethink this, I don‘t wanna have to artificially ignore her and I also don‘t wanna invest in something the other person doesn‘t seem to value. (I don‘t know how much she values it, I don‘t feel like asking, that would just show I‘m running after something)",15Jun2020,1

I just am really uncomfortable with him doing this still and we live in the same area so although he doesn’t know where I live, I’d be a bit afraid to run into him (not that I’d even recognize him though).

He said “no it’s fine if it helps you. Do it. Do it, go ahead and do it”. From his tone he was upset so I said I didn’t have to. But he continued to say if it helped me I should. So I asked for a lighter. He gave it to me and then said “can we sleep separately tonight, I feel weird about sleeping together tonight.” So I got upset and I left, while drunk. And I realize I shouldn’t have driven home drunk. And the other sub brought that to my attention. They also said the relationship is over already. So I said we should break up.

280,"Sorry for the terrible formatting. I’m on mobile and this is also my first time posting anything. There’s a TLDR at the bottom.

About a month ago, I (22 M) finished my bachelors in biology and have started getting ready for graduate programs. I’ve been teetering between medical school and a PhD since I was uncertain about what I wanted to do. I’m taking a gap half year to get applications together for a spring masters program to springboard into those and to think things over, just to get my head straight on which path would be better for me.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s when all this sorta clicked. I don’t want to do this. I really don’t. I’ve been crying and losing my mind every night and I have no one to talk to about this. I can do the work, I figured out how to study biology (took me a few semesters), there are even a few really niche areas that are interesting to me. But I don’t want to do this and I have no clue what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst feeling is I feel I have to go through with it. My family has all these expectations of me, I have all these expectations of me. Part of me thinks that the people around me have assumed that I’m good at handling things and no one pushes me anymore, so I’m probably just struggling to accept the responsibility and discipline on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m afraid of being mediocre, of not being enough. Not in the sense that I think highly of myself (trust me, I don’t). More along the lines of wanting to be fulfilled with who I am. I’ve just spent so long doing this that it’s all I know, and I haven’t explored who I am outside of this field.

&amp;#x200B;

The things I do enjoy are boxing me in. They would require complete re-education that I can’t afford, experience that I’m not qualified to get, or a complete and total abandonment of everything I’ve worked hard on over the years. Some of them are more silly, escapist hobbies that I’ve probably taken on to not collapse in on myself like a dying black hole.

&amp;#x200B;

Biology isn’t doing it for me, and what sucks most is it’s all I have. All my skills, all my experiences, they all are about getting into a higher level STEM. TAing or tutoring this, volunteering here, researching that, etc. I have letters of recommendation, but they’re all for medical programs. I could apply right now, if I stayed on this career trajectory I could do a decent job I think, but I’d hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people would say extend your experiences to other fields, but then they’ll ask for my accomplishments and what I achieved. I didn’t achieve anything. My grades weren’t stellar, partially because I’ve realized this lack of passion has been with me since I was 16. The things I did are only meaningful to the people in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

The few things I think I really like? My current research on neuropsychology is kinda interesting, sociology (teaching, researching, learning), writing, the idea of directing a creative project despite my lack of artistic skill, and maybe one day being a professor or in higher education so I can help people learn and survive what’s currently killing me. Every aspect I’ve explored of those things fascinates me, but I can’t do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fields that I do genuinely like are also just not paying well unless you’re the absolute best or have spent years in them (look who’s already behind). I don’t care about money, but to pay off loans on a career readjustment and to be able to afford the things I want later in life (not wealth or materialistic things, but things that do require money) means I have to consider it. It also poses the question of if I want to do this whole shift, so I realistically even have the chance to accomplish the things I want? Do I stand more of a chance having a life I want outside of my career if I do work I hate for the rest of my life?

&amp;#x200B;

I really have no one in my life who I can talk to about this. Even my parents, who I’ll have to probably explain this to and disappoint, just don’t understand. I’ve talked about changing my career to them before, but after doing a few explorations in other areas I thought I liked, I just ended up back on this same track and they feel like it’s a sign. I’ve lied to them and said I’m committed, because the reality is they can’t support me if I’m redoing my life. They think I’m studying for the MCAT, but I’m just hiding in my room from the world. I feel alone, trapped. Now is the time to make this decision, I can’t afford to keep treading water. That’s why I’m posting here. It’s a big question, a rambling post, and probably uninteresting to anyone, I know. I’m not looking for an answer, just some help or direction. Please. What do I do?

284,Hi so I took an online exam which we had 24 hours to do and I received an email for academic misconduct for submitting work that is not ‘wholly yours’ I admit I did work together with my friends on doing the exam however I really don’t know what to do or say to my professor in the meeting. It is currently a stage 1 meeting and I don’t know whether I should confess to the professor and risk having to repeat the entire year with just one module. I’m not sure if the allegations are concrete or if the professor is just ASSUMING rn. The exam was open book so most of the work in accounting would have been set out the same which is understandable but there’s one page of my workings which looks exactly the same as my friends. This whole meeting has really stressed me out so I’m not sure what to exaxtly say to my professor when we have a zoom meeting soon.

285,"Hi everyone first Reddit post but this has been bugging me for weeks and I needed to hear someone’s advice. So here’s the scoop, Me (21) and my boyfriend (21) have mutual best friends that we have been best friends with for years. My bf has been friends with ill call him Steve since high school and I have been friends with Steve since me and my bf have been dating. Steve met this girl I’ll call her Sarah and they started dating and Sarah became my best friend. We as couples and apart as individuals have done everything together double dates mall trips camping hiking you name it we’ve done it especially adventuring. We were very very close and have everything in common. Well a few weeks back I posted a political post that caused Sarah to message me randomly about it. Long story short we had a political disagreement that was respectful and honestly not really that big of a deal. I didn’t say anything bad or mean neither did she and we just simply agreed to disagreed because everyone is allowed to have their own opinion. Well few days go by and Sarah isn’t texting me back I figured she’s busy because she’s just had a baby but after about i week I message her to find out if everything was okay because I hadn’t heard from her. Well I get a long few  texts that were extremely hurtful and mean. She said she doesn’t want me around her baby because there’s a problem with the way I think. And my disagreement with her offended her so much that she couldn’t be  my friend and She doesn’t want to be around me. (Mind you this whole thing isn’t that big of a deal at least to me I was completely blindsided) I in attempts to try to save my friendship apologized and try to ask why and if there’s anything I can do to fix this because I care and even after all these hurtful things were said to me I still did everything I could to tell her that people can disagree on politics and still be friends but she was not having it. I guess my question for everyone is how do I handle this. Her boyfriend Steve still hangs out with me and says he thinks this is all stupid and I agree but I just am feeling angry. Its so awkward now even around their family it’s awkward almost like they don’t like us anymore and they’ve just stopped talking to us and I swear the disagreement was not big or dramatic just polar opposites on the political scale which we’ve know and talked about for years and it wasn’t a big deal. But now she refuses to talk or even see us or let us around their son. It’s hurtful and it’s frustrating since this seems so petty to me over one disagreement. I just am not sure how to let go and give up I never got the chance to defend myself either I just let this chick walk all over me. I get that people today just say Ok what ever bye but this was someone I cared greatly about and its hard to just say okay bye. I mean I’ve had the same viewpoints since the day we met them and she knew that so I just don’t understand why it became a problem all of the sudden. I’m not cutting people off who don’t agree with me it all just seems so immature and not the way to fix the problems of today’s world. I have a great deal of care respect and loyalty towards my friends so this was a hard pill to swallow... any advice? I def learned my lesson about posting political stuff cuz I’ll never do it again but I just don’t understand why someone would stop being a friend because of one disagreement especially when they know they are severing not only their relationship but someone else’s too like my bf and her bf since they have been best friends since before us.",15Jun2020,2

Hello, i just turned 21. i dont know who will see this but i hope someone can help me. i need some advice on something ive been facing. I do not know if this is normal or do i need to seek help but i've been overwhelm recently. My mom is sick and she's not getting better but shes still functioning like normal. My mom has been making it hard for everyone around her (eg: she wants this particular food and nothing else so my dad begrudgingly go and buy it for her. Basically she wants what she wants and no one can have a say in it if not, shes gonna keep repeating the thing till she gets it). My dad has a company to worry for and with the pandemic going on hes having a hard time finding business but he never really say anything about it to me or my mom. He's tired and i can see it everyday. My family is just my parents and i. We are not know close knit and its cringey when they try too hard. I cannot talk to them about anything im feeling because

1. my mom judges and does not understand where im coming from even tho im explaining and explaining she just does not gets it and will tell me otherwise or get angry
2. my dad has his own worries he does not need to take on mine.

I've been facing an issue in my relationship which i feel is a one sided problem.  Im an overthinker. He's my first real BF because i never dated seriously before college meaning it was just puppy love with my HS bullshit. Our fights is usually him doing all the talking and scolding and i just kept quiet and listen and apologise. It always seems to be my fault. He says im selfish, i dont think about others, i dont listen to him and i always talk back to him (i was trying to defend myself during fights like arguments not physical ones haha). He does not hit me or anything bad like that, he loves me i know but his temper is hard to tolerate as we progress further into our relationship. (sry dont want to give out a lot of details). this makes me think if i am actually what he says. me and him are from different statuses (?) like im 200% aware than im more privileged than him like being able to go college and have monthly allowances but he had to work since he got out of high school. Im also aware that sometimes i might be selfish and i try to think further before doing anything but when we get into fights he always brings up the same thing (ie. im selfish i dont listen to him). i dont know how to think for myself now. A lot of times when i make decisions, i will think ""if i do this will this make him angry? "".  and also, when i tell him im stressed and feeling overwhelm, he does not tell me its ok (never did). he just says im overthinking and that it was annoying that i call him when he asleep and he heard me sobbing about being stress. i know in my heart i still love him, but my head keeps on trying to convince me to break up with him. im fucking feeling crazy at this point. i did not sleep well this past week because my head is so loud. The reason i only started feeling like this is recently we had a fight that ended up with me begging him to forgive me.

my university studies on the other hand, we have so many assignments suddenly coming in in our final weeks of school. i have a rubbish group that im currently dealing with and they suck so bad. im so tired and stressed out but i procrastinate a lot but i still pass up quality work at the end. part of my overwhelmingness comes from here as well because my university is not accustomed to online class, some lecturers are making it fucking hard for me to listen and pay attention because their teaching styles do not work if its an online class.

&amp;#x200B;

i have dreams i want to achieve.  i have so many other things in my head right now. im so overwhelm that i was pacing in my room for like 20 rounds and i only noticed i was pacing so hard about halfway through it. I want to see a psychiatrist for this because my head is so loud sometimes. Now that i've calmed down, i feel like its unnecessary. BUT i still feel like seeing one because if this happens again and i breakdown i dont know how i'll handle it. Help. i dont know what to do. i dont know if this is normal or is this is high functioning anxiety. (i'll probably delete this because im afraid that ppl i know will find this)",15Jun2020,0
287,"So this happened only an hour or two ago, let me set the scene. So I am a valet attendant working for a valet company and I am currently placed at an upscale seaside restaurant/hotel in Rhode Island, if that matters, and the lot that I use is valet only because people parking themselves in a small area is just a disaster. It’s set clearly that it is a valet only lot. There is a side entrance that is coned off to prevent people parking themselves in the lot. 

So as I am talking with a customer, I hear tired on gravel and look back into the lot and I see a car pulling through the side entrance that is coned off so I know that someone moved them. I go to investigate and see if it is just a hotel guest or someone who was confused or whatnot, as I approach I ask the kid (he is out of the car as the parents are parking it) if they are guests at the hotel, he stops and stares me for a second and says no, I say okay well this is a valet only lot, again he stares at me like I’m an idiot and says “I know” then there was an awkward pause and he said “my uncle owns the place” even though he doesn’t. Keep in mind this was all said with an attitude like I am some moron for not knowing who this kid is his whole demeanor is very stand-offish. His parents come over and say oh sorry we didn’t know it was valet. Whatever, they go inside and I leave it at that. Later I see some bus boys taking the trash out so I ask who he is and they fill me in on how he is somewhat related to the head manager and I ask if he always has an attitude and what not. 

Fast forward two and a half hours later and as he is leaving he comes over to me, again very stand-off like and just stares at me and asks why I thought he had an attitude and I said well because you did and I was just trying to do my job because it’s a valet only lot. He then continues to stare at me and the walks away and as he gets in his car he tell his father, “we’ll have to get (said head managers name) to take care of this”. Over all I am worried that I may lose my placement at this spot because of this punk kid, is there anything I can do about it if I do get fired or removed from this location? Keep in mind this kid is very loosely related to the manager.

288,"I'm 24F. For a while, I've considered braces or invisalign. Let it be known, my smile isn't terrible, I actually think its rather nice. My top row isn't completely straight, but its not in need of adjustment. However, my bottom row of teeth is kinda crooked; not only would I like for my teeth to be straight, I get worried that its not good for my teeth to be like that. Sometimes they feel sore and I worry that they'll shift more as I get older. I brush my teeth every day and floss every few days, but I still really worry about food/residue getting between my teeth and causing lasting damage. So I'm considering investing in braces, or preferably invisalign. I wonder if its worth it, too, as I've seen that some people would have just stayed having crooked teeth than go through the ordeal of braces... NSFW - The reason I would prefer invisalign is that I absolutely love performing fellatio and I'm just terrified of trying to give a blow job, if someone would even let me, with a mouth full of stuff. You can remove invisalign at your will, correct? What are your experiences, both inside and outside of the bedroom, in regards to teeth straightening methods?

\*\*edit to include that price is more or less an issue; I'm Native American so while I do get free dental, I'm not entirely sure as of yet what they do and do not cover, so consider responding to this post as if money is not an issue.

A bit of backstory: I (24M) have just recently gotten engaged to the love of my life (21F) and things are going great there. However, we’ve been living in a one bedroom, VERY loud apartment for just under a year and a half now. It’s all we really need, as we have no kids or pets, but the limitations of renting an apartment along with the paper walls and cardboard floors have really taken a toll on me and my light sleepiness (it’s 12:50am as I write this and I was woken up by neighbors). 

We both have quite good jobs right now, as I completed my bachelors degree with 0 debt and the way we handle bills allows us to save well over a thousand dollars a month toward a wedding and a future home. Recently though, it seems nearly all of our neighbors in our block have been pretty unbearable. I know an obvious suggestion would be to talk to them about the noise, and I have, several times over the past year. It simply does not stop. Some weeks are better than others, but for the most part it’s pretty bad. The landlord does not care, and it’s really becoming a difficult situation. 

I know I have enough money to afford renting a house monthly. But the biggest problem is that it’s just barely enough to classify as not living paycheck to paycheck. The amount of savings will diminish very quickly, and logically I am well aware it is not the financially best decision in the process of getting married and establishing ourselves in the world. Our lease ends at the end of August, and I’ve been in a constant dilemma of “should we suck it up and continue to save like crazy, or should we pay more for the peace and quiet a house offers at the cost of far less savings”? 

TL; DR apartment neighbors are driving me insane but my current place is cheap enough that we can save an insane amount for our upcoming wedding and future home. Is the peace and quiet of a more expensive place to live worth the savings lost?",15Jun2020,1
293,"This girl (16) used to be my gf untill she broke up with me because she didnt believe that Im faithful. So she broke up with me, even tho Im not attractive at ALL. In a few months later, she texted me asking if we could be friends again and i said sure because i care still care about her. We go off and on with her ghosting me until the day that she told me that her ex, sexually assaulted her. I wanted to talk to her about it, but she said she didnt feel like it was the right time. I respected that, and supported her. Later on that day, she tells me about how I should just stop texting her because she hurts me. (Ik this is long, please stay with me) I told her that there is no more hurting me cause im already hurt, but then she says that isnt true and blocked me.

294,"Per the title, I'm pretty into genealogy and was randomly looking up family members' names on a newspaper archive. I saw a marriage announcement with my mom's picture and name and some other guy's name I'd never heard of. I didn't read the whole announcement, but saw enough to know that it's for sure my mom.

My parents have been married for 30+ years and I'm in my early 30s. I'm pretty sure my dad knows about it since my parents dated for 10+ years before they got married, which I always thought was weird, but I guess I know the reason now. 

Should I read through the whole announcement, google the guy, find out if it was a divorce/annulment/death? Rip the band-aid off so to speak? Or just leave it at what I've already seen?

I don't judge my mom at all for keeping this a secret since she's been as close to a perfect parent as possible, despite her having a terrible upbringing, but should I let her know that I know? Or not tell her since she clearly wanted it kept a secret?

296,"Okay, first post, on mobile- so apologies for any format or grammatical errors.

A little backstory: This last academic year was my senior year of high school and in October my best friend and I decided to go to this really expensive (for out of state students) school together, and they tbh were the biggest reason I was going. I had planned on going to this great school that had given me many scholarships and was basically paying me to go to their school already that I had been accepted to before we made that plan. 
I recently had a falling out with this friend- like they absolutely hate me and won’t talk to me at all. And now that I don’t have them as a reason to go I’ve realized just how screwed I am if I go to this college. It would be basically $30,000 for one year for me to go to this school and I really don’t want to go to it anymore. I have basically no scholarship opportunities anymore at my original school and have possibly (I can’t really remember) declared that I wouldn’t be attending the original school. But if I stay in-state I’ll be able to basically go all four years to college for one year’s worth and the expensive school. I really don’t know what to do. Would it be better to just stick it out and own up to going to the expensive school or should I try to get back into my original school? Or should I just look for a new college to make a late application to and just hope for the best, or take a gap year from college? I really thought that I knew what I was doing but I’ve been so naive to the costs of the real world. If you can give me any advice on what to do it’d be much appreciated.",15Jun2020,1
297,"19F here. My mom (42F) was abused sexually, emotionally, and physically as a child.

She still talks to her family under the guise of ""just checking on her mom"".

I've told her before I don't like it because they have said a lot of hurtful things and every time she goes back to talking about them, I feel like she doesn't care about our family (my mom, dad, brother and me). 

For reference My aunt caused a back injury 6 years ago when I was 13 and didn't get me medical attention for over a week and I ended up needing surgery on my back. My uncle tried to kick me when he was drunk. Both times she didn't say anything to them and carried on like nothing happened and forced me to as well.

Her sister and 2 brothers sent her and my brother awful messages last January (2019). She admitted she called adult protective services and tried to have my mom charged just because she got mad. My mom hadn't done anything wrong and was the only one taking care of my grandma so of course nothing came of it. My aunt pretended my grandma was dying and convinced my mom to come see her a month ago. Since then she's been talking to my aunt like they used to. I caught her talking to her sister about me. She said (yelled, actually) she can talk to who ever she wants. I said that's fine but don't mention me. 

She doesn't get how it hurts us and due to health issues, I can't move out/work right now. She'd rather spend hours on the phone outside than do anything with any of us but then says we push her away. I try not to and make an effort to do things with her but then she gets mad at me and I can't take it anymore. Now that I've stopped letting her act like that towards me, she is very angry and pushes me away further.

We told her we need more effort from her as well and she doesn't like that. She says she's depressed and x, y, z, but when I ask her to go to a doctor, any doctor, she won't.

Now my mom says she's 4 steps away from committing suicide, made some comments about us being the cause and then backtracked and said she's fine.

She says she doesn't want to be here anymore but wants the 17k she put into the house her and my dad got a year ago even though my dad has been paying the mortgage. She said it doesn't count since he hasn't paid down much of the principal (since at the start it's mostly interest).

I don't know what to do. I don't want to force her but if she's saying she's gonna hurt herself I think she should be checked in somewhere. Then when she hopefully has a clearer head, if she still wants to leave, we can go from there.

Is there anything I can do to help? Even if she doesn't want help? We live in Arizona.",15Jun2020,1

299,"So I (26 afab enby) live with my mom and stepdad. my stepdad is in his 70's, and i recently got a new job that i start tomorrow morning.

I have barely gone out during this pandemic has started. 

but during those three months, ive been job hunting on and off, and i finally land a job. i bring it up to my folks and theyre disappointed, angry, and would rather i drop it altogether because of the virus; because my stepdad is elderly and can be susceptible to the virus. A big part of me understands this, but anther part of me is just. Bored. And broke, and tired of being broke, and feeling like a burden to them. They will occasionally give me money every now and then, but it just makes me feel guilty and a burden even more when they do this. It's very rare of me to ask for them for money.

**TLDR: Maternal grandmother passed away a few years ago and she did not get to fulfill her wish of dying at home. Mother has a lot of regret about this. Maternal grandfather is now ill and wants to die at home, but this may not be ideal. How do I support my mother during this time?**

My immediate family and I moved to North America from our original country (""Home Country"") several years ago, but most of our extended family still lives there. This post pertains to my maternal grandparents, both from a small town (""Town A"") in Home Country.

My grandmother was very ill for a long time. When she was in the last few months of her life, she was living at home in Town A, where she wanted to die. As her condition worsened, my ill grandfather was not able to manage her care. My grandma needed regular lab monitoring for the medication she was on, which she was unable to get with the poor healthcare and poor lab facilities in Town A. We have no other family there. If my grandma stayed there, her wishes would have been fulfilled but she would have had a worse quality of life on a physical level. My mother moved my grandma to my aunt's house in Town B (bigger town) where she could receive proper monitoring, regular nursing visits, etc. She died in Town B. My grandma was comfortable until the end of her life, but my mother feels a lot of regret about moving her against her wishes. The most we could do for her is ensure her final resting place was in Town A.

Now fast forward a few years to the present day. My grandfather has gotten more ill and unfortunately has lost decision making capacity. My mother plans to go to Home Country both to visit him and help him move from Town A to my aunt's place for better care and monitoring. He can no longer manage to care for himself. My grandpa is currently insisting on staying in and dying in Town A. Unfortunately my family doesn't have any other options (nursing home is not an option) for his care.

My grandpa is not expected to die in the very near future, but he is approaching the end of his life. His quality of life is currently terrible due to inability to look after himself (lost mental capacity, incontinence, etc.). He has lost a lot of money due to his mental impairment. My family wants to respect his wishes of dying at home, but we also know that he would want to die with dignity, and both are not possible.

My mother is afraid of repeating what she feels may have been a mistake, and feeling regret. To make matters worse, neither myself nor my immediate family members can accompany her on this trip. How do I support her emotionally through this time? Everyone in my family believes moving my grandpa is in his best interests, but my mom is carrying a lot of emotional baggage.

This story starts in like November. I have a girlfriend, well, now she's my ex, let's call her Clarissa. I tried and kinda succeeded to set up two of my friends, Dick and Sara. Sara is currently my girlfriend and Dick is a Dick, true to his name. Clarissa dumped me, then dated Dick. Then me and Sara started dating. Very quickly into the relationship I found out 1) Dick still liked her, and 2) Dick has some sort of plan to hurt me that apparently Sara was in on. That was the red flag. She told me about it. She was the one that told me she was a part of it but she said she didn't want to do it anymore. I should've ended it right there but, I believed her. Sure people can change but, I shouldn't have continued to date someone who admit to being part of a plan to hurt me. That brings us to a couple months ago.

So  I'm going to be a sophomore after summer, but last year before the quarantine while I was at school, my friend and I were joking around and the conversation eventually turned to talking about the N-Word. He said it was okay to say it because he's a tiny bit black, and gave me an unlimited use pass. So I said it a couple of times, but I eventually made the mistake of telling some of my classmates in Advisement that I got a pass from my friend. I did not say the N-Word during that class or for the rest of the day, but one of my classmates responded with something along the lines of, ""I'm a little bit black and even I would not say it.""

I own up to my actions and mistakes and I do not want anything to do with the N-Word anymore, but I really hope that rumors about me did not spread and I hope it does not hurt my future reputation.

I never apologized, but I really wish I did that day, and if I could go back in time that day and prevent myself from doing what I did, then I would. I learned from my mistakes.

I'm sorry if this post is not the most polite or if it breaks the discrimination rule, but I just feel really bad and I am worried and bothered about my actions from that day.

321,"By the end of last year I told my mother about my depression and drug abuse during a mental breakdown. I have successfully dealt with my own issues,with the help of therapy, but it seems she is constantly worried about me and disapproves of my behavior, because I still do drugs.

I have tried multiple times to explain my reasons for doing the things I do, in a logical way, but she keeps rejecting it and giving reasons for me to stop even though I have already told her the whole basis of her arguments doesn't make sense.

I decided to keep on doing drugs because I simply enjoy it, and know I'm going to die one way or another, therefore I don't want to stop at the moment, even though I know I may do in the future. I acknowledge the risk I'm taking, but in the end I judged the risk worth the reward.

""You shouldn't do those things because it attracts bad energy"" (in a spiritual way)

My girlfriend and I have our own place. A few months ago, our friend (my best friend since elementary; her's since highschool) moved in with us on a whim because his toxic mother decided to kick him out over something that doesn't warrant such actions. He had no where to go and we had a room in the house empty, so we allowed him to move in. He isn't on the lease and our landlord doesn't know. We really didn't think too much about it as he literally got kicked out said day, and his stuff was moved in the next. The next month or two wasn't too bad, but my girlfriend and I were starting to get annoyed as he wasn't really cleaning up much around the house. He's now a roommate, so he needs to pull his end of living here. 

He pays a share of all the bills (rent, electric, internet), so he isn't here for free, but he also isn't on the lease. 
__________

Now we are here in June. He has lost his house key, and our other was lost a bit ago by my brother, so we have none. He said he'd pay for it, etc, but now we have to go to our landlord and tell her, which obviously looks bad on us. 

He has also been going out a lot and hanging out with people, which started when the state reopened from COVID. We weren't too keen on it, but it was ""whatever"" at the time. Now this past Friday, he was out at the bar's again, which have been jam packed as we are a vacation/ weekender town. My girlfriend and I told him we don't like that he's going out, not because we are trying to be controlling, but because our state is one of the top state's in terms of a second wave of COVID cases. We don't want to get sick, and he didn't really care, saying ""Well, it's a Friday"" implying that's why it's okay that he went out. He's living here and chancing that we get sick. My girlfriend has anxiety, so she hates it even more. He tried to say ""Oh, well I'm a server, so it's no different"" and while we all are, we were trying to tell him that he's still increasing his chances of contracting the virus and bringing it home to us, which he didn't seem to want to hear. 

A few weeks ago, he also threw a ""party"" at the house while my girlfriend and I were out of town, inviting coworkers over to drink. He never texted or called us to ask about it, and told us when we got back while he was drunk. We have two cats and he said they were fine and put away in a room, but they were also in there with no food, water, litter box, etc from like 9-4:30am, which is when he said they were all here. He said he didn't really get drunk so he could make sure all was well, but that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. 

My girlfriend and I also just kind of want our space back, and want to go back to living together, just the two of us. 
_______
Long story short, my girlfriend and I are way past wanting him living here. **How do we go about telling him to essentially find another place to live?** Girlfriend is over with him living here, feeling that he just walks all over her/ us, and that he needs to grow up and learn to be an adult. I don't want a drama filled event in asking him to leave (doubt that will actually happen), but I'm not sure of the best way to go about this.

I don't see a problem in basically telling him to go, but we've all been friends for years, making it fairly difficult to actually do. While we did allow him to come live here, it was on a whim to help him out, he isn't on the lease, and has caused us a lot of stress in his time here.",15Jun2020,1
324,"I have a best friend (we’re both guys) who I’ve known since high school, and it’s one of those friendships that just feels right and when we are together it feels like we were made to be BFFs since day one.

But when we are apart for some time a biting envy begins to manifest in my mind. I’ve always admired my friend and this envy has existed since high school, but I’ve always bottled it up. However, it is really starting to hurt my mental health now.

He is super attractive, I am ugly. We both have good personalities and big hearts, but I’ve always viewed him as the bigger person. He comes from a wealthy family, and I don’t. His family is big and loving and I have a small, tense family that fights a lot.

Recently these envious thoughts have been pervading my mind:

- When he becomes a dad his kids and his family will be better off than mine, for all the reasons listed above.

-He’s eventually going to get a better job than me, and I’ll be left in the dust.

-I’m not going to be his number 1 after he starts a family. I’ll just be a memory of the past.

-He’ll live a life that is downright happier than mine.

I’ll admit, on numerous occasions I’ve wished I was him. Here’s my problem: 

I am able to recognize this is a toxic way of thinking, and it is depraved to wish I could take the good things he has away and give them to myself. I love him with my whole heart, but I can’t contain the envy. It just consumes me sometimes and makes me feel worthless and inferior. 

Any advice as to how to stop the envy and focus more on the good things I have? I just can’t overcome it. Thanks",15Jun2020,1
325,"I just had to write this to get it off my chest, but any advice on how to deal with this is welcome.

My(22) brother (19) has been acting like an asshole for the last month, he’s been cold and always seems pissed off. 

When I try to speak to him, he immediately turns the first sentence I say into an argument. He finds the way to “start” shit all the time. Often I ignore him, but when I try to say anything back, or just ask him to drop it he starts yelling “shut up, shut up....” repeatedly and doesn’t let me say anything. Then I get pissed off and when he notices, he starts acting “calmly”, and makes it look like I’m the one who’s in a bad mood and he’s been calm all along. Then again if I try to speak he just tells me to shut up and go away. It’s so frustrating.

I gave him space to see if it passes, but even after a few days of not talking to him he’s still being like that. I tried to say something to him a few minutes ago and he didn’t let me finish my talking, he interrupted me and told me to shut up repeatedly. I just got filled with so much anger that I had to run out of the room because I wanted to punch him in the face as hard as I could, but obviously I didn’t do that. Also he’s my younger brother and if I hit him I’m the one who’s gonna look bad. But I went to my room and started punching my bed and throwing stuff around. I normally don’t do those things, this situation is driving me insane.

Honestly I don’t know what to do in a situation like this, we live in the same house, I can’t just avoid him.",15Jun2020,2
326,"Throwaway account. I posted this in r/relationship_advice but it didn’t receive a ton of feedback and I need some help on how to handle this. The original post is a little more detailed so I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend(30m) for 3 years now and recently things have felt a little off between us. I’ve been feeling slightly neglected in our relationship and the few times I have tried to bring this up to him the conversation has been brushed off. I’m not proud of it but my insecurities did get the best of me and I ended up looking through his old phone (he just got a new phone a few months ago but keeps the old one in his nightstand and still uses it from time to time). While I was looking through it I found folders dedicated completely to old nudes and explicit videos of his ex girlfriend (they broke up in 2013). When I confronted him about the pictures and videos he told me they were from an old SIM card that he had found from his blackberry. He said he knew about the pictures and videos but had not looked at them. He apologized that I found them but followed that apology with ‘I really think you’re overreacting’. He said that he was not the only guy to hang onto nudes of an ex and even tried to say that her videos and pictures were no different than regular porn. When I asked him why he would even want to keep the pictures/videos he said ‘you know I don’t delete anything. And maybe I’ll want to look back at them in 10 years. Who knows!’ 
He ended up deleting the folders but I can’t stop thinking about his response to the whole thing. Is this something all guys do? Was I wrong for being upset and making him delete everything?",15Jun2020,1
328,"Let's start from the beginning since this is very complicated and long...

I knew this one girl for a very long time. Our families are friends so I would see her from time to time. In middle school and high school, we would casually hang out. But not often since we always had two separate personalities and she was always ditching me for a more popular group of friends. She somewhat peaked in high school, always went to parties, drank, always had a lot of male attention, etc. I (f), on the opposite hand, was always very quiet and easy-going, never voiced my opinions, which made it unenjoyable to hang out with her as a kid since she was very bossy to me and self-absorbed. She gained a good 60 pounds since then and now hanging out with her is just hours of her complaining over her weight instead of her looks.

Anyways, when I went out of state for 3 years to college, she went to a vocational school. In that time, she became very needy. She lost a lot of friends and considered me to be her only and ""bestest"" friend, when I never truly felt that way due to the past. In college, I became very social. I went to parties and started dating boys. I gained a whole new level of self-confidence which made me feel like a whole different person. When I would go home for the holidays, she would always swing by and say her only ""best"" friend (me) should've gone to school in-state so we can be closer.

During my last years of college, she started to become even needier. I had just gotten into a relationship and every time I would do something with him she would get upset that she was excluded. There were moments I would ask her to cover for me so I can see my bf and she once texted my mom telling her the truth because she was mad I wasn't always hanging out with her. She complained that I had changed. She kept posting and subtweeting about me as well. It was frustrating. I started putting my foot down and she didn't like it.

Part 2:

During my senior year of high school, I met another friend at my new job. We became close friends fast and eventually, me, her, and her bf became a trio of friends.

Her boyfriend always had issues. He was always lying and creating fake profiles to convince his girlfriend to believe certain things. He had a big secret that we had to keep as well and it made him very insecure as a man. Anyways, he was always doing things like ""texting the wrong person by accident"" to get your attention. That kind of toxic.

However, back then I was young and I still became friends with him. Me and her boyfriend eventually got very close due to our very stupid sense of humour. His girlfriend would get jealous of this friendship very often. He would come to me and tell me some of the mean comments she'd say about me out of anger. It would hurt me because face to face she was always a friend that was very supportive of me. On a trip with us three, she accused us of cheating together and it ruined the whole excursion as a trio. But ANYWAYS, we did have fun and we were very close my senior year of high school all the way into college despite me leaving to go out of state for school. The was very loyal and there for me despite the few comments that she ""apparently"" said to her bf about me.

Part 3:

So here's the issue. Ever since I got back from college out of state, I had all this time to catch up with these three people. They were at the time the only friends I had from home. I had mentioned that I had changed as a person. I liked going to parties, I was more social, I drank alcohol from time to time. They weren't used to the new me. The friend I knew from childhood was over that party scene and accused me of being an alcoholic for liking it. The other two judged me for it and made me feel abnormal. Well, those three had met each other. The childhood friend and the couple. They disliked each other for years. The childhood friend telling me to stop being friends with the couple because the bf is super toxic (and even made a fake account pretending to be a girl texting me and telling me my bf was cheating on me with several women and blamed it on the childhood friend). He used to make fun of her for her weight and for snitching on me to my mom. One time, me and him were having a conversation in a text about her constantly ruining events by complaining over her weight and that she should take action and she somehow snooped and read all my messages and only got extremely angry with just me.

The moment where it all went down is during one vacation I took with the childhood friend (who pushed herself to come) and my family. It was in the state I went to school and we hung out all week doing things. One night we hung out till midnight with my family in the city. I had gotten a text from college friends asking if I wanted to meet up at a bar since I was in town. Since the friend wasn't 21 she wouldn't be allowed in so I asked her late that night if it was ok that I go. She said it was fine since we spent the whole day together. So, I ended up getting dropped off at the bar, and once I left my sister told me she went off on my parents saying that it was extremely rude for me to have left her after she came to the vacation with me. She even told them that I was an alcoholic and that all I care about is drinking (which is complete bs). My parents the next day scolded me and I was confused until my sister told me what happened. She acted normal and happy the next day as well.

In the car that day with all of us, I get a text from my friend from home's boyfriend or my toxic guy friend. Apparently she texted him the whole situation last night while I was out. He was saying that it was rude of me to have done that to her and that he didn't want to get involved. When I went to respond, my childhood friend caught me texting him in the car and FREAKED out. She was said I was talking behind her back again and at that moment something in me snapped. I went off on her in front of my parents. Calling her names. It was like years of annoyance towards her came out at once. She started crying and left immediately after that argument to go home by plane.

While I was still on vacation without her, her and the 'couple friend' were constantly hanging out. The girlfriend (who stayed neutral) told me that my childhood friend told them I gave away his ""big secret"" to some kids that were bullying him online (I didn't). Which caused him to send me paragraphs listing reasons as to why he does not want to be friends with me any longer bc I'm too ""toxic"". I ignored them of course. Even when my childhood friend sent thousands of paragraphs to me AND MY MOM attacking me (saying I wasn't mature bc I was ignoring the attacks) and even screenshots of the guy friend telling her lies that I apparently told him about her (the childhood friend).

I blocked all three of them (the neutral girl too bc the toxic bf uses her accs). And to this day, a year later, they are all still very good friends. The toxic guy friend even posts how he lost a close friend to get a better one (the childhood friend). Even tho the two hated each other for years they blamed it on me for making them hate each other. Despite all that, from time to time, I still get messages from them. The toxic guy friend asking me to add him to social media and the childhood friend texts me or my mom from time to time to say some sugar-coated nonsense.

The neutral girlfriend of the toxic guy friend messaged me a couple of months ago and even today asking if we could meet up. I never had a problem with her. However, she's still dating the guy and is good friends now with that girl and I really have no animosity towards them. She was very genuine and said even though she tried to stay neutral it hurts her that she lost my friendship and wants to work on just me and her.

So here's the actual question Reddit. What do I do?",15Jun2020,1
329,"Just pointing this out: I'm NOT depressed, suicidal, or suffering some type of neurological disease

Hello everyone, so throughout my whole life I've had NO PASSION in anything that is long term. I've trained for my middle school basketball team with my older friend but i just gave up in the end because without my friend i lacked any long term interest in training by myself etc etc. I've been motivated to learn new languages like French,Russian,Italian but only because the people around me made it look cool and feasible to accomplish but then again without them and their push i lacked caring and went down hill. One other i example, I've tried reading books and studying videos so i could become smarter academically and just for my knowledge because a friend was really smart and had all these interesting things that I've talked about with him in discussions but as time passed i just stopped researching and went back to my old ways. Im 18, i SOMETIMES play video games/ watch movies and just live my life with no long term future i guess. I do exercise almost every other day which includes running, pushups, shooting some basketball shots, and swimming. I try eating healthy but just consume whatever arounds the house, i always drink water multiple times of the day. I used to wash cars at a young age like 10 but besides that I've never had a real job. I'm going to have to go to college in a couple months and i at least want to go prepared with something to look forward to. Nothing seems to grab my attention, its like it lacks something that my mind wants or prefers.

Please give me some form of guidance so i can headed in the right direction so i can be in a good position for the future. Thank you very much and have a good one 👍👍",15Jun2020,1
331,"Hey everyone so fathers day is coming up and since my father has been gone most of my life and my mother has been a single parent since I was 2. I found it appropriate to get her a father's day gift. I know it might seem a bit weird but I think she deserves it. Especially now that i started my career and can afford it.

 So I decided on an iPad since her old one is breaking and she loves it and constantly uses it. Only thing is the iPad gives me an option to engrave something on it.

So the question is what should I get engraved on it? 

It has two lines and I think both line allows about 16 characters. So I would like to hear some great ideas.

333,"So I (19F) moved in with my dad(38) about two years ago after i was kicked out of my moms &amp; he’s been really helpful to me. When i first moved in i had no money &amp; was only eating spaghettios &amp; tomato soup since they’re so cheap. He always made sure i was fed &amp; would help financially if i needed it. 
To be straightforward, he’s an alcoholic. He drinks beer followed by fireball on nights where he gets drunk &amp; will keep me up talking to me about story’s he’s told me a million times before regardless of if i have to get up early the next day or anything of that sort. Then he gets hungry. I’ve driven him 5 nights a week to get food for MONTHS &amp; i finally got tired of it.
He just ended up driving himself when i said no. i wasn’t even aware because he said alright &amp; then i took a shower. when i got out &amp; saw that his keys were gone i started crying out of frustration &amp; worry. this has happened 2 more times since. &amp; it happened tonight. 
I love him obviously, with all my heart. i just think he’s an idiot for being such a dick about it. of course i don’t want him driving drunk, ever. but when i get home from an 8 hour shift to him drunkenly fighting with me for food i get so frustrated. am i being dramatic for not wanting to make the drive? &amp; it’s really not that big of a deal to drive him, i just don’t like that he gives no fucks about what i’m doing or how i’m feeling &amp; just expects me to drop everything because he’s drunk &amp; wants a burger. he’s woken be up from my sleep knowing i worked all day &amp; i have to work the next day, &amp; he won’t take no for an answer. i don’t know what else to do &amp; everyone is shaming me for telling him no but i don’t want to be his personal drunk chauffeur.",15Jun2020,1

335,"My sister and I have never exchanged gifts on our birthdays. We are week apart and she has her own place so she decided to throw a joint celebration at hers. I was running around late and just grabbed her a $25 gift card and bday card just assuming she wouldnt get me anything and more as a thank you for hosting. Well when I got there their patio was completely decorated, birthday signs and balloons everywhere. Great cake that she presented to me, lots of food (my friends came with food too but I didn't even bring the pizza I was supposed to ugh). It didn't even feel like it was a joint celebration cause she made the entire night about me. And on top of that her and her roommates got me a mini bottle of Moet champagne and $25 gift card for me. 

Just putting it all together she  went above and beyond and now I've spent the entire day hungover/feeling like shit lol. She never said anything to make me feel bad and I know she doesnt care but should I msg her and apologize or just let it go??  Or next time I see her should I get her a real gift?

338,"My roommate (19f) and I (22f) have lived together for just under a year now, and we get along really well. We never have had any real problems while living together and communicate quite well, also we hang out pretty much everyday as we share a lot of the same interests. We haven’t been very on schedule like we should be with our electric and WiFi bills, as we both struggle with our mental health from time to time, and my inconsistent income. 

Since we’ve never had a set system for paying the bills, usually one of few options happens; 1) we both log into the accounts and pay our half separately. 2) i pay one month, she pays the next (we’re even rn) 3) one of us pays, and the other gives them their half cash/Venmo. 

Since quarantine started, we’ve both had our own struggles with our mental health, and I struggled to find any income whatsoever. I had just been paying what I could, and so would she. Unfortunately I went about two months without any income, and after finally coming into some money I checked the accounts today to see that we were behind so I had to pay the full amounts right there. 

I brought it up casually mid smoke sesh, but I’m pretty sure she was spaced out by then lol (my mistake, I know). The only problem I’m having is I’m not confrontational whatsoever, i am pretty much the living embodiment of anxiety and I am always afraid of making people mad at me. I know that this is ridiculous as she has said before I’m one of her closest friends and I am aware that I should not be afraid to ask whatsoever. Logically, I know that, but that’s not how anxiety works and unfortunately logic means nothing. 

I’m rambling. I just need some advice about how to approach the situation. 

tl;dr: I had to pay an overdue balance of our bills and I’m being a p*ssy about asking my roommate for her share even though we’re friends and I probably am overthinking it.",15Jun2020,2
339,"I (18F) am moving three hours away to college in less than two months. I want to enjoy the time I have with my group of friends before I leave but nowadays all they ever want to do is drugs when we hang out and I’m not comfortable with it. My closest friend is also moving away to a different college and her dad doesn’t let her go out right now, so I only have the other two but I’m not comfortable with them anymore. I feel alone because I don’t really get to see my friends much anymore, but when I do I just basically think to myself, “what the fuck am I doing?”, and anticipate the moment I can go back home.

I’m not completely against weed or anything. I tried it a few times earlier in the year and the last time I had a bad experience so I decided to not really continue with it. I struggle with bipolar disorder which I believe played a part in that and now I’m on medications again, so that’s another reason I’d rather not do anything because the meds could possibly interfere with it. I feel like they don’t take me seriously at all when I talk about not wanting to do it. Like they don’t realize everyone reacts differently or something. A few weeks ago on my graduation day we all got together because I wanted to have fun that day and the whole time they just talked about wanting to smoke and couldn’t understand that I didn’t want to because I was going to be with family in just a few hours. They also try to pressure me into keeping drugs for them and stuff just because my mom is more lenient. They think she doesn’t care at all to the point where she wouldn’t care that if I were to keep drugs in the house. That’s not true at all. 

I’ve probably went into way too much detail but this has been bothering me for a while. I’m mainly not sure what to when they ask me to hangout with them now. The last time I made up the excuse that I had an essay due the day of and I needed to work on it. We’re supposed to hang out tomorrow and I said that I wasn’t sure my mom would let me. She always does so of course that sounds off. They always talk badly about my other friend I mentioned earlier for never hanging out with us, so I know they’re going to do the same to me. 

I know I shouldn’t care so much because I’ll be in a completely new environment with new people in two months, but I feel bad because they’re some of my closest friends and I don’t want to just cut them off. Yet at the same time, I really don’t want to be around them anymore? What do you do in this situation???",15Jun2020,1
343,"I’ve been with my significant other for over a year. We have lived together for 6 months. He can flip like a switch though. Some days he’s lovey and happy. Other days he’s a nightmare. Any small fights he only makes worse. He takes every thing and blows up. He will even go in room and turn music on like a teenager. I can never talk to him face to face when he’s like this.
I have to let him calm down. Then his apologies are half ass. 



Here’s some back story:
I have a job that’s very stressful. I’m an upfront person. When I get off with a difficult customer it feels good to be like “gosh that guy was an asshole!” Or tell him how annoying it was just to get off my chest. My SO thinks this isn’t normal that I should just hold in. I’ve never taken any of this out on him. Sometimes I believe he pretends to take personal. At times I’ve even told him and his response was basically he doesn’t care. Or right after letting it out I hug him or do something sweet like make breakfast. But He sees any emotion I have that’s not happiness as inconvenient. If I’m sad or mad at times I will wait for the opportunity for him to pounce on me. Not to mention he loves to gaslight. He should win an award for it in all honesty. 


Well today we got in a small fight. He escalated it to calling me controlling and jealous because he mistook a comment I said. Just to get off my chest now I have never been controlling towards him in any sense. The comment I made wasn’t even something that anyone would take offense to. In all honesty I believe he wanted to fight and was going to do what he has to in order to get one. He came back out of hiding to basically try and have me say sorry for something I didn’t do. I told him no I won’t own up to you saying that’s how I was acting when I wasn’t. He flipped and went back to room.


After I tried to say sorry twice. No response. Left him alone for hours. Then I get a text that asks me do I want to sleep in the bed or the couch? 



I left it at that and I told him if this was a game he wanted to play I was not doing anymore. I told him if he wants we can be done now. I told him he could pick. He replied again with the couch. So I told him as nicely as I could. It’s settled I will let go and not reach out. If he wants to be cordial roommates than okay. At the end of the day we’re adults who signed a lease. If he wants to leave he can yet I need him to cover his half or help me get a roommate. I asked him in person if he’d let me know. He immediately got extremely aggressive. Started gaslighting like crazy. Started calling me a bitch. Telling me I’m horrible for the things I say about customers. Keep in mind this is not to them, also it’s only difficult Karen customers. Trying to make me feel bad about things I don’t even do. 


The fight escalated to him being more verbally abusive. Even physically I was in the living room not in his way. He got up and He went as far as to push me countless times down the hall way not even giving me a chance to walk on my own to the room. Slammed the door. He’s called me every name in the book.


He even said he wishes he’s cheated on me because at least he’d have a sex life. 1) over the past year I found out I had early cervical cancer. Granted i was lucky not severe but for awhile before I knew what was wrong sex was actual torture at times. 2) he doesn’t initiate it and we had sex last night. 

Meanwhile he’s still being over dramatic cursing me out the whole way through. Telling me things he can’t back up. Like I’m so selfish. When I literally do everything for him including feed him while I’m actually working. He’s never given me credit for anything. Packing his shit saying he’s leaving.  I bring up I should call police for him if he doesn’t calm down. Then he had the audacity to say I was using my white privilege, that it wasn’t abuse. He’s Latino I told him yes you never have the right to put your hands on someone in a harmful way no matter the race. Also he was verbally abusive screaming in my face fuck you. 

During fights like these he says things that are hurtful and not true. For instance I keep him from his family. First off they live 30 minutes away. I’ve told him they can come over countless times or he can go there. Even tonight he could’ve and didn’t. Or saying he’s thought for awhile about leaving because I’m so bad. In my mind I am always loving on him. The only excuse he could come up with me being a bad person? Me saying dumb shit about my job. He goes far as to make things up about me treating people bad. This is the guy who told the guy behind us at target to back up just because he was too close and looked homeless. Yet I treat people bad???? 

It’s sad because the person he was last night was not this at all. He was sweet and loving. We were having fun. I thought he was the one for me. He’s even talked about marriage a few times recently. Which is funny considering him saying he felt forced to be with me lol. I have given him so many outs it’s sad. Practically begging him to not be with me if he didn’t want to at any point and don’t waste my time. 


I’ve been in a serious abusive relationship before and I know will get worse. First ex put me in hospital and went to jail. I moved with friends. Now I’m not so lucky as idk if police would do anything but aggravate this. Also I have no where to go. He’s threatened to tell my jobs things of my past to. 


Now I’m not saying I’m an angel. I can admit when I did something. Tonight the way he acted I’m shocked. In no way was acceptable. How do I get away????",15Jun2020,1

Let’s just say that he ‘got around’ a lot during highschool. Even while talking to me, he was messing around with other girls, including best friends of mine that were incredibly close at the time. 

He’s slept with a lot of people, like, a freaking lot. It bothers me to know how much he slept around while and before dating me. 

Now, I have friends of mine planting ideas in my head. That he ‘settled’ for me now that nobody else wants him. That he got to have his fun and do whatever he wanted before, and now he could just have me back after everything bad he’s done because he knows I still love him. 

Everything hurts so much. I don’t trust him talking to any girls anymore because of all the cheating and sleeping around he did. I’m constantly paranoid and upset, and it’s destroying me. 

Please, give me some advice. Don’t be too hard on me in the comments, I’m just a teenage girl hopelessly in love.",15Jun2020,1
347,"My boyfriend has a wife and two kids. Soon after meeting him I already knew this. I was told he was “emotionally unavailable” Debating with myself over months, because I have been cheated on, lied to, and manipulated so many times I cannot stand to have someone else ( ex, past lover, past crush) in the life of someone I want to be romantically involved with. On top of that, his kids were amazing and I already knew I would fall in love with them and take over a sorta motherly figure in their life and choosing if it was time for me and  if I was ready for that and everything it would entail. I finally decided I would go for it anyways. Now with that being said, they were “separated” she had cheated on him several times and kept trying to make it work but she wanted to see other people and they just decide to not be together. I’m starting to think it was a one sided decision, her decision.  

It’s almost been two years together with him (living together too) and very early in the relationship I told him how strongly I felt about him still being married and how egar I was to have him get a divorce. He promised to do it within the year. Blamed not being able to do it on money problems. Well we’ve saved for a while have a bunch of money and he still hasn’t even looked into it. So that’s bogus. I bring up how him being married bothers me almost too often. I refer to his wife just as that, “Your Wife” Every single day this puts stress on me. Every day that he drives to pick up or drop off the kids all I can think about is him and her flirt talking and smiling. She asks and he’s got it. She needs money? No problem, zelled. She need him to pick up the kids an hour away at her parents house because she’s “too tired” ON THE WAY! He answers within the first couple of rings no matter where we are or what we’re doing together if it’s her.  But my calls get voicemails, sometimes my texts don’t even get replies. They have their phone service together and insurance. He knows this all bothers me and just calls himself a piece of shit for it. 

The last couple of months I’ve been sick ( not COVID) Panic attacks night terrors are common symptoms I have along with vomiting bouts before after and during. It’s terrifying and I feel like everything in my life’s going to hell when it’s happening. Tonight I had a bout and my paranoia got to me. I regularly go through his phone, he knows this and I never really find anything but if he’s getting messaged by some hottie I’ll delete them. Tonight I had a feeling to look for texts and photos though. He has photos from the last 4+ years in there. Including wife pictures. In text pictures you can also see nudes and naked videos she’s sent him YEARS ago. I almost puked. My heart feels broken. He can’t completely erase a woman whose the mother of his children I know that but keeping things like that? I found messages from the week before we started dating where she asked him if he was spending the night. He said no after he started seeing me but I cannot help but feel like my want for him is the only thing keeping him with me. He doesn’t have any dreams, aspirations or goals. Whatever I want to do is what he says he wants to do. I have to initiate most sex and sometimes I can’t even get him to want me without fondling him or touching him. He doesn’t reply to sexy pictures or sexts, and he says it’s because he doesn’t know how.... if he used to get these sexts and bj POV videos from his wife... it’s hard to believe. He’s never been very kinky with me despite my tries.  

I love this man, he’s good to me in every way a man should but I don’t think I can live with knowing I have to share him with another woman for the rest of our lives. Him keeping those photos cannot be a good thing. Will he just deny knowing about them ? Can I trust that? Will I always feel like I’m not enough and his second choice because he can’t have just her? If he gets a divorce and those feelings don’t go away what do I even do then? I’m having a hard time seeing this situation resolved, I just hope an outside viewer tell me AITA? Over reacting isn’t something I do with everything but I have under reacted and Ben hurt worse in the past and I don’t want to go down that path again.",15Jun2020,1
349,"I’m talking tiny shards that come off at the end of the bone where the rib is cut, presumably with a bandsaw (I read). None more than a 1-4 cm long and the same wide.

Now it’s not so much I’m worried about those fragments seeing as I could easily remove most of them. However, the tiny pieces that were shrapnel of the larger fragments pose a bigger threat to my finished project. 

There are minuscule pieces that would ruin the meal. I’m talking, can only see if you feel for them due them being so tiny. I mean, how many could potentially be in the rib? Then I’m biting into my sticky, juicy, voluptuous fall off of the bone ribs and as I’m savoring the bite - crunch. A tiny sphere of bone, no bigger than .1 cm in diameter ruins my meal, uand for the bigger ones, potentially break a tooth. 

I tried removing the bone and washing them, but I’m still worried bone could be trapped in the meat.

My question is - does this warrant returning them... a second time? The first were much worse and although these are better, the ribs still contain fragments of bone. 

Also, why does no one ask about this? I could hardly find anything online. Is it part of the rib cooking process and the fragments soften while being smoked? Or am I getting screwed over with who I’m buying the meat from?",15Jun2020,1
350,"Me and my best friend do everything together. But it’s gotten to a point where he tries to be a know-it-all even in subjects he knows nothing about. It really gets under my skin.

And when we play video games (which I’m not good at) he boasts not stop almost to a point where it’s aggravating. I’ve tried confronting him about this issue, but his resolve is to get used to it. But I don’t want to. A little banter is fine. But for long periods of time I just want to sock him.

Hello all, I know I may get hate comments but if you have something productive to say, then please do. 

The argument we had were about the recent protests in the United States. We talked about it and I said I didn’t want to get involved because I have a lot going on in my life and I haven’t had the time to really look into it. 

For some reason, they took that as I didn’t care and I was being insensitive but I didn’t mean it like that. They spent about fifteen minutes telling me how much of an ass I was while I just sat there taking it. I understand completely how they feel and why they are upset but I didn’t mean to come off as insensitive, which I tried to say multiple times.

We talked after they calmed down and I apologized but they didn’t, cause they said they didn’t feel like they had to, which is fine, but it does rub me the wrong way. I don’t want to leave them but I don’t know, I just feel really upset and I may need a few days or so away from them.

I know I am wrong for not being educated and not trying to be educated, but that doesn’t mean I think the whole movement is wrong (which is something they also assumed). I just don’t know. I know I was wrong with how I said it (because I know it was a bit insensitive) but I just feel a bit angry about it. Like, I didn’t mean to come off as that and I apologized but that didn’t mean I needed to hear all that.

I even had to spend the next 15 minutes of them crying and I had to tell them it’s okay. You didn’t scare me away. I completely understand (which I do). But how they argued with me was something I don’t know if I can forgive right now. What do I do? Am I justified or am I being an ass?",15Jun2020,1

359,Since 2020 started I found myself in an abusive relationship until Feb. This girl can destroy me and get me into legal trouble for sending nudes. She sent more than me but I doubt that would be important. In today's society you believe all women and the man is always wrong. She got a screenshot of me using rather colorful language and passed it off to her friend which got me sent death threats and I got a 4-day suspension. I'm afraid she will come back and get me into more trouble. I live in constant fucking fear of that. I feel like someone out there is out trying to assassinate me. I have that constant deep stomach fear. Not even my parents know most of that because god knows they would inadvertently indict me. My grades have been shit since 6th grade. I haven't been doing good at all. I failed 2 core classes this year. Math and English. I will probably have to repeat them next year. I met 2 polish celebrities and formed a great friendship... Then that all fell to shit too. I am also in constant fear of legal trouble against me for stealing stuff if I am caught. I don't know how to dig myself out of this hole. I am hoping the summer can bring me something.

363,"Title may seem a bit off, and please bare with me.

So right now I'm (25F) single, have been for 19 months but it wasn't until recently my ex decided he'd gotten his use from me and fucked me off. I'm dealing with the pain and trauma of a 2 year abusive relationship and extra 18 months of abuse outside of it. I'm fucked.

Somehow though, Ive attracted more men now than before (all online though, shocker) including a friend (23M) I made last year, who I kinda wanna have a little something with. He knows my whole situation, as was there through most of those months, even answering calls when I was freaking out and in tears. He has changed a lot though and is planning to join the marines, but claims he likes me and such, just his focus is in the marines. I get that, I can't be in a relationship right now, all cool.

However he doesn't use his phone a lot, so I don't get to talk to him much, nor does he reply too often. He treats me well when we talk, things now getting a little dirty, but despite him telling me he *really* likes me, I feel as if that's not entirely true as he still keeps to his routine of ""not touching his phone at all until the evening"" - which honestly, may just be me and my issues. 

I was wondering if there was a healthy, positive way of getting him more engaged, or wanting more. Having some way to get him to talk to me just a little more, be a little more attentive, without seeming needy, desperate or clingy. I also don't want to ask just yet, as I feel that's not fair and also kind of...forced, if that makes sense. 

He's reassured me he's not avoiding me, that this was just how he's been for some time now, that nothing is outside the norm. He also seems to be so genuine with his words, and was extremely upset at hurting me recently, telling me he'll show me that he means what he says, etc. He claims he really likes me, and so on, too.
 I'm trying to not overthink and push, and work on these pesky issues my wonderful ex left me to deal with. Trust is hard rn, he knows, but it's why I need some neutral points of view. 

Any questions are welcome, since I may have no made much sense or explained much. Thank you!",15Jun2020,1
364,"Basically and I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible.
He was the only best friend I've ever had and I had to block him.
It all started when he started dating a girl who basically hates me/our friendship. I never met her and I don't really know anything about her besides the fact that she wishes I didn't exist but the truth is that she actually seems like a nice lady and I feel like I would like her if she didn't hate me haha. 
Anyway... My ex-best friend did try his best to keep our friendship and their relationship alive but he would often go weeks without texting me back but then he would come back as if nothing happened and his excuse was that he was always busy. This kept happening for 1 year until I sat down with him and explained that it was okay if he didn't wanna be friends with me anymore, I would be sad but I would respect it and get over it and I explained that I will never be mad at someone for something like that because people aren't forced to stay friends forever and sometimes they outgrow each other and stop relating to each other but I was just so tired of him ignoring my texts for weeks and making me feel unwanted, humiliated and sad. He proceeded to tell me that he never wanted to end our friendship and that he will always fight for our friendship. He also said that he loved me and he promised things would change. Things did change for a few weeks but then the same thing kept happening so I did him a favour and I blocked him everywhere and we haven't talked since January/February - basically I adopted a kitten with his help and he got sick, I kept texting him to let him know that the kitten was sick but he never replied and I was really mad at him and I felt so abandoned and betrayed that I blocked him everywhere (the kitten passed away a few weeks later).
Tonight I was told by a mutual friend that something really bad happened and I love him so much and I know I shouldn't even consider texting him but I hate thinking that he is going through a tough time and I'm not there for him, you know? But also he clearly didn't want to be my friend anymore so I don't think receiving a text from me would make him feel better. I'm afraid of his reaction, I mean I did block him after all... I also don't really know what to say ""hi I know we haven't spoken in months but I just wanna say that I heard about what happened and I'm sorry"" just doesn't seem right...

My uncle and my aunt have been living there for 30+ years, so I was really happy when they accepted me to live with them. Pretty much in my country I have 1 year of experience in working in forex center, but as what you suppose it’s not really useful in the current situation. So my uncle is super cocky and rude person, really intelligent and always sarcastic with me. He never accepted me as a part of the family and have never treated me like a relative. In my whole life he was telling me to give up my dreams, because with dreams nobody succeeded and says that I probably am saying to myself I will succeed, but this is not how it works, he says. I’ve always been determined to myself, always wanted more and always wanted to be well educated and as well well informed. He is dream killer, killed my dreams with the football, when I was 13 he said that already boys at my age were seen by scouts, so they will play big football, but not me, he killed my dream back then, even though I started since I was 5, I stopped at 17 though, but it was always on my mind. As well in my last job he was saying that nobody become rich from working in forex centers, so I better quit and do something with my hands. I don’t know why he is like that. Anyway, I said he changed and he really wants to help me out, he is giving me a roof, so I am thankful for that. So he has pretty big firm here in Scandinavia and there are 50+ working for him, he is pretty cool with them. I never really enjoyed that job, even though I was doing it. So before a month super bad pain comes in my back. It’s really back, I couldn’t barley walk. He said I am looking for excuses and I should not stop. I went to doc and therapy and they said it’s not good for me to continue doing it, because I have some kind of displacement of my tibia and I need therapy, as well I have something in lower back, which also requires therapy, so the therapist said that at least one or two months I should not go for that job. I asked my uncle and he said I will do something not that heavy, but our working hours are insane, we start at 7 and we finish around 8, and on the final it’s the same pain. So I took a week off and yesterday I asked him should I go to work tomorrow he replied ,, do you have anything better to do here? ‘’ So I am at work again, again in disgusting pain. As well because we live in Scandinavia I decided to start online lessons for the language, because I am really determinnetdd to learn the language, he said it’s a waste of money and I don’t need it, he even started shouting at me why I did it and that I will eventually learn it. How am I supposed to learn it when I don’t have to be around local people who speaks the language and with that job, only with people from my country? I need an advice what to do, as well how can I start something online, so I can make a living here without that? Finding another job is not an option, because I don’t know the language and pretty much everybody do speak English. I am desperate and I really don’t know what to do at that very moment.

368,"So, a little bit of a context first. We live in an Eastern European country, where it's fairly common to live with your parents deep into your 20's. This is not due to the population being conservative, but mainly due to the material reasons.

Anyways, I (26) met a girl (25) on Facebook on the first day of the national lockdown due to the corona. She just moved outside the capital (where we both live) to a small village together with her family, in order to avoid the risks of getting infected in a big city. Soon we became good friends, and after a couple of days, we became a ""couple"". I had the time of my life, and I guess she did too. We were nervous due to the quarantine, as we couldn't see each other (for real, interlocal roads were blocked by the police).

Anyways some 12 days ago, she suddenly got cold. No romantic messages, no sweet words, ""love doesn't exist"" type of messages. I tried to find the reason for this, but to no avail. She suddenly decreased the time spent on the chat. Having to finish some of my doctoral exams, I decreased my time as well (I've made sure that she understands this). Believing that the reason was me (""I must've bored her to death""), I stopped messaging her (usually I started conversations every day). She didn't write anything for some 10 days.

Yesterday, she suddenly deleted her Facebook. I reached out to her through other means, believing she blocked me. She said that she hadn't and that she had deactivated the account. A couple of hours later she reactivated it. Being a superior psychologist I am, I've tried to find the reason for her change in behavior for literal hours. Refusing to tell me anything more, she just repeated ""my life is sh\*t"", ""I've suddenly got cold and that's it"", ""I don't feel anything towards anyone"", ""I don't want to do anything"". She simply tried to push me away, saying things like ""I'd hate me if I were you"". After a couple of hours of interrogation, she got angry and implied that I only cared if she found a new boyfriend and wanted her to be miserable (as I'd listed possible reasons and said that I'd understand even if she'd found a new boyfriend, but that I needed explanation). However, I did notice that she avoided saying directly that she doesn't love me anymore, that she doesn't care about me and such things.

However, as I saw that the conversation was heading nowhere, I wished her good night and told her to contact me whenever she feels like it. I didn't (and don't) know what else to do anymore. I even wanted to go visit her at her village (the quarantine has been lifted, but bear in mind that she is with her parents, and that I'd be a foreigner in a small village and therefore we'd be a good source for gossip), but she didn't say she wanted it.

Does anyone know what to do, or at least does anyone have an explanation?",15Jun2020,1
369,"TL;DR - The title

Throw away account bc my friends know my main. I have told nobody that I am bisexual. Not even family. Over the last 3 years of college I have developed strong feelings for my friend after being his roommate since freshman year. We have had deep, serious talks about life and it’s made me fall for him more. He really is a great person, we consider each other best friends. We flirt in a “joking way”, at least its a joke to him, lol. We’ll flirt in person, over text, all of it. Its fun for me because it feels real but i know its all for fun to him. We even joke about how amazing of a couple we’d be, “if only we were both gay or bi.” If only, right?

We’ve talked about sexuality and said we’d accept eachother no matter what sexuality we were. He has said he’s 100% straight, without a doubt. I’ve said I am too. I’m not ready to come out. Whenever he talks to girls I get jealous, all I do is wish I could be what he wants. It makes me feel so toxic, I am toxic. I’m even rude to him sometimes if he doesn’t text me back or doesn’t think to text me at least once a day. 

I dont want to lose him, and I can’t talk to anyone because I haven’t completely excepted myself, I’m not ready to come out like I said. I know how I feel about him, but to keep him in my life I need to try and get over that part of my feelings. Any advice?",15Jun2020,1

371,"Some days ago I realized that human beings and being human by itself scares me af, this is my ""problem"".  
I've suffered a lot in this life because of humans, my human side made a lot of people suffer too. What is the point? Am I just crazy or what? How should I deal with it? I (17M) tried failed an attempt to suicide when I was 13 and since that day my brain created a ""God"" persona, he killed who I was before in order to being that Persona, something above humanity, something inhuman, something perfect. I have some disorders that corroborated this persona, such as OCPD (Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder) and depression (which might be bipolar depression). But I like to understand how my mind works so I think about that a lot, the conclusion i got years back is that my brain created that persona so I don't suffer or try to kill myself again, that was how he dealt with all the traumas. But thinking of it I don't know if I should accept it completely, being this persona I can't trust anyone, I can't count on anyone, I can't love have any kind of relationship because that would be a weak, a lost of time, I have to focus only in my carreer and my dreams. But what's the point of life if not having experiences? Falling in love with someone, having fun with friends, doing useless things just for fun, having a good time with people I care about, that persona doesn't allow me to do any of this. Right now I'm talking as a neutral person, not that ""created"" Persona and neither my ""human side"", so, I hate my human side, I hate being myself, being myself reminds me of all the bad things I did with people and all the bad things they did with me, I can't stand being myself, it hurts so much, it makes me wanna kill myself, being human is to being weak and accepting those weaknesses as a part of yourself and your existence, I don't want this. What should I do? Because of my OCPD I see this Persona as an advantage, but the price is TOO high, I'm not sure if I should allow myself to have such ""human"" experiences, but for not having those experiences I think I'm losing some important part of my life, should I accept that burden and turn myself into something more, an perfect successful being, or should I give up on it all and just accept my existence as just a regular person that wants to enjoy life? Or maybe there's a way of reaching that middle term without that voice in my head screaming ""NO, YOU'RE BEING WEAK, YOU'RE WASTING TIME, IF YOU GIVE UP ON ME YOU'LL BE NOBODY"" all the time? I don't think I can really give up on that Persona so I really wish there's a middle term I can find with your help, I know this might be some crazy sh\*t but i will simplify it, think of that being an question like ""Should I give up life and enjoyment in order to achieve success and glory, or should I live a simple and happy life with people I like around me?""   
I used to go to a therapist but never told her this point of view but one the things she used to say was that I should ""let myself more"". Nowadays I can't go anymore, I don't really have time. So this dilemma has plagued me for years, and I never find an answer, I ask you to think long before you answer, put yourself in my place, please don't see me as just someone crazy or something, I don't know how to live, I don't know who I am, so please help me, how should I live, who am I?",15Jun2020,1

375,"know it sounds silly. But i have reasons. I feel guilty when i masturbate. Although  im fairly atheistic  now, i still have some of those chritsian values  ingrained into me. When i masturbate, i feel like im doing something thats ""dirty"" or wrong, or ""impure"". It makes me feel like im a bad person for indulging in a completely natural  urge. 
To make matters worse, i got orally raped by my half brothers  when i was  3. A main fantasy  of mine is giving oral sex to a man. I feel guilty about these fantsies  because thats exactly  how i got raped,  and i feel like im not supposed to like  that particular  fantasy.
Most of my fantasies also include  degradation and humilation. I feel like a feminist  isnt supposed  to want these  things  to happen to them and that im not a real ""woman"" for wanting  that.

380,"When I'm outside I feel totally fine, a little nercous but thats normal. When I'm at home I just feel terrible though. Today I had a huge fight with my parents and they both hate me. They're nice people and I don't think they will physically abuse me, but I think I'm the problem. 

I've been a trouble child ever since I was little. I didn't want to listen to hardly anything my parents ever said and I was so stubborn that I would fight against every little thing. I just feel like theyre trying to control me and push me really hard when they just want whats best for me. I get really jealous of other kids who are friends with their parents and who don't seem to get so much pressure. My parents force me to get straight As. They threaten to take away things like my extracurriculars if I don't get straight As. Especially my mom since shes a stay at home mom gets very invasive in my business. She needs to know all the homework I have. If she doesnt like the way I do a project, she will just tell me everything thats wrong and do most of it for me. I don't want her to but I can't convince her to stop. My project ends up looking nice and people compliment me but I feel really bad because it just wasn't me and I can't tell anyone. She always tells me what I'm doing wrong and rarely compliments me. I asked her once and the only thing she could come up with to compliment me is that I'm smart. I know she loves me but she literally said she doesn't like my personality and I am incapable of handling things when I grow up. She feels responsible for me just because I'm her daughter. I dont even want to be smart because that means i have more potential and i have to do more or my parents think I'm just being lazy. If i even get a grade thats average or close to average my parents just say i can do better. When I get one score below average they freak out and make it seem like my life is ending.

They say that studying a lot now will give me a better life in the future. Theyre not wrong but i dont want a better life. I want to be normal, be able to do fun things and play with my parents. Maybe in the future i wont have fancy stuff or as good of a job but is it really worth it to be miserable your whole childhood for that? The problem is that everything they say makes perfect logical sense but for some reason I fight every word of it. I dont know who to tell my problem to. I dont have close enough friends and its not a serious enough problem to contact emergency whatevers. There are people out there being abused and I'm miserable over nothing. I try to be as positive as possible. I would never kill myself because I keep thinking that when I graduate and go to college everything will be better. 

Its only my parents that make me turn bad so maybe when I don't see them I'll be fine. Im also impatient and even though three years isn't that long, it seems to take forever. Basically I think I have a mental problem. I treat my parents awfully (not abusive, but just argue a lot). At the moment, my reason is always that theyre trying to force me to do something I don't want to do and has nothing to do with them and I want them to mind their own business. I say things that are really rude when I'm sure most parents ask their children to do things. Besides my parents, I don't feel irrational meanness towards anyone else. 

Ive tried everything I could think of like talking to them, trying to change my behavior, even trying to be normal but every effort ends in argument. Its like im internally mean because every time I try to do what my parents say I'm overcome with a feeling of hatred that I don't like. Ive even imagined running away and other terrible things I'm too scared to do. I told my parents exactly how I feel and I told them I want a therapist or something to help. They just write it off as a behavior problem I'll grow out of. Thats what people told my parents when I was in preschool. I haven't grown out of it and I'm a teenager now. I know my problem isn't all that serious, but it would be so nice of anyone to help me. I just feel stuck and would really appreciate any help.",15Jun2020,1

But yesterday he brought it up again half jokingly but it still makes me uncomfortable. He apologized for bringing it up but I don’t feel like I got everything off my chest. 
I understand the fantasy of course and he doesn’t pressure me into doing it but him bringing it up again makes me so uncomfortable. Plus, it makes me feel quite insecure, like I’m not good enough for him.

I know what happened  to me wasn't  my fault, but i feel  bad because i let them coerce me into doing things  i didnt  know were bad until later. I feel bad because i still let them enter my mouth , and i feel like i should take apart of the blame because  i made the choice to do that

393,"We are both 18 and know each other cuz we are in the same class in high school. I met him 2 years ago. We have the same laid back vibe, are into the same things and have a lot in common. But we never ever hung out. Only to go to the gym together after school but thats it. Also he calls me everyday since the day we became friends. But apparently he does that to all his friends (he lives alone so feels alone a lot). At some point in our relationship I felt like he treats me as one of the guys. But recently since quarantine, he gives me mixed signals. Like sends me pick up line memes but when I ask if he is serious, he says ""hell naaaah"". Also when I asked him to explain his recent weird behavior, he says he is like that to all his girl friends (which I dont rly believe) and then he asked me out as a joke which hurt.

I really really like him but I dont show it much. Anyways we are both moving to different countries after the summer and Im very sad about that. I will really really miss him. I saw him yesterday cuz it was our graduation. He did call the morning to ask me if i wanted to go to a bar for a beer before our graduation thing. I said yes but it didnt happen cuz I was too fucked up (we all drank at my friend's house before the thing). Tho i did tell him the morning when he called that i was going to a bar later that night and then to a rave with some friends (that he doesnt know cuz they arent from school). He was super envious tho cuz he wants to rave too.

Anyways he called me yesterday after the graduation at 10.45pm. I was at the bar when he called. He asked me if i was going to the rave. I said yes but at 3AM and that he could come if he wants but he said he doesnt think he'll be awake. But he did say that he wants to meet my friends one day (i feel like he just wants to see if they are fine so he can fuck with them but idk I think too much). He also suggested me and him go out to a bar on his birthday (in a week). I said that I was super down for that :).

Anyways im gonna see him tmr again cuz we have to go to school to empty our lockers. Do I confess? Or do I not so that I dont ruin our friendship? Is it fucked up to confess before his birthday? Ugh im so lost but I love him so much.

394,"Context: I’m in my last year of middle school. On Monday morning I have an orchestra rehearsal.
Tuesday morning I have a saxophone lesson, then that night I have soccer training.
Wednesday afternoon I have a clarinet lesson.
Thursday morning and night I have a band rehearsal and soccer training. 
Friday morning I have another band rehearsal. 

I’ve always kind of had a lot on, and until this year I’ve pretty much been fine. But this year, I picked up a few other commitments. Before we went online, I was kind of holding it all together because it was the start of the year, and I felt more motivated. Then school went online. Now that I’m back, though, it feels like there’s too much, then I end up missing some things, or getting sick, and all of a sudden I feel really lazy because I didn’t do anything but still feel really exhausted.

Everyday now after school I feel really hot and tired. Right now school isn’t that serious (and thankfully holidays are in a week), but when it heats up next term I have no idea what I’m gonna do.

I am really trying to work on communication including listening and being vulnerable but like I always overthink it.

However, due to the elongated time period before our batch (high school 2020) goes to college, hanging out with the same group of school fiends is inevitable. This attribute of my friend annoys me severely and I'm asking for either advice as to how I should deal with it or I should suck it up and ignore it.

She constantly says she's ugly/fat in manners of complaint, but is constantly flaunting her body. She tells people (those that don't know her from school) that no one likes her and everyone is mean to her, while no one is and she's generally pretty well liked at school. She is always whining about how she has everything very hard and her life sucks to the most normal problems. This one time, she said ""this is one of like 99 other problems I have like this""---very very sadly, to her TikTok not receiving a lot of likes. She gets sufficient likes on Instagram for likes to have to continue being a problem. Everyone that knows her knows about how insecure she is. But her closest friends also know how bad she fakes it. At some point, she was very under-confident, but now she's not and she just continues to hold it as a persona. As a result of this, she constantly does immature and childish things that annoy me and her other friends.

I did value our friendship because she has been there for me in the past. However, this stuff (along with some other problems) has caused a major drift between us. Yet, we have to hang out due to the shared friends. How should I deal with this?

I feel like I have zero life skills and I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle for independence against my parents, who still haven't taught me how to drive. Please help me.",15Jun2020,1

412,"Some background: A year ago, I got a cashier job at a grocery store. Most of my friends and even my current significant other (SO) work or worked there. Now, because of the pandemic, SO is on a leave of absence and currently not working.

Shortly after I got hired, another employee (we'll call her Ruby) started working there. I immediately got a bad vibe, but I moved past it. We don't always work directly together, just in the same store. The only time we crossed paths was with a mutual friend who consistently made us hang out together. Ruby and I never hung out just the two of us, but our ""friendship"" progressed to getting drinks and Friendsgiving with our mutual friend. Eventually, Ruby's and my respective friendships with the mutual friend ended and ours subsequently paused too. From what I know, she was secretly hooking up with someone at work and I didn't really care to get into drama.

Sometime around when my ""friendship"" with Ruby paused, I was sexually assaulted by a recently-fired coworker. I had a panic attack after seeing him again and Ruby was the only person around who I knew more than in passing. I told her some of the details and expected her to keep them private. Lo and behold, suddenly everyone in the store knows what happened to me by the next week. I ask her about it and she says someone must have overheard us, but that I would still keep her secret, right? In the next month after that, Ruby calls every now and then to check in on me and make sure I don't tell anyone about her hookups.

I reported the assault, went to therapy, and moved forward with my life, eventually meeting SO. SO and I were friends before dating and he's generally well liked around the store. Almost immediately after we start dating, SO tells me that he asked Ruby out before he knew me, but that I had nothing to worry about. She turned him down and if he was being honest, he only asked her out because she was physically attractive and he wanted to hook up with her. He was very upfront about his intention with her and told me that once he got to know her, he was turned off by her personality. I was admittedly a little jealous, but he's my boyfriend and not hers, so who cares? Ruby wasn't really a part of our lives aside from passing at work.

Fast forward a few months, Ruby texts me after work and asks me to talk. I go to her car per her request and we talk for almost two hours. She tells me that there's been a weird vibe between us and how she wants to be my friend. I tell her that I didn't feel there was any weird vibe between us because at this point, there really wasn't. I just kinda did my thing and didn't really care what anyone else was doing. I tell her that I needed some time to heal after my assault and that I didn't really think we were close. She reminds me not to tell anyone about her hookup and I say I would never. I still haven't, even when everyone in the store was calling her a hoe. I defended her to everyone else and I told her exactly that. She gives me a sob story about how people in the store say she's easy and while I agree that they shouldn't be slut-shaming her, I tell her to own it. Who cares what people you're not close to say? If you want to sleep with someone or multiple someones, it's no one's business but your own. She tells me guys just want to fuck her and that she can't get a boyfriend no matter how hard she tries and I feel bad for her. I know firsthand how judgmental people can be about your sexual history, especially when my assault was the talk of the store.

In this conversation, I also mention that while I was jealous at one point about her and SO's past, I've moved past it. She swears she would never do that, that she's not that type of girl, etc. So I shrug and listen to her rant about how she's no longer with her past hookup. She brags about how she's friends with all of the guys at the store and ends the conversation with a hug. I don't think much of the conversation and go home.

While SO and I FaceTime the next day (this was in the first few weeks of the pandemic), he tells me that Ruby texted him earlier that morning and asked to FaceTime. He agreed, even though they hadn't talked in months and Ruby had just told me the night before that her and SO weren't friends. She calls him, sobbing, complaining about how people around the store are calling her a whore and accusing her of sleeping around the store. She tells SO that he's the only person who ever gets her and that she misses hanging out with him. SO gives a bland ""yeah, sure"" answer and hangs up. When SO told me about that FaceTime, I'm livid. Here Ruby was, swearing to me that she would never go after my boyfriend and that she wasn't even friends with him.

Now, after this happens, I give Ruby some time to tell me about the call. I see her at work, we have a few short conversations, but she doesn't say a peep about it. You can talk to whomever you want, but I  told her that I'm not really comfortable with them talking one on one, given their past. I asked if she could at least tell me if they talk and she said yes, absolutely, she wouldn't dream of doing otherwise. It's not asking for permission, it's a polite heads-up. Either way, Ruby doesn't mention the conversation and stops talking to me.

So I tell my friends what happened. You know how it goes: you're at work, it's slow, and conversation drifts to non-work topics. I have a core group of five friends that I talk to and I don't really go into deeper conversation with many other people besides them. There are a few friends I talk to outside of that group and I share non-work parts of my life with them, but it's much more surface level. I tell my friends that Ruby is a liar and that she went to SO for attention even though she said she wouldn't. Mostly it's just venting about how frustrating it is that she thinks she can get away with it and how she goes around lying and manipulating people.

Now I want to make it very clear: my issue with Ruby is not that she's talking with my boyfriend. SO can talk to whomever he wants, as it should be. He's his own person with his own friends and even though I was pissed about the FaceTime, I told him it was his right to talk to Ruby if he wanted to. He said his friendship with her ended pretty much when his attraction to her ended, so he was just as surprised as me to get a call from her. No, my issue is that Ruby tried to manipulate me by making me feel sorry for her and then she tried the same spiel on my boyfriend for attention. It's shady at best and intentionally malicious at worst.

This was maybe three months ago. I told my friends to watch out for Ruby and not to let her manipulate them. My core group of friends stuck with me and supported me through this. One friend in particular overheard Ruby telling people at work that her fantasy is to steal a guy in a relationship and shares this with me. I say it's nothing surprising, but to leave that alone. I don't want to spread rumors about Ruby, just for her to leave me, SO, and my group of friends alone.

It doesn't stop there; one of my friends, L, whose husband also works with us (I know, we need socialization outside of work) got into an argument with Ruby over something small at work. A few hours after the argument, Ruby walks up to L and says she's going to steal her husband. L stares her down and tells her to try. Ruby tries to talk to L's husband at every opportunity after that and L's husband shuts her down every time. This is a recurring event and she does this to several more of my coupled friends, none of whom are caught off guard like I was because of my warnings.

This all leads up to the incident in question: as I'm walking with my friend, F, out of work, we run into Ruby. She greets us casually, but makes a special effort to ask me how my day is going. I say it's going good, I'm about to hang out with my group of friends for F's birthday. When I ask her about how her day is going she says it's going great, she's just planning on who's man to steal next. After saying that, she pettily flips me off and sweetly says goodbye to F. I roll my eyes and walk away. It doesn't faze me, people say crazy shit all the time, especially at my job. F is in shock that this would happen, especially in front of her, considering we all work together. I wave her off, saying Ruby is just looking for attention and that I didn't even say she was trying to steal my man.

Ruby texts me later that night, telling me to get over my ""problem"" with her. I text back saying I leave her alone and she keeps approaching me, so I'm not the one with the obvious problem here. After that, I block her. Not even ten minutes after I block her, SO gets a text from her on his phone while I'm hanging out with him and his parents. You know, the standard ""hey stranger"" text, asking when he's coming back to work. At this point, SO and Ruby haven't talked since they hung up the FaceTime over three months ago.

SO asks me what I would like him to do in this situation. He says he can shut her down, try to fix the situation, or play it cool to figure out what she's doing. I tell him it's his decision and while I would rather he tell her to fuck off, he can do what he wants. So he plays it cool (we still don't know what set her off at this point) and of course, she asks him to FaceTime. He says he's busy and she doesn't reply.

The next day (today), I'm at work, minding my business, when Ruby comes in. Ruby is always running late to work and today was no exception. She comes in, already late, and makes an effort to stop by my register and call me a hater, then blow me a kiss. Immature, petty, and unnecessary. It was then that I realized I was dealing with a child. We're the same age, yet she's acting like we're in middle school. Again, I roll my eyes and move on. There's no point arguing or wasting time on someone like that.

I get home from work today and sit down at my computer. Turns out, blocking someone on your phone doesn't block them from your computer. I receive the texts Ruby sent after I blocked her and they are shocking. The texts range from calling me an ""ugly ass bitch"" to saying she's going to hit SO up to see if he's down to fuck. Of course, SO is outraged when he sees the texts and says he will shut her down immediately after sussing out what exactly people are saying about me when he returns to work next week. This whole time, Ruby has been spreading rumors about me and SO doesn't want this to ruin my work environment, so he's trying to see what he can fix. These people are his coworkers too and by saying shit about me, Ruby is bringing him down with me.

So I'm curious: what should I do about Ruby? Like I said, I have a core group of about five friends and maybe two or three friends outside of that group. That's eight people in a store that employs over a hundred people. I didn't spread rumors and specifically told the people I shared this with not to share it with anyone else. I'm wondering how it became about man-stealing and not about lying. I made it very clear to my friends that I was upset about the going behind my back, not that she talked to SO. Ruby hasn't retaliated or talked to any of the other couples she tried to split up, so I don't know why she's coming after me. I'm perfectly fine to pretend she doesn't exist, but she seems hellbent on making work miserable for me.",15Jun2020,1
413,"**\*WARNING: Very short NSFW part towards the end\***

For the last few months I've been struggling with my mental health which I believe is partially the result of my home life. Here's the breakdown:

**Me:**

Lives at home with family, go to school, I pay for my car insurance, do my laundry, and clean my messes. My mom pays for my phone service and has me on her car insurance since it's cheaper than me getting my own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current situation:**

 I live in a house with my paternal grandparents, mother, stepfather, three cousins (21M, 23F and 26F), brother (21M), and two girlfriends (they don't technically live here but one has been ""sleeping over"" for months and the other never mentions going home soooo ya know; 20F and 19F). I'm using my cousins' ages as nicknames since it's easier than typing cousin1, cousin2, etc.

21 and 23 live with us because their dad died and their mother wants nothing to do with them.

26 is currently staying in 23's room because 23 is over at her boyfriend's house most of the time now since my paternal grandmother didn't want her smoking w\*ed in the house anymore. But she still comes over now and again.

21 and 23 have their own rooms for reasons I'll discuss below. Me and my brother however share a room with his girlfriend as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problems:**

My paternal grandmother (stepfather's mother; PGM for short), my brother and his GF. While my PG has cared for all four of us (me, my brother, 21 and 23) since we were younger, she has always favored the cousins over us since they were biological related to her. Due to this favor, they almost never get in trouble (even when they should) and get everything they want, regardless of whether or not it makes sense. That's why each of them has their own rooms while I share one with my brother.

Meanwhile, I get complained to / at almost every time I leave the room for something I did / didn't do. Put the laundry on before I go to work at night?  ""You know you can't be doing your laundry for 3 days starllini."" At school all day and walk into the kitchen 5 minutes before her? ""When I left the kitchen there were no dishes in the sink when I left. Who's are these?!"" Basically she blames every mess on me or my brother. When there is concrete proof that me and/or my brother did not make the mess, she just says ""well I guess we must have a ghost because everyone said it wasn't them.""

She's constantly complaining and acting like every little thing is some attempt at pissing her off when 100% of the time I just forget or don't always have time to do them at that exact moment. She's stormed into our room before early in the morning to chastise us (not even knowing if we're awake) because of the ""stuff we do.""

Then there's my brother and his girlfriend (BGF for short). My brother has always been annoying and pissed me off but became more tolerable after he started dating BGF. Then she ""moved in."" I always thought she was alright but since quarantine started some of her nastier traits have been coming out. She's extremely condescending when it comes to certain topics and it always feels like she's trying to start trouble by saying certain things in a nice, casual conversation. For example, we were talking about something nice and fun and one of us briefly mention something about my brother's behavior, sort of like a light jab about his language or something like that, and she says in complete seriousness to my mother, ""oh it's your fault / stepdad's fault that he's like this."" She's caused 2 verbal fights between my brother and sister and a slightly bigger one back in February. Then when you try to call her out on her shit, she starts crying and gets upset which then puts any of us in hot water with my brother. She is taking medication for BPD and anxiety, but I'm not sure how much those things explain her behavior but they don't excuse it.

This condescending, super sensitive behavior has even extended to our room. She freaks out when I move any of my stuff because I'm somehow also moving my brother's stuff while doing it and demands that clean up my stuff while her and my brother leave their messes all over the floor (empty soda can boxes, piles of clothes, etc.). Something that drives me crazy, that both of them use my bed as a lounging area of sorts. My brother has a loft bed he refuses to get rid of but is also too lazy to climb into 99% of the time. I'll make my bed only to come home and find:

1. Him sleeping in my bed.
2. Both of them laying in my bed since his TV is right in front of my bed
3. BGF sitting on my bed while she's on her iPad
4. Neither in or on my bed, but a mess indicating that both of them were on it at some point.

Not only that but BGF uses the wires by my bed like they're just for anybody to use which would be fine if they asked, but they don't. Occasionally they also try harassing me into letting her use my new laptop for gaming since she wants to play games but her PC is at her house. She is very careless with her own items (debit card, iPad, etc.) so I naturally said hell no. For some reason this surprise them.

So obviously this is a situation I need to get out of especially since I've heard that they'll be converting the dining room into another bedroom for 26 to move into since she may not be able to get an apartment and needs space big enough for her and her daughter. 

Recently I've been offered an escape: a room at my sister's house. No rent,  I get my own room and my mom would still help me out. So what's the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

**Sister's House**

My sister (30F), her husband (31M) and my nephew (9M) have a spare room that they're currently using as a playroom for my nephew. They said they'd gladly convert it to a bedroom for me, I just need to let them know when I plan on moving in. At first I was all for moving in, but after thinking it over I've realized several issues:

1. A condition of me being rent free is that I watch my nephew while his parents are at work during the day. Not like a nanny since they said my priority wouldn't be him 24/7 but I would need to watch him during the day and help him with his work if he needs it. It's not a problem right now, but I go back to school in the fall so I won't be able to watch him while I'm working on my school work, working at night and going to school during the day. My sister has told me on multiple occasions that while they do have other people to watch my nephew, I'm the only one for the mornings so I have no idea what's going to happen when I have my morning classes.
2. My sister is a little overbearing? She always wants to hang out and has never really understood my need to be alone sometimes. People stress me out and sometimes I just need to hang out alone for a while, but if I'm not doing something and she gets bored she'll try to make me hang out with her which is fine if I'm in the mood to be around people. If I'm not though she pulls the ""you don't love me"" card. She says it in a silly voice, but it gets annoying after a while.
3. Her relationship with her husband is good but it's been through some rough patches. Things are a lot better now than they used to be though. Regardless, sometimes they still loudly argue about stuff every now and then which makes me extremely uncomfortable and I really don't want to be around should it escalate. (They've broken stuff during arguments before. Just to give you and idea.)
4. My sister has also been a little annoying about the placement of things every now and then. For example, sometimes I'll put the butter on a shelf in the fridge instead of that little shelf in the door with the lid and she'll yell at me for that. I worry that if she'll yell at me for that what else could she yell at me for.
5. This one's a little NSFW...because of their schedules they don't get much time during the week to be around each other so when they get a chance to ""do it,"" they take it. This can be at any time of the day regardless of who's home. My mother went over to their house (unannounced to be fair) and my nephew let her in while they were ""busy."" I understand it's they're house, but personally I don't want to be around when they decide to get busy. And if they do it with my nephew in the house who's to say they wouldn't when I'm there.
6. They also have mice in the colder months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom Line:**

Feels like I'm choosing between two bad living situations. I don't know what to do. Ideally getting my own place would be the best option but I barely have enough for one month of rent at a crappy apartment so there's no way I could afford the deposit and other expenses. So it feels like I'm forced to choose one over the other.

Do I choose one over the other? Do I just stick it out? Are there other options for me getting my own place (low-income housing or something like that?)???

&amp;#x200B;

**Option summaries:**

Family home: be blamed for messes I didn't create, deal with a condescending girl, my brother and my possibly narcissistic grandmother while also being disrespected by those same people on an almost daily basis.

Sister's home: lose some freedom, potentially face problems with home / school down the road, deal with potential fights and uncomfortable situations, mice in the winter and sister who gets angry about the placement of things as small as a tub of butter. But I get my own room!",15Jun2020,1
414,"So this post will be a bit of a mess, so I will go ahead and apologize for that. 

COVID-19 has completely fucked up my life and all of my plans, and I’m a complete mess as a result. As much as I’m trying to hold it together, I just feel completely dead sometimes. 

I was evicted from my apartment, and I have had to completely upend my life. Within a matter of 5 days, I was forced to move out. This meant getting rid of nearly 80% of my belongings, over-exerting myself in those five days, and generally entering “battery-saving” mode to make the move happen. During this time, I had to tell my brother, who was living with me, that he needed to pack up his things and leave overnight due to some moving complications. I felt completely dead delivering this news. I was heartbroken having to tell him this. 

I also had to move 4 hours away from my fiancé, back to live with my emotionally and, at times, physically abusive parents. Additionally, I had to endure some abuse from my fiancé’s parents during this time. As you can imagine, I was a complete wreck during all of this, and I was also scared for myself and my brother’s new living circumstances. 

But, I told myself I would endure because I had three fur babies to protect (a dog and two cats). They mean the absolute world to me, and I told myself that all that mattered is that I would get to stay with them and care for them. I desperately wanted to make everything as normal as I could for them; it felt like if I could at least do that, it wasn’t a completely hopeless situation. 

Then, the worst thing happened. 

An incident occurred with my parents, and I was too scared to continue to live with them. I decided to protect myself and leave my home again. Unfortunately, this meant I would have to live apart from my babies. I couldn’t secure anyone to take them in for me, so I have had to do the worst thing imaginable to me. 

A friend of ours owns a grooming and boarding store, and he agreed to hold onto two of our pets (one of the cats stayed with my brother) at his shop. I’m deeply grateful to him for helping me out and keeping them safe, but my heart hurts so much everyday, having to be apart from them. I feel like a total failure for not being able to take care of my dog and cat. I am extremely worried about their stress levels. I only get to see them for half an hour each day on mondays through fridays, and my heart breaks all over again each time I have to leave them. The weekends are especially hard. 

I’m sorry that I’ve rambled so much, I am just deeply distressed. I feel hopeless even though I know I am doing everything I can to get them back to me. I’m severely neglecting my mental health because I can hardly focus on anything expect trying to stay “strong” for my fiancé and the pets. I feel broken. 

I know this is a highly specific situation, but I just wanted to reach out to someone who might understand how deeply distressing this all is for me. I am currently living with people who are not very emotional, so I am constantly suppressing my emotions, and it is hurting me. I hope it’s appropriate to ask for words of encouragement from you all. If you can find it in your heart to even give advice, I’d greatly appreciate it. 

Thank you so much if you read this post in its entirety. Also, sorry for any confusion, I can clear anything up if necessary.",15Jun2020,1

416,So I Already Wear Glasses But Is Thinking About Getting Contacts What Should I Do?,15Jun2020,1
417,"Hi everyone! This one is a bit complicated but I'll try to make it as clear as possible, sorry for my English - not my first language. 

I kindly ask you to read the whole story over and let me know what would be the best solution in this kind of thing. I know that it’s a crazy situation where there is no perfect solution, but it's a serious family matter and I really need some perspective with suggestions. Thanks in advance!

I have a 75 year old grandfather who all of his life was a bit strange. He was a professional boxer, pretty good one back in his times (Soviet Union) and was quite a popular guy his whole life. Being a good sportsman he always had company around and he's a person who never could take care about himself but always is offering help to others. So apparently, everyone (who's not very close to him) see him as a very nice helping person.

I'm not sure if that's because of his boxing career but he has quite a few serious problems: 

1. He was physically abusing my grandmother, my mother and my uncle when they were kids, but I guess that were the times (again, Soviet Union times). 
2. He is a hoarder. Like highest level hoarder. He has a huge house in a nice place but it's literally stuffed and filled with junk and stuff he'll never use before (used plastic bottles, buckets, burnt stuff, old bikes, etc.). 
3. He is buying stuff he doesn't need all the time. He constantly buys stuff from TV shows - pans and pots for thousands of euros, dumb gadgets that don't work, he goes to local markets and buys old broken stuff that he's going to fix some day.
4. He’s a bit unpredictable and has problems on keeping attention, is losing stuff ALL THE TIME (lost like 10+ passports, 20+ credit cards, 100+ phones). He cannot concentrate and do something till the end (and never could his whole life) and he can only do physical jobs or something that does not need any planning/thinking (take these bricks and move them to other side of the yard type of things).

So, basically he lives in his house outside the city and describes himself as a loner - goes fishing, picking mushrooms, hanging in the woods, etc. Someone from the family usually sees him once or twice in a month, helps him buy groceries, gets new phone so we can get in contact, etc. A few times in last 10 years, we have tried talking with him about the hoarding problem and he acknowledges it if he is able to concentrate. But, as he's always busy with his stuff, it just went like that for a while.

Suddenly he gets bitten by a tick and catches a pretty bad disease - tick-borne encephalitis (I'm not sure if Google translated it well). He goes to hospital and we take care of him for a month or so. My parents take him home after and let him live with them for a month until he feels better. Now, after a month he’s constantly saying he wants to go back to his house, so we are talking about that and asking if he needs anything there, so it would be more comfortable for him. He says that he gets cold in the house in wintertime, he has ruined the electricity, water pipes are broken in the house (probably because he's trying to ""fix"" them) and basically he agreed us to help him. We have made a plan, that we will take care of the house - get it cleaned, insulated, painted, new electricity and heating installed, etc. It costs a lot of money, but it’s all right - he’s family and we feel bad if he’s not able to enjoy life in his 70s, even though he was not the best dad for my mother and uncle.

We have arranged a few of the garbage containers (big ones, like they use in construction sites), we have started cleaning the house and basically after an hour or so he started to panic. I know that we probably made a mistake there (cleaning the house and throwing away his stuff with him), but it was literally old plastic bottles filled with piss and old rusty bikes. So he starts panicking, firstl getting the stuff we have thrown away and hiding in the other building, then he runs to the woods saying he will kill himself -.- 

Me and my little brother follow him for and hour or so trying to talk some sense in a calm way in this heavy rain, until he goes to some road and my father is able to pick us up with the car. But my grandfather starts to panic again and he starts to run, getting in the highway and putting himself (and everyone else) in danger. 

Now I’m already exhausted after spending a lot of money and time trying to help him, he starts to act like this and doing this crazy stuff, I tell him that he should calm down, otherwise I have to call for help and get him to police, so he is not putting anyone else in danger (running in the highway, etc.). But he doesn’t calm down, so I call the 911 and ask what should I be doing. They say they will send ambulance and they will check him.

They come and and he instantly becomes as normal as possible, but they still ask him a few questions, talk with me and they see that he’s distressed. So they say him that they need to get him calm and do a few tests, so they take him to a mental facility seeing that he's not in the best. He agrees (I guess he didn’t understood what he agreed to) and they go.

So he's in the mental facility for like 10 days. We are visiting him every 1/2 days and continuing to fix the house being happy that he is not bothering us anymore. We threw the garbage away, got his house insulated, heating, water, etc. installed, repainted and stuff. So it starts to look like a nice home. We only throw away garbage and junk that he will never use, leaving some stuff that makes sense (we have found a room in the house where it was mostly new stuff in unopened boxes buried in junk). 

Now there is the tricky part, which will be important later. Finding some tools in multiple quantities we don’t want to throw them away but there is no place to keep them, so my father takes a few things for himself. For example, we have found like 30 of these huge garden scissors. We kept him like 2 of them, thrown away like 20 and my father took one for himself and one for his mother. Now I see that it wasn't be best decision.

While cleaning the house, grandfather is in the mental facility for 10 days. We constantly visit him and firstly he is furious that we put him in a place like that, then he doesn’t want to see us at all. We talk with the doctor and they say they tested him for dementia and he clearly has it, scoring 11 or 15 points (I cannot remember right, but it's still a pretty bad result) in MoCA cognitive assessment test (I believe 26 and more is considered OK). 

So basically he’s been let out from the facility after 10 days with a recommendation to keep and eye on him. He gets out, feels betrayed by us because “we put him in madhouse” and he gets back to the house we fixed for him.

First few days feels like it’s all right, he calls us and thanks, being happy he has all this stuff, electricity, water, etc. We’re happy he is better. He visits us in one of the family weekends in my parents house. After that he calls my mother after a few days and says that my father is a thief and she should leave him. My mother loves grandfather a lot, but she had a totally bad childhood with him and she basically says “dude, we take care of you even though we had the worst childhood, we spent a lot of money, 2 weeks of our time taking care of your house and getting that junk out and now you call accusing us?”. 

So he hangs up and calls my father saying that he’s a thief and he’s dead. My father is not the smartest person emotionally, he likes conflicting with people, he likes teasing and is quite a hostile person. So he basically jokes about that and doesn’t take it seriously, but I can imagine that makes my grandfather even more furious. 

So now my grandfather doesn’t talk to us (me and my mother tried to bring him groceries, etc.), is really unstable, calls my father with these threats (my father blocked him now under my advice) and he’s telling my grandmother (who he visits from time to time) that he is killing my father.

Now, it’s very tricky, since while fixing the house, we have been talking with neighbours and friends about my grandfather and everyone is describing him as a very nice person who always helps and stuff. Even though he must be a horrible neighbour with his shit all around the yard and no feel of personal space. 

So, we kind of feel like since he is acting crazy and threatening, we should be calling 911 and they would probably get him into mental facility again. But since everyone sees him as a nice person, it looks odd. Especially relatives would think that we are totally bad people by putting him in mental facility and (probably) trying to take over his house? Post-soviet country things, I know. 

**To sum up:**

What should we do?

A) If he gets into a mental facility he will be very unhappy and will probably feel very bad, maybe even spend his last days there. Also, his friends and our older relatives will probably be very mad on us and think that we have some kind of evil plan. But there will be no danger to my father and anyone else. 

B) If we leave it as it is, even though he is old, he’s in pretty good physical condition and is very mad about my father. If he sees him in the city some day and gets a possibility, he might try to do something bad. Maybe not, but I don’t want to take risk of that. Also, he’s kind of dangerous for the community as well with his irresponsible thinking and acting  :/ 

What should we do? Maybe there is another way we don't see? Thanks everyone.",15Jun2020,1

I worked in China some of 2018 and 2019 but have no clue how to file my taxes or report this income.

419,"I have always had a strained relationship with my father, and have cut him out of my life since I was 14. I feel like I’m happy and content with almost all parts of my life, and I feel quite confident in myself. But, I feel like I always feel the need to gain approval from older male figures or want their attention. I always overthink my interactions with them, and always end up hurt and upset when I can’t see them anymore (e.g moving workplaces, different teachers that you obviously have to leave after graduating and such). It’s soooo annoying and feels like a void that needs to be filled. I know some will say to reconnect with my father, but that definitely is not an option right now.

420,"In the last year my(F17) (what used to be) best friend(F17) and I have drifted apart. I will be honest that the drift was mainly due to me being totally enamored with my boyfriend as this was my first relationship (at least one that I consider a relationship). I admit that I didn’t really see the rift until school started and by that time the damage had already been done. I made some very poor decisions but I’ve since apologized about not being there for my friend and we moved past that- albeit, not as good as friends as we used to be (which I completely understand). 

Honestly, I’m not upset that we aren’t as close anymore. I’ve come to accept the consequences of my actions. However, lately I’ve been feeling less and less close to her. I don’t know what it is- maybe it’s that sometimes she just acts too childish for me (i.e. pretending to be someone she’s not) or that she’s constantly posting about herself on social media. I’ve noticed that as time passes I feel uncomfortable being around her- not because I hate her, but because I just don’t feel like we have much in common anymore. We act very differently, have very different hobbies, and all in all just feel things differently. We used to be able to talk all the time but now we can’t talk without feeling awkward. It’s come to the point where I’ve told her gf (also my friend) that I don’t feel like we’re friends anymore... But her gf has told me that it was because I “pushed” her away and that we have a lot in common so we should stay friends. I never even meant to push her away, I guess I was just being a stupid teen. 

With my other friend saying that, I really feel conflicted about my feelings towards my friend. It makes me feel awful for having these thoughts- especially seeing as how we have mutual friends- but I don’t want to keep pretending like everything is okay. 

Honestly, I just need any sort of friendship advice. Did I really ruin my friendship? Or did I just outgrow her? Was I terrible friend?",15Jun2020,1
421,"I didn't think they did until my grandma confirmed it she said that her and every one that comes over notices it. Talking to them isn't an option and I think that my little sister will be hurt by getting spoiled and favoured because she has a diagnosed illness that makes her act up. They basically tip toe around her and sometimes just hand her off to me. My sister attacks me when she's mad and i can't do anything about it weather its fighting back, yelling/screaming at her until she stops, or pinning her down. Anything i do that affects her is almost unacceptable. 

I don't care about her illness and I will not pitty her. It's like Hellen Keller, pitty made her worse. They go easy on her with punishments and if she throws a tantrum they just send her to our room. I honestly don't know what to do, how am I suppose to teach her that she can't act out, that she needs to respect what I say, when my mom or step dad walk over and say the complete opposite. They wonder why me and my grandma can't get along with her, it's because she's spoiled by them. She does not get her way when I'm watching her or when me and my grandma are watching her.

424,"Hello sub-reddit

Last week Thursday night my parents and I suspected that my brother had taken their car as my parents car had not been in use for about a week and when my dad came back from work he saw dirt and wet-tires on my mom's SUV. My parents got in a fight about this which let to my dad apologizing to my brother for accusations. I suspected my brother had taken the SUV as the dash-cam had unsaved footage at 11:58pm of the vehicle starting up and the rest was cleared. I didn't say anything at that time as I also didn't want to falsy blame my brother. Now fast forward to Sunday night 11:20ish pm I woke up to see my car gone from the drive-way. I immediately went to my younger brother room and saw that he was gone and woke my parents up. I tried calling my brother same with my parents but he always ended the call. My mother was crying non stop and my parents went around the neighborhood area looking for my car. About 12 ish my parents found my brother and he quickly speed off and my dad was trying to keep up. To avoid any accidents due to lack of judgment my parents went back home. Around 1pm ish my brother finally came back home and lied to my parents that he went out to practice driving. My parents immediately took all the keys and his phone. My brother came home dressed in my shoes, shirt, pants and jacket so that my parents would suspect me instead.When I got back into my car there was a strong odor which was also present in the SUV(possibly marijuana). I had previously caught my younger brother with vapes and told him immediately to stop as it's a bad habit. However, my parents had also caught him about 3 times already. I had warned him previously that this is a gateway to drugs and he needs to stop. My brother is also extremely secretive about his phone and never allows anyone to look. He will delete apps so we won't know anything. Today this has really gone too far. I don't always have time to give my brother advice due to university but I really hope I can push him in the right path. I don't come from the best neighborhood (my old highschool ""friends"" use to smoke marijuana and stuff) however I always kept away from this kind of thing. I tried my best in my studies and got scholarships to go into engineering. I   don't really talk much to my family because of school but now I am extremely worries about my brother. Please any help is appreciated. I really hope that this will come to a stop. I am extremely depressed with this issue since my parents fought last week and just want it to stop.

I am uncomfortable with this as fines have been issued for breaking regulations. More so, when I tried explaining to him while he was driving that it made me uncomfortable, he got upset and began driving erratically.

434,"Sorry in advance for the long post. So last year I was visiting my aunt (74) with my family for around a month. For context we’re from a third world country. Now:

1)my aunt would openly make political statements that if heard in public could get us attacked /killed. Now since where we lived we had no air conditioning, we would keep the windows open to allow fresh air in. This meant that we could hear conversations from the neighboring apartments. I assumed that this meant that they could hear conversations from our apartment, so whenever my aunt made these political statements I was scared that the neighbors would hear it and attack us.

2) I hate to admit this, but I thought that my aunt had found out that I used to masturbate and that she was going to tell my parents, who are really religious

3) My aunt’s health was deteriorating and I couldn’t stand to see her in that condition

So, because of these 3 things, I started having intrusive thoughts that it would be a good thing if she passed away. As I was scared of acting upon these thoughts, I decided to keep away from my aunt and to only do anything if I’m 100% sure that it’s beneficial for her health, thereby nullifying any chance of me acting upon the thoughts.

One day, her health suddenly deteriorated and (my dad later found out that she may be having a heart attack, but were not 100% sure), so i decided to do nothing at all unless I’m 100% sure that it’s helpful for her. It’s worth mentioning that my dad is not a doctor but is a medical professional, who works in a different country (but was visiting as well). Also, there are 2 types of ambulance services, 1 is public and the other is privately funded.

So what happened is that my parents were discussing whether to take my aunt to hospital by car or ambulance

Now, i thought that the ambulance service in our area was quite advanced , but i didn’t know the distinction between the public and private service, and I thought that my dad thought that the ambulance service in general was poor (turns out he actually thought only the public service was poor). The only reason I thought that the ambulance service was advanced is because 1 time my uncle told me of a positive experience with them (I think he was using a private service).

Now, I intentionally didn’t tell my dad that the ambulance service was good, even though I knew it was and that it would be better to take her by ambulance, either because I didn’t want to interfere ( less likely), or because I had wanted her to die (more likely) or both.

Then, I heard my dad say “we don’t even know any ambulance numbers” (he was referring to a private ambulance service, while I thought he was talking in general about all ambulances). I knew our local emergency number, so I told it to him immediately, but he said “that’s gonna take at least an hour to arrive” (he was talking about public ambulances, while I thought that he was talking about all ambulances) and we took her by car. I can’t remember exactly how long it took from that point to take her to the ICU, but at max it took around 30-35-40 minutes. 

For comparison, the average response time of a PUBLIC ambulance service in our area is 25 minutes. 

Moreover, if I had told him at the time of my uncle’s positive experience, he would have realized that my uncle used a private service, and we could have called him and gotten the number of a private ambulance, which would have (I think) an even better response time.

Now I’ve spoken to my family about this, and my dad said “while you were wrong to have those thoughts, there’s no way an ambulance could’ve come sooner (it happened around rush hour and was raining) and even if you told me it wouldn’t have affected the outcome”. 

I don’t know whether he’s talking about public or private ambulance service, and whether what he’s saying is true or not. I just feel horrible that I’m responsible for my aunts death and I feel that no matter what I do, I just cannot live a normal life anymore, as i am , in a way, permanently responsible for not saving someone and no mater what I do, I can’t undo it. I am now constantly reminded about my aunt in everything I see or hear and I almost just want to kill myself to just get it to stop",15Jun2020,1

So I turn to you Reddit, what is the cheapest way to get a doctor's note without insurance? Definitely don't want to forge one, although I have the complete capability to do so.

So this is definitely not gonna reflect well on me but I really need to the it off of my chest and get some advice. I feel like I already know the answer but I’d appreciate some help. 

So it starts in highschool, we met in year 9 and became best friends. We had an endless amount of inside jokes, sleepovers every weekend and were pretty much inseparable.

Unfortunately for younger me, I didn’t realise the consequences and how extreme my emotional outbursts had become. 

I got pretty selfish and thought my issues were a lot bigger than hers, she was also going through some really really hard times and when she confided in me I didn’t realise I was actually making it worse for her. 

Then I got in a manipulative relationship, he tried to seperate me and her by saying she’s delusional and needs a good dicking (she came out to me and accidentally told him when he was asking me why she’s single). He became pretty verbally abusive towards her and I didn’t realise because I thought it was just a joke (he was in my ear explaining how it was a joke and how she’s too sensitive and “needs to grow up”. 

I started to believe him and she hated me for it. I had a big fight with the boyfriend one day and emotionally flipped my shit. I was saying things I definitely regret now but at the time I had no remorse for how it would impact others. 

I moved away to live with the boyfriend and his family (my family was pretty abusive towards me and I believed him when he said it would be better for me). I fell apart with my friend and she eventually blocked me on tumblr. 

Move to 2019, I realise after a bit of therapy that I’ve messed things up and that I drove her to this point. I sent her a message apologising for how I treated her and ask if she’d forgive me but if she didn’t it’s cool and I forgive her. She did forgive me and said she’s still rooting for me from a distance. I started listening to the music she recommended me and some of the music she’s recommended over the years. I left it at that and didn’t bother her anymore. 

I made a new tumblr bc my old one made me sad without her. I couldn’t find her account since she changed her username and I wasn’t looking for her. I made a few friends of my own and started moving on. 

Until I found her account. 

She posted a lot about how I abused her and was the worst friendship she’s had and that I’ve given her ptsd and how she’s finally recovering now I’m out of her life. 

This upset me but I just left it. I know she’s just trying to recover. 

I miss her so much and want to have a connection with her again but she’s made it very obvious that she’s happier without me. 

I just want to know how to move on too. I’ve pretty much checked her blog every day to see if she’s been thinking/posting about me, which she does, but only about the bad stuff. 

I feel like such a creep and pretty pathetic. 

Is there any ways to help move on?",15Jun2020,1
452,"I am a 19F and I have finished up my first year of college. It was really messy and this past quarter I failed 2 classes. Because of the virus I had to move back at home with my extremely strict and helicopter mom. Last week she found out I failed a class the previous quarter. It was a fit of anger from her screaming and slamming things at me while I was having a panic attack. It ended with her cutting me off. It would've escalated even more if my brother was not in the room with me. After that I hid in my room for days since every time I left she would be extremely rude and verbally attack me. It was only a few days when she calmed down admitting that she just doesn't want me to lie to her and that she doesn't want me to scared of her.

So after that I know I have to tell her as soon as possible about failing my classes. But I am still terrified. The smallest things have always set her off and more often than not she will get violent. She tells me not to lie or be scared of her, but her temper will have me shaking for days on end. I am unsure if I should or how I would go about telling her about what has happened this quarter. I don't know this may be pointless but I am just so scared of her and I need help on how to handle confronting things.",15Jun2020,1
453,"Like most other 20 something-year-old college students, I feel lost. Although I had this feeling in High School as well, I usually ignored it and just spent my time playing video games. Because I had not built up any meaningful skills over my high school years, I don't really have a lot of pull or direction in my college years. This has made college life pretty miserable so far and things seem to just keep getting worse. I have very few friends and interests and because of that, I often find it very hard to study and do well in school. This has caused me to mask the pain and uncertainty of life by playing video games instead of excelling in school. Despite that, I have been recently been trying to push myself to learn new things and have been learning to program and play the piano, but I still don't feel a very strong push or pull to either of those activities. I feel like my life has no more meaning than to simply exist and my nihilistic outlook towards the world has made it very hard to pursue any activity with true motivation or passion. I feel like an absolute cynic and I can't find any solid reason to do anything in life. I often find myself envying people like Elon Musk who can be so obsessed and motivated with their task even though it could be argued as meaningless. I'm not sure what I really want out of this post, but my life feels absolutely meaningless and I can't help but feel like a bad egg in our society. Hopefully, you can share a refreshing perspective, but any advice would be welcomed.",15Jun2020,1
454,"I’ve been in a lot of situations where I’m asked “if you noticed this, why didn’t you say something” because I end up forgetting to mention it, literally minutes after I think to myself that I should mention it. I have a lot instances where my brain just notes observations and throws them away without a second thought.

For example, I noticed an error on a report, so I highlighted it, thinking to myself that I should let the author know after I finished proofreading the rest of the paper. After I finished reading, the author asked me for feedback. I glanced over the paper while giving general comments and I failed to mention the error AS I was looking at the highlighted sentence. My brain went “oh look I highlighted a sentence” and moved on without recalling why I had highlighted it or even considering trying to remember. It was like my brain just went on autopilot, noted that it was highlighted, and moved on without further thought. In hindsight, I probably should have scribbled a little note next to the highlight, but I also think that the BRIGHT, NEON YELLOW should have made me remember to mention the error???

In general, I tend to have a chaotic thought process, especially when I’m asked a question and have to explain the answer. I end up thinking of all the related things that might be relevant and try to summarize it into the main points, but forget to mention all the points. For example, a friend asked me what I did on Friday night. The things I wanted to mention were that (1) it was my sister’s birthday, (2) my family surprised her with a cake that my mom and I baked together, (3) my sister really liked her birthday gifts, one of which was a gouache paint set, and (4) my family ended up playing board games until 2am. 

My answer came out like this: “I stayed up until 2am because my family and I were playing board games; oh my mom and I baked a cake for my sister and she really liked it, it had strawberries, it was really good. She really liked the gouache paint set that we got her too. I saw a bunch of tiktoks of people using gouache paint so I thought my sister would like it, etc etc.” I had failed to mention that it was my sister’s birthday AS I was describing how we celebrated her birthday, and my friend had to stop me to ask me if it had been my sister’s birthday. I don’t know why I forgot to mention the most important part of my answer.

I don’t think I have any memory issues, but I think I’m often very air-headed and don’t do a lot of active thinking, which may be why I end up forgetting to mention things as I’m passively/subconsciously(?)  thinking about them. So basically, I guess the advice I’m looking for is how to organize my thoughts better so I don’t forget things as I’m talking about them. Are there any mental/thinking exercises I could be doing to be a more active thinker? 

I also have poor critical thinking skills, so if anybody has advice on how to improve that, I would very much appreciate it.",15Jun2020,1
455,"I (17m) have a fwb who’s about 10-11 years older than I am. I’ve spoken about this on here before, and I know it’s quite an age/maturity gap. (I live in a place where the age of consent with anyone over the age of 18 is 16, so it’s legal.)

I googled it. The signs of grooming or whatever but I don’t think that’s whats happening to me. There was no waiting process, we just got right into it. 

He’s a nice guy. I’ve never felt pressured into anything, I’ve never felt unsafe, there’s no manipulation as we only ever just... Do it. When we’re together he’ll ask me if I’m okay, if I had fun, ect. I’ve never felt more cared for. I haven’t had lots of affection growing up, and I’m a fairly lonely guy, so the attention and compliments I get from him is nice, and feels genuine bc I’ve been lied to before (I can tell if it isn’t genuine😭)

So... I have a “radar” for creeps. I guess, after a few years of it, I can unconsciously recognize the patterns in the way toxic people and weirdos interact with not only me but other people. The way they text, words they use, the way they carry themselves or their tone in their voice... I’ve always felt uncomfortable around toxic people even if I just met them. It’s helped me stay away from them. I’ve never felt this way around him..

I see a lot of people saying that someone - especially my age - is vulnerable to being groomed or taken advantage of when there’s a significant age gap. Is it possible that grooming doesn’t always happen in situations like this? It’s been on my mind for awhile. 

One person mentioned before, that an older guy must be sick in the head for going for a 17 year old (even if it is legal) I guess that it is a little odd but even I find it hot. I suppose it’s a kink, I’m still learning what I like. 

Whats the possiblity I’m being groomed if theres no signs of manipulation or any other “signs of grooming”? It’s gotta be low... Right? Considering everything I just said.",15Jun2020,1

She’s been reporting every incident to the police but so far they’ve done absolutely nothing and I’m extremely worried about how this affecting her and honestly on how far this could possibly go. The person has even started to create fake dating profiles and online accounts with her information claiming she’s HIV+/has multiple STD’s, and when she messages the accounts she gets back a message saying this is what you get for not replying fast enough to me. 

These are just what she’s been telling me but I’m worried that they’re other incidents that she’s been keeping from me. It’s hurting me so much to hear her tell me this things, she’s my baby sister and it hurts. I’m supposed to be able to help her and protect her but I’ve got no idea what to do. I just got off the phone with her and I wanted to sob on how upset she sounds. I just want to help her. I’m on the other side of the country from her otherwise I’d be at her apartment tomorrow morning urging her to come home and screw everything else or staying with her until she feels safe/ok again but I can’t and I’m so frustrated.

459,"So, her family doesn’t want her to come because my brother (I’ll call him A)  bullied her brother (I’ll call him O) when they were in school (they left last year). Her mum doesn’t like my brother because of that and obviously my brother is also coming on holiday with us. 

Now, the whole brother thing is really complicated because my brother was notoriously a druggy and a bully, and basically just bullied O because he acted weird and snitched on him. O ‘acted weird’ because he’s autistic but my brother didn’t know that (still wrong tho). Another thing that my brother didn’t know was that O has raped 4 people. 2 6/7 year olds and 2 14 year olds. So the whole thing is really complicated. Legally, I’m not even supposed to know that and I’d never tell my family that because I’d never be allowed at my friends house again. 

My friends mum doesn’t want her to go because she doesn’t want her near A (which is ironic considering the amount of time I’ve spent with O) but A is also bringing a friend so we’d never really have to interact with each other.  

My friend is also grounded atm because she stole some beer and got drunk and her mum will no doubt blame some of that on me. She also once said that if my friend smokes weed with me (not any of our other friends) she’s not allowed to be friends with me anymore.",15Jun2020,1

466,My brother is 4 years younger than me. When we were little we shared a room pretty much until I was 14-15. We were very close and always together and until today we were still very close. Today he tweeted out randomly that I molested him and tagged me and my dad in it. I haven’t thought about that since the day it happened. I was 11 and he was 7. A neighbor Kid our age had given us a porn dvd that he stole from his dad. We watched it late one night in our room and 1 thing led to another we decided to try what we saw. He put my dick in his mouth and I put mine in his. It lasted like 30 seconds max and we both agreed that it was gross and weird and never talked about it again. He tweeted this like I was a predator forcing him to do it at the time. I know it’s wrong now but I didn’t when I was 11. I feel sick to my stomach and I don’t know what to do.

467,"Hi guys. I live with my brothers and mom in an apartment that we rented (I'm from a third world country, so living with your parents isn't as socially unacceptable). My dad passed away earlier this year (not from Covid), but when he was alive he was always in-debt and broke. So he couldn't buy a house for us.

Me and my 2 brothers are employed thankfully (our youngest 14yo isn't tho), but the problem is that our mom wants us to stay with her. Not only that but the apartment itself is a huge financial burden on us all, with its very high rent and other monthly bills. She ends up taking more than 75% of our salaries and BARELY gets by!

I'm utterly sick of this, I'm 27 and barely have anything in my bank account, I can't save my money, I can't put it to good use, and after mom taxes and monthly expenses I barely have anything left for me.

She doesn't care, and she seems to think that when I get a raise things will get better. Whenever I try discussing this with her, she either cries or gives me bad excuses like ""I cook good food for all of you, that costs money"", ""You want to shove 5 people in a studio apartment"", and the classic ""things will get better when YOU buy me a house!"". She also call me selfish for caring about my self more than the ""family""!

I dislike arguing with her because she has hypertension and I don't want to be a reason for her to have a stroke or something, but at the same time I'm a human being and I've to think about my future too.

469,"I have a current job as a chef in a restaurant mostly 2 days a week. However I have been offered a job for 2 days a week at a previous place that I worked at now that it’s changed business owners and my coworkers have returned. 

The current place I work at I find that the owners are difficult and quite demanding, to the point of ringing to complain about things that are out of my control or issues that I have no part in. I feel like they completely disrespect the fact that I changed from full time employment to part time to put more time and effort into study which I have undertaken during lockdown, mind you I kept their business afloat by being the only one who stayed with them and kept them afloat during the lockdown by making takeaway meals that they could sell. They took complete advantage of me during this time and reduced my pay rate to well under industry standard, they relied on me to open and close and maintain their business and often arrived late leaving me to complete tasks that I should have no business in doing.

472," 

Hi everyone just as a bit of background I was with my ex bf for 4 years. When we were together we shared a house that he inherited from his parents. He said he felt like I did'nt contribute enough to the relationship and acted as though I had no investment in him. He would cook me my favorite foods, pick out shows for us to watch, give me back rubs and meet me after work etc etc. He told me I put in no effort sexually. I would not dress up how he wanted and am not as sexual as him. He also said I would not put effort into his hobbies or getting to know his interests better.

Fast forward a few months later and I have had a couple of dates with other guys but can't stop comparing every man I meet to him. I still feel like I have strong feelings for him and we continue to see each other for tea as we live in the same neighbourhood. I dropped lots of hints asking him questions like "" do you ever think we could get back together in future"" and told him I loved him etc.He told me us getting back together was a possibility but he had a lot of reservations as I put so little into the relationship last time and would have emotional outbursts. I have a history of childhood and relationship abuse so have a lot of baggage which I would unfairly dump on him in the past.

A few days ago he said he was seeing a woman this weekend as a play partner to fulfil sexual needs that had not been fulfilled for him in years. She was there all day Saturday and on Sunday. By Sunday I was an emotional wreck. I could not stop throwing up and was shaking a lot and had a lot of chest pain. I'm a non emotional person so this was scary for me. I kept thinking I had really messed things up. I texted him and told him I wanted some of my stuff back. I went to his and we talked. (This woman was upstairs). I told him I loved him and wanted to be with him and spend my life with him. He told me he loved me. I asked would he stop seeing this woman because he told me he loved me and wanted to be with me. He told me his principles and integrity prevented that as he had agreed to spend the weekend with the woman and he had some needs to attend to. He said he had no feelings for her and it was purely sexual but his principles meant he could not blow her off.

Absolutely devastated a few hours later I texted him and told him it's not just sexual if hes having dinner with her, watching movies with her etc etc. He texted me this "" Ok, I get it and understand if you don't want to be with me that's fine. If you don't want to be friends that's also fine. But you had 4-5 years of me asking and I was told no. I did without and as soon as I pursue what I want you suddenly want to be all things for me (I told him I would change and put in all effort). Sure you can say you want to fulfil my needs , but you did'nt when we were together. If I can wait five years you can wait a few days (to think about things) Please accept that or move on. Everything else is just me being a good host. I don't want to make you unhappy but I don't want to be controlled, You only offer this effort after what I find what I want elsewhere. Where was the care and consideration when we were together"".

I acted crazy and went over to his house after that text. I started screaming at him that he was lying about being in love with me and was having sex with someone upstairs. I tried to get upstairs to her while I was shouting profanities. He told me he can't love someone who is irrational and unreasonable and needed time to think about what I said. He did suggest earlier that day that we date and this other woman fulfil his sexual needs on the side. He left things saying he needs a few days to process and think about everything. He asked me to apologise to the woman by shouting sorry up the stairs but then said me texting him would suffice with an apology to her. He said he was'nt going to make me apologise but it would affect his opinion of me based on what I did.

I'm just so emotionally distraught but it does not excuse my behaviour. I'm hoping someone out there could offer their opinion or shed some light on the situation.",15Jun2020,1

485,"Context: I have recently got engaged and have began to plan my engagement with my Fiancée. However my mother in her excitement about it became really intense and constantly goes on about it to both myself and my fiancée.  She would show us venues far far outside our budget and at length critique any decisions we made if they didn't fit what she wanted.

I spoke to her and asked her to calm down about the wedding and that she was putting us under too much pressure. Granted my delivery of this could have been better: I did not shout or anything but I spoke a bit too firm. 

She exploded and said if I don't want her help then she's not helping and to not speak to her about it again. I responded that I only meant for her to calm down, that I did not mean for her to not be involved and that she was being dramatic. 

For the rest of the day I was given silent treatment in front of the family and my fiancée which I was surprised as I felt this was a childish reaction. I also considered this rude and when she was left alone with my fiancée for a brief moment that day she just left without saying anything to her. This I found rude also. 

The next day I questioned her and told her that she was being rude to both my fiancée and I. She exploded again and told me I had spoken to her in the a rude and aggressive manner. The rudest someone had ever spoken to their mother and that I had shown I clearly show no regard or care for my family as I wasn't being considerate with the wedding. 

This isn't a situation I have found myself in before. I always respected her opinion and knew when she reacted angrily at me it was probably my fault. However this time I am certain I was not rude not aggressive so I asked my father had I been rude and he simply responded: ""you both need to watch how you speak to each other"". Firstly, to me this means I was not any ruder than her. Secondly he was present when I spoke to her, if I said something out of line he would have said something at the time. Thirdly, that he doesn't want to get involved too much or take sides.

I have said sorry that she perceived me as being rude and explained to her I do want her to be part of the wedding organisation and that I only meant for her to calm down with the planning. But she wont back down and continues to say I was rude and will not speak to me. 

She wants me to apologise and take the whole blame for the situation. 

To me my options are:

A) Apologise and take the whole blame resolving the situation. Whilst I feel like doing this just to resolve the situation it would leave me feeling childish and she will only become worse in her arrogance about the wedding planning. 

B) Not back down and refuse to apologise leaving the situation in this state until she accepts her part. However I continue to feel guilty and anxious about the situation. It has kept me up at night for the last 2 nights.

C) Try and organise a conversation and bring in my dad as a mediator. I feel bad doing this as it will put him in a bad spot unless he takes my moms side and might just enflame the situation further..

487,"As per the title, I only really have one friend who I can talk to about anything. I have two acquaintances whom I drink beers with every month or two but I am not really that close to them these days. 

My friend has been addicted to cocaine for almost 10 years and that addiction has resulted in several episodes of paranoia and drug-induced psychosis. He has been admitted to psychiatric wards at least 10 times over the last five years, and I've even brought him in myself.

But every time he gets out of hospital, the pattern of coke use repeats itself. He's a great guy with a very good sense of humour, and as an introvert with social anxiety, it's rare I find anyone I can open up to like I can with my friend. But I feel like the amount of energy I put into the friendship is a waste of time.

I always make time to visit my friend when he's hospitalized, even now that I have a daughter. I try to calm him down when he is high and paranoid. But sometimes I want to shake him and tell him to get a grip. 

He knows cocaine is the ultimate cause of all his issues in life, including his depression. He spends much of his weekdays sleeping, under the influence of strong anti-psychotics.  

Then, when he gets some coke, everything is great for him. He makes plans to go for coffee or go for a meal. He invites me over to drink beers, and I sometimes go. But I end up just listening to the same mundane conversations he always repeats when he's high. 

Inevitably, the plans made under the influence of cocaine don't end up happening. He simply turns his phone on silent and sleeps, sometimes for days straight, after his comedown. 

I don't really know what to do. I have sympathy for him; life really can be a struggle for some people and he didn't have an ideal upbringing. He has also lost both parents in the last year, so it's understandable he reverts back to coke.

But when you know cocaine is causing all your problems and is likely to result in hospitalization in a mental institution, why would you keep doing it to yourself? Why wouldn't you try something different, like exercising and learning a skill?

I feel like the investment of time into the friendship is becoming less worth it for me because my friend just won't help himself. He seems to think it's the responsibility of doctors to make his life better.",15Jun2020,1
488,"I have dealt with the confusion surrounding this situation for over a year now. Despite what my close friends/therapists tell me, I still have a hard time getting it through my head.

Me and my now ex boyfriend had just gotten together, and the first time we hung out at one another's house he reached down to my private area. I outright said no and that I was not ready for anything like that just yet ( I had never done anything like that before) side note - at this point we had only been together what..three days?

Anyway, later that evening we were supposed to be going to this party, there would be alcohol there too. Next thing I know, I'm drunk in a spa with him, and he reaches down to my underwear and (nsfw warning) fingers me. I don't say no and I don't say yes, and he tries it a few other times throughout the night. This happened while I was surrounded by all of my close friends but no one noticed.

The next day, he asked me if I was okay with everything that happened ""last night"" and of course I said it was fine, you know, blinded by what I thought was love and all that. Throughout the relationship becomes increasingly more toxic, he fingered me a few more times and I gave him oral, because my mindset was why not, it's already happened so..

He continually pushed my boundaries, asking to see my boobs etc when I always told him no. It wasn't until after I ended things that I noticed what happened in the spa actually wasn't okay with me. But I feel guilty because it's like, am I just saying that so I can hold something over him? Even though I know that's not why. Is it okay that I realised this after? Would this count as sexual assault? I just feel guilty calling it that and feel like I'm overreacting.

493,"So the situation is, I went through a breakup and during the breakup I was apart of a new friend group. 
So it was me, my best friend, my work buddy and my work buddies 2 friends. We all joined a discord group, we all got along well and it was a lovely friendship.
3 months into the new friendships, We met my work buddies friend in person, lets call him Adam.
So me and my best friend started having feelings for Adam at the same time. For me i was going through heartbreak from my breakup and I also didn't want to get in the way of my bestfriend finding love, so I suppressed my feelings, I couldn't care less about this guy anyways, I did not want to hurt my friend and I had alot going on in my life.
Its been 3 months since and whats happened is, I couldn't get rid of my feelings for him and I ended up admiting my feelings to my best friend, she deserved to know. Shes had a hard time and this guy never made his feelings towards her clear, I wanted answers for both out sakes.
So I decided to have a one on one with him so i can get a direct rejection and move on, but the outcome was he actually liked me this whole time and he was supressing his feelings aswell. He mentioned he doesn't want a relationship till everything is settled and figured out, i agree.
Now i told the rest of the group what happened and theyre all severely upset. My best friend felt led on and hurt that he actually liked me this whole time. She needs space to move on. Me and my best friend are good.
My work buddy and his other friend both have feelings for me and felt severely hurt, they HATE that me and Adam have feelings for eachother. Theyre making me choose between the group or my feelings, thats the only option they see.
They asked for me to bury my feelings for him till they go away and all of us continue being friends with no incidents or i let my feelings get the best of me and I establish a relationship with adam and the cost of everyone in the group.
I feel like utter shit, I never wanted to hurt anyone but I've gone and done exactly that.
What am I supposed to do.
How do I go about this 'decision' im supposed to make.

494,"My grandma died a little over month ago. At first we were all quite patient with him and we’d take turns spending the night with him even though there wasn’t a bed because he didn’t want it as a reminder of her not being there and we had to sleep on the stiff couch. 

Now, however, he’s just gotten very irritating. He needs someone to keep him company 24/7 it seems. Before my mom left on her flight to go to my sister to help her out since she’s pregnant, she’s be over there with him from 7 AM - 9 PM. Most days my dad wouldn’t even get to tell my mom bye before he left for work and I wouldn’t see her until she came home to get in the bed to sleep. He told me he wished she hadn’t left because (in his opinion) she was needed here more so she could keep him company.

Every day after work (I work until 6 PM and I also take 2 college classes) he tells me to come visit with him and eat with him, when all of us are struggling to fix him meals because WE ALL HAVE LIVES and my aunt and her grown kids have children and jobs. We are all just very exhausted after working yet he expects us to entertain him and not leave until 9 PM because he gets lonely... 

In my opinion he just needs to get into a routine and find hobbies and things to do to occupy his time because we are all beginning to resent him. The door broke and while he was eating breakfast with a good friend of his at a restaurant, my aunt and her husband and their kid came and fixed it and I went over there to see if I could find my earphones, and after he fixed it he said “Well I don’t want to be mean but we all better leave before he gets back or we’ll be here until midnight.” He guilts us into staying longer and it’s so hard to leave and we are all frustrated.

495,"TL;DR at bottom. Apologies for slightly long post.

I (26M) live alone. And have done for about a year since me and my ex split and she moved out. For months now (even well before lockdown) I was feeling incredibly lonely where I live, as I have no friends that aren’t AT LEAST a 40 minute drive away and there is nothing in my area for me to do (small town, residential and that’s about it), so it’s very hard if not impossible to meet new people/make new friends.

I am very fortunate in the house I’m living in at the moment as it is in my family (Uncle’s old house) so I’m able to live rent free, hence me and my ex jumped on it when it became available 3 years ago. But, the isolation it is creating was already becoming unbearable before lockdown. I desperately want to move and am starting to take steps to do just that. 

The issue I have though is that the industry I work in (Arts) has been basically put on hold by the pandemic, so I am unfortunately living off state support and Self-Employed subsidies at the moment. I have a good amount saved and with the help of these benefits, I could pay rent in the area I’m looking at until around March next year, but am I right to risk whittling down my savings like that for just the CHANCE of making new friends? 

The other problem is that I’m facing a lot of pressure from my mum and uncle (dad is incredibly supportive) to stay put, as its ‘safe’, and ‘we don’t want to deal with the house anymore, you said you would’. They’re trying to guilt trip me into staying by saying ‘stop throwing your family’s generosity back at us’ and things like that. But staying here is really damaging my mental health. Not just because of the loneliness, but because I’m surrounded by memories of my ex (she left me very suddenly, after 4 years together, without warning, so a part of me is still dealing with that even a year later). How do I make them see that a move is best for me? Can I even do that? Should I just go? 

Tl;dr. Really want to move because lonely. Not sure if I can afford in the long term, but am I right to try? And how do I make my family understand this is the right thing for me to do?",15Jun2020,1

497,"Backstory: they got together in 2012 and have been together since then. They had their first son in 2013 and things started going downhill from there. At first he was chill, but ever since their first son was born, he is extremely rude, has broken my sister's collarbone, always needs to tell everyone what he's done, won't admit he's wrong, won't take care of the kids, (they have 4 now), and I don't know if those kids are safe. He has major issues rooted from his childhood because his mother was on meth and let him get raped. He practically raised himself.

One time, my sister cried to me and told me that she's afraid to leave her kids alone with him because one time he fell asleep in the middle of watching (3 at the time) kids and the 3rd was found playing in a busy street. 

He has downgraded me, treats me differently when my sister comes around, ( I have a feeling they both talk shit about me, he told me this when he was drunk and mad). He's not mean when he's alone with me, but he's way more mean when my sister comes along. Same with my sister. She treats me more rudely when he's around.

My sister told me that she caught him yanking their 1 year old by the arm up in the air. He tells at those kids all the time and curses at them. They'll give anything they want to them if they cry and scream hard enough. 

He is a very bad influence on her and she's become very rude behind my back and sometimes to my face b/c of him. I keep telling her to leave him, but she says she doesn't want to move back in with my mother. My mother is also a very different toxic story. 

I have been in therapy enough to see the true colors of their actions and would like to save my sister from this hell. It is especially hard when my sister is also mean to me sometimes. 

I feel like if I bring this up to them, they'll do what they did last time and try to hurt me emotionally, like bringing up the fact that I'm 20 and still live at my mother's house, or the fact that my dad was a loser and I'll be just like him ( which isn't true, my sister admitted to me one time drunkenly that she's super jealous of me).

Idk what to do. I want her to be free of this so she'll be nice to everyone, but with 4 kids, separation is hard. How do I break them up?",15Jun2020,1

500,"(First post and I apologize if there’s typos, I typed on my phone) I saw a vid the other day about how PS4 parties be through the night and it started that at 9-10 everyone gets on. 10-12 is tryhard hours. 12-1 is toxic/rage hour.

N was sexually assaulted over 2 years ago and got pregnant. She decided against abortion but changed her mind back and forth whether to put the baby up for adoption. She eventually insisted on keeping the baby despite me saying how difficult it would be, but at that point she had a job and it was possible to make it work with my help. But since having the baby her mental health deteriorated and she lost her job after a meltdown. She’s in deep depression, started drinking and couldn’t hold another job and she has a history of self harm when she was with her mother so I am very worried. She also seems to resent the baby. I once came home to the baby screaming and her just sitting there staring. Another time she screamed at the baby to die and tried to violently grab baby from me like she was gonna throw baby down when she was drunk. I honestly think she’s on track to becoming her mother which is why I’m estranged from her mother in the first place. 

I can’t afford to support both N and the baby and I can’t afford to get her therapy either. I can’t bear to cut N out but she’s behaving more like her mother which is triggering my own issues, and with this economy I really don’t know how much more I can help. I think the baby is going to be in danger with N and would be safer with another family and maybe N could get her life together without the stress of taking care of a baby, but the last time I brought up adoption N lost it at me.

506,"25 M. My first sexual experience was earlier this year before the confinement at a massage parlour with a sex worker (how I lost my virginity at 25). Had never been intimate with a female before those sessions in any way whatsoever. I did it again the subsequent day. Ever since the pandemic and confinement began, I have been social distancing and have been feeling very lonesome. It's been 5 months since I had any intimacy and I have been wanting to go to see a sex worker at a massage parlour even if just one more time and quitting the hobby altogether. That being said, many erotic massage parlours are resuming services today. And, I have been actively debating whether or not I should go. I feel like getting it done (whilst taking the precautions of wearing a mask etc) and removing that huge weight off my shoulders (the lack of intimacy plus the indecision around pursuing this) then resuming the social distancing afterwards. Since they are resuming services today, if I go early (i.e. on the first day of resumption) perhaps that would probably be before many customers have had visited so I suppose maybe perhaps it would mean less chances of contracting covid19. Another notion which makes me entertain going further is that WHO did mention that asymptomatic transmission is rare. I do understand however the claim has been disputed. The loneliness and lack of intimacy are getting to me a bit and a session would do wonders for my mental health at the moment. Should I keep resisting and keep abstaining or should I go for it? It may be hard to keep abstaining. I am in Montreal Canada which has been hard hit by covid19. Seeing sex workers is my only way of getting intimacy at this point. I live alone too and have been very severely isolated for 3 months now. Part of the urgency of wanting to get it done is I am unsure of the future and whether the covid19 will be with us forever and define our lifestyles from now on. Also, getting it done means I no longer have to deal with this sort of indecision for the rest of the isolation period, something which too has been a hurdle.",15Jun2020,1

**“Happiness is only real when shared”.** That’s what Christopher McCandless wrote before his death in the Alaskan wilderness aged 24. He died of starvation, alone.

Research shows that having good, true friends is the no.1 factor in determining your happiness.

Science tells us friendships are fundamental to your mental wellbeing. Strong, meaningful friendships relieve stress, provide comfort and joy, and prevent loneliness and isolation.

So, while many people think bagging their dream job, making good money or moving to their favourite city is the answer to finding happiness, there is a LOT of truth to Christopher McCandless’ famous quote – humans need good friends to be happy. Period.

But more than 1 in 5 millennials say they have “no friends” and over 9 million people in the UK say that they are lonely.

This *needs* addressing.

I truly believe *everyone* is capable of making meaningful friendships if they look in the right places and approach it in the right way.

Here’s some things that I have learnt...

**1) Take the initiative**. When it comes to finding a true friend, you have to put the work in. A real friend won't just magically materialize on your doorstep, so you need to be willing to make the effort.

**2) Meet new people**

* One of the easiest ways to meet people is through friends you already have. Tag along to a party or social event and get your friend to make the introductions.
* Meet people at work. If you have a work colleague you feel a connection with, now’s the time to invite them for a drink or bite to eat after work!
* Leverage technology. There’s a little bit of a stigma attached to meeting people online, but it can be an easy way to meet cool people. Posting on online forums, DM Instagram accounts you resonate with, or try a friendship app: [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) is great for anyone aged 18-35, or [Bumble BFF](https://bumble.com/en/bff) is good if you want to date too.

**3) Keep an open mind.** Even if you meet someone who doesn’t *look* like the kinda person you'd have lots in common with, try chatting to them and give them a chance. They may turn out to be your closest friend!

Anyways, the problem is I don't know how to go about whether our love will last, she told me that she broke up with her boyfriend due to the abusive relationship they have stopped following each other but the day before the quarantine of their country, I searched the likes of both of their posts on Instagram to find that they both have liked each others pictures on the day before her country was quarantined but as of now they no longer follow each other.

521,"Hey everybody ! I am 17F, a junior in high school (like my best friend) and I think she is a femcel. Personally, I only started really having « things » (like making out, flirting and now sex) with guy in sophomore and junior year, having been sexually abused as a freshman and having had very, very low self esteem and depression. 
I guess something just « clicked » especially in junior year. It used to be her and me incapable to get men : now it’s just her. 

Physically, she isn’t unattractive ! Blue eyes, blonde, nice face but she is overweight and although you can be beautiful and overweight (I mean god, look at Lizzo for example !), her lack of confidence and general « treat me like one of the guys » attitude doesn’t work with men of our age, who we know can be dicks. She made out with a guy a few years ago and that’s it. Recently, the guy she was in love with (and her male best friend) got with another girl, who of course, is thinner. That just pushed her down the hole. 

Now however, I feel more comfortable in my body, and lost my virginity to a hookup a few days ago. We are now starting to regularly have sex and when I try to talk to her about it (not to brag, but just because it’s important for me, as it helped me a lot mentally and even if very personal, she is my best friend and we do tell each other everything) she acts really pissed and tells me I don’t need to tell her everything or even anything (like when I have sex or how it was like).

But it started earlier : every time we were at a party and I’d make out with a guy, she’d act really left out and kind of shame ? me afterwards and then tell the story to all of our friends as if I was a promiscuous, succubus-like woman.

She tries sometimes to be supportive but also ends up being really hurtful and brings me down in front of our friends and even my parents as if to make herself look better. 

I try to not talk about guys or looks now but she told me that I was “a better version of her” while also putting me down. It feels like she wants to be me but also projects on me. 

I don’t know what to do and how to act and I especially don’t want to hurt her. I know it must already really hurt when I get male attention and not her even though she’s right next to me, or when her mom compares her body to her friends’ (her mom has bulimia and is toxic).

How do I act around her and how can I help her ?
I keep trying to tell her she’s awesome and beautiful the way she is but I feel our friendship just sinking and getting more and more toxic. 

She can be really nice and then really mean and strings me along like a puppet, making me have emotional ups and downs. She’s very jealous of my other friends and wants to be my “number one” best friend. It’s like she’s competing with the whole world all the time and especially me and it’s exhausting.

I went to her door and asked if she had my parcel, theres was alot of evidence that pointed to her having received it, she got all defensive and straight up lied to my face saying she didn't have it.

523,"Hello, i’ve been currently having issues with where my life is going so far in terms of studies. Where i live (Argentina), most of the places where you can study are public, so you can technically walk in and out easily from one college to another.

So as soon as i graduated high school i decided to try studying Tourism (only 1y), sadly that didn’t work out because it needed economics/administration knowledge and i’m SO not into that, plus this one was private and quite expensive to say the least. Then, i thought why not try the hardest career ever aka Systems Engineering (kinda like IT, this is my second year), and i’m obviously struggling a lot since this one is mostly about physics and maths instead (only the first 2 years, but i still couldn’t pass the first one since i’m failing most of the exams).

I don’t want to make my mother think i’m wasting her time or anything at all, so i’m kind of scared of telling her i’m not enjoying what i’m studying again. The reason why i chose the second one was because i can tell you get paid well for it, and since i wasn’t having a lot of issues with tourism i thought it wouldn’t be that hard at all, and that’s exactly where i was wrong. I feel like i need to add the fact that i knew a thing or two about html and css and i thought i had this easy as well (smh). 

My mother is very strict and she tends to threaten me with kicking me out if i don’t get my s*it together, even though my brother has been struggling with studies until he was 27yo and he was finally able to take a course that lasted a year only. I’m currently 20 (female, as well), but i already wasted 3 years of my life studying stuff i don’t feel comfortable with entirely. Or even imagine myself practicing at all. I also would like to add the fact that my sister already knew what she’d study (medicine) since she was young and she’s already graduated and working, so she’s considered the “perfect child” so to speak, and that puts a lot of pressure on me indirectly. 

Right now i was gathering information together on what i do like and what i don’t, and what i find easy to understand and what not. Long story short, i was thinking either going for English teacher/translator (one or the other, or maybe even both if they give me the chance to simultaneously study them since they share a lot of subjects anyway) because thats well paid, my mother always adviced me to go for that since i’ve never had an issue speaking this language and to top it off i understood most of it right away, so it’s never been difficult to me. The only problem i currently have is that where i live i’m pretty far from the ONLY place that provides those degrees, so if i take the bus i probably will arrive there between 1-2 hours, but i honestly wouldn’t mind to wake up really early in the morning if i feel like i won’t be struggling to understand my professors or the subjects for the most part. 
Another option i had in mind was to study Philosophy, and idk how to properly phrase this so i hope you understand where i’m trying to get at but, i feel like i’d love this career, everything about it sounds so good and i only had a year of it in high school and i ACED my exams (not bragging, just trying to make it make sense). The place is not that far like my English option, but the problem with it is that idk what else i could do with my degree that doesn’t involve teaching others (not that i mind, i kind of hated teaching other people stuff before but now i’m sorta into it), and to top it off most of the people (perhaps including my mother as well) tend to say that this career will get you nowhere and you’d be wasting your time with it, so idk how worth it it is, but it’s something i really like as well. 

So, to sum up (i am truly sorry for this insane amount of text, i got carried away) i’m stuck between English and Philosophy, but i’m rather scared of having this conversation with my mother again. And by the way things are going right now with the pandemic, if the quarantine ends before the year does itself, i’d be free doing nothing. Of course, i’d try to at least find a part-time job to save some money in the meanwhile so my mother won’t think i’m doing this on purpose and that i want to sit on my butt all the time and live off of her incomes. So my reddit fellas, what would you suggest me to do?

Again, i’d like to apologize for this huge text and thank you as well for taking the time to read it if you did. I hope you guys are staying home safe and sound. &lt;3",15Jun2020,1

525,"So my boyfriend of 6 years randomly broke up with me to focus on himself. Was a shock for me and I'm hurting. Sounds silly but I'm really struggling with the idea he doesn't care. I'm crying and he's not . I'm checking his WhatsApp trying to think of reasons to pop up (like his stuff at my house ) and he doesn't seem to care at all. He wanted to just be friends, but I told him I need time to heal ...I guess even though I told him not to talk to me, I thought he might of tried..or I don't know. I guess it's easier for the person who is doing the breaking up. Finding it so hard not to come up with a stupid excuse to message, but it just leads to further disappointment as he ignores or seems careless.

From a males perspective, how do longterm breakups affect you , would you be heartbroken in the same way a female would ? Or is it kinda a thing where you finally feel free.
I don't know why but maybe just thinking or knowing he's sad, or misses me...might help me feel a bit less unwanted or unloved. Maybe not",15Jun2020,1
526,"Apologies if this gets sorta long. I work at a franchised fast food place and I’ve been there a very long time (10+ years). I don’t necessarily hate it. It’s what I found after the Great Recession and it offered me good promotions. It has been a bit up and down as the people are, well, volatile. But I fear I’ve reached my breaking point. I got a new boss transferred in who has been with the company for much longer than i, who has managed to hide their incompetence somehow, some way. This boss is extremely passive aggressive and it is very taxing on me not only in interpersonal settings but the image that is painted to the minions (subordinates) about me when I am not there. This boss has been changing things and then when questioned about it, immediately blames me. This boss shows up whenever they feel like it, leaves early and is extremely lazy causing our numbers to fumble.

I’m tired of picking up after this boss, and I truthfully have always wanted to change career paths but never got another offer. The closest I got was being sabotaged by my boss to a potential employer which cannot be legally pursued where I live unfortunately.

TL;DR: I’m sick of my toxic boss, don’t necessarily hate my job, but feel it’s time to move on. The saddest part of it all is that I’m almost qualified for my own store. But that ship has sailed for me. Need a new job. Two questions:

1. Is it ok to tell potential employers they cannot contact my place of employment? I fear another sabotage. But the downside is that this is the only employer on my resume...

2. Has anyone ever switched from a long stint at fast food, and how did you do it? I’m at a loss and need help.

My mental health is suffering and my therapist is at a loss. COVID has me terrified to outright quit, what if I can’t find something else?

528,"throwaway account.  
so three months ago a good friend of mine (17) got into an accident right before our final exams. we haven't seen them since it happened, which is around 3.5 months now - initially due to them being in the hospital and then bc of the virus and lockdown etc.

  
we (me and our friends) miss them. their family is being very vague about their recovery (which is def happening), which we respect and aren't prodding them about.  
they injured their thighs and spinal cord, and will only be able to take the final exams next year, which means they can't go to college with the rest of us this year.

  
this is all to say that we wanna send them a gift from all of us, just to say we're thinking about them and miss them. a friend suggested we make a scrapbook and write funny little stories and memories and such.

  
I need some advice on how to go about giving them a gift, if not that scrapbook, what it could be, anything we should avoid talking about, if it's even a good idea in the first place, etc.  
their mother isn't being very responsive but is okay with the idea of us giving her something.

530," I've come to the sad conclusion that my happiness comes at their expense, and their happiness comes at mine: they pay so much money just for me to follow my dream in a uni in London and I've never felt happier than when I'm there; I need to endure panic attacks, anxiety, attacks to my self asteem so that I can be with them and make them happy. I say this only because, as it has always been, living with my parents is so hard for me: they ask me if I want to go to the lake today (to walk) as well and I said 'no, my legs are hurting from the previous days' and well, that's when they started (as they often do) saying that I don't exercise enough, to be an actress you need to be fit and I'm not, I refuse to go with them because I wanna sit all day on my games etc. They never fail to attack my physical activity (when I say that I just wanna listen to my body and take a rest day, I'm 'lazy' and I 'do nothing all day'), my diet (you put too much salt, you don't eat enough fish/veg/fruit, if you keep eating the way you want you won't even fit through a door in a few years) and my lifestyle (well unless you have talent, you need to work really hard to become an actress and you clearly are doing nothing all day, you're lazy and unmotivated and you don't have the hard working qualities required).
And it's always the passive aggressive comments that get me. I know they're not trying to destroy my self esteem but that's literally what it feels like; and it takes a lot of strength for me to just ignore it. I say that I'm happy with the way I eat and the way I look and BAM suddenly my mom comes in saying that ""you think you eat healthy? And what about all the bacon you eat?"" literally only because ONCE I showed her the pic of me and my boyfriend cooking an American breakfast.
And whenever I say that I am so happy with friends in England, their answer is 'well cause they would never tell you the truth (that you don't do enough of this, whatever that is) cause they are just friends, so that's why according to them all I want is for my parents to' lie' to me and tell me that I'm good the way I am. 
I think I came to the conclusion that for the time I am with then  I should just do everything they say, even if it makes me unhappy, because it will make them happy and there will be no arguments.",15Jun2020,1
532,"I've had this online friend for over a year now. She used to be really great, she's introduced me to a lot of music and movies and video games too. The thing is, over the last 3-4 months, her mental health has been degrading, and even though I've tried to help her in any way I can, including sacrifice my own health (I've pulled all-nighters for days on end to help them, which affected my sleep cycle more than it did theirs because of the time difference).

She's quite suicidal and has even tried cutting themselves. And she's sent me pictures of the cuts even though I very clearly stated that I didn't want to see it, (I'm very squeamish and iffy when it comes to blood and pain). 

One thing I'd like to say (maybe because I want to get it out of my system more than the fact that it may be important information) I've often caught her lying about or exaggerating causes for their depression and whatnot. For example, one of her biggest ranting points is her father, who is -from what she's described to me- very abusive. But I've heard her father while vcing with her multiple times, and even when angry, he sounds quite normal. This has also been pointed out by other people in our friend group who have heard her father and how she speaks to him. On top of this, she's shown a lot of attention-seeking behaviour. Another example; she often leaves the discord server we're in after saying something ominous, joins with an alt account, and watches everyone panic and wonder why she left (people don't care anymore though).

I've definitely realised how bad this has gotten and although I insisted for a long time for her to see a professional, she hasn't tried to make any attempt at improving her health. And she insists that I drop everything to help her feel better or distract her ""because I'm the only thing that makes her happy"".   


I've tried everything, I've been honest with her, I've told her that I want boundaries and I can't support both of our problems all the time and that I have a life of my own. I've told her that I can't keep sacrificing my health for her. She seemed to acknowledge it for a day or so and then immediately go back to her old behaviour. She makes me feel guilty when she's not my highest priority all the time and I'm honestly so exhausted. I feel terrible every time I see a notification pop up from her. If I don't reply quickly she starts talking about killing herself and how no one would miss her. I've said that I need a break from the friendship to regain my energy because supporting both of us is quite taxing, but she always drops comments like (and I quote) ""oh that's fine I understand, I guess I'm just too much of a burden"" or something similar.   


The fact that she's toxic to everyone else in the friend group and is thoroughly dislike doesn't help either.   


I'm sick of feeling trapped and guilty and responsible for her. Is there something I can do that I'm not thinking of? I fear that if I do something too startling like end the friendship completely or give her an ultimatum to get her to improve, it'll be what pushes her off the edge.",15Jun2020,1

i have experiencing problem with both of them since teen, they are both dismissive and pain in my back to the point that most if not all chore on the house will be either be done by me or/and my mother, every single problem will be pointed at me, and every single time i deflect and/or prove a point i will always be the one who ended up be the bad one, every single thing i have will never be mine, and every single thing i do will be judge, and no i can never complain, because if i do i will be the target for the whole entire family ,   


what my father did :  
1. never teach me anything  
2. complain everything to me  
3. always look at me with either anger or disappointment

4. expect too much of me

5. always dismiss everything i did (unless there already a lot of people know about it)

6. never ever talk or listen to me like a father toward son (which i always want)

&amp;#x200B;

what my sister did :  
1. neglect every chore that appointed toward her  
2. always take what mine  
3. always complain about everything (which will be taken as source of anger toward me)

4. make mistake but always make me be the one to fix it  
5 the mistake that she doesn't told to me usually come to me become my problem

6. her wish and ""need"" will always take something away from me, like always (example : she want her 3 month old phone to be replaced, while i have been asking for an upgrade (as in added exchange) for my phone soo i can atleast save 1 more assignment file for app testing)

7. according to what i gather she see me as a ""weight""

what is the reason that make you snap and post this you might ask  
 

because  today my father angry because i didn't hear him to open the front door of the house and take my answer and prove of me doing an assignment review for me disrespecting him, while a while my sister is literally 5 meter away from the door, when i ask where she is he said that she is in the bathroom, like seriously 5 minute before he arrived she was just lay down on the sofa while playing with her phone

&amp;#x200B;

do you want to fix this relationship you have toward them?

  
yes of course , but by the look of it and by the way of how thing is i'm currently at 30% interest of caring or even thinking about them

you are 20 y/o you should have a job and place at this point right?

537,"Okay so this is so dumb! But I'm pretty conflicted.

I dated this guy (let's call him John) way back when I was 17, we didn't last very long and at the time he was abstinent. Flash forward to February of this year, he had reached out and tried to make a move. I rejected his advances because I knew he didn't actually like me, he was just horny and lonely. Though since then I've entertained the idea of just going for it just for fun. 

I guess my issue is that I feel somewhat insecure? Like I've been with two other guys I seriously dated after I dated John, and for some reason I feel the need to add him to my bed post because he was the first guy I seriously dated and I also feel the need to get my count up to three? Superficial reasons, basically.  I'm not lusting after him, really, I just sort of want to do it just because I may have the opportunity. Not even for bragging rights or anything like that, I honestly probably wouldn't tell anyone that it happened if it were to happen. Just for me, as an adventure maybe? I've never been the type to just go have sex for the sake of it, and it's something I kind of want to try just once. 

The reason I hesitate is because I know this comes from a place of danger-seeking and wanting to be a little daring in my youthful, sexual escapades but I'm also about to start seeing a new guy, who we will call Joe. Joe is super cool and we've been on one date already, planning another one sometime soon. I know we will probably be serious sometime in the future, so maybe that's why I've started to feel like I need to get John out of my system now? Like this may be my last opportunity (for the foreseeable future) to do something raunchy and stupid? I just don't know why I feel so compelled to do it, anyway.

Ok so me and my freinds family are really close to the point where not only his parents but his aunts, ubcles and grandparents tell me Im part of the family and can visit even if im not freinds with him anymore. I visit them without my freind sometimes too.

Anyways over the course of the past years iv gotten to know her more and at the beggining of my senior year I developed major feelings to her.

Things have happened with my biological family and now over the course of this summer I'm living with my freinds family or my other family. Because of this we have gotten to really spend time with one another and we even hanged out seprealty. She drove 400 miles with me to go to a restraunt that had a stupid name in one day because my best freind didn't want to go and she thought it would be fun.

It feels weird to talk with her when my freind or the family is around but when its just me and her I feel like we could talk for hours about anything really. We even talked about different experiences we had when we were drunk. She agreed that next time me and my freind  or her brother go camping she want to come too and she knows we drink.

Ok here is where I need advice, she knows her brother will be with his girlfriend and the only other person there she barley knows so she will be hanging out with me.

544,"Physical insecurities:
First of all, my biggest insecurity is my nose. To me, it’s so gigantic and it can get oily sometimes because of my skin. Not to mention my blackheads. Other people say it looks fine but I feel like they’re lying... it does look big. Whenever I watch movies I can’t help but comparing myself. It shocks me how people can be so pretty, and though I’m fortunate for my looks already, I clearly do not look like any actress. I don’t want plastic surgery because it can go so wrong, and the cost is outrageous. Also, I know that god made me the way I am so I want to be able and accept myself. 

Mental insecurities:
This is kind of how I am: I’m an introvert around extroverts but an extrovert around introverts. I can easily talk to someone who’s shy but the minute someone talks to me it’s hard to think of what to say. Also, I can be really awkward and weird in a way? Sometimes I feel like I’m too loud or seriously unfunny and it always crosses my mind. A lot of the time I want to change my entire personality, but that would weird out the people who see me every day to one day see this whole new personality. I get really overwhelmed about trying to fit in and to talk to people but it’s something I struggle with.

How can I accept myself or change? I want to become more relaxed and not care about what other people think but it’s so hard. I don’t really know what to do anymore. I’m afraid after the quarantine and summer that I’ll have an even harder time. Any tips to become more confident and social?",15Jun2020,1

Obviously he said the proper slur with the R at the end of it. And he expected a big laugh and we rightly told him it was absolutely disgusting what he did.

I wasn't fond of him before, I only played online games with him because he's the friend of a friend. He submitted a big apology and others have forgiven him but I've taken note of what he said and he's said homophobic and transphobic stuff in the past and I'm just not comfortable being his friend.

I know a little “sexual dirt” about every one of my family members.. they have all done regretful shit sexually. I kinda want to tell them about my “dirt” eventually lmao.

550," Okay so this is so dumb! But I'm pretty conflicted.

I dated this guy (let's call him John) way back when I was 17, we didn't last very long and at the time he was abstinent. Flash forward to February of this year, he had reached out and tried to make a move. I rejected his advances because I knew he didn't actually like me, he was just horny and lonely. Though since then I've entertained the idea of just going for it just for fun.

I guess my issue is that I feel somewhat insecure? Like I've been with two other guys I seriously dated after I dated John, and for some reason I feel the need to add him to my bed post because he was the first guy I seriously dated and I also feel the need to get my count up to three? Superficial reasons, basically. I'm not lusting after him, really, I just sort of want to do it just because I may have the opportunity. Not even for bragging rights or anything like that, I honestly probably wouldn't tell anyone that it happened if it were to happen. Just for me, as an adventure maybe? I've never been the type to just go have sex for the sake of it, and it's something I kind of want to try just once.

The reason I hesitate is because I know this comes from a place of danger-seeking and wanting to be a little daring in my youthful, sexual escapades but I'm also about to start seeing a new guy, who we will call Joe. Joe is super cool and we've been on one date already, planning another one sometime soon. I know we will probably be serious sometime in the future, so maybe that's why I've started to feel like I need to get John out of my system now? Like this may be my last opportunity (for the foreseeable future) to do something raunchy and stupid? I just don't know why I feel so compelled to do it, anyway.

Has anyone else felt this way? And should I go for it?",15Jun2020,1

Unfortunately, the coronavirus plagued everyone and I wasn’t left with many internship options. An old coworker reached out to me basically offering me the internship and telling me how great I would be (her dad is high up in the company). I decided to take It since finding other jobs this summer was proving difficult in general but also in my major, marketing. I just figured it would be something to put on my resume. I’m a fast learner,a hard worker and am typically a jack of all trades when it comes to jobs so i thought this would be a piece of cake. Fast forward to now two weeks in. 

I absolutely entirely loathe this job. It feels scammy, Its doesn’t align with my long term goals and ultimately I feel that they want me to exploit my friends and family, and take advantage of me for my contacts. I hate it. I am heavily considering just quitting and hoping to figure out something else to do this summer, but I want some feedback. What should I do? This is a big risk because if I don’t find anything else then I’m stuck with an empty summer and no experience at all.

553,"So I went to this job interview this weekend, as a background I had a same position job where I was being paid roughly $20 an hour. With new employer, this is the first thing we discuss. I tell her I know my past rate was a bit more expensive than is common around here, and that I am willing to work with her on it and she says it shouldn’t be an issue. 

The following day I’m there all day for my working interview, and then the day after she calls me and asks me to come to the property. I oblige and she gives me a rundown of the schedule that was starting the next day. She finally tells me my pay, but we couldn’t really discuss it because she was doing so much with her other employees. She also had me under the impression that we had a LOT of volunteers (more than needed) and she had three other employees to run 2 small classes through the day. 

She offered me 8.50, which is less than half of what my last wage was, and is furthermore not a living wage around here. I send her a text and let her know I loved her property and was grateful for the opportunity, but unfortunately I can’t accept. She is now blowing up my phone saying she fired her other trainer, and now has NO ONE to run the program. First, I feel this isn’t the whole truth, as like I said we have lots of volunteers. Second of all, this is in education in sports. I have been developing the skills for this position for OVER TEN YEARS. Third... and at the risk of sounding potentially rude, how is this my problem? She waited until the last minute to tell me she was offering me less than half of what I’m worth, and I feel that alone is an ok reason to reject the offer.

see my friend group right now is amazing but i feel as if they all have a secret hatred towards me. one of my friends were joking around one night and i’ll admit that we both said things that went a bit too far and they haven’t replied to me yet. They’re not the type of person that acts blindly towards their emotions. but it’s not even that. I feel like i can’t fully trust them with my heart? like i have my inner circle. and this group of friends that i’m like slowly moving into my inner circle. but it’s always been a scary thought yk. they have this whole group chat just to gossip and talk shit about people there? and it’s not that i have a problem with that myself. but with them it’s like. the smallest thing can seem like a trigger for.. them to all just back talk me.
i’ve been trying to distance myself but i feel a need for human interaction and i always find myself wanting to come back. the only reason i’ve been trying less and less to do that is.. that every single time i give them all my love as a friend, and show support, and check in on them. i haven’t received the same back in the same way. it’s one sided. and yes there’s ONE person who does return it. and i’m incredibly grateful for them. but it’s just. i feel like an unnecessary part of their life, that i can disappear one day and they wouldn’t have a second thought. so i feel as if me being there as a friend, always being left on seen the moment i contribute to a conversation or even just being blatantly ignored when i show love.. no clue man. i feel like i sound selfish. but in all honesty. i’ve spent the past two years being nothing but selfless and allowing myself to be hurt for the sake of others and i just don’t know what’s right from wrong anymore",15Jun2020,1

560,"I am 23 years old male and a failure. I am about to drop out of my mechanical engineering degree of 4 years because I abandoned my studies. I had my worst mental breakdown in my life. I just cannot give a single fuck about my degree. The final straw was this COVID 19 quarantine. I had to learn everything online and about half of my professors just told to study without any material guidance. We basically had to google whatever related to the assessment that they will publish. It made my degree studies felt so far away from me (in a sense that the degree did not feel real). I cannot learn without physical classes. I will attend about 30 minutes of online class and just close the online class because I felt I just cannot care about my studies. 

To be honest, I have a weak mental. I cannot take too much stress at a time or I will have breakdowns on which I do not do anything productive. Basically, I can only handle so much at a time. There is so much stress at home due to quarantine that I was always preoccupied with mental breakdown every day. I am extremely introvert and private. I have 6 siblings so the house during quarantine is very cramped (8 people in a small house and me and 2 brothers had to sleep in living room). So just waking up already stresses me out. There is basically no private space for me to run to except a small cramped hot room that is filled with stuffs. So, I completely turned away all my studies and binge on interesting things on the internet such as anime, comics and forex trading. When I discovered forex trading all I saw was a potential career and so it made my decision of ignoring my studies even stronger but in the back of my mind I knew this forex thing is just another excuse to run from my studies.

I know reading this you probably thought I am weak or sissy or something. I just cannot change for the better. I have tried time and time again to improve myself. I have joined Civil Defense in my uni for 3 years. In those 3 years, I have joined many activities to build my character. I took responsibilities in some of events, sometimes leading and sometimes leaded. I tried to be better. After 3 years, I discover that I did not change at all. I even joined character building camp in a mountain for 6 days and still I was the same person. I was still weak minded and anti-social. 

I have tried many self-help books and methods since I was 18 yo but to no avail. I would stick to them and feel enlighten for 2 or 3 weeks and revert back to a piece of shit that I was. I do not think counseling will work either because my country is pretty religious they will probably say some shit relating to being far away from religion etc. I did gave up on God and became an atheist (secretly).

Please help me. How do I become at least a tiny little bit better human? I do not even know what to do anymore.

TLDR: I am a piece of shit human, a man baby, weak willed person and probably will get kicked out of engineering degree (currently 4th year). I tried many self-help books and method and is still a human trash. What to do?",15Jun2020,1
561,"I've been unhappy with my job for a while now. I was actually a few weeks away from handing in my notice before we all got laid off because of Covid-19 in March (I've been collecting unemployment). But now were about to be hired back soon but my gut feeling is I want to decline returning permanently. Part of the reason for this is my old childhood dog has been deteriorating and I want to be with him as much as possible. He means the world to me. I have enough savings to coast for a couple years even if I'm not getting unemployment but I guess the main worry is I don't want to be burning through all my savings too much and I'm worried it will be really hard to find a new job, because so many people have lost their jobs so there's a lot more people looking and making things more competitive. Surely I could find a new one within a year? I just know that the first day I'm back to work and dealing with all the things I hate again, I'm going to instantly regret leaving my dog (I live in a different city for work, dog lives with mother). Obviously I can't tell work about my dog because the notion of throwing away a job for a dog they will think is ridiculous. If it wasn't for him I would go back to work and tolerate it longer until society recovers more from the pandemic.

562,"Hello everyone.

Because of the pandemic, we were sent home to continue the second half of the semester online. Now that my junior year is over and I have the rest of the summer to observe what is happening all around the world, it leaves me feeling uncertain about the future, regarding whether or not I should wait to see what happens between now and the start of my last year or power through and get it over with.

I talked to my parents about it two nights ago. I shared my worries about my other three roommates and how they are also unsure of what to do as well.

I said if they all decided not to go back for next semester but I decided I wanted to go, I'd struggle to find another group of strangers to live with on campus, or I'd end up living alone in an apartment off-campus in the city. I have zero problems being alone as I'm very introverted and asocial, however I'm afraid to live alone due to safety concerns.

I'm a 5'1 female and I don't know how to defend myself yet. Adding on to the fact that I'm content in living a hermit lifestyle, I don't have any other friends. So I would probably be an easy target. And I feel awful for saying this because I value people for who they are and not what they can do for me, but I feel as though I would need to be a part of a group of people I trust just so I could be safe.

I have been living together with two of my roommates for the past couple of years, one of which I have been in close contact with since the first week of Freshman year. I would be totally fine if the other two roommates decided not to go next year, but I'm worried most about my closest friend. If she made the decision not to go, it would make my last year a little harder in ways I think would affect my studies. And to be honest, I think a large part of the reason why is because I was planning on asking her out before the pandemic swept across the country.

In addition, the school I'm attending has three plans in place of starting next semester, all of which involve some element of taking classes online again - which makes total sense - but its implementation was a disaster these past months because this art school isn't designed to be online. So I'm also worried that I won't be getting the experience I'm paying for.

But I guess to sum things up… is it pointless to ""wait out"" the pandemic by taking a semester off to see if things settle back down into somewhat of a routine? Should I just finish my degree on time so I can move on with life, despite all my worries of how I'm going to adapt to it? Should I even be thinking about what my friend is going to do?

I'm in such a weird headspace right now. Uncertainty is my worst enemy, and if I can't foresee my own future, let alone any future in general, I start to feel lost.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope you all are doing alright. And if you would like, please let me know what you think. :)",15Jun2020,1
563,"I’d like to think I’ve improved as a person as I’ve grown up, but I still carry a lot of guilt with me for a few instances that I really regret in school when I was a little kid. I know that I deserve to feel bad about those things, and have spent a fair bit of time wishing I could change the past. 

There was a kid who my group of friends would occasionally play with/ hang out. They were nice enough but pretty awkward (not that I can talk) and would get picked on a lot. I had so many chances to stand up for them and I always felt guilty when my friends made fun of them, but never did. There was even an instance (only one that I can remember but maybe more) that I took a more active role and followed a group who were picking on them to see what would happen. 

Years later I ended up in the same college as them and whilst we were friendly we never really talked. Our group of friends did a gift exchange and they got me a really sweet gift, I hugged them and thanked them but we left it at that. 

I’ve written out multiple times what I would want to say but it’s always sounded self-indulgent and made me wonder if I was just doing it to try and alleviate my own guilt, so I left it and didn’t hit send. Would it still mean anything over a decade later to say something, or should I just drop it?

I've tried it all; sports, math, writing, acting, singing, writing, drawing, I even kinda suck at talking to people and making friends.

Sometimes I start to feel like it's too late for me to figure out anything, like the regions in my brain that were supposed to be for talent just wilted away because I wasn't using them and now I can't make any. Meanwhile people were practicing how to draw and how to sing and how to act and how to play an instrument.

I have a loving boyfriend, amazing family and friends, and it wouldn’t feel right leaving them. I also just received my masters degree and am studying to pass my boards. But something isn’t right. I feel like this work, come home, study, sleep, repeat, isn’t for me. I don’t know how to get rid of this feeling or what to do!

574,"Hi so. Sorry this is recent for me. 

To sum it up: I am living on the other side of the world from where I was born/raised. My family still lives there. I moved to my current country two years ago. I love it here but when pressed as to why I struggle to find tangible reasons to give. I just know that I find myself feeling at ease here almost every day. I don't have a SO or super close friends (I have made a few but I've never really had that many regardless of where I am). 

So this is how I'm living and then Corona. And I'm getting messages from home and my parents had it (have recovered almost fully, thankfully bro and extended family didn't catch it). And I've been furloughed so I ask if they want me to try and come back to them, knowing it's likely impossible anyway and everybody says no. And the answer stays no until last week when I get a call from my parents that they are struggling with the aftermath of having had it, my brother is unwell, my grandparents are unwell and may not make it to my next planned visit (March next year) and there's nothing concrete suggesting not everyone will make it but. If I'm still furloughed could I maybe come home. And I say if they can get me back I can be back for a month. 

Except when they looked into it there was a question of if I left now, on the visa I have now, I may not be able to come back to where I am now. And I'm checking to see if that's true from my end - evidence suggests I'd just have to quarantine for two weeks which is do-able. But I don't know if it will affect my visa long term, or if once out I will be blocked from re-entering the country for months. So the issue of going back is now looking to be a case of moving back, at least for a while, and losing my flat and my job. 

And I don't know what to do. Because realistically the only real and tangible things I would lose would be my flat and job. The friends I have here are all work friends and I think that honestly they wouldn't miss me very much in the long term. I'm happy here but how long can I be happy knowing my family would like me back home. Or how happy I can be knowing somebody might not be back there next time I do go. 

But then there's the reasons I left in the first place that would be undermined by moving back: my independence, my ability to grow outside of the tightknit family, how much I prefer the climate of this country, how much I love the country I am in now. 

I really feel torn. I've contacted an immigration group to see if they can answer whether I can get back in if I do leave but until I know I feel like I'm stuck between uprooting my entire life here and going back to a country I struggle to love, or stay here and swallow the guilt and knowledge that the people I love are missing me and just want to see me for a while. 

I don't know what to do.",15Jun2020,1

577,"I 21F get free physiotherapy via my workplace at a few select physiotherapists. I picked one that a few of my colleagues had recommended and went, the man was alright. A little too personable, would ask me if I had a boyfriend. He would “forget” what I was studying every time I came in and ask me again, he would tell me he coined me as the sort of person to do certain things. A few sessions in he started to say that my hips were tight due to my back. Plausible, and almost certainly the case, my new physio gave me exercises to do, to get flexibility back. He started massaging the sides of my buttocks. Then the next session he would say that the cream would get on my underpants so he would take them off and rub my buttocks. He never touched my actual private parts but he was very close to. I’m unsure of whether this is like some thing physiotherapist do? I’m really sure it’s not though, I just need clarification and suggestions on how to go about this. I just don’t want it happening to other people, as it made me super uncomfortable and I just didn’t know whether it was wrong or not.

"" he came in here and saw ur breasts and thought you were free game "" ... this particular statement came when i was 14. he thought i was a messy kid, mind u, i rlly wasnt, and he would force me to go in my brothers room and stare at it and ofc snide comments came with this behavior "" if you left home right now youd be an embarrassment but if ( my brothers name ) left home right now wed be proud of him "". hed constantly check my phone and get mad at me for having friends ( listen, whether u believe looking thru a childs phone is cool isnt the point yk ... do what u have to to keep your children safe from predators) and hed get mad at me for having friends ... you heard that correctly, friends were a problem. i have this girl who i met earlier last year, were rlly close and talk literally daily, we'll call her anne, anne is 2 years older than me .. 2 years, and john said that me and her had the "" same values "" and i should just move out and go live with her ... i was 14, once again. he told me if i ever got a job while i still lived there theyd take my entire paycheck, saying this knowing i want to go to college so id pretty much struggle. i had suicidal thoughts starting from the third grade up until very recently. i tried to get therapy for it but it was family therapy, and ofc he felt he had done nothing wrong. he told me to lie to the therapist abt me cutting myself, abt me feeling like i didnt wanna live anymore so i could "" quicken the pace of my sessions "". my mother knew i was suicidal and was just condescending, she asked me if i wanted to go to a hospital cause "" i didnt appreciate what they were doing for me "". they thought of these things called thinking errors, and he tried to force me to learn them but i refused cause i thought it was idiotic. whenever i brought up feeling left out or depressed i was hit with a "" if u learned you're thinking errors you wouldnt feel like this "", i got told that very statement while i was sobbing my fucking eyes out pleading with my mom to finally listen to me. i was so stressed out from that situaiton, i was in my room on the floor just crying, it literally brought on my period... the second one of the month, 2 weeks early. my mother took his side, when i told her about to odd comments about my body she got upset with me. he literally was OBSESSED with making remarks about my chest, the reason i moved out was bc he said "" you need to put on a bra, i can see the whole form "" why making circular motions around my boobs .. like hello ? he was friends with a pedophile, he thought underage girls could consent to sex, and he was just so .. disgusting yall, he sided with bill cosby LMFAOO case closed. on the day i moved out my mother and john were downstairs berating me for hours, some highlights if u will.

This is my first time learning a new language on my own accord. I already speak 2 languages (Tagalog and English) but in my country we already are learning english as we learn to read and speak. Although, I must admit that im not fluent on both of them. (Yes, even my own language)

I’ve noticed in animes that when they are reading their own language they also get confused on how to read it. For example, yato can be also read as yaboku.

keep in mind i was so drunk, and he was 100% sober. before he drops me to my place, (i have no memory of this), he told me that i pulled him into his room and started kissing him and started doing things to him that made him ""uncomfortable"". he said if the roles were reversed it would be sexual assault. but he also proceeded to have sex with me, from behind (doggy style, this i remember for some reason) and i dont think i, a 5'3 girl, can force a 6 ft guy to be in that position with me. anyway we ahve sex and i go home. we don't talk for weeks after that but we recently started talking again and he told me this happened after MONTHS. this happened in MARCH. and he said he felt hurt. i asked him why he's telling me now and why he didnt tell me earlier?? 

because our relationship is mostly sexual i go tired of it and i told him that he's treating me like a whore and he only wants sex with me and nothing else. he brings this up to defend himself and tell me that i have no right to say that because i did that when i was drunk to him

591,"I’m having a life crisis, so as a normal and rational person would do, I’m turning to reddit for some much needed stress relief. 

I’m a 20 year old American living in Australia. I was traveling and working but lost my job in March due to COVID. I since moved and now live in the Sydney area doing work for accommodation stuff. 
My partner that I’ve been with/traveling with (it’s complicated) wants to move to the city and look for work when we finish our project we started in this garden, so like around the end of June. My priorities right now are making money, as I’m in a pretty tight spot, making money to take home with me so I’m not stuck couch surfing and crashing with family again, and to be happy, obviously. We both have go home by September (stupid visas). 
I have an interview this week about a job here in this small town. As of June though I wouldn’t have a place to live for free, and it’d be way harder for my partner to get a job here than in the city. I’m kind of thinking (option 1) that maybe me staying here alone and paying for a room for a few weeks while working wouldn’t be horrible. I’ve been debating my happiness with this guy for a little bit now and think maybe I could feel more stable if I just shacked up here and made some cash before going home. I think I COULD find a job in the city but this one could be available now and would be easy. Accommodation would be hard. 

Option 2 is that I wait it out, go to the city pretty broke in a few weeks and look for work with my partner. It would be easy and maybe take a week or so, but I could hole up there until my time is up and I go home with some money with the bank

I guess option 3 is go home soon. I have some money here coming in and am still waiting on my tax return and hopefully stimulus (fingers crossed). I could barely buy a ticket home and crash at a friends in a city at home and find work there. I DO want to be home right now to see my family, my niece, and be around to support all of the BLM causes right now. I think it’s a pretty important time in history in America at the moment and I’d love to experience it.

592,"My husband didn’t defend me to his friend, when his friend said I was having a temper tantrum

With covid, my husband and I are working from home. We decided to take our dogs on a road trip and stay in an Airbnb in a small town in Colorado, where one of his best friends lives (call him D)

His friend has a big pit bull, super sweet but just a puppy. He’s going to training and day camp, but even D admits his socialization is messed up during a critical part of his puppyhood. Naturally, we were all nervous about introducing the dogs. 

Our dogs are two small mini Aussies. One of them is about 35lbs and has always had a timid/nervous personality. The other is 30 lbs and is the exact opposite happy go lucky puppy. 

We get there and do the backyard intro and i notice D is just telling us it’s totally ok for our dogs to bite his, because that’s how his dog will learn not to get in their face. He’s also got  shock collar on (from his training class instruction) so he said he’d shock him if anything goes wrong. His dog is 4-6 times my dogs size.  We focus a lot of energy on his dog and i notice our dogs/ the Aussies are getting more and more aggressive. Warning signs up the ass, snarling ten times in a row and his puppy pit bull is not getting the message. I start to intervene and my husband starts yelling at me that i need to leave them. We get in an argument about it, my point being it’s great we are teaching D’s dog, but right now we are ALSO teaching our dogs it’s ok to be aggressive ten times in a row and not helping deescalate. We don’t conclude our argument really but the dogs calmed a bit and we moved on.  

When we get into the car my husband apologizes to me in private and says he thinks I’m right, we need to train from both sides. 

The next day : we go back over. We have a nice dinner and dogs are doing fine, staying away from each other mostly. D starts calling my husband and I’s argument my “temper tantrum” and keeps saying it maybe 3-5 times in a row. My husband says he’s going to “staying out of that one” but i can tell he’s laughing. My response to D was a “how dare you call what i did a temper tantrum” in a light as possible tone (note light as possible. Which isn’t easy) and kind of just start to focus on playing with D’s kid, as that convo was not going anywhere nice. Soon after we left cuz it was getting late. 

When we get back to our Airbnb we are getting ready for bed in the bathroom and i say I’m not happy his friend said i was having a temper tantrum and he said nothing about how that’s not appropriate. He freaked out and said he did nothing wrong because he stayed out of it. We got in a screaming match about how he is saying I’m just PMSing (I’m not) and “do you even hear yourself” over and over. He said it’s not his responsibility to “control his friend”. This is his friend, who I’ve met a handful of times. This is his friends house, which I’ve now only visited twice. He’s known this friend for decades.

594,"I was friends with this girl since 2nd or 3rd grade when she moved onto my street (one house over). We used to be pretty close, going out to ride our bikes together on our street and playing some made up games. This was the situation for a while until the summer of 5th grade. Near the end of that summer, in late August of so, we went out as usual, but I made one key mistake which ended up defining our relationship from then onward. I rather unwisely quite literally got down on one knee on the curb and asked her if she ""loved me"". Naturally she responded with ""You know, I like you as a friend and all and you're a really good friend...."" and then abruptly said she saw her mother coming or something of that sort, taking me back into reality. Of course, her mother was not actually there and we laughed the whole thing off and said our goodbyes soon after as it started to rain. Now, the next main part occurred upon entering Middle School, 6th grade. You see, due to the abruptness of the whole episode during the summer, I did not realize that she viewed me as just a friend. Thus, throughout much of 6th grade I sent her notes and such attempting to ascertain whether she liked me or not and, as I later realized, simply alienating myself from her even more. Now, as 6th grade drew to a close, I started to realize just how awkward I must have been making her feel, I felt horrible. Throughout 7th grade I tried to make amends through letters/notes or through asking her friends to tell her what I wanted to say, as I couldn't manage to talk to her in person. I felt a tremendous amount of guilt at that time and pain at being ignored, as I saw that she mostly ignored my communications. A breakthrough occurred when I asked her on the last day of school whether we can just start over and start with a ""clean slate"", she agreed and I was hopeful. Next was 8th grade in which things slowly progressed, I was beginning to get over her, despite the fact that I was still largely ignored. However there was a few large events that changed a lot about our relationship. So, one of my friends and I were talking and this topic came up. I mentioned that it is sad that I don't have any means to contact her, it would make things much easier. He then brought up the fact that he had an instagram and could dm her sending her my number (which he would imply is his own) because he had to"" tell her something important"" and then let me take it from there. I was unsure and thought he was joking, so I didn't think much of it. That was, until the next day when she texted my number. I told her that she had the wrong number and tried to explain who this actually was, but after the initial shock she was fine with it. We had a relatively normal acquaintance during that time in which I did actually ask her whether she hated me and she said she did not, which gave me great relief. However, of course, not all good things can last forever and one Sunday morning I woke up to a series of messages from one of her friends. I wondered what the hell was going on and when I saw the situation, I was quite shocked. Apparently me texting what was at that time a popular meme (they did surgery on a grape) to her coincided to when the girl and her friends had been discussing it in their group chat. In sorting through the screenshots, I saw that it created quite a mess. They supposedly thought that I had ""hacked their gc"" and subsequently started bashing me, calling me a ""creep"" and ""stalker"" among other things. Then the conversation took an even worse turn when one of her friends started to defend me. This led to a mess of a conversation. I was subsequently blocked by the girl. This drove me back to square one again and the remainder of the year was mutual ignoring and more pain for myself. However, in the summer there was another development. Over the summer another friend and I were talking and he mentioned a grade wide discord server which I knew existed but never cared much about previously. I thought ""why not?"", made a discord and joined the server. Little did I know, but the girl was a part of the server. So after some thinking I sent her a dm asking if we could talk. I said that I had changed and just wanted to know why she blocked me. In hindsight perhaps the messages came off a bit out of the blue and awkward, but of course hindsight is 20/20. She responded by essentially saying that she felt uncomfortable and encroached on by my messages and such. I understood and, at the time this was quite the blow to my self image, so I explained my guilt and apologized again, just asking her to listen. She listened and somewhat forgave me. So I let it off, until another event. There used to be a politics sub in the server. One day we both had a interesting debate/discussion over our respective views at the time. The result was actually the beginnings of healing, with a creation of a channel expressly for the purpose of ""agreement"". I thought all was well and let it off, until later in the summer when another even occurred. In mid August I was quite ecstatic, I had rediscovered an old friend from elementary school. So I posted in the discord server a message referencing this in a manner which, I guess was too vague (Well, I guess I still discovered one person from my past this summer). After this message I left for an event. Upon returning to check on discord, I saw that I had missed a whole damn war over that comment. It started with one of her friends responding calling me a ""stalker"" again, presumably thinking I was referencing the girl in the message. The one of my friends tried to defend me and others tried to mediate. Then the girl joined in and made several....unkind comments about me in the passion of the argument. My friend unfortunately had not made the situation much better, instead inflaming it in the passion of anger. When I came back I immediately explained and apologized for the vagueness of my remarks. A few months later she left the discord server and after that argument stopped using the server. I sent her an explanation addressing all the points she brought up in the argument on the server. I don't know if she saw it, but I hope she did. Following that summer, I made a concerted effort to get over her and it worked for a while, nearly the entire year. Then in quarantine I decided to send her a mail asking her if she would consider unblocking me. She shut me down promptly.

596,"So I’m from up north and moving to the south was a big culture shock. I’m a young Hispanic man and I didn’t realize how difficult it would be for me down here. The weird looks I get all the time when I’m with my white girlfriend, or the crazy things older people would say to me and my mom who’s white. Like how do you have the audacity to say that? But I just chalk it up to being in the south in a less progressive place. 

I’ve pretty much gotten used to this by now. Not used to it but more so expect it. But there’s two things I keep noticing at different jobs I work at down here. People always call me boss, and people always call me big dawg. It doesn’t really make me feel any type of way I just want to know if this is meant to be derragatory. Up north I would never hear this, I would hear hey wassup man, or how you doin bro, in a upbeat voice when I walk in. But down here I get “hey” in a solemn voice. Or “sup boss” or “whattup big dawg” in a not so upbeat voice. Like they automatically don’t like me. 

Like I said I’ve come to expect this and I just want to know if that’s something southerners say if they don’t really fuck with you like that, kind of like bless your heart. It’s just been bugging me not knowing if it’s nice or not, because I never hear it said to anyone else but me. No matter what job I’ve had down here it’s the same at every one, like they’re all in on this certain way to act to people they’re not familiar with (Hispanics in my personal case). 

I could just be reading too much into this but idk man I feel like southerners will act all nice to your face and then be ruthless behind your back. I never experienced that up north it was always good comrade back home. Every single job I’ve had down here, I’m telling you, people act a certain way towards me. Something I’ve never experienced up north. Let me know what you guys think. Thank you.",15Jun2020,1

598,"I haven't reached any of my goals. In fact, I'm in debt and unemployed without any skills (they're outdated) and I don't have friends. I've made mistake after mistake. Lots of trials and all errors, lots of setbacks and illnesses and life happening. 

I'm studying something new for the nth time in hopes of making a living out of it, but deep down, I have some fears that this is going to fail like my previous attempts. But the difference now is this is not to apply for a job but to freelance so I have some hope for it. I don't need to prove my worth in interviews and try to explain my 5+ years out of traditional employment. I can just build a portfolio of my works and showcase them to potential clients. 

I used to think that I'd be on the right track at age 25. Then I moved that to age 30. But now, I'm 30 and I just don't know. I don't even have a business yet. I watched a movie that said, ""Because getting old sucks. Most people don't accomplish what they hope to and they realize they're most likely not going to. They end up living this quiet life of denial."" That scared me. I don't want to end up like that.

About me: English isn't my first language. I have a neurological disorder that makes me unable to tolerate jobs and situations I hate no matter how hard I try. I graduated in one of the most prestigious universities in the country and I was the top of my batch. I'm female. I am ashamed to apply to generic jobs because my batchmates might see me and mock me for how low I've come considering I was always an honor student. I've considered becoming an Uber driver but I'm afraid for my safety (rape being prevalent in my country) and, again, my batchmates might see me and mock me. I'm also now avoiding jobs that require me to go out as I have an immunocompromised housemate. In the years I was not in a 9-to-5 job, I experimented earning in different ways and made bad financial decisions that I thought would work but made me go in debt instead. The best that worked was reselling imports, which I'm planning to do in the future again once I get a stable source of income, pay off some debts, and save up capital. The import before failed because I got duped by China. They showed me class A samples but delivered crappy versions of it. For now, my partner is taking care of my needs like food and essentials but this can't go on forever. I feel so guilty and useless already. 

I don't have friends because I've become too negative and I can't afford most things anymore which is needed when I go out with friends. I've tried making friends online but who would wanna be friends with someone old with my life situation and have nothing to be proud of. I sound like a loser and maybe I am but in denial. 

There are many ways to look at this like it's all my fault, that I'm lazy, or I'll end up like that guy in the movie. There must be a constructive way to look at this like the quote that problems are opportunities? Which perspective is the most mature and realistic? Please help me fix my perspective. I don't know who to turn to for advice.

And what should I focus on fixing first? I'm assuming my financials? Should I not try to make new friends for now? Some people can live for years without a single friend, right, when they're down in the dumps? Maybe I can do that as well? Or is that only possible for certain types of people?

And please don't advise me to get medicated. Advise me anything but that. I am high-functioning and I refuse to be drug-dependent for the rest of my life in order to function well. I am firm on that. I hope people who medicate don't take this as a personal attack to them. It's just my personal choice for my own life.

I can totally understand that people are busy. However, I feel like being ""busy"" is the easy solution because ever since coronavirus restrictions started easing in my area a lot of my classmates have been going out more.   
Also, it's one night for 2 hours on a weeknight. I don't think that people are that busy that they can't set aside that amount of time? These are high school seniors, not medical students, to top that off school is over (we just graduated, lol).  
There might be some who are genuinely busy. I understand that. However, even when I am busy I try to make time no matter what for things. I don't know what the issue with the teacher is either, he doesn't bite.  
I think it's a lot easier to say ""I'm busy"" rather than putting the effort to try to free up your schedule. I don't think that people are so busy they can't set aside a few hours for a day.

603,"Hey everyone, I just had a rather difficult debate with my father regarding gender equality in sports and then more specifically focusing down to physicality. We left the conversation pretty heated and hostile toward each other at the end, I came away feeling disappointed and upset that my father is ignorant and I can only assume he would be feeling the same.. so any advice about how to approach him to sound it out tomorrow and further continue the conversation will be greatly appreciated. Here goes.

My father and I (23M) were watching a program on TV which prompts questions and debates on national TV late at night which focusses on political, social, and economical issues within our country currently. The topic on hand was bringing back certain sports to live tv now that our covid-19 restrictions are easing and how there were a lack of female competing sports. The panel had a variety of professional athletes and senior directors from sports such as rugby, football, afl and olympic sports. 

To keep it short, my father was sighing and moaning that of course there is equality they don’t need to sook on about it. I prompted a question asking, well if it is equal how come only the mens competition is back on air and the womens is not? This debate quickly unravelled and changed into the physicality differences between men and women. My father is a good golfer, his argument to this was:

If there was a pool of 100 golfers, 50 women and 50 men and the top 10 would qualify, women wouldn’t make the cut - they can’t hit as far. I know myself that golf isn’t about hitting further, it is far more strategic than that. He wouldn’t take a bar, so i decided to try another route and say well sure they might not hit as far on average (amateur women v. amateur men) but it doesn’t mean they might not have a chance. 

My father was adamant that women can’t do as good as men due to physicality so I tried to suggest that in the air force as fighter pilots, the same physical stress and demands are required from both men and women equally. I was trying to show him that his logic of women can’t do the same physical thing was wrong as both men and women AF Fighter pilots have to endure the same physical flight stresses.

This is similarly to race car drivers, we have a motor racing sport here in Aus, we had 1 woman competing in that tournament dominated by men. His point was saying “they just can’t do it” yet here we have 1 woman that has and he discredited that? He couldn’t see that his argument of “women aren’t better” was wrong even though I (believe, I) gave multiple arguments to support.

The debate turned from facts to emotional jabs from this point and it became prevalent that my father is naive about the issues surrounding equality. His intentions are close where he says “i do reckon discrimination is wrong” but then contradicts himself by saying nah women can’t do that as good as men because they’re not as physical. How do I suggest, in a diplomatic way, that hey, they actually can and the debate on tv wasn’t about that but merely why isn’t the recognition and air-time there for female dominated sports like it is for men? 

This is a big ass post. I would like to apologise in advance lol

609,"I was born and raised in the US, but raised in a Filipino household. I consider myself more American than Filipino, and even joined the Army which is how I met my fiance. I ended my term of service and brought her with me to live with my family to save money before I start attending college. I understand the risks and consequences of living with a partner alone while in school, but we both want to make it work. My family have told me they don't like the idea of us getting engaged/married, and that I disrespected them by suggesting that. Also, we disrespected my father by not eating dinner with him which doesn't make sense since my mother doesn't eat dinner with him either (they're still married and living together). So I did it anyway because I want to spend my life with her, and told everyone via phone call to tell them the news.

610,"It's my first time posting anything on Reddit; and this revealing. Please go easy on me. No one might read this, but it's worth the shot. Even a shot in the dark. I don't know who to ask as it is complicated and can be embarrassing. As you can see, I'm desperate. 

I am a Muslim and well, here it is. I'm in love with a Muslim woman - not all for her looks, but her character. (I feel it's important to disclose that ""Muslim"" part to give context to some of the things I'll be covering.) I know it sounds cliche but looks can wither while character can stay for a lifetime. It may just be me, but she makes me feel 'at home' whenever I would see her. 

I'm studying in 'Country R' through scholarship. Before continuing our actual studies to achieve our respective degrees, international students must attend a preparatory program. That's how I met her. She's from 'Country S' and I'm from 'Country I'. Different corners of the world but sharing the same faith. After the preparatory program, she will be continuing her Master's degree in a different university while I will be pursuing my Bachelor's. She's older than me, but I don't mind one bit. 

She's amazing, but will be returning home after 2 years - in the midst of my Bachelor's study. This sense of urgency has motivated me to do good for her, but eventually blinded me and made me commit wrongs that I didn't even know I've done towards her and our faith and traditions. I apologized and learned from my stupid mistakes. To this day, I still hope that she has no hatred or any of the sort towards me. May God forgive me of my wrongs. Still, afraid if I didn't do anything special, she would have no admiration or any form of respect towards me. 

In 2 years time, I intend to ask her the big question - before she leaves for her home country. The preparatory program will end soon and I won't see her for another 2 years or ever... So, I planned to give her some presents soon. It's just something to remember me by as they are unique to my country and hopefully, they can be beneficial for her. (So, I asked her if I could come over with a guardian (*I want her to feel comfortable) to simply give the present. She said that she cannot receive gifts from men. I'm speechless as I still believe she deserves something nice.)

I've been and will continue researching, or rather finding information, for this big plan I have for her family and mine. About possible routes to getting in contact with her family, asking for their blessings, the marriage itself, and the start of new life together. These are things in general, but the details have been obstacles that I must find ways to solve. It's honestly overwhelming.

During the next 2 years, I have this strong desire to improve myself. I know I can be more mature, wise, intelligent and courageous as a person. I know I will grow as a person. I will be more 'ready'. While pursuing my Bachelor's, I plan to work as a tutor so I can earn and save money. I also want to learn Arabic, but it's been hard finding a good teacher. I want to be able to speak with her and her family in a language of their own. I really care about this. I want this to work. 

I'm also focusing so much on being wiser and etc. because she has mentioned, in one of her status, that she would like to meet her future husband in 'City D'. She wants her future husband to be smart, brave, older and Arabian. I can be more smart and brave, but impossible for me to be older than her. So, I want to compensate that by being wiser because I understand that wisdom has no correlation with age. As for being Arabian, she mentioned that only Arabian men can understand Arabian women. I felt defeated reading that as I feel I'm not good enough to treat such an amazing woman. (I'm not Arabian). Race should have no role in how we treat one another. 

Even sharing the same belief, it feels impossible building a bond with her, even, for an introduction. Is there something I'm missing? 

Months before she will be leaving, I will talk to my parents about this. I don't think they are ready for such discussions now and I want to, at least, show them that I'm mature and 'ready' when finally talking about it. It's also embarrassing, so I have to build up the courage to talk about this with them. 

Then when the time comes, I will give her another present but this time, bigger. In it will be a letter, asking the big question for her and her family. From there, my big plan, which I've constructed during my studies, will finally take off or cut short. 

I have this dream of building a strong family; and to make donations from my future job or any kind of help to help other people, especially Muslims, in her war-torn country. She told me she wants to rebuild her country and I want to be on board as I know there are many of my Muslim brothers and sisters who need the help. I have many big dreams and one of them is her. I really love her. 

So after all this, what can I do now?  

And all this intense feeling. Am I just being naive? If so, then what is love? And, why am I only feeling it towards her and no other woman? (Except my mom, but that's kind of different)

I don't want to risk breaking what's precious to me. How should I interact with her? Her family? How should I interact with myself? How can I bring up this subject to my family later? 

How can I find peace when she's always on my mind and I can't do anything to show my love as it can be perceived as creepy, weird, or sinful? ""We're just colleagues,"" she said and, ""I treat everyone equally. I can't treat anyone special."" I just want her to notice my little actions for her:

I spent money to buy chocolates and fruits to make her happy and well (whenever she's sick)... 

I make stupid jokes, so she can laugh even if I feel dead inside... 

I always make sure she's OK in class... 

Before quarantine, I would go with her to the Metro to make sure she's safe returning to her dorm... 

I swallowed my pride and apologized for my mistakes and commit my time and energy to improve myself... 

I spent my sleepless nights writing (mostly poems) about my love so I can sleep and, hopefully, so she can see (but she no longer does)... (I thought writing could help, or at the very least, ease.)

I'm willing to have her beside me in my dreams - my future...

I'm willing to sacrifice my money, blood, sweat and tears to achieve that dream... 

And now, I'm willing to endure to hide this intense emotion I have for her and to act ""normal""... 

All because of love. All because of her beautiful smile. All because of what I believe in.

And, I have this jealousy when she would talk or giggle with her friend(s) from the same country. I should be happy that she's comfortable and happy, but I still wonder if it's only me she doesn't want to acknowledge. How come she's fine being together, sometimes, in private with her (guy) friends? Is it only me? And, why? Am I not enough?

Questions and worries that keep me awake at night and tire me in the days. I feel as if everything is against me. I understand that all this is too long, but this is my shot in the dark due to unfavorable circumstances; and to ask the wise or the experienced, ""what should I do?"" and, ""what can I do?""

Nonetheless, I hope you have an awesome day. Thank you.

613,"&gt;So 31 year old male currently unemployed, past few had a few short term contracts but thanks to the shitty state of the economy in Australia for the past few years those jobs were always short term and unstable and why hire me when they can import Rajiet from India to do it for cheaper (but very poorly).  I studied interactive media and did a postgrad in marketing and worked in digital marketing and SEO.  
&gt;  
&gt;Out of despration when I  was 28 and a half and I studied to be an Enrolled Nurse, I absolutely hated Nursing with all my being and of course being a white male grduate Nurse with no experience I was unable to find work.  It has been a year since I graduated I don't feel uncomfortable working as nurse due to not wanting to harm anyone and me as I said before there is me absolutely despising the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other thing is I am a 31 year old virgin who has never had a GF thanks to his height of 5'3"" making me subhman in the eyes of western women and most women in general. But now at my age it is even more likely to never happen thanks to being, my height and lack of experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I am 31 year old man with not the best employment history, never had a  GF thanks to my height of 5'3"" and now most like never will due to a combination of a lack of experince, my height and being poor.  So if life has taught me one thing is that things are only going to get worse for me not better because society will not let me suceed or even have a secure job. I am most likely going to end up homless because in the current political climate and womens stranglehold on the gates to employment via HR white men are placed at the back of the employment bus.

&gt;I am lost and honestly consider killing myself everyday. I don't know what to do.

620,"I usually do not like to share stuff concerning my relatives, but this problem concerns me directly.

Long story short, my mother (47F) has the bad habit of drinking a lot, especially when she feel stressed/anxious. I understand her need to use it as a ""distraction"" to her problems, even if it drives me crazy to see her drink three bottles (or more or less depending on how much money she has) a week by herself. Anyways. What bothers me (21F) is how I am ""forced"", as her daughter, to take care of her when she throws up because of it. We are both living together and our others relatives live in others towns so reaching out to them is pointless. But what bothers me the most is her false promises.

See, during the past five years in a total of three or four times, she promised me she would stop. Of course, I am not expecting her to completely stop in a day ; after all, an addiction is not easy to get rid of and I totally understand this. But the awful part is that she keeps this ""promise"" for a week or so and restart to drink again. I usually let it slide because she's the one paying the bills as I can't find a job, so she's the one paying for her alcohol and she is the adult, so I don't have much to say in the matter. But yesterday, as she had finished throwing up (once again) she told me she realized her problem and would really stop this time. And I believed her because she was ""conscious"".

Yet, ten minutes ago as I was in the kitchen, I noticed an empty beer. And when I opened the fridge, I found another one unopened. I know a can of beer and a complete bottle isn't the same, but it's alcohol nonetheless. She didn't even waited a week before buying again alcohol. Now, I feel totally betrayed. I took the unopened beer and emptied all of it (after drinking some as well). She is currently out so I can't face her about it now.. and I don't even know what I could say without turing it into a fight. And I don't want to fight her, I just want to make her realize how she is hurting not only herself but myself too.

What's the best approach in order to achieve this?

I simply just told him a bit partial truth but explained it the best that I can about how mums and dads argue and sometimes it's beyond fixing and stuffs like that.

But for the last 3 months he acts like he hardly stands me. Also, I need to remind that he's one of those people whose emotions really detectable with their body language.  
He doesn't mean it openly. But after knowing someone for a long time and especially after living together for a long time, it gets more clear to understand things from their actions, body language etc. 

He's noticeably cold. He avoids looking at my face when we're speaking. When we're sitting and chatting with everyone else in the house he bows his head to the desk. Even though everyone is in a good mood and smiling, he gets a serious face and sometimes tries to change the topic I'm speaking on abruptly like I was not speaking seconds ago.  
Because of the pandemic sometimes we're home studying on our desks throughout the day. If I don't speak or ask something, we speak literally nothing all day long. Like two strangers in a library.

It started long before the epidemic. After a small, verbal disagreement. Something far, far away from a  fight. He was dead cold for a week. I asked if I said or did anything wrong that might upset him. He said no but his coldness worsened.  
After a month or more, I asked again but this time angrily by mistake. Because I was trying to be extremely kind and gentle but he was still same. This time he refused his mood too and said that things would get worse if I open up this again and I'm exaggerating.  
I felt hurt and sad from the beginning but after this my feelings changed more into anger. I feel excluded when we're with friends, because he acts like that. I decided to keep it this way and not to try anything further. 

I was not sure to add this and it feels cringe to mention. This dude is a handsome, very fit dude but he's obsessed with his muscles and look. He spends one-third of his day in front of the mirror.   
But I am a person with naturally very broad shoulders even when I'm not regularly exercising. Months ago I started again regular exercise and he said to my face that he can not believe how my shoulders are that broader than his not jokingly but seriously. I thought he was joking. He said it's because the t-shirt I'm wearing. Yes this is very childish and cringe but this happened multiple times. 

Recently, we've met with friends that we haven't seen for a long time. Everybody made compliments on my progressive look and you should've seen his face. His face was suddenly dead.   
Also, he constantly stares at my chest when we're sitting across. It started to bother a lot.

However, I moved to California a year ago and had to re-register the vehicle in California. The cost of full coverage insurance is ridiculously expensive here, so I had to apply to the state's low income, liability only insurance.

639,"(First thing I need to say is that I live in Europe, things are a bit different there).

Here's the thing: I have asperger syndrome, and social anxiety, and despite having postgraduate degrees, I've had a lot of trouble keeping a job or even getting hired by someone 3 years after getting it...and it's been extremely hard to deal with as I've been busting my ass to find a job, but I just don't fit in. Add to this the fact that it's already hard to get any job where I live, even if you're a ""normal guy""...Anyways, the year of my 30th birthday, I got severely depressed because I felt like an absolute failure, despite knowing I wasn't entirely responsible for the entire situation.

A very good friend of mine, who has a family member with aspergers, and who's extremely successful (he has several businesses, although he's 15 years older than me) proposed to give me a hand, as he knew how harsh the work market is nowadays, especially for people who are on the autistic spectrum. So, being a business owners, here's what he did:

-He made me a signed work certificate proving that I had been working for him since I got my degree

-He gave me references

-All his secretaries know about it, and they took care of making sure the papers were in order.

-Anyone calling the company I've been ""employed"" by would hear that I was indeed employed there

And so on...

I felt really bad about it when he told me, telling him that it wasn't fair to do what when so many people struggled with their jobs, to which he replied ""buddy, this is the current market, and it's not going to get better. You can fake it 'til you make it, or you can regret it later on""...and I ended up accepting doing it.

Three months later, I found a job as a consultant (I won't give any more details), I told them from the very beginning that I was an apsergers, which they didn't mind, as they knew what kind of assets I could bring to the company with this kind of syndrome, and I've been employed ever since.

TLDR: I accepted to cheat, because I was scared as hell for my future, and because I wanted to do something with my life. My life is much, much better now that I did that, but I can't help wondering if this was wrong, even though I was simply trying to get somewhere in my life.

641,"Throwaway account for anonymity. 

TLDR; Recently my best friend's narcissistic tendencies have been getting significantly worse and I'm starting to suspect they may be a full on narcissist, but their mom was a diagnosed narcissist who made their childhood hell so it's a touchy subject and I don't know how to bring it up without them reacting poorly or sounding like an asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, I've known my friend \[Jo\] since high school--I'd met Jo's family before and know first hand how much of a narcissistic their mom was and saw how hard it'd made their home life. Jo knows they have narcissistic tendencies but has always been determined to not become like their mom. I'd never been super bothered by it before, but in the last year I've been a lot more annoyed by their behavioral habits and a recent exchange suddenly made me consider if they're more of a narcissist than I thought. It wasn't a major incident but more like the straw that broke the camels back, compounded by everything they'd said/done before.

Some potential red flags that I'd been noticing were how often they talk about ""deserving"" things while making little to no effort to attain those things (like they're entitled to them), they've been super condescending to people who don't meet their (high) standards and straight up implying they're ""better than the average joe"" (e.g. ""I always thought the average person was smarter but guess not"", ""life would be easier if I were dumb like everyone else"", etc...), and they constantly frame themselves as the victim in every grievance while never acknowledging their role in the situation (it's always someone else's fault). 

I think these behaviors are all pretty normal in moderation, but it's literally *all the time* now. Every rant about work includes how incompetent all their coworkers are and how Jo deserves a huge raise, and is topped off by humblebragging about how good they're at at their job. Every discussion about current world events includes mention of how everyone should put in 5% more effort ""like Jo"". Every complaint *I* have about my day/life, no matter how big/small, is one-upped by Jo's greater misfortunes. It's like Jo equally has to be both the most successful *and* the most unfortunate person in the room, simultaneously, and at every opportunity puts other people and their problems down while singing Jo's own praises to achieve that. 

I've only implied that they may be more of a narcissist than they think once, and they got extremely defensive and rebuttaled everything I said. When a mutual friend brought it up Jo straight up flipped out in disbelief, insisting they're nothing like their mom, and it hasn't come up since. Jo insists they're good at taking criticism but all my past experiences say that's not the case, and it's making it hard to even suggest that they might need to rein in their behavior. I don't think Jo has malicious intentions--I don't even know if they're consciously aware of how they're acting. I'm not trying to say that Jo is like their mom specifically (and never have)--just that I think they've been particularly egotistical lately and potentially more narcissistic than they like to think. How can I bring this up as diplomatically as possible, considering Jo is potentially a narcissistic but still my best friend?",15Jun2020,4

Despite working here since 2018 I feel like I'm barely improving, the more complex things get the more I feel like I'm not cut out to be a programmer but I don't know what else I could even attempt to do with my life.



Everyone I work with seems to be able to immediately comprehend, understand and resolve any issues throw their way, however I seem to struggle on basic issues and I can't seem to remember anything. I feel beyond pathetic and useless.



After a long day I feel incredibly depressed and anxious due to my inability and I truly don't know what to do. 



Some have said it took years in work and then suddenly things just 'click' while others say if I struggle this way then I shouldn't be in the job. Despite being 23 I feel I'm locked into this path for life, I have no natural talent or skills that I can follow into a successful career.

649,"Okay so where do I begin with this one. My brother is a lot older than me like we have a 12 year age gap but we have always been close like he’s always been there and never once forgot my bday or Christmas. (we are half siblings though I never thought of my brother as only being half until recently). He has issues but all in all he’s a good guy I would describe him as a huge grump and a hole but that’s just his personality. Well he met this girl who I liked but she was a little off. She told Wild stories of her ex husband who was a cop being murdered by a gang in front of her eyes that her mother never loved her because of mental illness and she raised her sibilings and I mean these are very real issues that could have been true but there was never ANY proof of these stories and I mean the stories just got more and more exaggerated and Wild. Me and my parents never said anything about it because well if she makes my bro happy what ever. 

Well i should have stayed away. Like she has bipolar disorder and is on many drugs. I befriended her and we had a lot in common. We both rode horses and her and my brother wanted a ranch so long story short we both met a group of (Gypsies) at the barn we rode at who befriended her because she paid everything but they knew the ins and outs of riding and competing and taught me and her. 

Well I rode with her for a few months like maybe 2-3 before the drama started. It started with her snapping at me. Making awful comments about my mom how she failed my brother how bad of a guy my bf is I’m lazy and entitled and my brother doesn’t understand me and we are only half and blah blah. It ended it a fight because she all of the sudden started implementing rules about when I could ride. Mind you I’m an adult so I felt a little frustrated by that and it soon ended in a blow out. With my brother coming over and us arguing out front so embarrassing yelling at each other. 

I gave this whole situation some space until she messaged me about coming back. Everyone in my family including my boyfriend told me not to do it but I did because i felt that she was my friend and since no one liked her I would be there to support my brother. That was the biggest mistake of my life. I mean she got more and more out of line saying things about my family at the time I was like 19 and she’s like 36 just railing on my family. Which I naively tried to defend which made her more piss. So a few months go by we go to a rodeo to compete my bf comes it was so much fun until the last day. Me and my bf and one of the Gypsies were joking about him getting on a hot horse (meaning a horse that’s crazy) her horse was crazy and she heard this and completely lost it on my bf she threatened to beat him up call the police on him threaten him with my brother saying my brother would beat him up mind you again we were 19 my bf literally cried she said just awful thing I couldn’t believe it. Never the less she took that same anger out on me told me I couldn’t ride at the show again. I mean at this point I’m dumbfounded. 

Fast forward a month my bf has completely removed himself from this entire situation and so have my parents. 

I was looking for a horse found out and she and my brother had just bought a horse trailer that I was hoping to be able to use but she told me so so the Gypsies gave me a beat up trailer that on the freeway to getting a new horse the wheel flew off into an Attorneys windshield... needless to say I felt awful that I had done that to my dad and all they told my dad was to pay the bill and fix the trailer which he did an she was nasty to me the whole time didn’t come help I mean I cried it was traumatic the guy said he was going to sue and she was I hate to say it a bitch. It costed my dad 700$ to fix that trailer since it was old. I trusted this lady and I shouldn’t have. Probably one of the biggest regrets of my life dragging my dad into that. 

So my family and bf plan to go out of state for a week and I ask her and the Gypsies if they can watch my horse. It’s an agreement and my brothers girlfriend offers to take care of my stall. I said my dad could come take care of my horse but she insisted that she would do it and it would be ok. Well she lied...

During my trip my phone got blown up about my horse and she is angry because she has to watch her and she again loses it on me over text while I’m in a different state. on the plane ride back I get a text saying she’s done I can no longer stay at the barn and I better f*ing get there when I land because my horse and stuff will be on the street. I mean you can’t make this stuff up guys... 

So I finally stand up for myself after being afraid to say anything to this woman for months and. I just say okay fine I’m done too I’ll come get my stuff once I land. Well I should have called the police because she got violent throwing shit screaming she called me every bad word in the book and called my brother calling me all these horrible things cussing at my bf who’s just there for my safety so I can walk my horse 40 min down a dangerous roadway (I didn’t have a trailer and there was no way she was letting me use hers) my brother allowed this. 

So fast forward to today I haven’t heard from my brother since no texts no happy birthday or merry Xmas he didn’t ask if I was safe or okay I mean the guy cut me off and blocked my number my own brother. So fast forward to this week my mom told me that my brother told my other brother what his girlfriend had told him.. she lied about everything. Told him I never asked her to watch my horse (which I did) she Said I said I hope they break up and called her names and my boyfriend video taped her flip out and laughed but non of this is true! I told my mom I couldn’t believe it but that she was lying straight up. I mean the lies were extensive without getting to much more into it she said I said things I never did and what really made my mom believe me was if that was truly what happened where if the video? I mean I would have showed her exactly what happened if I did have a video but I never did so I mean it’s nuts. I’m angry at my bro he didn’t protect his little sister and he allows his mentally ill gf to disrespect our mom and my entire family. She’s just so nasty. And hatful. Any advice on how to tell my brother non of what she said was true?!! I mean he will not talk to me!!",15Jun2020,2

655,"I just recently began therapy and we were talking about things that happened in my past and I mentioned that I knew I had been bullied as a kid but I didn’t really remember it. She asked me if I would ever want to know what happened and I said no because I was trying to move on from my anger towards this person that I didn’t understand. 

That night, however, I got curious and asked my mom about the bullying. She told me that this girl bullied me very badly. She told me things like no one liked me and no one wanted me (that’s all I’ve been told). And I guess later when my best friend started hanging out with her, she (the bully) started telling my friend horrible things about me and they both turned on me and bullied me (we were 10). 

I don’t know what to do. I just found this all out and after talking to my therapist discovered that my brain probably blocked out the memory. My mom thinks the bullying changed me a lot and increased/was a factor in my anxiety and depression. My therapist says thinks it’s probably one of the things that caused my trust issues. I know I need to forgive her somehow or let go of this anger but I don’t know how. So far the only thing I’ve done is block her on social media but that makes me feel crummy when I think about it.

656,"Hi all :)
Throwaway here as a) new to the subreddit and b) SUPER long time lurker and finally using interest in reddit for good, rather than procrastination. 

Challenging situation here because I’m an older sibling (25F vs 12M) instead of a parent, but I need advice on how best to help my little brother out and give him supportive advice on coming out during this day and age.

My little (Half) brother (12M) confided in me last night while we were reading before bed that he thinks he might have a ‘crush’ on another boy in his soccer team and is (in a beautifully innocent and curious way) wanting to know what I think about him potentially liking boys - ie, being gay. 

Obviously, as long as he is comfortable in who he is and what he wants, I couldn’t give a flying fuck if he’s sexually attracted to figs! I just want him to be happy in himself and know he’s irrevocably, unconditionally loved. We had a really open conversation (under sibling “secrecy privilege”) about what he is confused about, what he is scared about and what this might mean for the future. I want him to feel secure in his skin as he is, but I did tell him what I think is the reality for him in 2020: 80% of people don’t really care whom he loves at all, but there are sadly still maybe 20% of people (maybe less, maybe most likely more) who might either outright bully/attack him or say “joking” but blatantly hurtful things to him about being gay that will be indescribably hard to deal with. 

He’s my little bro, and I love him with everything I have to give. In saying that, being almost 15 years older and seeing the cruelty that some bastards inflict on people for THE MOST ridiculous of fucking reasons (gender, sexual orientation, nationality, etc) I know that our world isn’t as accepting or safe as it should/could potentially be.

What I need advice on is how much should I try to prepare/brace him for whatever potential ignorance he has to deal with?
 I want to start taking self defence classes with him to prepare him for the worst in case it ever comes to that when he decides (IF he decides) to come out. Multiple reasons: 1) I’ve always wanted to do it for myself 2) I have three other younger brothers, so this would be such a great way that he and I could bond and have something unique that’s just part of our relationship (for now - would never stop other brothers from joining in!) 3) most people have encountered at least ONE ridiculously toxic, overly macho, twat-biscuit that would physically hurt (or attempt to) someone for being homosexual and I want my little brother to feel secure in that he could take care of himself (to a degree) if something like this ever arose.


As a woman, I’ve always wanted to train myself in basic self defence because I think it’s just plain sensible, but I always thought it’d be something I’d pursue as my own hobby. Am I being homophobic/segregational/just-plain-insulting if I encourage my brother to do this with me, especially after he just confessed he might be gay? 

I wish the world was a safe place for everyone, but the reality is that it just isn’t there yet. I know I can’t always physically be there for my brother, but while I’m still an ‘authority figure’ to him, I want to help build for him a great basis for self confidence and personal safety - no matter who he loves, but especially because he may face challenges I (or my other brothers) didn’t have to while growing up.",15Jun2020,2

659,"My (22f) bf (26m) wears clothes that are way too revealing.

Like don’t get me wrong, he’s a really handsome and musclely guy and his style in terms of the combinations is good but he thinks that people in real life wear clothes as tight as these male models in pictures and all it does it look too tight and show too much of his junk. It doesn’t help that he’s well endowed and he seems to be the only person in public who doesn’t notice how inappropriate it is. Like if we’re not getting a disapproving look, it’s some bimbo flirting with him and he doesn’t even notice. 

I’ve never met someone so smart and clueless at the same time. He thinks women are just being nice to him and on the off chance that he does notice people looking, he starts looking himself up and down as if there’s some sauce stain he doesn’t realize he has. Like no dude it’s your junk. 

Anyways, I’ve tried shopping with him and he says the clothes I pick aren’t form fitting and he sees them as baggy. I just think his perception of what’s actually well fit is off because he’s so used to getting his style from men’s fashion pages online. 

Any idea how I can help him see that his clothes are too tight?",15Jun2020,1
660,"I am part of a group chat with people who I have known since school. In general, we all get on very well and I really enjoy having them as friends. We play games together, meet up all the time (pre virus anyway) and they make up a decent portion of my social interaction. 

The issue is that we are all in a group chat and some of what gets posted makes me uncomfortable and I am not sure how appropriate it all is. A lot of memes and jokes are posted that I think take things slightly too far and I am not sure what to do. I have jokingly mentioned that these things are not appropriate but I don't feel like other people have really noticed it. There is one person in particular that sometimes comes out with things that are quite bigoted and I don't know how to challenge them. These people have been my friends for well over 10 years and I value them and know that they are good people at heart, but it makes me uncomfortable seeing them post things that they view as funny that are potentially offensive. I don't want to be associated with this kind of thing. 

So I am just wondering what any of you would do in my position? Is it enough to just stay in this group chat and ignore the post that sometimes feels offensive, or should I just go ahead and leave it?",15Jun2020,2

662,"So my (22M) girlfriend(18F) broke up with me because she said ever since she started on her new depression med that she’s felt different towards me. She also told her parents that she doesn’t even love them the way anymore. I noticed her personality changed when she got on the medication, she stopped texting or calling me about just random things about her day. Before the meds, she wanted to move in with me, marry me and go to college, she even said I’m the first guy that she ever wanted to marry. She was raped a month before we started talking and admitted to me that if it wasn’t for me, she wouldn’t be here today. She said I was her hero and she looked up to me but once she got on the meds, she acted like I annoyed her, she stopped laughing at my jokes and stopped making excuses to see me. She said she still cared about me but didn’t feel that way anymore since the meds. Her dad told me that if I want her back, I need to make her miss me, have no contact. Her mom even agreed and I’m just left hoping that their right since they know their daughter extremely well. I’ve never felt a connection towards a girl like this before and she become my best friend. She also kept sending mixed signals after the break up and apparently cried all day after the break up and had a nervous breakdown. She wanted to text me all day but didn’t til her mom said she should. And I screwed up Friday and asked her how she felt about me and she said she didn’t know.

I have zero concerns over anatomy and physiology, biology, or any other science-based course. I’ve heard from more than one person that finite math absolutely worked them over, though.

664,"So, newly married back in February about 2-3 weeks after losing my job in January due to layoffs. Managed on unemployment for a couple of months and found a role that paid great but ended up only lasting for a month.

&amp;#x200B;

All the while, I've been on the job hunt. All of this while news of COVID has just gotten worse and worse. At this point, the wife is fed up by my 'lack of drive' meanwhile as of my count last night I'd applied to about 450 jobs since about the 2nd week of May.

We were doing pretty well for a moment, had ended our apt lease and went to stay with her parents temporarily while we waited on the house we were buying to finish being built, but then I got the call telling me they were ending my contract immediately out of the blue and this was shortly after we were called to come in and sign the last bit of paperwork.

We would have been moving into our house last week. But since, we've been forced to stay with her parents as I have no income past current unemployment and she's got disability as her primary source.

I've tried going after new technical certs and have lost a few hundred dollars already failing tests. I've had countless interviews up through multiple rounds and no calls back past that, and I can't even seem to get in touch with anyone for a follow-up. 

At this point, I'm just at a loss. She came to me about a week ago and voiced that she was finally starting to get the gist of the circumstance and understood we have to be patient as right now our lives are resigned to a ""hurry up and wait"" type-scenario.

Meanwhile, in her world she decided to go to get her real estate license and is working on her degree, as well as managing a small business.

&amp;#x200B;

I can understand her comparison for lack of drive, but at this point I'm not even sure what I can even do. We're trying to relocate to another city with a better job market for the both of us but without the money we can't do that. I can't just pick any job per-se as if I change professions even in a temporary move it affects our ability to purchase a house. 

As COVID cases are still on the rise, even if I were to just go do something just for the extra money it puts myself (high risk) and everyone else in the current household at risk.

Yesterday, we seemed to be having a pretty good day and I decided to sit down and play a game for a bit after running through job applications for a while. At some point, she just looks at me and asks, ""What are you doing? Playing that damn game again, huh."" and proceeds to go work on her real estate course.

This was mid-afternoon and she basically didn't say two words to me the rest of the night. In my frustration, I was up until around 3 AM (as was she) just sitting in silence. I left for about an hour and a half and went for a walk (as recently we found out that regardless of what my physical appearance is like, I have the cholesterol and arteries of someone 20 years my senior.) to get that in and clear my head a bit to try and think of what I can do.

At some point on the way back, I noticed she'd turned her location off as it's ever-present in Maps and I didn't go very far but was checking how far I was from the house. She'd gotten word of some work for her business last week and we had plans to go do that this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I got up and she walks in to get dressed and just tells me, ""I'm going by myself."" and continues getting dressed. I come back in the room a few minutes later and she's gone without another word.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm just at a total loss of what to do and feel as if I'm spiraling. To make matters worse the one person I have to talk to seems to have zero interest in speaking with me. As I made multiple attempts to speak to her about what was on her mind yesterday and was just met with a harsh glare.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it bothers her that I play games, but at the same time during this period I really don't know what else I could be doing and just feel lost. Sure, I could keep at the certifications but there's not really anything that would be an instant ""ok, here's a job"" or even something that without more of a collection of certifications would greatly increase my chances and it feels like a gamble to keep trying and failing when the only money I'm guaranteed right now is from unemployment.",15Jun2020,2

672,"So, I have a close friend who normally communicates with me non-stop. I have noticed a pattern that she doesn't communicate as much when she goes home to see her family.

During covid, she has returned home . I have been super lonely since I live alone so I told her I'd really love to talk to her, as I am feeling pretty isolated. She said she'd try to call me, never did, and said she's been really busy. About 2 months later I say the same thing, I am feeling really lonely, and would love to talk to her. She said ""I am the opposite of you I am super over stimulated lately but I will give you a call."" Again, never did. Occasionally I will text her and sometimes she responds, other times she doesn't, but she hasn't been initiating texts with me like she normally has. Sometimes I will text her something that feels pretty big to me and she just won't respond.

Anyways, I am pretty hurt because I have always been there for her 100% whenever she tells me she is having a rough time. I've already told her twice so I feel like, maybe I should just let it go as it is clear she doesn't really care to talk to me. Thoughts?

I RARELY post on social media, so I hadn't posted anything, I wrote back to her 10 posts and said are you trying to call me out? She said no, not you. Although it was a bit weird because there were some signs that she it was me (she tagged me in something and deleted it and didn't tell me what it was, and she put the 'close friends' tag on one) Anyways we had a conversation about it but she said it wasn't me that she was pointing at.

A side effect of treatment/recovery will be gradual blindness in her right eye (about 35% of her peripheral vision by now?) so if anyone has any tips on how we can accommodate that, that would be very welcome also. The secondary issue she had could potentially end up with the same result in the other eye (will see from today on). 

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to make adjusting as easy as possible for her and when lockdown was announced I had to stay full time with my fella when the plans were to begin staying a few more nights at home with my parents. My bro lives far away also but has been working hard to get a new job so will be a whole other story looking for a gift for him soon too :)

&amp;#x200B;

So, until I can comfortably start the part time staying with fam each week to really help, would like to know how to aid her until I can be with her to pour her orange juice and coffee in the morning, as the scalding stories have already started and it's sad we can't be there for her yet. Have of course been visiting, but no contact. She comes at me with a measuring tape each time I get there lol :)

&amp;#x200B;

In short, looking for practical and some more luxury type things as the woman does not like chocolate OR flowers, and has everything she needs in terms of clothes/shoes, but may get her some jammies and have located some cute cashmere socks for her. Would give her some funds to go gamble with but sure the casinos are closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the waffle, but thanks.

Also- if there's any NHS/healthcare folks happen to be out there reading this- thankyou so much for all your hard work during all this. As much as it sucks being a key worker, I couldn't imagine a more difficult job to have in a time like this. Yet, even before and throughout this disaster, you have taken such good care of my mum and caught the second issue mid crisis and had her in surgery completed in such short time. Thankyou.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the patient is to be credited for their resilience during their difficult time- NHS and healthcare workers, whether you're a cleaner, lab tech, doctor, nurse, surgeon, porter, or have one of those titles within healthcare settings I couldn't spell nor pronounce, thankyou. You are brave and strong and inspiring for generations to come. I truly hope you will get some rest soon, and life will find a way to reward you. Thankyou thankyou thankyou. Stay safe and take care.",15Jun2020,1
674,"Alright well I really need help here, 19 M who just finished his first year at college.

This girl went to my highschool and college, and somewhat liked me in hoghschool for like a week, well once we got to college we didn’t talk and then in December I started liking her. I was bad at making my motives clear and only recently started doing homework with her more and occasionally hanging out. Last night I told her I had feelings and she said she was talking with someone already. I really enjoyed every moment I was around her, I thought we had been having good times, and now all I feel is pain and sadness. I really like her but now I don’t know how to move on. I feel like she is unique and the type of person that I would atleast still want in my life but I don’t know if it would be too painful to keep her in my life. This pain just stacks onto my already existing depression and stress about my current summer classes which our going awful. I just had a party that ruined multiple items on my house and I have to fix them just adding to the stress more. My life is just going awful, I have no motivation right now, the pain is endless, didn’t sleep last night. I feel like I just had my world ripped out of me, my source of happiness. And now she won’t leave my mind, she is all I think about. I wish I never met her.

WHAT DO I DO NOW?",15Jun2020,1
675,"Last weekend, my brother and I sat in the garden and got a bit drunk. This resulted in some pretty deep conversations. At one point, he got all depressed and vented to me about something that was bothering him. I didn’t know how to respond so I just sort of nodded along and offered my sympathies. “Man, that sucks...” Stuff like that.

Anyway, he’s actively been trying to avoid me since then. I guess he feels awkward or ashamed about what he told me. This hurts because we’ve always been so close. I don’t want him to feel weird around me but I also don’t know how to make him feel comfortable.

Any advice?",15Jun2020,1
676,"My boyfriend and I have been doing pretty well despite the pandemic, but I was diagnosed with a metastatic recurrence of cancer last Wednesday and it hit me really hard. Things got bad last night when my ex started asking questions about it. Unfortunately he and I work together and he is in a higher position than myself, so I can’t block his number or tell him off. I kept saying that I couldn’t talk about it and I’d give him more info tomorrow (today) morning, but several things were said by him that just worsened my depression. 

I finally took a handful of pills and cut a bit, then texted my boyfriend to let him know how much he means to me. Three hours later I wasn’t showing any signs of OD’ing, so it was surprising yet very obvious that I wasn’t successful. In that time he figured out that I’d done something to myself and I did confess to it. Our conversation started at 7 PM, he figured out around 8 PM, and went to bed a few minutes before midnight. 

Here’s where the issue is... this morning, he texted me saying that he felt like he was in the wrong for not coming over and checking on me. I know he was busy with his game night and he goes to work super early so even though it did hurt that he chose to stay with his D&amp;D group rather than helping me, I told him not to worry about it. I apologized for my actions last night and thought that was going to be the end of it (sans some feelings of guilt that I usually have after a suicide attempt). 

But then he said “To be fair though I was also pretty hurt last night.” I was confused but he said that he was hurt because I hadn’t thought of him and how miserable he would be without me when I took the pills. I told him that I texted him because I wanted him to know how important he is to me (and I wanted to leave him something positive to remember me by, but there’s no way I’ll say that), but now I feel terribly guilty and awful again...

How do I fix this? I’ve been apologizing like crazy but I don’t want him to resent me...",15Jun2020,2
677,"I supervise people in a call center and make around 58k a year. I hate it. It tears my soul out of my body some days. Others it is not so bad.

I have an opportunity to work much more on my own and have much more freedom but I will be making 47k a year (US). 

Part of me feels like I should just suck it up and make more money. People work really hard to get to a point in their life to make that much. 

Part of me knows I should do what makes me happy, because money doesn't mean everything especially if your work is unfulfilling.

678," Thinking of applying for a visa for the US, and the following is written in they're kinda convictions stuff:

It states ""if you have ever been arrested,  cautioned and/or convicted of an offense anywhere in the world,  you are required to declare it when applying for a visa.  In a case where an arrest resulted in a conviction, you may be permanently ineligible to receive a visa and will require a waiver ineligiblity to travel to the United States.  The rehabilitation of offenses act does not apply to us law,  therefore,  even if your arrest or conviction is considered spent, you are still required to declare it and furnish the acro police certificate when applying for a visa""

Technically,  I wasn't arrested, but I took the advice of the then solicitor, which led to a conviction, who instructed me to pleade guilty (I would explain what happened,  but you wouldn't believe me.)

Does it mean I still need to declare it?

680,"do i just look weak? is that it?

well, honestly, im like over 6 feet, skinny. but well, average frame (maybe even a bit above that), i look even angry, basically def not scared. whatever..

what could cause it? its a genuine issue, whenever im alone, i do feel like in a bit danger, (not one on one tho obviously). you know how some people just walk ganged up and shit (basically, pussy asf)

im 18 btw

like, i genuinely want to know what could be the reason behind it?

it almost feels like they don't want me to talk and dont want me to be heard..

i've always been like that

at school for example

i wasn't bullied or anything, and i still wasn't silenced but dudes (some, well actually not even a lot) had problems with it for some reason.  like some of them, were almost only cool when i didn't speak, and had problems when i used to talk.

again, what could have caused it..

do i just look pathetic? or is it the opposite?

how does it work?

also, i've read somewhere that it can be related to facial features too (better bone structure, etc.), how true is it? tbh, i havent felt that way in forever, but i always had girls liking me and stuff, and calling me attractive. not sure if its anyhow correlated to that.

i mean, when i see someone for the first time and shit, or in the streets, i guess that kinda is relevant..

what do yall think?is it cause i look weak?

they almost frown at me, spit to the side, or try to fuck with me some way.

i don't know what to do.

again, its not fear. but, you know how shit might go down. and especially, i do always carry a knife tho.

basically, what can i improve? or should i even improve anything?",15Jun2020,0

682,"Long story short; we were married for 3 years, dated for 3 before that. Known each other since we were 13(30 now). He started drinking in high school and it wasn’t that bad, until we got married and had our son. He got so bad over that time, fired from 8 jobs in 6 years for drinking before or at work. He would drink and drive constantly. He was emotionally abusive, called me names and cornered me in bedrooms so I couldn’t leave. Drinking after work or on the way home so he wouldn’t get caught at work or at home... Once he did it with my son in the car, and I decided to end our marriage. Legally we have 50/50 custody...(in Florida) I can’t gain full custody unless he is drinking while watching our son (during his turn) and I’d have to prove it. 

Well, three weeks ago he got fired again from this job he had for two years...didn’t tell me for a few days, and now just told me he can’t pay daycare this week..(we split it, I pay a little extra because I make more)I asked him when he first lost his job to plan how many weeks he can cover with daycare so I wouldn’t be stuck last minute paying for it by myself. 

So now I’m stressing over financials of covering his half of daycare while he is job hunting...I’m sure he will pay me back, but still..I have a lot of expenses especially the end of the month, and also our sons birthday is this week and I was planning on taking him out...so now I can’t.

684,"so this is a massive mess and a very long story.
 this is backstory: 
i (15f) have a friend (16f) - lets call her Helen. we go to school together and have been friends for two years. when i became friends with helen she was already friends with another girl (let’s call her Roseanna). i had no problem with Roseanna and us 3 became really good friends. 
however, in december of last year, Roseanna started going out with a boy (Jack). and that’s where the problems started.
Roseanna changed so much, she started having underage sex with Jack - Helen found videos of them on Roseanna’s phone - they both cheated on each other numerous times, they were both extremely manipulative towards themselves and us (their friends) and used us. one example is when Roseanna wanted to meet with Jack but had to look after her two younger sisters (3 and 12) she would ask either myself or Helen to come down to her house to hang out. Then she would get Jack down and they would disappear up to her room for a “few minutes” -spoiler: it was hours- and we would be left downstairs to mind her sisters. 
also Helen and Roseanna would regularly meet up without me which i hated and told them that but all i got was empty apologies. last year they met up together without me on my birthday. 
eventually - September 2019 - Helen and i got sick of this and cut Roseanna off which caused a lot of drama and ill-feeling between us all. 
so in late February/ early April Helen texted me at around 10pm OUT OF THE BLUE telling me that her and Roseanna had made up and did I want to be friends with THEM ? even tho for the past SIX MONTHS Helen and i had been best friends ??
i was very upset and didn’t go into school the next day, but came to the decision that i had no other option than to be friends with Roseanna if i didn’t want to lose Helen. 
and so we were all friends together for a week or two until quarantine hit and i wasn’t rly on social media so i didn’t talk to either of them until one day when Helen messaged me telling me that her and Roseanna weren’t friends anymore.
i wasn’t bothered and told her that’s fine and thought nothing more of it UNTIL i was in the park one day and saw them together. i was devastated that Helen had betrayed my trust again. i sent her a long letter in which i explained how i felt and she completely blew up at me. 
i basically went nc with her after that and she with me until her birthday on the 12th of june where i messaged her ‘happy birthday’. she didn’t reply but that evening posted pictures of her and Roseanna together at her -Helen’s- house. i also commented ‘cute’ with an emoji but she didn’t reply to that either.
ANYWAYS, i am moving schools in September and i was wondering if i should still make an effort to talk to Helen if we won’t be in school together next year ?
ik this is very long and thank you so much to anyone who reads it, i would love some advice because Helen and i have had good times together but i just don’t know what to do.",15Jun2020,2
685,"My sister has always been immature and sensitive. But it’s becoming more apparent now that we’re older. I’m 19 and she’s 24. We both live in a house my mom owns. I recently moved in (left my dad’s house). And lately I’ve been a little Type A about minor household upkeep. I haven’t told my sister to do anything. She just gets annoyed whenever I complain/mention something that’s out of order. She claims that when her only interaction with me is critiquing something it makes me appear negative (mind you I do talk/joke to her about other things) . However, this is just me trying to be responsible in a house I don’t pay rent in. I had no idea me making these small complaints made her resentful. On top of that my sister just doesn’t like being told what to do (but like I’ve said I never told her what to do). We fought this morning because I told her to turn down her music because I was sleeping and I work later (I was annoyed but not impolite) and she called me “negative"" and said I needed to ""calm down"". When I told her me enforcing boundaries in a reasonable tone didn’t make me negative she plugged her ears and told me to go away. I told her she was being a b*tch/childish and she was projecting. Long story short my sister feels that we as a family argue a lot. Which is true. But I told her that she participates and sometimes prompts the arguments by stepping over boundaries. I told her if you live in a house you don’t pay rent in AND if you live with someone else you have to be considerate. Personally I don’t feel like my critiques should be an issue. I just feel like it’s a personality clash. I also feel like she’s upset with our current family dynamics.",15Jun2020,1

687,"People of reddit, I need your help! 

Pre-COVID, I planned a destination bachelorette/birthday trip for my best friend. We have a group of 9 going to Florida, all booked and paid for since feb. Total costs roughly $400 per person, they still have time to pay me their portion. Some already paid, most have not. 

In late April, I emailed everyone to see if they still wanted to go on the trip (I could cancel the airbnb and get 50% back). I said I completely understand if they do not feel comfortable coming on the trip, but to let me know ASAP. I hadn't booked the activities yet and didn't want to until I had a solid headcount. I mentioned this to the bride, and told her that depending on the situation (i.e. illness or job loss) I might not accept payment from someone who had to cancel. It wasn't a firm decision, just something I was thinking about. Everyone still wanted to go.  

I asked everyone to confirm again if they were coming. One of the BMs didn't respond to me, and instead called the bride to tell her she has anxiety because she lives in a ""hot spot"" with a lot of cases and is worried about being a carrier. The bride **insisted** that she not pay if she couldn't come, and then called me the next day and told me. I was really upset that she told her not to pay. I felt that it was my decision if I wanted to make that gesture, and it really caught me off guard. She told me that she would pay for her friend's portion, but I feel wrong accepting the bride's money. We still don't know if she is coming or not, and I did not want to get upset, especially with her so I let it go. I wish the bride was never involved, after I had really tried to communicate with everyone and be understanding.   

Today, I received an email from another bridesmaid, who happens to be the bride's SIL. She cannot come for a health reason that is perfectly understandable. The bride and their family does not know yet, so I can't say anything. She already paid her portion and did not mention wanting money back. 

The question is, after the bride told her friend that she wouldn't have to pay if she wasn't coming, how can I keep the money of her SIL? Who has a very legitimate reason not to come. Again, we still don't know if the friend is coming or not, but I'm worried. It's one thing to lose $400, another thing to lose $800. This is all coming out of my pocket, no one else's. I'm in a really tough position now and don't even know how to respond to the SIL. I want to say it's completely fine and give her money back, but then what happens if the friend cancels too? Do you see my predicament? What do I do!?",15Jun2020,1
688,"Hope this post is all right here. OK so context on my (25F) uncle: he decided to go up on a ladder to fix the roof; aunt (his wife) didn’t like that I think because he was elderly, but he insisted it was fine. He fell off the ladder and died at the hospital. 

Dad mentioned that his wife’s sister had dreamt a few days before that he would die, and didn’t say anything to him or her sister. I don’t know any other details about her dream.

I’ve never been a believer in spiritualism or anything like that, but I did vividly dream about my cousin and me bawling because her sister was passing away of cancer.

692,"We've had a joint account for almost a decade, for 2 years in the beginning we didn't. We were able to afford quite a bit.

The situation: I've always made twice, sometimes triple, what he's ever made. I own all of the assets and make all of the big purchases. I don't mind this as I'm greatfull my partner is home enough to cook, clean, and take care of the dogs on more occasion than I can. We've always spoken about him being a SAHD and I'd be the working Mom. It's always been like this for us.

The problem: since the conjoining my networth hasn't grown in value much and my savings has been entirely depleted. I always foot the late fees on the bills he forgets to pay. He doesn't own a car because he accepts a plethora of used and abused vehicles from his family members that either have loans out on them or are beyond repair and break down within a month despite how many thousands I sink into them trying to keep them running. He breaks expensive items in our house that more or less need to be replaced on a monthly basis. Or we need gas or food. Or he wants a video game or game console. Lately he's been revealing that he has been buying fast food lunches during work and sometimes buys smokes and other people's items. He's a sweet guy with the best intensions.

The sitch: his parents are visiting this weekend and will be leaving his younger brother for a few weeks as well as a lemon for him to keep. This month I've been able to pay off all our bills, putting us on track for the rest of the year, which we are lucky for given the pandemic. I'm completely terrified that if I don't end up with a savings threshold or at least something to maintain my financial Independence, that I'll end this year feeling used or worse. I've spoken to my bank about opening a separate checking account solely for me. When it opens, I plan on filing the proper paperwork for direct deposit at my work. 

I need advice: I plan on discussing going back to splitting our bills 50/50 again, but I don't know how to approach the topic. I will be able to maintain my half of our bills and my own separate bill expenditure, and be able to keep well over a thousand a month. This will leave him with almost nothing at the end of getting paid and paying his portion of our bills. I mean, dollars. I'm afraid he will find this unfair, even if I give him regular allowances. I don't know if he'll take this as I'm trying to separate myself from him, and I'm not sure if there a trope where the relationship starts to fall apart once you separate your paychecks. I'm not even sure if I can actually justify doing this other than I'm just trying to have a retirement. Or maybe I do just want to cling to some of my own money. Either way, I'm terrified how fragile this will make him or us. Am I even doing the right thing? Is this something I should obtain his approval on? How do I tell him he's too much of a spender for me to feel comfortable letting him take from my cookie jar?

On his old accounts he mostly followed pretty white girls, some pretty asian girls and some latinas. I’m black. He’s hispanic. It’s stressing me out that im not what he really wants. He says im beautiful but he has never admired a black woman everrrrr. These girls r as white as can be. I’m getting anxiety

Good evening reddit,

yesterday  evening I M(19) called the girl F(19) I have been dating with for 2  months, the girl I lost my virginity to, and my first actual short  lasted relationship, to end it. The reason I did that was, she said she  was feeling uncomfortable for us 2 to do anything beyond holding hugs  and hugging, cause she made her feel guilty, and/or have second thoughts  mid/after making out or kissing or having sex. When I asked her why I  shortly found out that her 1.5 year ago 4-month-lasted ex came back in  town. This made me pretty upset, and annoyed, cause he have spent a  considerable ammount of time together, cuddling, doing stuff, or just  talking. Heck she even said she loved me like the day before that. She  said we could still date, but without becoming sexually engaged till she  felt better. My opinion? Bullshit. I called her and said that I didn't  feel like being her backup plan, she should feel free to explore her  feelings with the dude, and that im out of there, but she can give me a  call if the things don't work out (hookup implied). I pretty much  initiated the no contact rule. I feel kinda bad, not cause she is gone,  just cause I gave my everything to this, even if I didn't show this, and  like, all of the feelings were fake all this time? Idk dude, it just  hurts a bit. I don't know what to do and tbh its a pretty hard period of  my life, exams, summer coming up and I could use some help from someone  more experienced than I am

Thanks in advance",15Jun2020,2
705,"I’ve lived with my roommate for about a year now, and we’ve been close friends for years. We shared an old friend in high school, but we cut her off because she was toxic and a bad friend. My roommate has recently become friends with her again, but I in no way want to allow her to be a significant part of my life again, so I’ve just been tolerating her when she visits. I have no problem with my roommate having friends over, but this friend seems to be over constantly. She stayed for a week because she was “sick of her mom” and is now staying for another week because she got a sunburn and apparently isn’t adult enough to take care of herself. Summer is my only time to ever sleep in (we’re both in college) and I would like to get more than 6 hours of sleep a night for once. The friend and my roommate were loud until 2am last night, and then the friend was loud at 8am this morning. Then at 8:30 she started banging dishes around in the kitchen. 

For some reason neither of them are hanging out in my roommates room (which would make things quieter) but are instead constantly staying in the living room (which is between both our rooms). She also eats all of our food (which I pay for) and hasn’t contributed any money to me in the two weeks she’s stayed here except for paying my share of pizza once. She’s always loud and obnoxious, and seems to bring out the worst in my roommate. I’m really sick of her being over all the time, especially with a global pandemic still going on (most of my close family is immunocompromised in some way) and I honestly feel like my roommate and her friend are being really inconsiderate and aren’t considering that another person lives here. I’m trying not to snap at them, but biting my tongue is getting really old. I’ve asked them to be quiet in the morning before, and that lasted for a whole 20 minutes before they were loud again. How should I bring this up to my roommate and her friend? I don’t want to seem too harsh, but I want them to understand that I live here too and it’s important for me to actually sleep and few comfortable in my own apartment.",15Jun2020,1
706,"Hi there. This is long but I hope you read till the end. Please.

I've been thinking about this for months and it's not that easy knowing I should be having my third year in college this school year but I don't know what will happen to me if I stay in my current school. I've been trying to avoid this but as enrollment dates comes closer, I can't help it. But I don't have anyone I'm comfortable talking to other than the people already involve in my 'reason of leaving' so I'm turning on reddit to ask opinions and advice. But first, I'd like you all to know why I want to leave my current school.

I love my university. It wasn't perfect, but at least I was having fun learning and taking classes and meeting people. Not until,the 1st semester of my 2nd year begun. 

I don't have any personal problems with the professor. I don't love nor hate him. He's okay but on that certain day, he was pissed at someone in our class. At first we, the class, thought the 'threats' were jokes. He was smiling while saying, ""I've dropped a lot of students in my class. You can call your parent but that won't help. I can fail anyone."" He kept going on about failing grades and possibly  failing us and all that. We laughed, of course, because we didn't have a clue what was happening. We didn't realize he was angry and was specifically talking about someone until he broke the laughter and said, ""I may be smiling but I'm actually serious.""  Everyone who tried to make things comfortable tried to smile but we knew something was up. Later that day, we found out he was offended by a comment made by one of my classmates in our private group chat. 

That was the first incident and it kept getting more toxic as classes went by. At the end of that sem, a few of my classmates were failed. And those people were the students he didn't particularly liked. By now, you may seem to think that we should've reported him and asked authorities. We did that. Nobody actually paid attention. We were told to give him...another chance. So we did. We shrugged the issue, hoping he'll stop.

But the second sem was worse than worst. Even those who favored him as our professor, turned their backs on him because he was...being so unfair. This was when everything was I started having panic attacks and anxiety. Like I said, I never hated him. He was okay until he wasn't, until I can't even tolerate him anymore. I sometimes think he's crazy and that he has issues because he is purposely doing things to make us fail. We were taking Theatre classes from him (he's the only professor available to teach that subject so we had no choice). He makes surprise graded activities which he doesn't do to other classes with the same subject he's teaching. He even embarrasses and scolds my classmates, my friends, in front of the class for something so simple. He rejects our work and effort, even though we were better than his expectations. One time, he assigned two of my classmates as the writer of a play, and wants the script to be ready after a day then REJECTS IT when presented. There was also a time, he didn't attend the presentation. He left the room and went back when the presentation was done AND STRAIGHT SCOLDED THE WRITERS FOR 'NOT DOING A GOOD JOB' AND 'BEING A BAD STUDENT.' I mean, we accept criticisms but what he does is so unfair. He doesn't give us a chance to prove ourselves. 

Of course, I also had a taste of his craziness. I was assigned to make arrangement of the music we'll use during the play. It is supposed to be original unless licensed to avoid copyrights. So as someone who doesn't want to disappoint, I made arrangements with an alumni along with one of our ""producers"" who already has a record label to help us with the accompaniments as I'm not good with instruments. The alumni agreed to help and went his way. After that meaning, I rejoiced because we had a good deal for such a nice price BUT then the professor barged into the practice room, dragged the alumni and scolded him. Shocked? We were too. He scolded the alumni because during the meeting he 'allegedly' criticize the professor and mocked him in front of us. Who told him? His beloved ""producer,"" a snitch and a liar and his FAVORITE student who'd do anything to win his favor. It was true that the alumni asked topics outside of the deal like how we were doing and the problems we're encountering BUT he never mocked the prof. It was shameful because I invited that person to help us. In the end, he was shamed in front of everyone. I broke down that day. But it wasn't the end. There were more occasions  where he sabotages our productivity through her ""beloved producer"" and try to fail us and even STOP the theatrical play for us to play. He gave us anxiety, and I woke up every morning feeling drained. And when I enter class, it isn't just me whose feeling it. Aside from that ""favorite,"" everyone was tired and demotivated. Everyone was just holding on for the sake of grades and our dreams. 

And when I saw that, I decided to confront the problem. I braved myself to talk to him. I initiated a meeting so we could try and mend the relationship HE BROKE. We told him everything, our problems, the pain, and everything to clear up issues and problems. But it didn't work. It never works. Right now, he must be very thankful for COVID because his desire to stop our production happened. The play didn't happened because of the virus. Now, just imagine what he did in our grades. We did our best, better than what the expected during rehearsals but because it didn't went through, he found a way to drag us down. All because he had a personal grudge we don't even know about.

I tried. We tried.  We talked to people but the school doesn't listen. Probably because this professor has high ranks and good reputation in the university. Yes, he is smart and known in the school so how can we fight someone like that? How can we, merely students, convince higher-ups to listen to us? They may even take it as a joke. They won't believe us because we tried to talk to people, we reached out...but no one reached back 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I'm thinking of transferring instead...but I'll graduate late. I'll be left behind. I'll break my promise to my parents that I'll graduate on time. I need to be able to support them because they're not getting any younger. They're old. I need to be there for them. 

but if I stay... I don't know what'll happen.

&amp;#x200B;

So help? Please? I'm really tired thinking about it. Please?",15Jun2020,1

710,"I have a job I'm pretty good at, where I make enough money to pay the bills, where the culture is mostly okay. The only 'problem' I have is with my amount of work: I'm rarely busy and can knock out my essential job duties, plus additional assignments, with maybe 10-15 hours worked for the week, total. I'm able to WFH right now which is great. So what's my problem?

I feel chained to my desk and cannot will myself to work on other things in my free time. It feels dishonest to take an extra 15 minutes during my lunch hour to get a workout in, or (when working in the office) go to a restaurant for lunch on a slow day. No one is looking for me and I don't clock in/out so it's not like I'm stealing the time, and if something comes up during the day I didn't account for I have no problem staying late to make sure it gets done, especially to account for the 'extra' time I took earlier in the day.

I also don't feel 'allowed' to work on personal projects, although no one has ever explicitly stated as such. I would like to work on improving a variety of skills so that I can get a better, higher paying job and build a better future, one where I don't JUST pay the bills but can contribute to retirement, have a sizable savings, go on vacations, pay of my debts and generally feel more fulfilled. But I just can't make myself do it. I feel like I'm going to get in trouble, or worse, fired, even though by improving these skills I would also inevitably be improving my current job performance and could even potentially move up within my company.

It's not like I sit around all day doing nothing, although it's barely better. When I am not working-working, I am on 'standby' mode, browsing reddit, facebook, IG etc mostly mindlessly. It's unfulfilling but I feel guilty working on anything else, which I don't understand.

I've even explicitly told my boss I was going to train myself on X, Y, and Z to get her 'permission', but I haven't done it. I think part of what is contributing to the feeling that I'm not allowed to do these things is that when I told her, she said it was fine and then the next day assigned me a very time intensive, but otherwise boring task outside my 'hired-for' job duties, so it was as if she was saying ""I said ok but it's really not.""

How do I get past this feeling?

I have been suffering with OCD for a while now, and I have a therapist.

I used to have really horrible intrusive thoughts/ images come into my mind and it made me question whether it was true. I couldn’t speak to anyone about this, so sometimes I would rip a tiny piece of paper and write down the worry and bin it. 

But my OCD is starting again bad because I’m thinking, what if I wrote down one of my awful intrusive thoughts in my notebook, (which I might have left at University) and now I’m anxious incase someone who reads it believes it’s true what I wrote. 

What should I do?

I know the things I had intrusive thoughts are likely not true but because I have OCD it makes me doubt. I’m worried if someone who doesn’t understand would just hate me, or tell everyone what I wrote.

I don’t even really remember writing anything in that book but OCD, keeps saying what if ?? And this is 24/7 worry and anxiety.",15Jun2020,1
717,"Im (24M) going a trip with a co-ed group of friends and everything seems to be centered around “getting an insta”. The clothes, the location, the food, the airbnb, etc. it’s soo annoying and has lead to us passing up on great venues bc their not “insta worthy”. 

I will say it may be partially my fault, since I knew this in advance. We all come from well-off backgrounds and in college used to love to “flex for the gram”. We’d wear designer clothes all the time, go to expensive clubs, eat overpriced food at fancy restaurants, and post everything on social and thought we were hot shit, and just like to be seen in general. 

I’m not trying to be holier than thou bc I also loved doing all of that at the time...but I’ve changed now. Idk I just don’t care about that stuff anymore, and now that it’s my own money instead of my parents I want to save it all and not blow it on pointless things. 

I love my friends and really enjoy hanging out with them. I just hate how this flexing/insta mentality is such a big factor in their lives. Is this even a subject worth broaching with them? Or if I want to maintain the friendship, do I just have to grin and bear this side of them? I don’t want to insult them, but I’m just in a different place now.",15Jun2020,1

719,"I (F18) have a girlfriend (F19) who happens to be a little overweight. She does not get along with her mother or sister and they’re both anorexic and trying to get her to be as well. Luckily, my gf moved out and so did I so we are renting a place together away from that toxicity. But basically since middle school she has been bullied by her mom and sister about her weight and how much better they think she looked when she was skinny. Obviously, this caused internal conflict in my girlfriend’s mind as well. She’s always (not always, but every time she looks in a mirror, etc) talking about how much of a “lard” she is, calling herself “lard ass” and “ugly,” “obese,” even “morbidly obese,” which, realistically, she is fat from it. I have been skinny as a stick my whole life and never had to deal with the problems she faces on the daily. I couldn’t possibly ever fully understand what she is going through, but personally, I think she’s the most beautiful girl in the world (I tell her every day). Her weight doesn’t matter to me. But I know that is unhelpful information to her. What can I say (or avoid saying) that will help her know that I think she’s beautiful? Pertaining to weight specifically, preferably, but doesn’t have to. I am not asking for help to “fix” her. I just want things I can say to her sometimes that will make her feel good about herself.

I’m working on being secure in my body, but my main point in this question is about comfort. A lot of times tights pants such as leggings or tight jeans (especially lighter colors) make me feel 1. Insecure and 2. Uncomfortable. I don’t like how it feels in that area and I don’t like how they make me look sometimes. The problem is that I love wearing comfortable leggings but it’s really hard for me to find a pair I feel good in.

722,"I apologize for the long post ahead. I have been wanting to talk about this for a while, but hadn’t had the nerve to post. When I (24F) was 15, I got into a “relationship” with my youth pastor who was in his early 30’s. I’ll call him Joe. I had just moved to a new town and I was young, naive and somewhat sheltered. From the very beginning, I didn’t see the signs that Joe paid special attention to me. We were both leading music for the the young adult church. He would buy me gifts, constantly try to get us alone during band practice, and would offer to drive me to places/home. I thought he was being nice, I was just happy to have a friend in a new town. 

Things started to go bad quickly. Over the next year or so, we got so involved to a point where he proposed to me and basically said we would wait until I was 18 so he could “take me away”. He was such a creepy person. He would literally get off on the innocent young girl clothes/jewelry I wore and wanted me to wear specific things. He became extremely possessive, and wouldn’t let me talk to or see any of my close friends, especially the guys I was friends with. Nobody knew what was going on behind closed doors, everybody and I mean EVERYBODY loved this guy and thought he was the perfect Christian, perfect pastor. Eventually my mom started to suspect things, and she found a blog he had posted online where he basically went into details of what was going on. I still can’t believe what a fucking moron he was to have posted on the internet like that. But anyways, my mom confronted me and then went to the head pastor of the church and told him and the elders what was going on. We ended up having a meeting at my house with Joe and all the elders and pastor. Joe sobbed hysterically and begged for my PARENTS and the churches forgiveness, but not mine. He then asked if everyone would step out for a minute so he could apologize to me privately. And when everyone went outside, he basically said “yeah, I’m still in love with you. This doesn’t mean anything, and I’m still going to marry you when you’re 18.” Once again, he lied to everyone and we continued the relationship secretly. Despite all his bullshit, how controlling and creepy he was, I was still madly in love with him. 

Eventually, things became harder to hide and we stopped seeing each other as much. I had a lady who was my mentor at the time, who I told everything that was going on and she helped me work through it. I found out several months after that meeting that Joe and her started dating. My world was destroyed. The whole church took Joes side of things, I ended up leaving my church. All my friends at the church called me a slut and abandoned me. To sum it up, I went crazy. It started me down a long path of abusive relationships, drugs, drinking, you name it. I destroyed my life for several years after that because of what everyone did to me. 

Now, 9 years later, I’m doing really well. I’m completely sober and I have a wonderful husband and a baby boy. But I still can’t think of Joe or even hear his name or it makes me fucking livid. I hate him. I blame him for destroying my life. I was a child, and he took advantage of me while he was supposed to be a role model in a damn church. I feel like he has to know how much he hurt me and how much what he did fucked me up for so many years. I want him to hurt like he hurt me. He is apparently going to Seminary now and is a wonderful Christian man who everyone still adores. Yet he has never owned up to the fact that he’s a fucking pedophile. I need closure in some way and I have no idea if I should Facebook message him how I feel, meet him in person, or try and let it go completely and not talk to him. Has anyone confronted someone like this? Did you receive closure for confronting them? I don’t know what to do. I’m so angry and I hate having these feelings still. I want it to end. 

TLDR: I was 15 and got preyed on by my 30 year old youth pastor. The church found out, and everyone took his side and it destroyed my life. He is doing super well now and is going to seminary. He has never owned up to being a pedophile.",15Jun2020,1

Our first week we didn’t realize the dryer was never connected to a wall and almost started a fire. They came days later to fix it. Next someone tried breaking into our apt and our door has still not been sense fixed and is very very stubborn to close. (And there’s a huge gap below our door letting out all the cool air) Then my roommates ceiling started leaking and she immediately told them, they came in told her they weren’t able to do anything due to corona and then cut a hole and took out her fire alarm for a month without warning the neighbors of the safety hazard and let alone letting us not have one for over a month. After a month of calling we finally go ahold of the manager because she had a huge gaping hole/ dripping/ and no fire detector for a month and asked them if they were going to compensate for the issues. They said no and came to fix it the next day. And now my ceiling is leaking A LOT everytime the person in the apartment showers above me in leaks through my light fixture into my shower ( A LOT OT WATER) and I can hear it pouring onto my ceiling when the neighbor above showers. 
I’m honestly done with this apartment and I want to be compensated in some way because I just want out of here.

726,"So we've had this very nice smart TV for 4 years now. It has stood the test of time. A true victor, if you will. My partner was very (and I mean very) attached to it. It was one of our first major purchases together. It symbolized the beginning of our new lives together and has been with us for many years. To me, it was just a nice TV. An appliance. To my partner, it was so much more. 

Recently, we were horsing around in the living room and my partner attempted to juggle a sippy cup (he's quite adept, and it's almost become a magic trick in our house). Welp... Sippy cup flew careening off course and collided with the TV. The collision was horrifying. Slow motion, gasps, fallen faces, the whole shibang. Just imagine the sound of impact, the crackle and pop. My partner was (and still is) devastated. In tears, broken up, the works. He feels he's responsible for the loss of life of our dear TV. 

At first I shrugged it off. To me it's just a TV. It's replaceable. My partner, on the other hand, is so broken up about it. I'm questioning myself now.

730,"So I have been considering changing my major for a while lately, and nursing has definitely caught my eye as a potential possibility. At my college, you can’t get into nursing school unless you complete a full year of perquisites beforehand. Thus, many people find out they got accepted into nursing school as a sophomore. Right now, I am an incoming sophomore (18 years old) for the 2020/2021 school year, so if I suddenly decide to change to nursing I’ll have to spend the entirety of my sophomore year taking prerequisites without knowing if I’ll even make it into nursing school. 

Is it worth it to get on the nursing path this late without being sure I’ll get in?? My school’s program is very competitive, only accepting about 120 people ever admission round.

I’m okay at science, but I get really anxious in labs. The downside is I have no work/volunteer experience in the medical field, which is encouraged for the nursing school application, so I’d have to get a little experience first. The main reason I’m interested in nursing is because I’m fascinated by the psychiatric nurse practitioner career and can see myself being a part of it. 

To anyone who is a nurse or is involved in nursing schools/programs, do you think I would be a good fit, and do you think I’m making a poor decision by starting late?",15Jun2020,1
731,"I know this shady person and they are claiming to sell things in the name of charity. They do this online and people praise them for being generous. I know they’ve been involved in shady schemes before so I confronted them about posting proof of donations and they told me to mind my own business. They have not posted proof of donations yet and am surprised no one called them out anyway.

I want to call them out online but my partner says that would be wrong, that I shouldn’t publicly shame them because I didn’t give them money and I have no proof that they stole anything.  I argue they haven’t proven they donated anything and my history with this person makes me suspicious. Any advice?

**edit**: I think I needed to be more clear, it would not be a call out accusing them of stealing, it would be me publicly requesting proof of donations. I have seen many other people post receipts when selling things for charity. I would not be publicly calling them a thief.

edit again lol: they have claimed online to have sold hundreds of dollars worth of things for charity

734,"Throwaway because I just read/scroll on Reddit and don't usually participate, but I would like some advice.

Me and my boyfriend decided to move in together. We are looking to get an apartment in August because that is when his lease ends. We have two options. 

We could stay in the city because he does not have a car and walks to work. The 1-bedrooms in this location cost $1,400 per month. Together, we can afford this, and it is a 20 minute commute for my job. We would also have to buy the furniture basics like a bed, table, etc, but nothing extravagant. 

Alternatively, we could live in my step-dad's house. My mom got re-married and my step-dad lives with her, so his house is empty now. It is about $800 per month, and it is fully furnished. The house is in the suburbs, but the commute is notorious for taking 1.5 hours during rush hour. I would have to drop off my boyfriend, go to my job, and then return, taking about 3.5+ hours per day. Also, my mom only lives 10 minutes from this house, but I prefer to keep some distance between us because she has a tendency to take advantage of me. We are cordial, but some big issues have gone down between us. 

My boyfriend wants to stay in the city. He is averse to the commute and is worried about how my mother will treat me. He knows living at my step-dads house will save money, but he says he has no problem paying more for peace of mind. I have always put as much money into savings as possible, so when I hear the rent difference, it makes me hesitate to live in the city. 

Are the commute and potential issues with my mom worth the amount of money we save? What should be the bigger priority? Which housing option is better?",15Jun2020,1
736,"I'm (25F) am so lost at this point. My grandmother (70F) has severe dementia, which my family and I found out about last December 2019. She pretty much has a problem with everyone in our family. My mom, my sister, my cousins, even my uncles. That's how she's been for my whole life. I believe that anger and resentment has been the two things that led her to having dementia. There are stories I've read where a nice, kind grandparent has turned mean or nasty because of the disease. I would say that my grandmother is exactly the same, except much more paranoid, much more livid and very snide. 

I haven't had the best relationship with her for the past 10 years and she moved away to a different state about four years ago, and in her words ""never wanted to hear from any of us again."" I guess we should have been alarmed but that's how she's always been. Impulsive, cruel, and could carry anger with her everywhere. 

Fast forward to December, my mom called her. I kept thinking something was off. I tend to have a sense about things before they happen. That's when we found out she had dementia. Not only did she tell us, but she started calling everyday after that. Many times in anger or would ask very invasive questions. Like to me she would say ""so why haven't you been married? Are you broken as a woman?"" Stupid stuff like that. 

But then come February, she calls us from the hospital saying she was robbed by a man in her town. She'd never seen him before. My mom spoke to the attending nurse and the nurse said there was nothing wrong with her, no injuries or bruises and she told the police she didn't want to file a report. It was late and the nurse said because of overcrowding (I think early signs of Coronavirus) my grandmother would have to stay in the waiting room until a social worker could take her home in the morning because she was refusing to go home. 

My mom decided to bring her here, which is about 5 hours away from her city. For a month she was refusing to go home because she was afraid. Understandable. Unfortunately the month went by and Coronavirus was in full force so my grandmother couldn't leave. And the past four to five months have been a living nightmare since then. Anger. Frustration. Lies. Cruelty. All from her. Quite frankly, I'm super triggered because this is exactly how she acted when I was a kid. 

Long story short: She refuses to seek any medical attention or really any advice from anyone. She keeps wanting to leave even though her state is still pretty shut down. She argues and yells from morning to night. She leaves her mess and filth around for us to clean up. How, HOW can I help someone like this? How can my family help someone who is so toxic and mean? But most importantly, how can we get the best care for her when she doesn't believe she needs care and won't trust us to do anything for her? 

tl;dr: Grandmother was toxic. Grandmother is still toxic with dementia. How can we get her some help when she hates us?",15Jun2020,1

741,"So I had this mentorship program growing for awhile, where I mentor a middle schooler who is academically advanced. The kid is awesome and we bonded quickly as he's interested in the field of work I'm in. Before the covid, I met with him and for security purposes, his mom would join the meetings. She would always be engaging and asking questions too, which I thought was awesome as I saw it as she was being engaging and wanted to participate too. All of my communication has been through my mentee's mom, as that's how the program wants it to be. I have a public IG profile and began to notice this lady seeing my stories and a few weeks later started following me. A few weeks later she sent me a fb request as well and I just wasn't sure what it meant. 

Yesterday morning I received a text message from her with a picture in underwear. It wasn't too much of a pose/sexy picture. And the message seemed to be for someone else. It took her about 2 hours to sent me a message apologizing about this and said that she felt embarrassed. I haven't replied back a s I'm not sure what to even say.

746,"My stepfather was diagnosed with cancer in late April/early May. This was tough to digest as my real father died when I was very young so he’s been the only constant father figure in my life.

I was trying to figure out a way to tell my girlfriend about it but before I could she told me she was leaving me for one of my friends. The timing could not have been worse. At a moment where I needed my girlfriend more than ever she deserted me. 

Thankfully the outlook on my stepdad’s cancer is good and he’ll likely pull through. The treatment is the tough part. It’s obviously taking a toll on him mentally and physically and means that none of us in my house can come in contact with anyone because if he were to get covid now he’d die. This fact is very depressing because as lockdown begins to lift we have to further into it for quite a while. 

This coupled with the knowledge that my ex girlfriend moved on from me so quickly (we’d been going out for a year and a half) to someone I thought was a friend and who’s definitely not compatible with her (everyone agrees) is a should destroying feeling. This is taking a large toll on me and each day as I watch on from the sidelines while my stepdad suffers and my girlfriend buddies up with my weasel ex friend I feel more in danger each day of going into a mild depression. I’m starting to have a constant low mood and to exercise or perform my hobbies is becoming tougher due to lack of motivation. Is this just a passing low mood due to what’s going on or something more?

747,"I am sorry this is long.. and I don't know if I'm writing to the right subreddit.. This has been on my mind for the past several years, and I don't know where to ask..

Being an adult is hard. I have to be wary of everything around me because there are tons of organizations with conflicts of interest, and I always need to be on my guard for everything.

Need a car fixed? Be careful which mechanics you go to, as they might take advantage of your lack of car knowledge and overcharge you for everything.

Want to eat healthy? Well then go on low-fat diet? wait no.. Go on low-carb diet? wait no.. Go on a 5 day fast? Wait no... You can keep researching this stuff for years, with no obvious answer.

When I was little, I followed almost everything my parents told me. And usually the result was pretty good. Because of my parents' guidance, I became quite successful in life. I recognize I am very lucky I had such great parents.

As I grow older, I can no longer lean on my parents to answer most questions. And society deems me to be completely responsible for my mistakes, chastising my for not doing enough research. If I fall for false advertising, it is my fault. This makes life miserable. I have to be an expert at everything, otherwise risk being taken advantage of. 

I have definitely made mistakes in my life, and learned useful but very stressful lessons from those mistakes. Unfortunately the amount of stressful lessons increases over time, especially now that I am responsible for my children's future.

I feel a stronger burden of being the parent, needing to make all of the life decisions. Which dentist should I switch my family to? Should we live in a big city or a small city? Should we have another child? Are we even raising the kids correctly??

Growing up in a scientific field, I never believed in ""god"" that understands humans and makes ""miracles"", and nor do I want such a religion.

**I want a replacement for my parent's guidance.**

I wish for there to be a philosophy, or religion, or whatever you want to call it, I can follow, that will make decisions for me which things to buy, what friends to make, where I should live, etc.

I just want something I can trust, and not have to have any second doubts about it.

Is there such a philosophy / religion? I have tried to look into this online.

The two ""ways of life"" I've found so far have been Stoicism and Humanism. But both talk about how to live life, without going into details on where to live, what to buy, how to raise my children correctly, etc.

There are *tons* of self help articles / books on each subject. but it is extremely hard to know which is the correct book to follow. It feels like another decision that I have to spend tons of time researching and be stressed out about whether or not I am doing the right thing or not.

What should I trust? What should I follow? Is there a replacement for religion?",15Jun2020,1
748,"For background: I am a nearly 30 y.o female. I taught elementary math and science for 4 years before I got burnt out. I stuck with it so long because I truly loved the act of teaching and loved my students. The timing was right that my husband got a job offer at the end of my 4th year, and having been burnt out already, decided it was a good time to change career paths. 

I thought a natural move would be to go into higher ed, since my background is education. No one would even give me the time of day since I was elementary and I finally was given a shot as a part time glorified secretary at a community college and after a few months was moved into an advisory position, but still part time. 

During that time I discovered working with college age students just wasn’t for me and the job itself was not fulfilling- I felt like most of my job was busy data entry work and I always felt I had to beg my boss to give me more things to do, which I think she took personally.

I left for a full time job at a non-profit (think animals) and I’ve been mostly really excited about it. I had been there two weeks before all the Covid stuff started so I’ve essentially been away from my team from the start and I think it’s just starting to get to me. 

My team is only 5 people, including myself. 3 are “managers” and then myself and another female. The segregation of roles is very apparent given the small team size- the managers are always having meetings without myself and my colleague and therefore always mentioning things from these meetings that I have no background on. This includes inside jokes and info about people I don’t know. I just sit there and don’t say anything on our calls unless prompted. 

I feel very isolated and really don’t feel like I’m a part of the team. To compound this, their matters always seem the highest priority and it, just like my previous job, makes my tasks seem low level and not important. 

People can say what they will about teaching, but I had a lot of pride when I was a teacher. I felt like a professional. I just can’t seem to find something that I feel that way about. I wanted to love this job, but I feel unimportant when I’m not included in these meetings. 

To give more perspective, we have our largest event coming up in a few weeks. Things I know about this event: the name and that it is virtual. I am literally donor relations. This event is all about donations. Shouldn’t I know more?

I still feel slightly self-conscious about my belly and I still don't know how to get over it.

Today I saw this person pleasuring themselves on their balcony. Not like having a private moment in the sun.  Facing out toward the street looking down on the world and tugging away.

I want to scale back at my full time job because I want to build my own business. I want to put in my notice but also propose working part time for the company for the following reasons: 
1. I could use the money 
2. I feel guilty, like I’m abandoning them (it’s a start up and I’m mentoring a few folks) they have little talent because they don’t know what they don’t know and money is right 
3. I genuinely want to help. I know they need someone who has experience and a lot of people have left or been asked to leave. My husband works there too and I want to help be sure he can be successful too - they just scored a huge contract and I’m a critical role. I’d be leaving in the middle of the start up 

Some points of note: 
- I’ve been pretty miserable in this industry for about 5 years and I recently determined I am miserable because it’s not what’s in my heart anymore, it’s not my passion 
- I took the job because it was meant for someone with less experience (and paid as such) so I thought I would have lots of flexibility and be able to do a standard 40 hr week and it’s turned into 60plus hours weekly and A LOTA OF STRESS... more stressful than some of my high profile roles.

764,"So long story short I'm an international student whose dorms closed so I couldn't return to my home country so my extended family members who have never met or seen me welcomed me to their home without hesitation. I've now stayed in their house for 3 months and a half and I wanna give them a gift before I leave 

For context they're parents of 4 and 7 yo kids who live in france in the city of Versailles (near paris) and just moved to their house. The dad is fond of science and loves chess a lot and has lived in a lot of countries because his job is international oriented if that makes sense. The wife is well I don't know much about her to be honest.

765,"I don't even really know how to start this....I don't want this to be too long, and I don't even know what kind of advice I'm looking for, so I'll just jump into it.  
Parents divorced back when i was 9 or 10 because of abuse, the one I remained with had to work a lot for me and my siblings and especially the first 2 years I was on my own as much as someone that age could be. Maybe this is part of the reason of why i've become like this? I can't understand some feelings most people have - I do have some emotions, but it's like I don't have all of them? Since I was young I saw I lack empathy but as I grew up I noticed other 'holes'. I'm pretty much indifferent about life and even if I try to find something that I like, that I wanna do, a goal to reach, at the end of the day I just can't care about it.  For some stupid reason I can't bring myself to like humans. Sounds horrible, but they look the same to me. Round faces, long faces, short, tall, so what? People have some kind of preferences but I can't.  (I don't find people disgusting, don't get me wrong, I just don't feel any special attraction to any one in particular). I thought I'm asexual, but this doesn't seem to be the case. I am more lonely than I can describe. It's like a hole I'm trying to ignore, but from time to time (like now) I think of it and it hurts. I tried to tell myself that my dog is enough but it's not. I just wish someone would be with me, but how? Because of my indifference sooner or later I get bored of anything (including persons) and I push them away, wanting to be alone, just to feel miserable because I'm alone. I don't like when people touch me, I don't know why, but I just feel the need to wash myself if they do, and I feel like puking if it's just something like a long hug. Why exactly do I feel the need of a human if in the same time I react like this?? I saw in movies psychopaths that seem to be the same, and then they find a person that they see completely different, so is it the same to me? Will there be someone that I will not get tired of, that will not make me feel disgusted when he/she touches me? I have a problem with anything stalker related because I can find it only beautiful - no, not the part when the stalker kills like a pychopath and ruins everyone, but the love that he/she has. That giant love he has for the other person. In these days people cheat like it's normal, I heard way to many cases of cheating. I couldn't handle something like that. I already know that I better kill myself than being abandoned, and that's probably why stalkers seem somehow good to me. Back to the point, I don't see myself stalking someone, or loving someone enough to fight for them, or not get tired of them. I clearly have mental problems, so of course no one could stay his/er whole life with someone like me. I just want this pain to end, and I tried so hard, but even if I ignore it it, I will think of it again and hurt. What exactly could I do? (yes, I tried therapy back in school, nothing helped)",15Jun2020,2

768,"There's a TL;DR at the end for those that don't want to read all of this. 

I've been with my current employer for 6 years. Within the first 3 years I was promoted 3 times and I thought I had found my career plan. Since then, I've been stuck in my same position for the last 3 years and have been passed up for my goal position a few times. The first few times I understood. I was still young (I am now 27 and started when I was just out of college) and had limited experience. My superiors ensured me that my time would come, that they saw a lot of potential in me and that I just needed to be patient. However, in that time since my last promotion those superiors either left or were promoted themselves. When I first met my new superior I was straight forward to her about my goals and plans and she has said numerous times that I have a bright future and she absolutely planned to promote me. However, several opportunities have opened up since then and each time they go with someone else and each time she tells me I need to improve on this or that and that I'm still young and blah blah blah. Fine, I get it. Then just a few months ago a position opened. I thought for sure I'd get it this time. I worked on everything they told me to, did all the right things, couldn't think of anyone who had something that I didn't. And once again I was passed up. What stung that time was that it was someone who was younger than me and had less experience. I couldn't believe it. I talked to my boss once again and she had and I had an intimate conversation where she said she was waiting for ""the perfect opportunity for me"" And while she wouldn't give me a time frame, she will promote me when this opportunity arises. I partially believed her and partially felt like it was a cop out. 

Well, another position has opened that I plan to pursue but I'm afraid I'll get passed by again. I'm afraid that I'm going to be held back. I've put so much resources and energy into this job that I've failed to create a back up plan. Should I trust my superiors who claim they see a lot in me but keep turning me down? Am I just not as good as I've thought or been told? Should I give them an ultimatum about promoting me or else I'll find a job elsewhere, even though it'll be hard for me to find a job with similar pay and benefits? Anyone else had this situation and how did it turn out? Thanks In advanced. 

TL;DR - Passed up for a promotion several times but superiors keep telling me that my time will come. Should I believe them or are they trying to keep me from getting hurt and quitting?",15Jun2020,1
769,"The background is a long story, but to shorten it: my dad has bipolar disorder and used a lot of my savings and a year of max student loan money for his own benefit when i was under 18.  He says he is sorry and will pay it back, but is only sending 50€ a month even though he has a fulltime job. He is also still going on holidays, getting take-out etc.

Recently my grandma passed and we found out her will doesn't include my sister or uncle (her son). So it's only me and my dad on it. My dad has said he'd give me his share to pay back some of the debt out of goodwill. Now it's not a large amount of money still left on the account, but obviously my family members are upset they weren't mentioned in the testament at all. My sister has mentioned she has seen my dad take thousands out of my grandma's account without clear reason (through doing her administration in the past year). I also know my dad was involved in the last draft of the testament and while my grandma didn't have dementia, she wasn't exactly sharp anymore. My dad is acting very defensively and i don't trust the situation. I am worried my dad manipulated my grandma to take her son and granddaughter out of the will. Also that he might've taken money scretly to make it seem like he gave me all of it, even if he didn't. My uncle and sister aren't planning on fighting the will, they think i deserve the money. However, we all distrust my dad and are not sure what to do to find out. Any advise?

770,"Hey there,

I wanted to make a drawing for a friend's birthday. A commune friend told me she had a fish whose name was taken from a fictional character, so I was planning on drawing a scene from the movie, and just replace the head of the fictional character by an aquarium with her fish. 
So I sent my friend a message in the style of ""hey, heard you have a fish, sounds so cool, do you have pictures of him?"".
She answered with sending pictures and telling me the fish died which was very tough for her because he was her pride and joy. I have no idea about since how long did the fish die.
 
I really really like this friend, although we are not really that close, like I think it's the second time only she told me that something was tough for her. Most of the times we speak of light subjects or unrelated to our lives. I know her for a bit more than a year, we communicate almost only by texts.

Anyways, the conclusion is: doing a drawing including her fish - does that sound nice or careless?

779,"Obligatory first post/I’m on mobile warning, sorry about formatting or poor spelling!
Some background information:
I (21 F) met my roommate (23 F) through work and got to know her more at college. We were never super close, just very friendly and hung out outside of work/school 3 or 4 times. A couple months after knowing her I mentioned thinking about moving out of my parents. Her roommate at that time decided to leave before her lease was up and needed to find someone to take her spot. I ended up deciding to move in August 2019. I started dating my current boyfriend (27 M) in May 2019 so he has been a witness to almost all of this. I also have screen shots of texts, emails, and photos of some of these situations. Everything was fine at first but now she is slowly becoming crazier and crazier. I truly think she has an unchecked mental illness which I’m contemplating trying to get in touch with her family about (but that’s another story). I’ll bullet out what I’ve been dealing with this last year in chronological order, everything below has been addressed with her:
- When it’s her turn to take out the trash she’ll leave the leaking/smelly garbage bag in the hall for days.
- She cleans her cats litter once a week, this results in him peeing/pooping on the floor which also takes her days to clean up.
- She never rinses her plates which has ruined our dishwasher.
- She will often come in screaming and crying on the phone.
- She has asked me on multiple occasions to make absolutely no noise so she can take a practice test but will interrupt me multiple times while I’m in the middle of actual online tests.
- I had told her about 4-5 months into the lease that I would not be re-signing, 2 months ago she cornered my boyfriend and I in my room and basically told me she thought it would be best if I re-sign our lease for another year and then find her a roommate, she said she can’t look for one because she has to study for her MCAT. This was just a few days after my great-aunt had passed away unexpectedly.
- I found out she has been stealing medications and supplies from the hospital we work at before and during the pandemic.
- During lockdown she had both a booty call and a friend over for hours, on separate occasions, then also stayed overnight at another friends house.
- My bf stayed with us for a month when our lockdown went into place, I had asked her before if it was okay since we are all healthcare workers (my bf and I actually worked on a Covid unit while she’s in the ER) she said it was fine and never mentioned anything about money. When she asked for him to split rent I said no but we’d split utilities and that’s what lead to her threatening me (not physically) in order to get him to pay her $200-$300 for staying there. This lead to me telling her to refrain from talking to me unless there is an emergency and also blocking her number/social media accounts. 
My current issue, and the one I need advice on, is that she refuses to sign a notice to vacate. Where we are staying they require a NTV 30 days prior to the end of your lease. She has stated she’s looking for a roommate but we only have about 2 months left in our lease and she still hasn’t found someone. If we don’t give a NTV we default to month-to-month payments which would raise our rent as well as a $100+ fee every month we don’t re-sign or give a NTV. Please if ANYONE has ANY advice for me I would be forever grateful!",15Jun2020,1
780,"My, 19f, entire (short) life has been filled with conflict. I'm very used to taking verbal abuse and giving it back as soon as someone gets upset. Now I'm getting older and I don't want to do this anymore. I know that sometimes I'm just wrong, but for some reason I can never just come out and say that. I was raised in this dynamic, so when someone else starts yelling, getting defensive is my natural instinct. I will fight for an opinion that I do not believe in, just because I'm being confronted about it. 

Another factor is that I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, and so I process things very slowly when I panic. I usually panic when I am confronted with anything at all, so if anyone has some advice for not reacting and staying calm, I would appreciate hearing it.

I’m constantly thinking about whether or not the University I go to will be reopening in the fall and having students return to campus.  My University sent all its students home in March because of COVID-19.  This has been very difficult for me.  

I had a bad experience in middle and high school and was the kind of kid that got told things like “you can’t sit at our table because nobody here likes you” a lot.  The culture of the area I grew up in was very, very cliquey.  I coped with all of this by reassuring myself that high school would be over soon and college would be better than this.  Well, I was right!  My freshman year of college was awesome.  It’s a great community and I’ve really bonded with the guys in my residence hall.  For the first time in my life I feel what it actually is to have a meaningful connection and friendship with someone is and it feels unbelievably good.  But unfortunately COVID-19 had to come and ruin things by separating me from my first real community.  I haven’t hung out with anyone my own age in months, and not everyone wants to do Zoom calls (I’m getting sick of Zoom myself).  I’m praying that we will go back in the fall, but I’m also constantly worrying about it.  I’m loosing sleep over it.  

A big problem is that the constant negative thoughts are making it difficult for me to appreciate the good things I do have in my life.  I just got a job after being told “no” by like a dozen places, which I think is a miracle.  I’m doing volunteer work.  My parents have been very helpful and supportive.  I get to spend time with my dog.  I’m reading some great books.  And I KNOW that there are people in the world that have it much worse than I do.

My father however won’t shut up about dying and it is tearing me apart inside without him even knowing it.

All of my fathers brothers and sisters and his parents died before their 60’s, him and one other sister are in their 60’s and have no signs of the disease which means they will most likely not get it.

He always tells me how I have to take care of mom when he’s gone and he plans his retirement and what retirement home they will buy with my opinion in mind, he asks me all these questions about how I would feel when he’s gone and mom is living alone blah blah blah and I just want him to fucking stop it’s breaking my heart and tearing me apart inside and he has no idea.

As he continues talking about his near death he tells me how I will inherit the homes and will have to plan accordingly with mom what to do and now all I can think about is what the fuck I’m gonna do when he does and I get all this money and shit and I feel like a selfish asshole for even thinking about the money but he’s pretty much shoved in my head.

796,"My roommate is super chill. I have no issues with them regarding anything else. However, whenever he comes home, he smells absolutely foul - I know, I know, anybody who smoked would probably think he’s an absolutely blessing. However, I don’t smoke. They don’t smoke in my presence, but whenever they come into the room, it stinks up. Yes, they do go shower immediately afterwards (and when they do I spray the room with Ozium), and it’s a temporary nice smell.

She called me the other day and hit me with asking me if I could provide her with 10 contacts (friends/family) who might be able to use her services. In the heat of the moment and since I was in a store and trying to get her off the phone I ended up telling her yes, no problem. Now that I read into it, I see that these financial planners are only out to get people's money and want to sell, sell, sell. She told me she would call me back on Wednesday to get the contact's info. 

How do I respectfully tell her that I do not feel comfortable asking friends and family to be called by her only for her to try and sell them financial products?

Well, in her birthday Anne replaced me for Kate's boyfriend so they could be all couples were her initials plans were not like this. She did this after Kate began to date with her boyfriend who at the same time is also Anne's boyfriend friend. (I don't have a boyfriend)   It's something it hurted me and I regret it not adressing the topic to her. 

I understand about having a new friend but I really feel she's replacing me. I don't want to enter in unnecesary details but it's like lowkey shit. For that reason I don't if this is normal or I am getting crazy. I just list some examples so you can all understand me better. 

\- For example, Anne, Kate and Anne's sister (Let's call her Janine) have a whatsapp group. That's completely normal. Well if Me, Anne and Janine had a whatsapp group. A group we stopped using after Kate appeared, Anne includes Katie in this group unnecesarily instead of creating a new [one.It](https://one.It)'s also small gestures like we were walking after a party and Anne left me behind. (She's wasn't like this) 

\- Another example, This winter I told Anne it would be fine going to certain beach to spend our time like we always used to do. She quickly told me to we could go with Katie too. I told her this morning to go to the beach and first she posted something on instagram (ignoring my message) then later she told me we could go to the beach with Kate.

I'm pretty sure everyone knows I'm mixed simply because of my appearance. However, I had some people over a few weeks ago and someone said something super rude.

One of the girls (who I am not very close with) was talking about her trip to Europe. Someone asked if the men were attractive, and she said yes. She then said, ""I think Europeans are just overall better looking than Americans. It's because Americans are too mixed.""

Two of my close friends proceeded to AGREE with her. My one friend said, ""yeah the United States is full of mutts"" and my other friend began to brag saying, ""I'm 100% Serbian."" I was offended, but I stayed quiet because I was the only one who wasn't fully white and I didn't know what to say.

805,"English is not my first language which means I've learnt many things from books/grammar lessons.

The good thing about this is that once I've learnt verbs, tenses, etc...I'm going to be strict using them, that's why it strikes me as a nonsense when I hear native speakers making mistakes we've been told not to make.

For instance, I might not have what you consider a good English level, but I'd never say “James has went to the party”-Why do some people speak like that in the US? (HAVE+FUTURE)

When you hear sb speaking like that...what do you think about them? Is it ignorance? Slang? Just a way of speaking?

Last week I heard a native speaker say: “The killer laid in wait for the victim” (LIE,LAY,LAIN, no?)

Same for double negative. Why so many people in the US and UK say things like: She doesn't wanna meet nobody (anybody)...

Are those mistakes acceptable? Are they considered to be “ignorant”?

Is it about context (friends/family vs polite environment) or about (ignorant vs well educated)?

I'm not critizing people that speak like that at all...They are native English speakers after all, and they speak way better English than me.",15Jun2020,4

I drove home the entire way with my hazard lights on, so if a police officer stopped me, I would tell him it’s because my headlights weren’t working.
All morning today I was looking at my car, trying to figure out why they weren’t working, until hours later, I finally gave up and took the car to a mechanic.

A while later he called me and told me my car is ready. He says that my headlights work and that they were never broken. I have him show me for proof.

Anyway, I fucking forgot how to turn on the headlights the whole time, and it took me 2 days and a mechanic to show me before I realized that the problem was me and not the car.

I genuinely like this boy. he lives about 45 min to a hour away from me, and he really wants to meet me. he offered to drive to me, to meet my parents so he could actually take me out on a date. 

my dad is saying this is really dangerous, that I shouldnt be talking to people I dont know and stuff like that. I've skyped this boy, so I know hes who he says he is. hes not but 11 months older than me. my dad put me and the friend I met this boy through, through self defense classes, to make sure we can handle ourselves and I wont be sexually abused again.

I do understand hes trying to protect me, but the boy is willing to drive over 45 minutes just to meet my parents because he actually likes me. my mom told me they cant keep me from boys forever, and they cant stop me from having a life just because of what happened 3 years ago. my moms going to talk to my dad tonight, but I think he needs to realize the entire point of the classes was to make sure I wont get hurt again. 

the boy is willing to comply to what my mom wants, just so we can meet and hang out. she wants to meet him after she gets off work, seeing as she works in the town he lives in. hes willing. he wants to meet me and hang out with me before a relationship progresses.

My left shoulder rotator cuffs feel like it's being pulled when I move it sometimes and I been noticing my left trap is smaller than my right trap. I'm very left handed but I can tell I have more muscle on my right shoulder now and my left shoulder width looks smaller than my right shoulder.

I'm going to go see a doctor soon but I don't have health insurance so I'm kind of worried. It doesn't impact my life that much but the tightness has been starting to ramp up since I started doing shoulder workouts. I just started weightlifting and it's making me sort of sad.",15Jun2020,1
814,"My brother's abuse on our family dog ( still a puppy) has been going on for a year now. He punches and slaps our dog on the head and drags him by his hide around the house. He does a myriad of other stuff that I'm not going to list. ( he smiles while he does it and does it when our parents aren't home).

When I first started noticing it ( my sisters noticed it too) me and my sisters confronted our parents about it. They told us to let them know if we see it again. Well guess what, we do see it again and my parents say the same robotic response ""let us know if you see it again"". So I tell them we did see it again. And they wanted nothing to do with it. 

This literally goes on for 6 months ( about 3 to 5 times a week) and I'm growing more and more concerned - about the dog and my brother's mental state ( for abusing animals in the first place) . So I try to see if I can seek external help like a counselor (dead end). I've talked to my friends about it. ( they tell me I should tell my parents about it (dead end)).

I confronted my parents one more time that we can't keep the dog if if my brother is going to keep doing this stuff to the dog. They still don't listen. I try to reason with them by saying that they should be concerned about their sons mental state if he is doing this stuff to the dog. ( usually leads to greater human abuse). Well they mention therapy ""if I see it again"". 

So I decided to take things into my own hands. I looked up roots to animal abuse and then sit my brother down for a talk. I try to ask him how school is going. We talk he is kind of rude ( by the way he has been calling me stuff like gay and homo for three years now, he has gotten better but still does it several times throughout one month). I get answers. Seems like school is going good overall and tell him let me know if there are any problems at school. 

I love my brother I was genuinely concerned about if he was getting bullied at school. I then talk to him about the dogs and what he has been doing he gets defensive and essentially tells me I can't tell him what to do ( to the dog)  ( I think to myself wtf!?!). 

This is over the course of the next six months - keeps doing same abuse to the dog. Every time I see him hitting the dog I tell him to stop in a stern voice. 

My concern slowly changed to straight up anger after I could hear the dog whine while I was in another room. 

One day I saw dragging the dog by the hide and I just had enough I pretty much shouted at the top of my voice ""STOP THAT SHIT RIGHT NOW. IF I EVER SEE YOU DO THAT FUCKING SHIT AGAIN IM GUNNA PUNCH YOUR ASS RIGHT IN THE FACE.""  

The problem with me is that I do not like physical confrontation. I feel sick, like I'm going to pass out so I would rather take stuff and not dish it back out. So I try to 
Avoid fighting and yelling at all cost. I've never yelled at anyone like that in my entire life. Felt like I was going to pass out.

The abuse goes on for more months until today. I saw him hitting the dog. He does this right in front of me. After the course of a year he knows I am not going to do shit about. I've never seen what he does with the dog while I am in another room. So I pretend to enter another room while peering out into the room that my brother is in. Almost right after I left he grabbed the dog by its hide and smacked the dogs head so hard I could hear the teeth in the dog hit each other. 

At this point I have have enough I run out and sucker punch him right in the face. He was more surprised than anything.

He is fine right now. I feel terrible for doing it to him. I tried to apologise to him. But he is not excepting it right now. I told him I shouldn't have done it. Right after I punched him I felt sick. Bout to throw up. Do not like fighting at all.

815,"Okay I may sound childish but please try to understand me. 

I had planned my next birthday for months, it's a special birthday and everyone around me knew. After this one I'll move away and will not be able to see most of my relatives and friends for a quite long time. I have already said that for so long, even before the Covid outbreak. 

Now last week I decided on what to do. I want to make a brunch with relatives and later go to a local lake with friends and celebrate there with more alcohol (we won't go swimming intoxicated, no worries). All of this is allowed again. 

Today I received an invitation from my great-grandma who decided throw her birthday party on my birthday since she had to postpone hers in April due to Covid. I have no problem with her celebrating her birthday but I wanted that to be my special day. 

When I received the invitation my grandma told me she told my great-grandma it would be okay with me since I wouldn't need to pay for the food on that day and would still get presents. I started crying and maybe that was a bad response and maybe that was childish but I was so down over the last month's that this birthday literally was something I looked forward to only to know that now my plans are destroyed and my relatives won't come to my birthday (some already agreed to my great-grandma and those people knew I also celebrate on that day). 

I feel selfish and dumb, very egoistic to be true. But it's my last chance to really celebrate with the people I love in a long time. In another sub I was told that's it's just a birthday and I shouldn't be so angry but I really hope someone here will be able to understand me. 

What should I do? Is it okay to feel sad and angry or am I acting up again and should stay calm? 

It's not the first time people ignored me. Last year on my graduation where I wanted to have people around me someone else threw a simple house party and no one came to my graduation party.

They work 45-65 hour weeks (no overtime), they take on tasks that take focus away from what should be priorities, and they always complain of anxiety, burnout, and stress ""but it's done"" -- only for the next thing to be a source of anxiety and burnout.

One thing is the workload from our superior which I know is immense. The other thing is that this person is actually a really giving person (though at their own expense -- e.g. they'll buy coffee for the group even though they can't make rent this week). This person is glad to be reporting to me in the future and while I can help manage their workload as much as possible, I can't manage how they enforce their limits or their nature.

818,"Long story. Thank for taking the time to read if you do.

Me:30 female.

 I work at a martial arts gym. Everyone is casual and close and most are cool but there are some creeps I have to keep firm boundaries with bc I know what their intentions are. One of these guys decided to grab my waist when I greeted him which is part of my job. I immediately told me boss bc it made me uncomfortable. It was a violation and I had avoided this man like the plague before it happened bc I knew that was the type of person he was. 

So I told my one boss ( I have two) and he said he would talk to him but he didn't seem to really take my side and made an excuse that this guy is super ""touchy feely"". There's a bro code at the gym I guess and my boss probably felt put in the middle of defending me and defending the bro code and seemed to just want to dismiss it and get over it. 

My other boss caught wind of what happened and was pissssssed. Completely different reaction. Heard me out. Defended me hard. 

So the creep waist grabber was warned and that is that. 

So fast forward 6 months, and my boss ( who had the less taking it serious reaction) keeps mentioning the guy to me and asking if I'm ok when he's around because I seem kind of - makes a skittish impression- ( English isn't his first language so he doesn't know how to express what he means). Every time I tell him I'm fine. I just ignore him. 

I don't understand why he keeps bringing it up to me. I don't want any problems with the guy. He behaved inappropriately and he was warned. I'll be professional bc it's my job but not friendly and I will not be expected to be friendly either. What I fear is that eventually my boss will bring it up and make it out to be like I'm doing something wrong. When I do nothing but ignore the guy.  And I have a right to. I did before and he STILL could not take a hint and had the audacity to grab me. 

Logically: I have every right to be ""skittish"" around a creep. But my boss is acting like he's surprised to see me like that or just acting like it's weird in general. 

I don't like being under a spotlight and scrutinized either. So every time the guy comes around is my boss gonna study my body language ? Naturally if I feel I'm being scrutinized then I will seem ""off"" 

I just wish he'd stop bringing it up and I don't know why he does. It just seems odd to keep revisiting a sensitive issue. I don't want to contribute his behavior to malice but I can't make sense of it. 

Also he teaches martial arts self defense against unwanted behavior. And he has a daughter too. What if that happened to her!?

Why can't he just accept it for what it was : a violation and harassment. And the fact that I have every right to react and deal with that man however I want and it's none of his business 

I guess if he brings it up again ill ask him why he keeps asking and that I'm fine and if I'm ever not then I'll let him know?  Bc until he brings it up, I don't even care to think about that man but when I hear his name then yeah I get upset thinking about the memory
 

And I have a history of childhood SA. And PTSD because of it. 
 Maybe some women would just brush it off but not me. That behavior needs to be reported.
But somehow I'm weird for feeling that way ?
And I in no way reacted crazy or made a scene. 
 I calmly said ""would you mind not doing that again. "" And promptly went to my boss to report it.",15Jun2020,1
819,"Hello friends. I'm 22 years old and I'm currently making about $21,500 gross income. I don't have any ""adults"" in my life to ask a serious financial question, so I came to you guys(:

I have decided to totally revolt against the ""monthly payment"" system. I reject the notion that everything needs to be planned on a monthly basis. I think that sort of planning leads to short-term success but it doesn't set you up for long-term success. So I've chosen to start paying off all my loans systematically. I'm almost done, I just owe a few more thousand on my car and I'll be totally debt-free. I pay my car insurance twice yearly, and I get like $150 off for doing it that way. 

But here's my question: how should I approach my yearly evaluation coming up? I'm a teller in a local mid-sized bank and I just don't want to get short-changed. I was wondering if asking for a 20% raise would be too much to ask for. I've had perfect attendence and my work has been satisfactory/above satisfactory as far as I am aware. If I got a 20% yearly raise, I'd go from making $11/hr to about $13/hr.

It wasn't all that bad at first everything was kinda normal for a while, but I just started getting bored.  I felt like being around people was draining and not worth the effort. Hanging out with friends became more of a social obligation, it felt like I was just at school again, bored and unmotivated.  So throughout the year I slowly started hanging out less and less, I deleted all my social media and started to completely ghost my friends.  At first, I would make up excuses for why I couldn't hang out but eventually I just stopped responding to texts.  I just have this feeling that I need to get people out of my life.  Recently I've been becoming distant from my girlfriend (18f), the only person I still talk to outside of my house.

822,"Hey,

So at the beginning of October 2019 me and my ex separated. Sad times. Really sad times in fact. I genuinely loved her to bits, frustratingly I kind of still do. But she left me, and I learned earlier this year that she lied to me a lot and is now enjoying a new life with a new partner. Who ‘coincidentally’ was her new friend pre break-up. But that’s for another SR. 

Anyway, a week or two after it happened I packed up all her things into boxes which is a pretty heartbreaking way to end a relationship if you ask me. And shortly after I asked her to come get her things which amounts to five large cardboard boxes and two bikes, as well as random stuff.

After months of me asking her to come over she eventually agrees to come before the end of April, but only after I said if it’s not gone by then I’ll get rid of it. 

I should add in fairness that she was in her last year at uni and was quite busy. But i ask myself why I’m the one burdened with all this crap, yet I try to be level headed and do right thing. Throwing it out the window and ranting on social
Media is really not my style.

Obviously, UK goes into lockdown and I catch COVID so the deal is off (Where I am
specifically there are still travel restrictions and we’re told not to go in others houses). And now, in June 2020, about nine months after our break up, I’ve still got all her stuff, and lots of it!. Worse yet, being stuck in the house every day I’m more or less looking at it daily, getting a constant glimpse into our previous life.

I’ve had friends and family tell me to bin it all, and even now I’m like “why the f**k didn’t I do that months ago”, but it feels wrong somehow. But having spent months looking at it I’m now getting a bit restless on the subject.

I looked into the surrounding area for a person but saw no one. Eventually i decided to just keep walking. As i walked back i saw the dog again.

Sometimes I am very tired after work and I’m thankful to have these things done but it makes me feel like a child and it’s hard when I don’t hardly have any privacy. As soon as I lock my door for some privacy she’s knocking on door. Or when there’s an issue she wants to know and will keep bugging me about it. I even had to turn my iPhone location thing on for her to give her peace of mind about where I’m at. Whenever I want to do something she is always quick to give her opinion on how I shouldn’t. I have bad anxiety and I’ve gotten a lot better and I’m trying to do more with my life and have talked about moving out eventually but I can tell she hates the idea of it. Whenever I wear certain clothes she gives her opinion saying it’s “scandalous” and I feel like she thinks I cant handle anything. I have tried talking to her, she doesn’t get mad or anything but I can tell she’s highly offended and she’ll keep bringing it up. It’s also hard living with my grandfather since he’s very sexist and very racist and I have to hear him constantly saying disgusting things about people that I don’t agree with and that I hate hearing. He’s also very paranoid and always has to have the doors locked, he will even wait to leave after me to lock the door in fear someone will break in and go as far as to lock the doors even if he’s right outside in the front hard mowing the grass. Since dating my boyfriend for the last few months it’s made me realize more than ever I want my independence and that I do want to move out in a year or so. Has anyone else experienced this? It makes me feel so embarrassed and ashamed since I can’t do much for myself. It sorta feels like I’m in prison and having my every move watched.",15Jun2020,2
828,"Hi!

Please bear with me because this is quite the telenovela and I'm terrible at explaining things. I'm 16(F) and the oldest in a pretty big family (I have four other siblings) my family is very strict And controlling. The thing is, I know that my mom and dad love me deep down, but they are terrible at showing it, and I'm getting exhausted. My mother and I never got along; we have very different opinions. She doesn't like that. She always seemed to blow things out of proportion (e.g., I accidentally got an order wrong when we bought food out, and she proceeded to tell me that I'm the biggest failure in the world and that I will never get anywhere in life, that I'm an ungrateful piece of shit amongst other very aggressive things). We would fight non-stop over very idle things, and it's gotten to the point where I can't even bother talking to her. I feel like I can't have an opinion, even on little things, I can't have a rational conversation with her about any remotely controversial topic because then I'm an incompetent teenager who can't think for herself. I am treated the same as my 6-year-old sister, as in the exact same in everything, which I feel like I should be treated with a little more independence, but alas.

 She isn't physically abusive (not really at least), but she is extremely mentally abusive, Her comments on my sister's weight ( she isn't even remotely overweight) drove her to starve herself, which prompted my mother to go on about how my sister is a stupid idiot that cant takes care of her self. Her comments (and stuff my dad did) towards me drove me to extreme depression and attempted suicide at some point( she found me and started screaming to me about how ungrateful I am) (anytime I try to explain how I feel or how something she may have done hurt me she start telling me about how I would be nothing without her because she gave birth to me, feeds me, taught me everything I know, etc. she also brings up every petty mistake I may have made in my life).My dad, however, is more bearable, but I think that's because he isn't home as much (my mom is a stay at home mom) 

My dad has extreme anger issues (so does my mom but My dad is worse). My sister and I were bickering about a charging outlet AS ALL SIBLING BICKER. So I complained (immature on my part) thinking my dad would be rational and try to compromise; instead, he chased me around the house, dragged me by my hair, I tried to get away, but he pulled mine by my hoodie, my lip was cut in the process and got two bruises and skinned my hand. It got to a point where my mom had to get in between us, as well as one of the nannies, and he then wanted us to apologize for disrespecting HIM, by arguing with each other. The thing is my parents continuously argue, and it gets to extreme points sometimes. I'm not an angel, and I would admit if I made a mistake, but my parents NEVER DO, they never want to say they are wrong. I've made  mistakes (not major I don't do drugs, sex, or parties, etc.) I'm a kid I'm learning, I shouldn't be afraid to tell my family something because of how they may react. ( my parents are very religious, I'm not, but I wouldn't dare tell them). I don't know what to do. I feel absolutely worthless and unloveable. I'm insecure to a point where it's not even funny, and it's all because of what my mom tells. I don't know how to express my emotions and be vulnerable, and I'm very emotionally distant and all fucked up. I'm going insane in this damned quarantine please just tell me how to fix my mentality.

Thank you, &lt;3",15Jun2020,0
829,"This kid has been hitting my brother up for a while now trying to sell him some pair of Nike shoes for $140. Now the kid is also saying that he has someone that’s willing to pay $220 for them and he’s willing to sell them to my brother and then help facilitate the transaction between him and the other buyers. This seems like a huge red flag to me, since it doesn’t make any sense why this kid wouldn’t just go directly to the buyers that want to pay more, seems like a classic “limited time offer” trick to dupe my brother into buying the shoes off him since no one else will. He came to me asking to borrow $20 since he needs the money today, but I said no because I’m not willing to help him risk losing his money. Thoughts?",15Jun2020,1
830,"I live in an apartment complex. Recently, some birds have started making a nest right outside of my building. As a result, they are aggressive and are flying at the heads of anyone who walks by.

Everything I've researched says to just ""avoid the area"" and ""use a different door"" but there is only one way in or out of my building and it requires me to walk for several feet along a fence right by these birds as they swoop and scream at me. 

I have contacted my apartment manager and she is aware of the situation. She says she has contacted a wildlife agency but in the meantime there is nothing she can do. 

I have to leave the house at least 3 times a day to take my dog out. I am tired of fending off bird attacks each time. 

I don't want to hurt the birds, of course. But does anyone have any tips on how to handle this other than ""stay away from the area?"" Any non-violent ways to protect myself and prevent myself from being attacked every time I have to leave my building?",15Jun2020,2

833,"Hello All, 

I am applying for a job and one of the requirements is to create a graphic Flyer or Poster, and my first thought was a poster for Short Term Managing/coping Anxiety ( think breathing exercises, affirming phrases, etc) 

And my mother says that this is ""too political"" because not everyone thinks the same about anxiety and that others will think that since this is what I created the poster about , I must have anxiety . ( I mean I do LOL but I don't think that will be the first assumption)

So I wanted to get some like third party views ? She suggested stuff like "" World Hunger "" which I think is more political than anxiety but I digress. 

I guess my questions is : Does A poster about Short Term Managing/Coping with Anxiety seem to political or that the interviewers are going to  assume I have anxiety ?

836,"I am a 19 year old girl from India. I had to switch to business administration because my family and other people led me into believing that a career in Biology (other than becoming a doctor) is not lucrative. I didn’t wanna become a doctor. I wanted to do something related to Pharmaceuticals or Biotechnology.  My parents didn’t even send me to college out of my town. I don’t know if they even want me to make a career and I think that’s because I’m a girl. They gave me a lot of shit when I said I wanted to go to college out of my city and they blamed it all on my choice of career and my lack of clarity in life (I was confused as to how I was going to make a career in Biology, I lacked guidance). Now I’m stuck studying Business, which I know nothing about. A lot of people in my class have studied these subjects in high school but I have no idea what it’s all about. My Math isn’t great (and to top it, I haven’t studied it in 11th and 12th grade) and I now have to take the CAT examination in India to get into an MBA college. It’s like GMAT but it’s considered tougher (that’s what I’ve heard). I’d take GMAT too but I doubt my parents will send me abroad, I don’t even know if they’ll send me out of my city even this time. 
My college sucks so much. They just burden students with assignments and don’t teach anything. Despite all this, I managed to score 9.03 CGPA in the first semester. Being regular is key and I also managed to do well in the exams somehow, except for Accounting. But I know I’m not doing great overall and not really learning anything. I get so depressed when I think about my situation because I didn’t even wanna do this, I miss Biology. Any advice for me?

837,"Hi, I’m a fifteen year old girl and I’m in the national paralympic selection. I have been part of the team since December last year and at first I really liked it, but now I really want to quit.

We don’t train that much (4 hours on Friday with the national team and then 2x 1.5 hour with my regular/not paralympic team + a regular not paralympic match like every week) Now they want me to join a paralympic team so I get more training, which I get, but this already to much for me. 

I’m born with a hip injury (which could’ve easily been fixed, but the doctors only found out when I was 2 and I already could walk somehow). Now I kind of walk like a pinguin and if I walk too much or stand for  too long it hurts, like quite a lot. The doctors said I would probably be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, but I’m not (only when going places where you have to walk really far). I can actually do almost everything a “normal” person can I’m just not that flexible. 

In October last year there were Paralympic team try-outs (of all paralympic sports) and me and my parents signed me up as a joke. Then I got an email I was selected to come and when I was there I got selected for the national Paralympic team).

My parents were so proud of me and I don’t want to disappoint them, since the last two last year I was in a bad state mentally I kind of did really bad  at school and I almost had to repeat the year. My parents were so disappointed in me and I don’t want that to happen again.

Then there is another thing: if you want to want to play in a Paralympic team you have to be classified by a doctor or you can’t play official international games. I don’t want to hear that I’m handicapt because I’m still struggling with accepting it.

I really want to quit the team, but I don’t know how to tell them. Do you guys have any tips?",15Jun2020,1

So me and this girl have been friends for 3 or so years, we’ve gotten really close overtime, honestly I think we could both say we’re each other’s closest friend. She’s just absolutely amazing, I really couldn’t ask for a better friend. For the 3 years I’ve known her she’s been with the same guy, he always kinda kept me in check, whenever I started to get feelings for her, I’d force them down and try to forget about it for the sake of our friendship (is that bad? I honestly don’t know at this point) but anyways, about a week or so ago she called me and was just having a total meltdown because her boyfriend had dumped her... She totally deserves someone better than him, so I’m honestly happy for her since she doesn’t have to put up with his crap anymore. But 3 or so days ago me and her went for a walk for a couple of hours and we kinda had a moment while we were sitting on a beach where we both kinda just looked at each other, and to be honest I’ve never felt more at peace in my life. I think I’m falling in love with her... and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m almost positive she knows that I wouldn’t get romantic with her just to get in her pants, so that’s not really my worry, but I’m just terrified I’m gonna hurt her or mess it up... do I tell her how I feel? Do I try to forget about it again? Do I just let things happen naturally and risk her boyfriend coming back or her thinking I don’t like her?",15Jun2020,1

840,"I don't feel like typing out a biography because I don't think that's necessary. Basically, I have little to no experience with girls, not just sexually but socially, and I'm in my early 20s. I think that I'm just the type of guy that women would rather settle down with and marry rather than the guy they want to date and hook up with. I don't feel any particular type of way about that, it is what it is, but I desperately feel the need to make up for the lack of experience I got when I was in high school and college.

I'm getting my money right so that when I'm older I can make myself out to be a good catch so that I can start having those experiences that most people get to have when they're younger. I've heard that dating gets much easier for guys as they age, so I'm hoping that's the case. It sucks that I have to wait though because I've already missed out on so much and regardless of how much sex I have I won't know how much I need to have in order to compensate for the lack of it I've had thus far.

I still want to date the younger girls and I want to quantify the number of women I have sex with. When I think about how many women I should have sex with I think of a ridiculous number like a thousand. I know that's virtually impossible, but I just want to have as much sex as possible with as many women as I can before I die. That's pretty much my life goal.

845,"In March, before COVID hit NYC, I was readying to move into my new apartment. When it became clear things were going to look ugly, I put moving out from my family's house to the side and helped them self-isolate. Their measures were extreme: no walks, no going outside, no going to any stores, no socializing with anyone (even with social distancing), and nobody except my father was allowed to return to work. I thought these measures were heavy-handed, but temporary. My mother is a wheelchair user, so I was surprised when she turned all her aids away because she felt they were ""too much of a risk"" if they got her sick.

130+ days later, New York's numbers are at a record low and the state is reopening in phases, but my family holds that nothing for us have changed. I am still paying rent for an unused apartment. I am due to return to work in two weeks, but my parents angrily told me that they still expected me to come home to them to do what my mother's aids were hired for: housework, cleaning, and childcare for my 4 younger sisters. Otherwise, they believed ""I don't care if my mom lives or dies"" and ""it's my responsibility"" to help them until my mom can be vaccinated and she is no longer at risk of contracting COVID.

They told me ""you effectively don't have a relationship anymore,"" and ""you're not going to have a life for another year or two."" This crushed me.

I’ve been in therapy for a year, and I’ve encouraged him to seek therapy. He went once and never again. I know everyone has to go at their own pace, but I feel like I’m trying to get over my issues (depression, anxiety) and I’m putting in the work, but he never did the same.

Anyway, fast forward to last night when he drunk dialed me and cried. I hung up and blocked him. This morning, at work, he approached me, apologizing and crying profusely. He admitted that he has “nothing to live for” now that he doesn’t have me. He says he “fucked it all up” and has to “end it all.” He’s visiting family next week, and said, “it’ll be the last time they see me,” and that he’s in the process of writing a suicide note.

I don’t want to invalidate his suicide threat, but he does try to seek attention. I don’t want to disregard his threats because they may actually be real. I feel like he’s putting a lot of heaviness on me in order to gain sympathy, but also, what if he’s for real?

My family decided to help him out through this and gave him a place to stay for about 6 months till he got a job and found a place. They did it, they were in an apartment for about a year and I would visit every so often to check in on kids and my friend.

Once they called me frantically and I said I would call the police, they turned and threatened to disown me if I called the police, for fear of how things would turn out, if police got involved. My sister does not allow my mother to speak with any of my mothers friends. My sister hates all our extended family member and one by one, forced my parents to cut their relationship from them. It is so toxic and I don’t know what to do. In a year or two, what my sister is doing to my parents would be considered elder abuse. 

I’ve thought long and hard and want to have the police involved. My sibling is very manipulative and can flip on a dime and act normal in front of people she needs behave in front of. I’m worried if the police gets involved and do nothing, the ramifications of that would be disastrous for my parents. She has pulled a knife on my father at one point. She’s made threats to others that including hiring people to shoot her ex boyfriend. I’ve discussed all this with my parents, and they are still adamant in not involving legal authorities- they feel she is not serious (but pulling a knife on someone is rather serious). 

It is so sad to see my parents getting bullied, intimidated, belittled, etc. people of reddit, what do I do?",15Jun2020,2

862,So I’m currently applying to transfer out of community college and into a four year school and I have a big problem. The school I’m applying to needs all the past syllabi for every course I’ve taken. I haven’t saved any of these because I thought I would never need them again. Now I no longer have access to any of my school accounts so I can’t even re download them. I can’t call the registrar because no one is there because of COVID-19. I sent them an email but who knows how long before I can get a response and if they’ll even be able to do anything once they do respond. I need all my things submitted by Friday and I seriously don’t know what to do. I even tried searching the website for a database of past syllabi and it looks like it doesn’t exist. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!,15Jun2020,1
863,"Tl:dr at the end.

Just for some background information we are both around 17 - 18 years old. I have suffered from anxiety, depression and panic attack disorder in the past, my biggest fear is being abandoned or forgotten.

Me and my best friend, let's call her Nat, have been friends for close to 4 years, maybe even more. We've always been there for eachother, through my hardest break up, her family hardships and many other issues, we'd always have eachother's backs.

It was just me, her and two friends who we hung out with, when we changed schools last year, we were seperated from the others. I thought we'd keep our bond as strong as always, but somewhere along the way it weakened.

My big sister and mom had to go to the hospital for several months in 2019 through the first month of 2020, I was alone at home for the duration of my big sisters hospitalization. I had no real friends in my class and Nat was the only one I could rely on, she and I would spend time during some of our breaks so I wouldn't eat alone, but over time we spent less and less of our breaks together.

I had a particularly bad day when we had to go to a theater show, no one wanted me to sit with them and when I asked Nat, she told me she'd rather sit with her class. I cried while watching the show through blurry eyes. I wish I had told her how much I needed not to be alone at that point, cuz' I think that's when our friendship started slipping slightly.

We would invite eachother to stuff, it was a consistent back and forth of interactions. But then we got less and less  time or would ask at inconvinient times and have to tell the other ""no"". I guess we both either got tired of being declined or maybe just forgot to ask.

I got into a relationship with someone who lives far away, a long distance relationship with someone who I love very much. I would try to include him in everything me and Nat did, which might also have led to our relationship declining.

We joined a discord server, created by my boyfriend where there were a lot of other people as well. Particularly someone named Wizz and Limitations will become part of this, in a way, later. When my boyfriend would be at work during daytime, I would sit and wait for someone to come online, but most of the people I was comfortable asking would be on the offline status. Then I would find out they, Nat, her brother, Wizz and sometimes Limitations, were all in a Dm / group and I didn't know.

The fact that none of my friends had thought to invite me, hurt me deeply. This would go on for sometimes several days at a time, and I would just tell myself ""Don't think about it"" and ""They probably just didn't think to invite you"", but my sadness and anxieties grew every day.

Then ocassionally I would get a message from one of them saying stuff like ""Help Nat is killing all the wumples ;-;"" or ""We're playing Doki doki with Limitations, pretending it's a dating sim XD"" , but they still wouldn't think to invite me, even though I was online and alone.

These messages made my anxiety and panic attack disorder flare up. After calming down, I would get angry, almost enraged at them. I wouldn't message them or communicate how I was feeling, I would just let it build up inside of me. I would use stupid methods to get their attention, like setting my status to ""Do not disturb"" with and say stuff like ""I feel awful"".

Then usually Nat would respond, sending a message to me for the first time in a while, asking if I was ok. Somehow this only made me angrier, seeing her only message me when she had a reason to be worried made me feel like shit. I ignored it and decided to ask her if we should go do something soon.

We made plans, hung out and for the first time in a long time, I actually felt like our friendship was as good as it used to be. That illusion was shattered when I came home however. I was invited to Wizz's server where Nat, her brother, Wizz and Limitations had been playing Doki doki and talking on. I broke. Something inside me shattered, it felt like my heart genuinely broke completely in my chest.

I had a panic attack that kept coming back, until my boyfriend came home and called me on discord. I vented to him and he was furious. At first he wanted to chew out Wizz when he joined his server's talking channels. I took Wizz aside, since he was completely confused.

I confided in him how everything had started to fall apart. He assured me that it was just a bunch of misunderstandings, that they didn't mean to exclude me, that the server and dm calls weren't evident of me being forgotten. I believed him, so I tried to forget it all.

But then recently, just a few days ago, me, Nat, her brother, Wizz, a different friend of mine and my boyfriend were on the server. We were all playing on a minecraft server, but then my friend, Nat and Wizz went to talk about personal stuff in a dm. I waited patiently, ""surely when they've talked they'll come back, right?""

But then they stopped playing on the server, they went to apex and played just Nat and Wizz, my other friend had already gone to bed. I thought Wizz might invite me and Nat's brother after my boyfriend went to bed, but still no response. I texted him, but in the end I had to forcibly join their game and ask if we could go into a dm or something.

I was ok, kind of, but the fact that I had to force myself into their session made me feel like I was forcing them to hang out with me. It cut me deep. Then the next day me and my boyfriend had asked the others if they wanted to watch me play outlast, really my only reason for them being there was their company and the fact that I get easily scared.

We settle for a time after dinner time, but for several hours we get no response and no one joins, then my boyfriend sends out a message asking if the will join. No response on the server, two hours more pass and I get tired of waiting, I legit beg for them to answer so I don't waste any more time.

They finally respons with a resounding no, I was not disappointed about the ""no"" but the lack of response from any of them. It was the last straw, I was enraged and furious.

I went to bed shortly after and the next day I refused to talk or play with any of them. Childish, I know. My boyfriend got worried for me, he didn't want me to suffer, but as more time went on the angrier I got, I declined Nat's invitation to play games.

I was finished with the unreliableness of my friends and decided to call our friendships quits. My boyfriend wasn't having it, he didn't want me to just throw away my friendships, so he asked the other's what was going on. He then called me later, crying. He told me that it was just a misunderstanding, that they never meant to leave me out and that Nat was actually crying because she missed me as a friend. Aparently she missed being able to spend time one on one with me, she had missed our interactions too. For a while I tried to argue my case, that she should have just invited me like we used to.

That she could have called me up any time if she wanted, but she felt like my boyfriend was in some manner in the way of her doing that. I felt and still feel so guilty, but at this point, I don't think our friendship is salvageable. She hasn't been online on discord since that day, but I do know she is playing with the others in league of legends. I feel like the others might dislike me now as well, since I indirectly made her cry.

I'm honestly fine with them never wanting to talk to me again, but is there any way I can rectify our friendship?

tl:dr; Me and my best friends relationship started to slip and after misunderstandings and miscommunications I have dug a rift between us that I don't know how to fill. Is there any way I can rectify our friendship?",15Jun2020,1

866,"Hello all, Ive been thinking more and more as I’m about to leave a good paying job to go to college. The job that I’m at pays me well, but leaving the job to move an hour away to then go work at a part time job losing more than half of my hourly pay and yearly salary has me at quarrels. Going to college will give me an opportunity to work in the field that I dream to work in, but I’m worried and know that I won’t get the job that I want right out of college and me thinking that has me considering not going to college and progressing in the job that I’m currently at. I’m only 20 and I currently make ~45k a year I’m afraid that once I decide to move to my college I’ll possibly be effecting my future negatively. I already make more than anyone I know. I was talking to one of my friends about the situation and he thinks I’m crazy to leave the job that I’m at to go to college. I don’t mind the job that I work at I love it, but I never expected to like the job this much but it isn’t the career that I envisioned to have. I fear that if I leave me job I won’t get another job that pays as well once I get out of college and I believe that is to be expected. My parents think I should stay and go to a college closer to home where I can keep my job, but I want to go to the college that I want to go to and they are supportive of that and I don’t want to keep a full time job and do full time school anymore. I just feel so overwhelmed right now because I’m at an important point in my life that will shape the rest of my future. I don’t know what to do, it sucks because I also signed a lease with 3 of my other friends on the apartment that we’ve selected but we only pay for the room so if I chose not to move they won’t be effected by my decision. 

Sorry if this is all over the place and really long I just typed what I thought.

867,"Long story short; I’m an LGBT male 23 years old who graduated college last year and I have never been in a relationship. Over the years I’ve gone on dates, or had short flings but nothing more. I find myself never having luck with Tinder or Bumble, and the same names keep appearing all the time. Due to COVID I have had no means of meeting new people, and may not for a long time (finding a new job.) 

Now that its pride month Im putting effort into finding that special someone, and so I’ve been trying to gain the courage to be more forward with people.

Last year, a friend of mine told me their brother was also LGBT and let me tell you this person is 100% my type (from what I can see on the surface of course) however even after finding their tinder, apparently at the time they where interested in someone else (female if that matters) and so nothing ever came of it. Of course today, a year later, my friend posts about him for his birthday and Im wondering is it worth trying again? Do I reply to her story trying to fish for a chance things will magically work out, or do I run the risk of sounding desperate or even give the wrong impression? I have never spoken to the brother and I also don’t want to come across as creepy in anyway shape or form. My intentions are 100% pure literally he is a heartthrob and if theres even a small chance a for a Connection I wanna take it, but I don’t wanna ruin it by making a bad impression. Also I don’t wanna give this friend the impression that im just using them to get to there sibling nor do I want to rely on them for information. 

I hope someone gets what i’m saying but im very socially anxious especially when it comes to this stuff and I just wanna be more confident in these types of things",15Jun2020,1

869,"TLDR; 25 year old female here! Moving abroad to start a new job soon. Idk if I should stick around w this relationship, try long distance and work on the following issues or just let go of it early and move on?

here are things i’ve noticed after 7 months of dating this guy, but idk if i’m just being too nitpicky...


- mainly only talks about himself, and doesn’t ask me questions about myself. it is something I feel weird bringing up with him, since I would want someone who’s naturally interested in my life. at first, i thought it was just first date nerves but like, it has been months now. there are times when we’re talking and he goes on for long stretches of time, just talking and i sometimes zone out. he doesn’t even ask me questions to like see my view on what he’s talking about. 

- talks about his exes/other girls he finds attractive a lot. like several times in every conversation we have. i brought this up w him multiple times but he just doesn’t see anything wrong w it and continues to do it. he kind of just says i need to view it from a different perspective.

- whenever i ask him to clarify something he said, he goes straight to “you misunderstood what i said” or “why didn’t you give me the benefit of the doubt”, instead of just explaining to me what he meant to say. again i could talk about this with him, but i feel like i am picking on so many aspects of his personality in those moments. also, a discussion with him so easily escalates into an argument.

- on multiple occasions, he has said he is “always right” or has an “elite taste” in entertainment, and tends to think very highly of himself. again when i point this out, he says it was a joke or plays it down... but he has said this in serious situations many times, where we were obviously not joking. like is this concerning or am i just being too critical!?!?

- one time that stuck with me, is when we were having a discussion on clarifying something he said. i was upset but he just said “good night” when we hadn’t even finished our conversation. another time is when i brought something up, and he just kept trying to change the conversation to something else instead of just clarifying the thing we were talking about that i was confused about.

872,"I started a musical project about a year ago, and originally did everything solo. I wrote, recorded, and produced everything by myself in the beginning. As time passed and more opportunities started coming my way, I decided to bring a friend on board. He had a home studio and production experience which helped with those aspects, and him playing multiple instruments helped my live performances from being just me and an acoustic guitar. My music is mostly acoustic anyway, so he would just add things like a secondary guitar, a keyboard, or percussion depending on the song.

Well, recently it came time to record new music, and the plan had been to record together in his studio. Suddenly he became very unresponsive and unreliable with communication, and would flake when we made plans. I decided to record the new material by myself, which wasn’t a huge deal but didn’t turn out as well as if he’d have been involved.

I was then booked for two shows. The first show I was booked for on fairly short notice and he was busy that day, so I played by myself. The next show had about a month’s notice, and he was meant to be there, but then didn’t answer his phone at all for a week before the show and then messaged me the night before the show and said he wasn’t feeling like playing.

Since then, he has been impossible to get ahold of. I’ll call him, text him, he doesn’t respond, then appears days later and says something like “I’ve been sleeping a lot” or “I’ve been so depressed” only to disappear again. He does suffers from major depression and has a very busy schedule with work and other things but I went into this partnership with the expectation that I could rely on him and so far he’s disappointed me a lot. I care about him greatly and very much want him to be involved but his behavior has been very frustrating. I feel like I should cut him off and stay solo, but at the same time, I don’t want to hurt his feelings or miss out on the benefits I might have of working with him.",15Jun2020,1
873,"So I (23F) have a cousin (24M) who was crazy abusive to me as a kid. Thankfully nothing sexual but he would hit me, lock me in a small non-ventalated room after spraying an entire can of ax body spray (it was also super hot cuz summer and no air conditioning) causing me not to be able to breath and have a panic attack. He would hold me down and tickle me until I either peed myself or started crying. He was also verbally abusive and would manipulate my brother and I into fighting for his amusement which severely damaged my relationship with my brother.

My family (who I am super close to) has a weird blind spot to him because they feel bad his dad peaced out when he was a kid. He had 3 older siblings that are all wonderful so to me the excuse is bs. There was one incident at my high school graduation party where he slapped me so hard he left a nice handprint on my arm. This was after commenting that ""the men were talking so I should shut up"" at MY best friends party (mine was right after) while talking to MY bf at the time (who just shrugged his shoulders and said something like ""shouldn't have pissed him off"") . When I got home I told my dad (who is my superhero) what happened and he literally told me not to say anything to anyone because he didn't want to cause drama with the family. This broke me and ruined what was supposed to be my day as well as damaged my relationship with my dad. He has apologized and didn't realize the gravity of the situation but I just can't get over it.

On my 21st bday party he got crazy drunk and started picking fights with everyone. He actually threatened one of my other cousins with a log that was on fire. Once again my day became about him.

Because of this weird blind spot and my parents not wanting to cause a rift his behavior has gone unchecked and no one knows about all of the abuse. He has also become even more sexist, racist, homophobic and violent. 

I didn't realize how bad this blind spot was until he got in a bar fight as a marine and ended up going upstairs, grabbing a metal pipe and beating the offending mariner's head in. That poor kid died three times on the operating table and is disabled for life. My family was FURIOUS that my cousin was facing criminal charges because ""he was just defending himself"". Even his lawyer was like yeah no that's not how that works. He ended up being dishonorably discharged and serving some prison time (not enough).

Now because of my family's reaction he is all woe is me, my life is hard, etc. He has literally broken every part of his parole (owning a firearm and a few others) and no one says anything.

I am still expected to have him come to all of my events and basically pretend like he is a wonderful person that I love. I have honestly never hated anyone so genuinely. Everytime I talk to my grandparents or other family members he gets brought up. My choice is literally put up with him or cut ties with my family whom I love more than anything.

I just don't know if I should even bother bypassing this crazy don't cause drama thing and telling at least my grandma about what he has done. Any advice on this I would appreciate it.

I'm also making a career change in an oversaturated industry, with many companies not hiring right now, and am currently unemployed.  On top of that, I'm going through a break up with my partner who I live with.  Since I'm unemployed and living off of my savings, moving out is pretty much out of the question, but it is incredibly hard to stay positive every day while going through the break up and having no way to give each other space.  I'm just at a loss right now.  I feel so overwhelmed by everything happening, and super trapped in my situation.  I have no idea what to do.

One alternative I have is to drive across the country to be with my family. However, that makes me super nervous too because traveling will increase any risks, and the last thing I want is to bring COVID to any of my family members.  I am young-ish (late 20s) and perfectly healthy, never get sick or anything but I know that doesn't mean no risk, and doesn't mean I can't still pass it to someone else unknowingly.  I'm a horribly anxious person and already am terrified of the possibility of getting sick or getting someone else sick, so I know that if I were to travel I'd be freaking out the entire time and probably make my stress even worse.

 It just feels irresponsible to travel right now.  But at the same time I don't really have any other alternatives, aside from staying put and staying in this shitty situation I'm in.

883,"CO detector still reading 10

I recently bought a new CO detector, it’s the kiddie one that shows a digital display. 

It has a “peak level” button that you can press to see the last recorded CO detected. Two days after I received it, It kept reading 10 when I pressed that button. So I called the fire department and our local gas company and they found a small leak on our water heater. 

The water heater was replaced since our apartments were already in the middle of replacing them. All last night I kept checking the peak level and it was 0. (I’ll be honest, I have a horrible fear of carbon monoxide and I have kids so it makes it worse) 

This morning the peak level was 10!! The only gas appliance is our water heater so unless the new one has a leak I don’t know what’s causing that number. Should I call the fire department again? At this point, maybe the detector is malfunctioning?

Edit: I forgot to mention, when I reset the peak level back to 0 it stays like that for a good 6-8 hours or so. If there was really a CO leak wouldn’t it pick up on it right away?",15Jun2020,1
884,"So I sold what was supposed to be a 75 gallon fish tank, stand, top, and lights for $200. It was supposed to be $350 but the person swore it was only a 55 gallon, so whatever. I got it for $100 and put work into resealing it. I met them at 10 am and it is now 2 pm and they have messaged that they didn't want a tank that had been resealed unless it was factory sealed and they want their money back. Issue is, they're over an hour away and had refused to even pay a delivery fee. They said they didn't have enough money and I was using the money for my dog's Fluconazole and groceries. So the money is gone for the most part except maybe $40. It holds water, I made sure but have no pictures before at the time I had done it I had no plans to sell the tank. Now I'm afraid they're going to tamper with the tank and make it to where the seals don't work. We used an entire bottle of aquarium seal on the tank so again. No reason to leak. What do I do....?

886,"I have had this job for a little more than a year now. I am a junior administrative clerk for a store. I count the money the salesman make and take it to the bank every day and do various forms of paperwork. I fucking hate it. I sit at a desk all fucking day and take shit from the manager because she despises me for some reason. I have alot of stress and deadlines to meet and because i rush to meet these deadlines I tend to make alot of mistakes on my excel spreadsheets. I was told by said manager today before leaving for the day that if i continue to be so negligent with my work she will have no choice but to tell the boss that i keep screwing up and then i will have to sign a warning.

She talks to me like I'm some stupid kid and actually scolds me like one in front of my coworkers. I'm so embarrassed and horrified and I never know what to say when she asks me why i keep fucking up. . . I just stand there like an idiot with nothing to say because I swear I double check every thing i do cause I know I tend to make mistakes and it's important work because it involves the money the business makes everyday . I don't understand how this keeps happening. I feel like such a loser and a failure. I can't quit because I live in a small town with very limited opportunities. I still have to live with my parents because the pay is low but they were so proud of me for landing this 8 to 5 job that just the thought of how disappointed they would be in me is killing me slowly. I don't want to be a burden on them again (I pay half of my salary to my parents for living in their house, like rent. I am self sufficient, I pay for everything I do. I don't ask my parents for anything.) I am so scared of getting fired and now due to covid the fact that I still have a job is a small miracle. If I were to get fired i will most likely not be able to work for months, My parents just can't support me at the moment because my dad has just had his pay cut due to covid. 

What can I do? I am so stressed and scared all the time. I am at a point where i feel like maybe suicide isn't such a bad way to go, at least i could leave my parents my meager savings account as a nice little retirement fund. Both my brother and sister are well off and have great jobs that they are super good at, and all i can say is i like playing video games. I have no ambition or skills. I did not go to college, couldn't afford it and i suck at studying. I can guarantee you  I would not have made it a year in college. 

I am just another 24 year old with nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to. I am at a dead end in my life. What can i do to make things better? I feel so stupid and inexperienced, i'm tired of crying in the shower and hoping no one hears me. This has to end.",15Jun2020,1

888,"Hoping to make this as short as possible but here it goes. I've worked at this restaurant for over 10 years. I love the hours. The pay is great. However... covid has turned it into an absolute nightmare. Customers were snobby, entitled and rude before but now that they can't see you smile, it's even worse. Basically my job for the last 10 years is not the same job that it is today. Despite helping them keep their business open since the beginning of the pandemic, they gave me an ultimatum as to whether I wanted my job back-- and I accepted. However, it came to my realization that it only applied to a few specific people and the rest we're told they were allowed to keep their jobs, to collect unemployment and they would be called again when they were needed. At the time, it was very frustrating to hear that, and it still is, to have to pick up their slack with increased hours on top of a pay decrease, since business has slowed. First there was some bullshit salary that was 50% of our pay, then we went back to tips and then...

It got tougher. First week of June, my mom had a major stroke. And it's been an absolute rollercoaster of emotion. On top of having the POA duties fall into my lap, on top of covid restrictions... it's been a hellscape barred with 100s of phone calls throughout every day of the week with doctors, nurses, social workers, family, friends, etc. First week was spent wondering if she was even going to make it, and since then have been met with a lot of peaks and valleys. Glimmers of hope here and there, and doses of reality in between. I'll have hours where I'm hopeful and happy(or just numb) and others where I just fall apart imagining the situation my mom finds herself in. For the most part, work has been understanding and allowed me to take two weeks off to process this but the more I am coming to learn about this situation is that it's not even close to being over. I am so grateful my mom has advanced to rehabilitation but in two weeks, uncertainty will arise again.

It has absolutely divided me 10 different ways. Between the way my job treated me(another issue was my boss screaming at me for voicing concerns weeks prior), the way the job has evolved within this pandemic, my own regrets, the uncertainty, my own mortality, my wavering friendship with my closest friend... it's like all the pillars of my life decided to topple at the same time. And I really don't know what to do... I've asked if I can be put back on the schedule starting June 25th but have yet to hear a response, so there's a chance I don't even have this job anymore but considering they reached out to me for a reply I think I'm just overthinking that. But also the way that they've treated me this whole time really makes me think they aren't worth my time anymore. To scream, yell and cut pay of the only employee who stuck their neck out for them, while embroidering those who told them to fuck off, just doesn't sit right with me at all. And now I'm in a position where I might have to return in 10 days, I'm still an emotional wreck who is seeing life in this different light and wondering why I'm making myself miserable when life can be as short as it is. Or I don't return and find myself out of a job and potentially really screw myself. If all of this never happened, I would still be happily working there but now that I am going through this and they still aren't allowing me the same beneficial leave of unemployment they allowed those who weren't even willing to help(which I'm not saying I want but given the circumstances would be nice to not have to worry about at least one avenue of my life) just further pisses me off that my dedication to them is all but meaningless.

894,"Hello! I am a 20F college student, and I have been internally struggling for some time now. See, all my life I've dressed pretty typically: t-shirt, jeans, shorts, leggings, and the occasional dress/skirt. In the past year or so, though, I have sought to dress more modestly, so I no longer wear shorts or leggings, and I keep my tops modest as well. This was not a dramatic change from my old wardrobe, so nobody really said anything. However, for the last 6 months or so, I have had a strong desire to forego pants and strictly wear (at the knee or below) dresses/skirts. Just to be clear, though, they will all be stylish with modern designs. This is not something I have at all felt pressure to do, just a personal desire. Actually, that's the reason I'm coming here: How do I avoid backlash for this decision? Can I? Is it really all that weird? 

While my boyfriend supports me in this decision, I'm worried about what his family will think. I'm worried what MY family will think. I'm scared that dressing like this will make it difficult to make friends, and that it may confuse the ones I already have. The problem is that I don't really have an awesome reason for wanting to do this. I mean, yes, modesty, but I know this is considered a radical move in that regard. I just feel more comfortable in dresses/skirts: its easier, its cooler, makes me feel more professional, I like how feminine it makes me feel, and it makes me feel closer to God. I still know how culturally weird it is and I'm scared or backlash. I struggle with self esteem a lot, and while this will make me feel personally more secure, I worry about the added social insecurities. 

Side note, since I did mention God above and I think its important for context: I'm sort of a hippie Christian, though the desire to dress like this came before I fully committed to my faith. I do not believe in organized religion, so my expressions of faith (while typically based on precedent) are solely a reflection of how the religion manifests within me, and this is never something I want to force on anyone else, even my own children. I am worried, though, about being perceived as a religious nut, especially as I've announced to my family that I'm dedicating my life to service: Joining the Peace Corps as soon as I graduate, working in social services after that (its what I'm getting my degree in), and doing lots of small charity work on the side. I fear that changing the way I dress will make them extremely critical of me.

So, should I change my wardrobe, regardless of what others think? Is there any way I can make it less weird for others? Am I just weird, haha? Just, honestly, what should I do? 

Thank you so much! Any advice at all is appreciated.",15Jun2020,1

I ended up moving away saddly and couldn't see her anymore, i always wanted to go back to see my friends and to see her. I eventually went back and started school there again but i had a gf when i returned. I tried talking to her a couple times but we were strangers it seemed an it was awkward plus my girl was getting jealous abit so i had to stop talking to her. Fast forward 3 years my girlfriend tells me she cheated 3 times and loves another guy so i pack up move out go back to the town where my highschool was, that's when i thought of her again, i thought ""i just got out of a f**ked up 3 year relationship that hurt me really bad, i should wait for awhile to heal then try talk to her"". Four very long months pass an i finally decide to message her, it was going good until i gotten drunk to celebrate w my bestfriend an i accidentally sent her silly messages and spilled out my feelings for her lmao it was so embarrassing, i tried explaining myself while apologizing alot in a message i sent her, never got a message back at all. Felt like i was being annoying too for sending so much messages so i told her that ill stop and i did, she never said anything to me at all since the first drunken message ive sent her only read it.

905,"*long post!!! 

As I’ve grown older, I’ve really began to notice the issues I have with my self-worth, self-discipline, and trusting others/myself. I know that my upbringing and genetics have to do with many of my problems, so I’d like to overshare and ask for advice from anyone who can sympathize or empathize. 

My dad was an abusive alcoholic, married to my mother who used drugs and refused to take her medication for her Bipolar Depression disorder. She also suffers from anxiety and lots of childhood trauma herself - along with my dad too. I say was because after a long night of screaming and me ignoring the situation, it peaked and the cops were called. Me and my three siblings were sent to live in foster care and my dad was sent to jail. We lived separately for awhile, until my parents reunited in their toxic relationship and we moved back in together. My dad quit drinking for a long time but has recently  picked it back up, not quite as heavily. But it was still prevalent in their relationship, despite his sober ness, that he was abusive to my mother, whether it be physically or mentally. 

I’ve watched my parents throw punches at each other, and growing up we heard them constantly fighting and being beyond rude to each other. I basically parented my siblings. I’m also pretty sure, not entirely though, that my mom used marijuana around my siblings and I, and surprise surprise, i smoke it now and struggle with dependency issues. Actually, my whole family smokes, all 6 of us. 

To this day, my family continues to struggle with big blowups about small things, a lot revolving around past anger and past issues that were never resolved. We always just swept things under the rug. I was always the mediator and still am, during these fights. 

I find myself struggling with disciplining myself, as I can never stick to anything and can never give myself motivation for things. I have the worst self esteem, maybe body dysmorphia? More than likely from my mom telling me to suck in all the time. I see myself as ugly and fat, not finding out that people even considered me attractive until I was 17, two years ago, and still not understanding it at all. When I was dating my boyfriend of 3 years, I never could accept a compliment or believe what he told me. I also couldn’t trust him properly, even though he never gave me a reason to not trust him. Well a few, but not huge ones. I also self destructed our relationship by doing drugs and sleeping with someone I don’t even like. I love him to this day but know I’ve ruined it. My mom cheated on my dad and it was a big part of our childhood because my dad followed my mom there once with all of us kids and took us into the house she was at. 

I have bad anxiety and substance abuse issues, and I repress all of my emotions, physically unable to share them with others. I don’t want to burden others with my problems and they can’t help anyway. Nobody ever knows what to say. I just don’t want to turn out like my parents. My brother has gone down that road already and he’s lost, but I have to be a healthy individual. I want to go to college and not be broke all the time (considering my terrible spendings habits - thx mom). I want to have healthy relationships and not feel the need to self sabotage myself so I can’t hurt them sooner than they’ll hurt me. 

I’ve read about reparenting and am interested in that, but really would just like peoples takes on this. I don’t know if it’s even actually that bad of a situation, am I overreacting? Am I just a loser who isn’t supposed to have a good life? I feel terrible for ruining my relationship, maybe I’m really just not supposed to be happy 🤷🏻‍♀️

912,"I'm a nineteen-year-old woman. About three years ago, I made a post from a throwaway account on this website about my father. I cannot find my original post anywhere after some deep-diving (I remember significant phrases from the post, like ""we were like two peas in a pod"", but I'm still having trouble finding it). Anyway, to sum it all up, I was sexually assaulted by my father. 

We used to be very close until that big event changed it. He told me that he felt bad afterwards and told me not to tell anyone. However, after a couple of days and with the helpful advice from some advice subreddit, I caved to my therapist and told her everything. We had an emergency intervention. My mother was so hurt, but she stood by me. During a phone call that my therapist made to him, he was asked if what I was saying was true. He denied it, saying that I forced myself onto him and that he denied my advances. Hearing that just took me apart. I was asked if I wanted to press charges, and I did not, because my mother did not want the family to break apart. The rest of the intervention was just a round of talking to my grandparents on my father's side about what happened (I do not think they believe me, to this day, but they are still very loving towards me), my parents talking to my therapist, my therapist talking to me -- just talking all around. 

It was decided that my father would be out of the house for a while, because I felt really uncomfortable with him being there. He stayed at his parents's place during that time. When he came back, I was still very uncomfortable with his presence. I avoided all conversation with him, even the ""good  mornings"", ""hellos"" and ""goodnights"". Eventually, he complained to my mother about it (I overheard their conversation), saying that he did not want to feel like a stranger in his own house. My mother addressed this to me and asked if I would have it in my heart to forgive him. I really did not want to. She said that I should at least be respectful by saying ""good morning"". 

In a therapy session with my mother, the subject came up about forgiving my father. I do not exactly remember what was said, but I know that I just said that I did, so that I can move on. My mother really wanted the family to be held together and believed that we could move on from this and everything would be fine. 

So, for a time, I tried to act normal like everyone else. Fast forward to now, I have resolved that I cannot forgive my father for what he has done. This really affected me, because I would have recurring nightmares and flashing thoughts during the day about him assaulting me again (this is not the case now, but I have had one nightmare recently this year). I realized a while back that he has actually molested me discreetly plenty of times (nuzzling on my breasts with his head while we were alone downstairs, getting hard-ons while I was on his lap, etc.), but I never picked up on that as being sexual and inappropriate. It has made me feel even more about the situation.

Additionally, he has just been acting like an overall jerk around the house to others, even to my baby sister. He calls it ""tough love"", but I do not buy it. He repeatedly keeps saying that he has the final say in anything and everything, because he is ""the man of the house"". There are just way too many things that he has said and done to list. 

Dorming at college has been the best thing ever for me to get away from him, besides me just wanting some sort of independence. I want to cut him off, but it is tricky. Despite my mother being the primary breadwinner, he has significant veteran benefits that have really helped fund my education. He also has good credit and is just overall more financially-wise, so to speak. I fear that if I cut him off, he will take that away from me. 

Additionally, I am also afraid that he might prey on my baby sister and my other younger sister. I am also afraid that my brother will grow up with his hurtful values. I am ashamed to admit it. Also, my mother will be heartbroken, because it will show her that I truly have not forgave him like she has, and that I do not have love for him like her. 

So, Reddit, am I right for wanting to cut him off? If I am, how should I go about this? If not, why? I truly do not know.",15Jun2020,1

Hello everyone! I (23M) am currently at my 5th grade in a good University in a poor country where things are hard without a degree. I'm halfway through, having passed the most difficult subjects, but I completely dislike it and studying is a torture. It is probable that if I finish it, I'll have a ""good"" job (I won't starve) which I might or might not like. The things I learn now will be totally useless. It's just about getting a degree.

The thing is, Uni makes me too anxious and sad and I feel like a loser. I feel it's the road to a boring and sad life. Something I think I'd like to do is music. I'm playing the guitar 10 years now and I've written songs. I want to make a band. But I can't rely on the band to make a living. Maybe it's a good first step to study sound engineering/music production. (I can't study music since I have little theoritical backround compared to what is needed to pass to a music college).

But after the studies of music production, what? It's a workspace you don't easily get into and I don't know if it's enough to make a living from it. I will also need to have a conflict with my parents, who expect me to get the degree. I'm down in a hole. I don't wanna be 28 living with my parents. I don't wanna get the degree and regret not chasing my dreams. And I don't wanna start studies around music and starve tomorrow.

Help, please.",15Jun2020,1
914,"I should preface this post by saying I've worked at this company for 2 weeks.

I got a programming job at a mid-size company, and the office has a relaxed culture that does not feel corporate at all. To most people this would seem like a good thing, but having not had much experience interacting in a casual-professional job setting, I almost want to quit as I generally can't get comfortable in these types of places.

From what I've observed, the people interact with ease, and I feel like a robot. I've even gotten into a slight benzo addiction to cope, but that's a whole different thing. My previous internship had the similar relaxed environment where it was weird to not be relaxed and I dreaded it. 

I see two apparent options which are 1) push through and hope by experience and time I can become relaxed, or 2) quit and work a more robotic job where social interaction doesn't matter. Option 2 seems absurd to me even though I feel totally stressed out every day of this job.",15Jun2020,1
915,"Basically me and my dad just don’t get along anymore at all. I’m 21 and he’s approaching 70, so our views are almost never aligned and he’s also a lot more snappy and easy to offend as opposed to when he was younger. My father has been there for me as a provider in many ways, but our personalities just don’t align at all. Being around him completely dampens my mood and I feel awful about being dismissive but every time I try to talk to him, it ends in an argument. Today I told him a story about my friend, and he basically started lecturing me about how I need to keep a distance from her or whatever. My dad often lectures me on stuff I already know and repeats the same stories so today I asked him does he know that I know the things he tells me, or does he think I’m ignorant to it and that he’s teaching me a lesson. I thought the question would help make me have less resentment toward him, because part of the reason I do avoid him is that I think he is overprotective and acts like I don’t know anything when I do. I’ve gone through SO MUCH that he has no idea about and learned all on my own. He has never known about any boyfriend I’ve had or anything because he’s kind of controlling and I feel like him not knowing would save me so much lecturing. i tried to get therapy after experiencing traumatic events and he made me feel like shit about it, kept talking down on me wanting to go until I was just too discouraged to even try anymore. i sometimes change into outfits I actually want to wear in the car because he tries to control what I wear otherwise. I hate feeling like I have to hide everything and sneak out the back door when I’m this old. I really wanted to hear his answer and was hoping he’d say that he knows I know it, he just likes to reiterate and talk about it. But he completely flipped shit and was like IN MY GENERATION YOUD GET SLAPPED. YOU WOULDNT EVEN BE LIVING HERE. JUST SHUTUP AND LISTEN TO THE STORY. YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING. Like wtf? I chose to not respond and stay calm but inside I wanted to cry. Any time I voice an opinion my dad doesn’t like he gets mad and says some hurtful things to me. And because of him (definitely not him alone but partially) I have a major issue with codependency, I’m always scared to voice my opinion or defend myself and it’s lead to me getting used and abused by many people. I love my dad but we are not compatible to live with. We have almost nothing in common and I feel like my resentment toward him won’t leave until I have time away. I currently have no savings left because I had to quit my job because of Covid, and I’m in school. I’m still at community college for another year and then I plan to transfer. I just want anyone to please answer and give advice on what to do. I pay no rent here, my dad provides everything for me. But I feel like I’m in an abusive relationship with him sometimes. I genuinely don’t know what I do that’s so bad. Or what to do. I have major anxiety issues now and all this with him makes it worse. I have a tedious major so it’s hard to work and go to school at the same time. I sometimes work sometimes don’t, it all depends on my college classes.",15Jun2020,1

917,"First off, I am literally brand new to reddit. Birthed into this website just before I wrote this post.

Second off, I haven't approached her about it yet.

I recently figured out that my sister in law has lied about something very peculiar. For context, I am a 22 yo F, and she is a 19 yo F (let's call her Rebecca), and she just married into the family (my husbands family) a couple months ago. When I first met Rebecca (just after she'd gotten engaged to my bro-in-law), she mentioned that she had been to Australia on a trip the previous year. I am an Australian citizen (dual with my birth country), and have huge family ties there, so obviously that was exciting for me to hear. I asked the details about her trip, including how long she'd visited for. She told me about her time there, and said that she was there for 3 weeks. I told her about some of my experiences with Australia (because it's a talking point with a person I have very little in common with), and mentioned that I lived there for 3 months while I was in high school.

Jump forward to a few weeks ago, while we are hanging out for the first time one on one. The topic of Australia comes up again, because she mentions that she had gotten engaged to someone while she was there. I, again, ask how long she visited for (because I had forgotten, also she'd gotten engaged to someone else previously????) and she says 3 months. She also details that she stayed with her fiancé the whole time, and that he was much older than her and tried to take advantage of her. Obviously this news shocks me, and my mind completely glosses over the fact that her timeline had changed.

Recently, my husband and I were discussing a trip to Australia to visit my extended family there, when the topic of Rebecca's trip to Australia comes up (because we were thinking of visiting a friend that lives in the area that she visited). I then have an epiphany of the mismatched info, and ask my husband how long Rebecca had told him her trip was. He said 3 weeks. Alarm bells start ringing in my head, and I go to social media to see if I could clear things up there. Most of her socials had been scrubbed since she'd gotten married, but her mother's FB was public and Rebecca was tagged in a bunch of posts. The first post about the trip was that she left on February 3, and the second was that she returned around Feb 22. If my math is correct, that is around 2.5 weeks.

So I text Rebecca, asking her the dates of her trip citing that my brother was there around the same time as her (which was true) as an excuse to randomly be asking. She said she was there Jan-March 2019. And so I think, well maybe her mom just didn't post things on the days they happened. But then I remember that her mom posted a photo of Rebecca and my b-i-l on their very first date on the day it happened, so she is pretty prompt with posting (some might say obsessive). So I look in January, and sure enough there are photos of her at her parent's house. And I look in March, and there are multiple posts of her at her parent's house again. So how in the world is she supposedly in Australia for 3 months, if her mom posted when she left and returned, and also photos of her at home in the months that she was supposed to be still gone for? Also, her family is super religious, and I cannot see them allowing her to travel on her own to another country, and live with a guy (that became her Fiancé) for several months (especially since she was 17 at the time). She also only changed her tune about being there for 3 months once I said that I'd stayed there for 3 months.

I'm supposed to see Rebecca this weekend, and honestly I wouldn't typically say anything about it and just use this knowledge as a guiding compass for trusting her. Except, she has told me a bunch of stuff that is super personal, and I'm wondering if she lied about those too to gain sympathy. She is very young (not that I'm much older, but the difference of when I was 19 to now is crazy), and doesn't have a lot of life experience because she grew up in a very small town. I feel like there are a lot of things she's lied about in retrospect to try and get ""cool points"" and ""sympathy points"". I also told her some pretty personal things as well (because I thought I could trust her), and now I'm really regretting it.

Would it taking it too far if I asked for clarification about it? And do I have enough substantial evidence to bring this up to her?",15Jun2020,1

923,"My college has been shut down from the time lockdown started in my country. Online classes only started after like 3 weeks after this happened. I (f22) was working full time before quarantine and was continuing said work from home. It might also be a good time to point out that I suspect that I have adhd-pi. I have never been strong academically and have never really studied apart from classes in my life. assignments are the bane of existence and despise them almost as much as presentations which my anxiety wishes death upon. Unfortunately, the mental health sector in my country is a joke. Illnesses like depression and anxiety are finally being recognized. However, knowledge about adhd and other learning disabilities are strictly reserved for children. Which is why i haven't been able to find any resources or help for my suspected adhd even after a year of actively trying.

So you can imagine what happened when all the structure was taken away during lockdown. I was doing work from home fine until college started. When online classes started i became miserable. It was my mistake that i continued working for reasons that seems irrational to me right now. But i did and completely neglected online classes. We do zoom calls where students disable video and audio as the lecturer presents the class. And i took this as a chance to go online for class and then fall asleep thinking i would just watch the recording later (surprise. i didn't).

but now its been about 3 months into classes and i have missed many assignments, quizzes and oral tests and presentations from my classes. My justification at the time was that i was miserable at the time. But it doesn't end there! 3 weeks ago i got fired from my job for a stupid reason that is completely my fault. This upped by anxiety to level 99 and i completely shut myself up. During low times, my first reaction is to isolate myself from everything. I went completely off the grid and slept 16 hrs a day. This included not going for classes. At the same time 2 of my major classes started a long running group project which i was obviously not there for.

After a week i went to online classes but proceeded to stay off the grid still in a depression haze. Ignoring my group completely. They proceeded to do the project and have gone way ahead with it. One of the reasons why i ignored them is because it's so overwhelming. They've already done this much work. And i would hate to go and just take credit. So ridden with anxiety, I didn't go to the classes with group presentations and such. The marks for these two majors are all dependent on these group projects. Yesterday during class, the teacher saw me join the chat and called me out and asked me to enable the microphone. I was so scared out of my wits so I didn't make a peep. He asked me to call him after class which i obviously didn't do. 

It's been a week or so that I have not been debilitatingly depressed. I don't want to fail my classes and want to catch up. I have been completing some assignments for other classes and its been very difficult as i find it very hard to motivate myself. But i'm really scared about those 2 majors and the group work. And i have no idea how to get out of the mess I made for myself. I know i am a capable person but the covid situation, no external structure life during quarantine and mental health stuff has been killing me. Should I email the lecturers and tell them about my situation? I was thinking about asking them for an independent project-work. I seriously am not capable of calling him as it sounds too overwhelming at the moment as even the thought of that causes me to freak out. 

Honestly, I wouldn't know what ""situation"" to tell them about. I know I could have avoided all this if I just powered through a few weeks back. I hate myself for getting into this mess. I wish i could undo it all but i cant. How do i get control of my life? I'm sorry for the very long read but I really need help.

924,"I received an email about a job offer, but it seems a bit too good to be true. Pay is CAD$41 per hour, flexible hours, work from home opportunity (I suppose those two make sense with the virus), and they let students work part time. The person who sent the email claims to be somebody who was very easy for me to verify exists because her name and position are listed on the company's website. She also has a LinkedIn page that was easy to find. I did find that the company is expanding their business into Canada, so it makes sense they might be looking for employees proactively. That said, when I asked where she found my email address she said on Indeed. I checked my profile there and my resume and email are set to private, so I have to confirm to show them to employers. I contacted Indeed to see if there's any way they could still find my resume, but I only just did that before writing this post, so I'm still awaiting a response. 

The email also mentioned I would need to fill out a comprehensive online questionnaire, but instead of linking me to something on their website I was sent [a docx file that looks like this.](https://imgur.com/TCii9nG) There are a few things I find striking about this. Going top to bottom, the questionnaire asks for ""State"" and ""Zip"" but below specifically asks if I'm authorized to work in Canada instead of something more generic like ""in your country of residence"". Here in Canada we of course have provinces rather than states and postal codes rather than zip codes. Next, the education and employment history sections asks if I graduated from my last job and what my degree from there was. Finally, where the signature was applied you can see that a white smudge covers some of the text as if an image of the signature was cut and pasted from somewhere else rather than being applied directly to the document with a digital signature pad. I feel that this form is likely harmless to complete, but I'm not totally sure. Should I fill it out and see what happens or assume it's fake?

One final issue of concern is that the company rebranded recently from their original name to a very similar name. For this reason they have a lot of different domains they use for different parts of their website. This isn't totally abnormal. It's something I've seen on a lot of websites for very large companies. Like a company might have a different domain for user accounts, one for support, and different ones for different products they offer. My issue is that the company has very limited options for receiving support and no careers section on their website, so I can't confirm if the domain is actually one they use. The email address is &lt;firstname&gt;@&lt;companyname&gt;connect.info which could be legitimate, but could also be an attempt to fool people. I'm really not sure what to think about this one. It would be huge for me if this is a real opportunity, but it can also be a major problem if this is a phishing scam.",15Jun2020,2
925,"This is very serious for me and I am not looking for hate (I probably deserve it.), I just want answers on building my personal identity.

So, I don't belive in the superiority ( or inferiority for that matter) of any race but I am often called a racist because I have no boundaries of words or topics for humor. 

I can not find it in me to talk to someone I want to be friends with and only talk about things that won't make them dislike me. If I'm aware that someone might not like certain things that I say then all I can think about is not saying anything stupid, I can't focus on having a conversation with them, I feel no personal connection at that point. 

Personal relationships for me have to have humor in them or it feels wrong for me, but I force myself to not make personal relationships with a lot of people because I know that I will eventually slip and say something that someone doesn't like.

I want to know how to change myself but I just don't know what to do. I know the general advice; don't say the n word or any other slur, don't focus on their race and instead their person, don't believe racial stereotypes, learn about their culture, don't make race jokes, find something that you like and isn't racist then invest in it... I know all of these and I try my best to follow them but these tips just don't seem like they work because when I actually try to talk with people I'm only focusing on not fucking up.

I want to talk to this cute black girl at work but all of the advice I get doesn't really seem to help with actually interacting with her, when I think about how a conversation with her I can't think of anything I want to talk to her about because I'm so focused on not being a insensitive person.

Again, I'm not looking for ""you're a racist, go away and stop doing racist things""  or ""treat everyone like a human being"", I get these a lot and know. Please read the whole post because I can't really condense how I feel and what I need help with.

928,"More context:
Me[M] and this girl (Racquel) took the same course for collage in 2014. Within a few weeks of school Racquel and I started talking between classes and studying early in the morning. We developed a pretty good friendship and I was interested in her. At the time I didn’t know she had boyfriend because I had her on Twitter and Facebook and there no evidence of any guy in her life. 
Another classmate (I’ll call her Rose) could tell I was into Racquel and said I should ask Racquel out and I said I wanted to but I wasn’t sure if she was single or not. Rose offered to ask for me and I said yes. Rose informed me that Racquel did have a boyfriend. 
Nothing much happens between Racquel and I. We go for sushi and have coffee before class. 
Fast foreword to the end of summer (school was finished, it was only 5 months long).
I was gonna take her out on her birthday but she never responded to my texts. Turns out she had broken up with her boyfriend just prior and she needed time to be alone. Here’s the point where I thought I’d seen The last of her. I’d get an occasional text from her but the conversation would end pretty fast. 
We were both looking for jobs in the field we studied (sterile processing). She had two offers within a week (in the fall, which I find out later.)

Jump to March 2015, she messages me that she misses me and that I should apply at one of The places she working at. I apply and I get a casual position, however she no longer works there as she got a permeant position at her other job (same field). I continue to work there until a positions open up at the current place Racquel’s working at. I apply and get one of the 4 casual positions. She and I reconnected like old friends. 
She and I are good friends, however she would confused me because she would grab my butt and tell me how handsome I was and be really flirty. I Thought she was into me. One day I happen to see a twitter post from her about her giving a guy a chance or something (I don’t really remember the tweet). I thought maybe it would be me due to her flirting and butt grabbing and such.
It wasn’t me, it was a guy she had told me previously she wasn’t into at all. I was speechless for a while. 
We’re still friends, we go out for breakfast before our shifts and walk around our work place. 
She is the one person I could talk to my ADHD, anxiety, depression, disappointment from parents and many other things. We also have the same type humour as well. 
We on occasion will go to this really fancy restaurant That’s close to our work and treat our selfs (I’m talking $250 bill, which we always split 50/50).
During this entire time she’s has been single almost the entire time, apart from briefly seeing her ex bf and the other guy. 
In January 2020 we have dinner at the fancy restaurant on a weekend which we split down the middle (I feel like I have to say this again just so people reading this don’t get the wrong idea and I have accepted it long ago that she and I will never end up together). 
A few days later we are both working and but not the same shift. One of my other co workers is going through her stuff and says she can’t find her ticket for a wedding social (socials are fundraisers for weddings where I’m from). I ask what ticket, and she says Racquel and *** (the ex bf). I had to ask who that was because Racquel calls me her bestie, and as far as I knew she wasn’t seeing anyone and was still single.
I had to ask multiple times to make sure it was the same person I knew.  (Apparently she had been engaged for a few weeks at this point)
When My shift starts I ask her about it and she was really caught off guard and try’s to play it down. 
This has been on my mind for a while. Am I in the right to be pissed off that I find out through a ticket that my best friend is getting married? 
If I was the bestie shouldn’t she be excited to tell me and me being one of the first to be told, apart from her family?

Currently I've enrolled in the 2 year program since that's what the program covers, and I've got to worry about paying for books... But I've not told my parents that Im just getting a 2 year degree. My options were this, go to school at this one for 2 years just getting my general education stuff, doing no animation work, and then transferring to a different school that's more expensive doing just animation work, or go 4 years at this school and have to worry about those 2 years seprately. The problem with the 4 year program? Its in Digital Design, and on top of that, I've missed the deadline for any kind of scholarships...

It seems that almost every day she tells me that she's tired of it and that she's done dealing with it all. She tells me she just wants to forget it all. 

I don't know how to help. I feel like I'm good at listening, but I'm terrible at giving advice back. She says it means a lot that I'm there for her, but I don't feel like I'm doing enough as a friend.

I give her the basics like ""it sucks now but it'll get better"" and ""you've been through a lot already, you're a strong person and you can get through this"" but after a while it gets old and I run out of things to say.

942,"Edit: This is a very long post, I know, but it's the first time I speak it out loud. Please bare with me. 

Hello, this is my first post here.

I hope you guys can help me find a way through this, because I don't want to end up depressed; and yes I'm not comfortable these days.

So our country, Lebanon, is going through its worst economic crisis ever, with local currency devaluation and high rates of inflation. Please Please bare with me.

I enrolled at the American university of Beirut, and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering. This is my senior year now, and I kinda feel bad about it. I feel that I'm everything but an engineer, and I now I hate my major. However I always loved music, especially classical music. I used to listen and try to play Mozart and Beethoven by ear since I was 7. I used to enjoy it.

So my parents thought that this would be a good hobby for me since I wasn't that good at sports, so I started taking private piano lessons with our neighbor teacher, but I didn't like it because the teacher was really serious and gets angry easily at me. So I told my parents I want to stop.

when I was 12, I decided to start piano lessons again with the same teacher, who was getting really old, so because I wasn't that mature, and didn't think about what I will do when I grow up, I started playing pieces I like instead of practicing, thinking that I will be good as a pianist anyway (picturing myself as a 20 years old man). But in fact I made little progress, and then stopped piano lessons because of high school and official exams.

After that, came the most disgusting moment of my life, which is to choose what to do with my life. I was a good student with very good grades (I was french educated tho), and managed to score enough in my SAT (altho I'm still not that confident about my english communication skills).

I didn't know what the hell was engineering or mechanical engineering specifically, but one of my brightest friends said he wanted to do that at the same uni (AUB), so I thought it would be good to be an engineer since my parents wanted that, and I was good at mathematics and physics. But little did I know that this will end up like this.

I have good academic standing at my uni which is top ranked in the MENA region, but I feel that this is going nowhere, and in my third year of university, I started hating my major and university  because of either bad professors or ugly topics and courses. More than that, my fellow students seemed to be finding a way out of it by self learning. So I felt bad because I couldn't do that, because I was too busy studying for the useless courses and always failed to manage time, so I couldn't really benefit from my full potential, so I'm feeling exhausted from my most precious resource which is time.

So at that moment I realized that I don't like it, and that I want to finish as quickly as possible so I can find out what I will do.

At the end of my second year, I found out a youtube channel ""TwoSetViolin"" and they really reminded me of the actual life of a musician. I was like, yeah I want to do that. But as the same moment I was thinking that doing so, I will be an extra to the society and I won't be innovating to help the whole world get through its most challenging problems.

But I decided in my third year that I will enroll in a music school, to learn the piano alongside uni, and just when I finished my first 12 sessions, protests started, the currency started its devaluation and the Covid-19 outbreak. so I had to stop again my piano lessons for the third time during my lifetime. Now that the gov started easing lockdown, the music school called me saying that they we re-open, but that they will increase their rates/hour. I was shocked and saw my dream of being a good piano player flowing far away. The reason is that tuition fees are already too high for me to afford (at 1500LBP FOR THE $), so I'm barely being able to pay for tuition with the actual crisis. And now, the uni announced that they will start receiving in  the spring semester payments at the the market's exchange rate which is around 4000 for the $, so I'm doomed. I think if this will happen I'll have to drop out like many other studentS.

I really don't know what to do. I really dream of being a musician, a classical pianist, performer and even enter the music production industry, but I see that I should continue to obtain my degree in engineering because I payed a lot and this is my senior year. But I don't know what to do after that. It will take time to become a musician, and I don't know if I'll succeed. I'm really confused and I don't  want to reach depression stages, because I'm not feeling good, at every instant of my life right now. Even when I watch my TwoSet videos that give surges of serotonin, I directly feel bad after that.

Please help me.",15Jun2020,1
944,"I've aksed this a couple times, but never get any straight answers. A couple months ago, my truck was leaking some anti freeze in my moms gravel driveway. I put a lot of kitty litter on the stain, twice, and then scrubbed it down with dawn, but it hasnt really helped. I've also found several other stains, but I sort if doubt they are from me. My moms tenants truck was leaking really bad, and my dad said he used to dump oil all over the place when he use to work on his cars. My mom also spills a lot of gas when she burns debree in the drive way. Ive spent like $200 trying to get rid of these stains, and really stressing out about it, because half the driveway sort of slips down to the bank. About 50-60 ft down the bank is a small seasonal stream. While it's in likely, I'm afraid this oil is contaminating the stream, and I'm afraid it's going to destroy the environment, and kill a countless amount of animals.

945,"So yeah let me begin , we started of as friends , then friends with benefits and now we're in a relationship.  I new from the beginning that I was falling hard and I tried to resist it . I've never been in love with someone I only had short flings because of my commitment issues. And I never planned on being in a relationship.  But one day I met him and we hung out a few times , we always had a lot of fun and talked about so many things and i slowly felt it coming. At first I thought it was just the sexual attraction that I had for him but I quickly realized that it was more than that. My boyfriend and I we kinda have problems with our feelings (we can't really talk about them) for me it's better now mainly because of him . He on the other side is a different story (he cant even say I love you to his family) . 


But we have been in a relationship for 3 months now and we got comfortable with one another and everytime we are together we do silly (goofy) stuff , we're compatible and I can read his body language even tho it can be pretty hard with him ...his eyes don't lie. And for the past two days he's been saying stuff like ""hey OP ....I...like you"" ( he said that like 3-4 times ) and I think he kinda wants to tell me ""I love you "" but I'm not sure . I think I'm going to have to make the first step but I'm very nervous I dont wanna fuck up I'm scared that he isn't  ready yet that he will dump me and that scares me I just dont know what to do .

949,"I’m (24F) 14 weeks pregnant and just got a call from my doctor about my blood work. Everything is fine but they said I tested positive for Chlamydia. Now, I lost my virginity to the dad of my baby (29M). Only person I’ve ever had unprotected sex with, and before we did he swore on his life he was clean and claimed he got tested so often that “the office knows me by name.” Which is strange because the man could be on his death bed and won’t go to the doctors and he has zero insurance (works for himself). I’ve never been so mad. I get the prescriptions sent to my pharmacy, like a damn adult, and told him I’ll drop his off and Venmo request him. He said “I’m not taking that shit” and so I said okay, and I’ve now blocked him on everything possible. Before I did, he said “no wonder I got so sick in January, it’s because of you” (a month after we got together). This man has caused me hell for the last six months, worst six months of my life. And now I’m doing this parenting thing on my own, which I am now scared of because what if the medication I have to take for it hurts the baby? I know that a very small percent of people have had to go through this but I’m so fucking scared. I don’t know what to do. 

So my part of asking for advice/a few questions: 
  -Are there any people that have knowledge/educational background that knows how to go about having an STD while pregnant? I’m just starting my second trimester.
  -Can I get his name removed off of paperwork at the doctors? He will not be on the birth certificate.
  -If he does try to contact me and harass me (he’s done it before, all three times I’ve tried leaving him in the past) is there anything I can do to protect myself and my baby? I tried so hard making it work with him, putting my own mental health at the bottom of my list, and this is the final straw. He’s lied to me so much, I’m done and I don’t want a damn thing to do with him ever again.
  -I’m so fucking scared to have Chlamydia, I know it’s a more common STD but still. The only other thing I’ve gotten was a UTI (once again, after having sex with him) and that was an awful experience that turned into a very severe kidney infection so an actual STD is scaring the fuck out of me.

I’m sorry, I’m overwhelmed and just have too much going on, and now this. It’s a lot.",15Jun2020,2
950,"Woke up to several texts and missed phone calls from my boyfriend's mom telling me not to answer any other calls until I spoke with her. When I asked her to explain, she said she has listed me as her landlord to a realty company because her **real** landlord ""hates her"". She instructed me to claim she was my tenant, that she pays a certain amount each month, and that her lease is up this month (which it isn't). She explained she wants to buy a second commercial property and doesn't want the realty company knowing she is currently paying rent for two properties already. 

I have since been dodging her calls and one call from the realty company. 

I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. She didn't even ask me before just assuming I'd go along with it and lie for her. She gave out my number to a company without my consent and, according to them, I'm her landlord. I don't know what to say to her or how to say it, and she is now desperately trying to reach me, so I've turned off my phone. 

Side note: it's also my birthday, so I'm kinda pissed she chose today of all days to do this.

957,I 21F turned 21 a few days ago and ended up drunk texting a friend of mine 21M. Backstory: I had a crush on him 2 years ago but nothing ever came out of that. A few months ago he told me that he had “caught feelings” for me and at first I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try pursuing that... But I ended up changing my mind bc I definitely prefer to have him as a friend and don’t think we would really work out together. In my opinion we never dated or anything like that. Fast forward a few months later (now) and I accidentally drunk texted him some things that I guess were a bit flirty (stuff like “omg I miss you” and then “sweet dreams &lt;3” later).

960,"Hello. 

I'm a 15F, and I kinda have identity issues. I don't really take myself seriously or anything but this is the one thing that really bothers me I guess.

I don't know how to say this but I really hate myself, for a lot of reasons. Between crippling awkwardness and just being kind of a loser, I don't have much going for me, and it makes me a prime target for bullying. So, I try and cover it up with being edgy. It's cringe, but, yeah. Not over the top, but more like the weird quiet kid at the back of class who never talks and stays away from everybody. If anybody tries to laugh at me when I'm like that, I either ignore them or tell them to shut up. Like I said, cringe and edgy, but whatever. It's the only thing I can do, really. I'm awful at talking to people so it's not like I can just act outgoing and confident. I've tried taking confidence courses and stuff but none of it really worked for me, and, if I'm being honest, I prefer acting like that anyway.

My problem is I can't pick a side. People are complex and have multiple sides to themselves, that I know, but when I really despise myself, the shy loser, it's hard to just 'be myself'. Acting like I don't care makes me feel so much more confident in myself and doesn't make me want to never open my mouth out of fear of messing up. Should I just try to make this into how I am?",15Jun2020,2

962,"Hi! Back in early March, before the COVID-19 pandemic took root in the US, I bought two round-trip tickets to Spain in July for a wedding. Y'all know what happened next- pandemic, the wedding was postponed, etc. I have been waiting for my flights to get canceled so that I can get my money back, but was on tenterhooks because I've read that Spain is opening up to tourism again on July 1. (My trip was for the 2nd-9th of July.) I received a couple different emails detailing flight changes, but that was it. I opened my email today to a letter from Condor (one of the airlines I'd booked with) saying that the flights were canceled and that I am to receive flight credit equal to the booking price I paid.

I'd like to get my actual money back, because $3,000 in cash now would help me a helluva lot more than $3k in credit to a specific airline for a trip that I will be unlikely to take within the next year.

**Can anyone offer advice?** I don't travel much and have never been overseas, so I'm uncertain what to expect when I call. If it matters, I booked the trip through Google Flights and all emails received have been through Condor.

I still live at home because I’m about to graduate and couldn’t afford moving out as a student. It’ll probably be another two years before I can afford to move out, and I feel so shit about it. 

I really long for my own space, to be able to leave the house without being asked a million questions. I can’t shave my legs or wear make up without her thinking I’m going on a date. Even when I say I’m not I can tell she doesn’t believe me. I can’t leave the house after 10pm without getting an angry text that I woke her up, what the fuck am I doing and I need to find somewhere else to live if I keep her awake. I really really try to be so quiet but having to sneak out of the house at 20 feels so ridiculous at this point. She will ignore me for days on end too, just for going out and that only keeps me out of the house. Too toxic.

Now she found out I smoke weed. I did stop being sneaky about it, I will admit. I’m not addicted and I’m not dependent on it. It makes me really happy on those nights where I just can’t handle being home because of her, or if the stress from school is too overwhelming. It’s either laying in bed not being able to sleep and be so fucking sad or giggling all night living my best life and then passing out. I can’t explain that to her though. She thinks it’s the way to crime and a ruined life. I’ve been doing it for a couple of years now though and I’m fine. I go to school and I’m planning on getting a job.

I seriously feel like my privacy has been violated. I don’t mind saying “hey I’m going to (friend’s) house! C ya!” Or “I won’t be home for dinner.” Or whatever. It’s the “who is that? How old is he/she? Where does she live? When will you be back? What are you gonna be doing? Where do you know them from?”

She confronted me about the weed and I again was in an interrogation about who I smoke it with, how often, why etc. I get it’s drugs and she’s worried but normally a 20 year old wouldn’t be living at home, it’s because it’s so expensive so live nowadays. 

I don’t know what to do in this situation. Can I even do anything? Her house, her rules, totally fair. But I just want to be entitled to keep some things to myself, to keep some things private. Weed was one of those few things and I just feel robbed somehow.",15Jun2020,1

972,"I am a performer in a large US city whose life has been hit very hard by the coronavirus. I had a bunch of work lined up for this year and obviously none of it is happening. It's hard to imagine the industry of live performance going back to normal where I live for a long time. And on top of this my wife just gave birth to our second child. 

My wife has a good paying job that she never really wanted to do, and doesn't really enjoy very much, but it offers our family health insurance and some financial security. 

All of my extended family is in another country (my birth country) and my wife and I have always half-seriously discussed moving there eventually. We like the idea of raising our children there because they have socialized healthcare, my family is there, and the political climate is less intense, more access to nature, etc. 

The thing is, moving there means we would both change careers completely and likely make far less money for a while. I wouldn't have the same performing opportunities, and my wife would want to do something other than her current job. I would most likely go back to school for a few years while working part time or something. I should say that I love my job, and I have some good footing in the industry. Ideally things would just go back to normal and I could do what I do.

If we did move, we would have a place to live for free with my family while we figure out our new lives, and we would have a strong support system and community. 

Another wrinkle... we live near my wife's family now, and they would be devastated by our moving away, which is something we would all have a difficult time with.

All in all, I know that eventually my wife and I would be able to establish a nice secure life if we moved, but it would be hard, and involve leaving a career that I love. Is the pandemic and job uncertianty enough reason to uproot our family and shoot for something different?

980,"It’ll probably be relevant, I am 24F, diagnosed borderline personality disorder, severe depression and mild anxiety, taking sertraline and quetiapine. I have had CBT and DBT in the past.

As long as I remember I’ve always felt uncomfortable and embarrassed of being happy and showing my enjoyment of things. 

I haven’t celebrated my birthday properly since I was a little kid because the idea of it freaks me out, I can’t go on dates etc because I am so embarrassed of being seen to enjoy myself. I can’t sing along to music in front of people, not family or friends or my boyfriend, I will refuse to watch comedies with anyone because I can’t laugh at them in front of people, it makes me sick with shame and embarrassed to the point where I want to cry. Forget about dancing, exercising, anything. When I am drunk, all of these feelings go away. (I do not have a drinking problem but it worries me that alcohol is THE only thing that stops these feelings)

I’m not a miserable person, I smile a lot, I will laugh at someone’s jokes, I play video games and stuff and I enjoy them. I never claim to dislike things I don’t and I don’t like coming across as boring or like I’m not enjoying myself.

I wasn’t bullied as a kid for having any specific interests and I’ve never been ridiculed for something I enjoy. 

Where does this feeling come from and what the hell is wrong with me?

983,"24 F. Im trying to enlist so I can have a better life. Living with mom.

Dad doesn't want me to enlist or even leave the state to travel or live. I am his only family. He has no reliable friends.

I feel frustrated because I would like to improve my life and stop depending on my mom while at the same time traveling and doing cool stuff while i'm still young. I'm not dating anyone and video games, partying, and weed aren't really my idea of living a fulfilling life (even though I am from a big city).

Im angry that my dad puts so much pressure on me to stay in the city where I wanted to leave since I was 18, doesn't want me to travel or live far away. I think its unfair that he doesn't put any effort into finding friends or a wife, and is making me his only support network. He is therapist averse.

I just feel like I spent so long trying to make my career work and trying to make things work in my home town and having it be unfulfilling in the end. I am speaking to a therapist, was told to tell him of my frustration in detail soon when he has recovered. Ultimately I have already told him I wanted to travel, enlist, etc. We fought verbally about it many times (most recently because of another job option that included traveling that I applied for). If all goes well with recruitment, I will end up leaving for my time. I probably will return home for a little bit afterward. I am very angry that he doesn't support my decision to travel, more angry than I have ever been in my life. (So angry that I wrote a reddit post when Im usually a lurker.)

Years later I'm pretty sure it's unlikely that one guy gets ""falsely accused"" like 5 separate times. I also remember a girl we both knew talking to me about it, how he kissed her without consent and tried to pressure her into sex, and I confronted him but he explained it away.

He definitely tried to do the same thing with me (I'm a transgender guy but obviously he didn't know that and saw me as another girl) when he asked me to our prom and kept trying to get me alone after I repeatedly told him we were only there as friends. I'm not defending myself by saying I was manipulated by him, it's not really a good excuse. I just feel terrible now and I don't want him to continue that behaviour. 

I don't exactly know how to let the world know. Going to the police wouldn't help, I have absolutely no concrete evidence. I've thought about talking to his college.

He'd probably be more into some kind of crafting or city-planning game as opposed to a combat-heavy game (although he likes action enough too).
He's never really played video games before so I don't want to overwhelm him with complicated gameplay. 
I'm also concerned that any game with an online component might have a toxic player base or the players would already be so good that he doesn't feel like he's good enough at it to have a good time.

989,"For clarity, I am a 24 year old female, I'm about 5'4"", and weigh around 250 lbs. As far as my ""appearance"" goes, I'd say most people would see me as clearly overweight, but not morbidly obese. I have ALWAYS struggled with body image issues since I can remember. I was always the chunky girl, and as I went through college I slid from ""chunky"" to just fat. I 100% know that my weight and health are my own doing, and I am the only one who is going to fix it. Just when I try to make the necessary changes, I quickly give up and slide into my old habits. I would say my over-eating is directly connected to my emotional state, and I often use food as a comfort for my feelings, like many people with eating disorders.

About a month ago, I was hit with a fit of migraines on a level of pain I had never experienced before in my life. These migraines lasted for days on end without a moment of relief. I could not walk, see or get out a full sentence without being in crippling agony. 4 trips to the ER (legitimately believing I was dying), some MRI's, and a trip to the neurologist later, revealed I have a condition called Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. Long story short, the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds my brain and spinal cord is the highly pressurized. It's caused me uncontrollable migraines from hell, that cannot be relieved with even the strongest pain killers.

The condition will likely be something I deal with the rest of my life, but at least for now is being very well managed by my neurologist and eye doctor. I am on medications that will keep me stable and healthy, and as of now, I have yet to get a single headache or pain from this disorder in about 4-5 days. My neurologist is confident that this is currently under control, and I am ready to get back to a normal life.

The issue is though that I have not had ANY appetite since this whole ordeal began. In almost a month I have had zero thoughts of ""I should eat"" or ""I'm hungry"". No stomach pains, no growling, nothing. Because of how debilitating my condition was at certain points, food was the last thing on my mind. There were times I would go over 24 hours without an ounce of food, and have zero conscious desires to eat anything. My boyfriend (27M) noticed right away, and tried his best to make sure I've was eating regularly (memory loss from pain killers made it hard to remember the last time I ate). But now that seemingly EVERY OTHER symptom has gone to rest, I'm still noticing I have no drive to eat food. And it's not just that I'm not hungry, part of me gets grossed out by the idea of making myself eat. I have yet to confess this to my boyfriend out of shame.

I KNOW that this is bad. Loss of appetite can be a symptom of something more serious, and I SHOULD talk to my neurologist about this before my next follow-up in a month. But the little voice in the back of my brain is ecstatic over what the lack of appetite has done to my weight. I have lost \~15lbs since this started. I KNOW that's NOT healthy, but I cant stop thinking about how, this is doing to me what I've been failing to do over the last 10+ years I've tried to get my weight under control. 

My logic for staying quiet is NOT rational, but eating disorders are not rational either. I feel like such a pathetic loser for even thinking of not saying anything.",15Jun2020,1

I was just afraid if I said anything to her this would happen and so I just tried to hide it and it was an innocent mistake, this happened on Thursday and today I showed her what was on the app and both showed nothing people matched with me but I didn’t have the app when they did nor did I say anything, like nothing and now she’s saying I could have deleted the messages or something and everything, like I love her so much but I showed her nothing even went down and if it was when we were together, it just would have been me trying to feel better about myself because I’m ugly, but it wasn’t when we’re together because I’m not an asshole who would ever cheat on her.

I think she’s just trying to leave at this point because I’ve done everything I can to try to apologize and go outta my way to show her that I didn’t cheat, I know she’s mad because I told her how hard it would be for me to be with her because she thinks I cheated and that i don’t want her to retaliate and I want there to be trust and she said something and my response was then get the fuck outta my life not because I meant it just because I couldn’t live my life thinking she would wanna be with someone even though she doesn’t trust me and hates or if she left me because of someone she  doesn’t understand and like it was a complete accident.

When we called his family they all had their phones off as well. Days later we went to his home and one of his relatives opened the door and just told us everything is good with him and that he will come back the day after. Later on he his mom and others from the family went down where we were standing and told us that their phones are off because one is broken, the other one is being fixed and etc. Then they said that our friend and his father went to his country for an emergency (with the car) and that their phones must be off or something. 

They said they haven't spoken to him but they already said he will come back today (how did they know if they didn't call?) and they also said that he will call us the day after. Also we checked the borders and they are closed so it's impossible that he went there. The next day came and nothing from our friend.

They have amazing chemistry, share many interests, and are comfortable around each other. Bea and Jeff bought a house and moved in together last month. However, a few months ago, she found he was talking to another woman. 

Bea unlocked Jeff's phone. I'm not sure why - I think she'd gotten it into her head that something was suspicious - and she found texts from him to this woman, saying ""I want to give you the d*ck"". They'd been messaging for a few months, and then they just stopped talking around March time.

Bea decided to let it go, as she was afraid to admit she'd unlocked his phone, and there was no more talk of cheating. Yesterday, however, she messaged me to say that it had happened again. Jeff was once again talking to another woman, this time with messages like ""are you horny?"" or ""do you have any new toys or outfits?"" 

She doesn't want to confront him about this, for a few reasons. One: she knows she would have to admit to unlocking his phone, with no other reason than ""I was feeling insecure, and I saw you texting a woman when we were sat together"". Two: they just got a house together. It would make things so much more complicated to break up now, especially seeing as she wouldn't be able to afford the bill or mortgage payments by herself. Three: she loves him. She doesn't want to risk losing a relationship with someone who understands her more than anyone else, and she doesn't believe she'll find anyone else.

1005,"Please forgive me in advance because this post may seem like more of a rant up front but there some great points for discussion that I'm genuinely curious about getting opinions on.

For context, ever since I was a little kid I knew that one day I wanted nothing more than to have a beautiful wife, our own home and perhaps a couple kids. Never was I that ""normal"" child who dreamed of one day being a doctor or owning my own business or winning the lottery but rather that I found the thought of being with someone who actually liked me for me and not what I had to be very comforting. Everyone has different goals but mine just never happened to be about worldly things. Fast Forward to 2020 when I'm in my late twenties, I'm starting to question whether or not it's actually possible to find a non-superficial relationship. 

For centuries now humans have lived by the hypergamy principle in which a person of lower class or worth (usually women) will get married to someone of higher worth or value. This is exactly what I don't want which is for someone to feel more attracted to me because of what kind of job I have or where I sit on the social status leader boards. 

Some of the latest data shows that 40-50% of all marriages in the United States end in divorce (all for varying reasons of course) and this is what scares me the most of about monogamy; the thought of never being good enough for someone in the long term. You get married and take vows to love and honor this person until death and then 5 years later are filing for divorce because of an infidelity, financial problems, or simply just become bored or ""grow apart"" from your current partner. 

You would think that with women becoming more independent and self sufficient now a days in the workforce more would be inclined to marry for true love and companionship rather than monetary gain like we used to see in previous generations. This still holds true today in my opinion though unfortunately where the bar continues to raise and dating has become increasing harder for men, especially in one of the worlds most popular dating avenues today with dating apps. We're taught all our lives to never judge a book by it's cover but swiping right on covers is all we seem to do. 

My parents have been married just about 30 years now but were probably happy for only about 10 of those years. Now heading into their early 60s soon, they admit the main reason they stay together is because they need the other to live financially.

Currently as of today I still struggle and am personally confused about what I want in regards to a relationship. Despite being very confident about who I am as a person, the thought of sinking into the loop of falling in and out of love with different people is not very appealing to me. I'm looking for something of substance where we support each others passions and projects, something where we take turns driving and paying for meals, a give and take 50/50 relationship where it isn't about how tall someone is or what kind of career the person has. Just the thought of finding someone who wants to lay out on the front lawn and look up at the stars one night is probably the most intriguing thing I could ever ask for, not because looking at stars is particularly fun in itself but because the person you are doing it with is what makes it fun. 

Is something like this even possible to find today?

1008,"Some background to help. My girlfriend has some friends she’s had since freshmen year of highschool. A two of them, I too have been friends with them at varying times. My gf went through trauma with some of her exes through freshman to winter break 2019. I am now with her and lets just say, these friends have been rather mean, during and before this. They yell at her and she doesn’t even do anything wrong. And when she was being abused they were still assholes, it just pisses me off having learned of this. My gf has done so much for them and yet... she gets yelled at and in a abusive friendship with theses two. But as of recently there was an event that pushed this off the edge. They would make her cry when schools were still in and I would have to deal with it, and help her, it bothers me to see people being such assholes. And they did nothing during her abuse, not to mention that she has had some good times with concerts with them, but they just get to be assholes. Back to the edge pusher, her and I had been 3 months apart and didn’t get to do anything together, then a little more than a couple days after my wisdom tooth removal, I got to go see her, one of the happiest moments in my life. But as of recently I have gotten go out with her and do stuff together. And so we noticed something before this that was irritating, anytime my gf would bring me up to her friends she would get yelled at, for no reason. But on a social media she decided she would post stuff with us cooking together and her friends blew up. They told her they hated her and also that they hate being second favorite, and that she should have picked them over me. But she can only see one person really close... because the virus and also she has an autoimmune which one the friends is galavanting across the state and into other states, and doesn’t even believe in either the virus or autoimmune disease. The other is just angry about it too, despite doing stuff with the other friend and going out. They blamed her more on their chat and I had to help her bc they were being mean. What should she do? They’ve been mean for quite some time and they get more unhappy when I am involved, but when she was being abused they didn’t give a care. Just what should she do?

I'm  going back to school but having a difficult time deciding what to do.  The first is a Doctorate of Strategic Leadership program and the other is a MBA program. They're at different schools. Both schools are  accredited. I had the thought to pursue the Doctorate now. Then pursue the MBA  and try to get my employer to assist in the cost.

What  would y'all do? Doctorate then MBA? MBA then Doctorate? Possible to do both  programs at the same time? Neither? I've had a few comments that I should pursue Organizational Leadership instead of Doctorate? I think it would be difficult to do  both programs simultaneously due to financial aid considerations. Any  help is appreciated!",15Jun2020,1

I have thought about talking to my parents about this, but I don't want to create a fuss, I don't even know how they would help me...

Second, I have thought about talking to a professional, but they wouldn't know how it feels. Sure, they are trained to talk to people. But just by reading books can’t make them fully understand what Iam going through. And I don't need to hear empty words like 'it will be ok' or 'just give it time'.",15Jun2020,2

I would go into his office two times every month for trouble or mIsBeHaViNg and he would be very upfront and honest with me which I liked and respected but I have signs of adhd and don’t have it diagnosed yet. I was in class and I was talking while the teacher was ( this was like the 5th time I get very panicky and anxious without noise ) and I was sent to the office and we talked and he asked me if I was on meds and NOT to tell my parrents he asked me that I was shocked for a moment regains sanity and said no I’m not. I told my parents after I moved and I would always panic if people would day be quiet or something like that and think that I should be on meds and I am behind other kids because I’m not liked by many people because of my hobby’s like Pokémon and skylanders.

1022,"Each day is the same.

I wake up around ten in the morning, eat my breakfast, then go back in bed. I stay in it for around one or two hours ; I scroll endlessly on Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. I listen to some music before I ""start"" my day. I make my bed and sit on it for the rest of the day, unless I need to go eat, clean myself ect. I play games, read stories, listen to more music. Before I know it, the night is falling and the day already ended. The next morning, everything starts again. And so it does the next day, and the next one, and the next week.. and it never stops.

I do not have any real reason to wake up in the morning. I don't have a job ; I applied to many, got as much refusals. For them, I'm too inexperienced, my profile isn't what they are looking for. I don't have friends ; the last ones I had were those I last saw when I finished school at sixteen. Since then, I have been by myself, with the only company of cats and a mother. I don't even know how to open up to new people in real life anymore ; how am I supposed to approach them, to befriend them enough so they want to see me again ? Would they even accept to see me again ? I am not one of these interesting, mysterious, pretty girls who attracts people by their attitude and their cleverness.

So I just continue to sit on my bed, hoping for a better life, for a chance to make one by myself. But it never comes. Each day is similar to the one before. Each mornings brings me weariness, each nights brings me sadness. I imagine in my head scenarios where my life isn't like the real one ; in these dreams, I am not me. I'm not a pathetic person with no self-discipline, no motivation, no joy in her life. In my dreams, I have love, I have friendships, I have travels and beauty. 

I do not wish to hurt myself. As bad as this text sounds, I do enjoy to live. I enjoy discovering new songs, playing to my favorites games, watch tv shows and movies ect. I just.. I don't know. It's like my mind feels like the life I have isn't made for me ? And as much I try to change that, nothing does change. Year after year, my life has been the same as before.

1024,"Hello fine people of reddit. We all know that Father’s Day is coming up. And I’ve been debating on posting this story. But I need help with this. 

My dad hasn’t been in my life, but I know him. I’m 20 turning 21 in 2 days and I can probably count the amount of times I’ve interacted with my father on my hands. He rarely calls me. And I feel like I have to start majority of our conversations. I’ve tried reaching out when I was younger (like 18), and it worked for a little. I found out that he got married and I met his wife. But that kinda just faded out. And we really haven’t talked like that since. 

I called him, sometime in early 2020 like January. And found out his age, that he has siblings, and his birthday and I told him where I worked. It was like a 5 or 6 minute phone call. That I stressed over bc I wanted to try to reconnect and ask a bunch of different questions. But I couldn’t really bring myself to say anything other than that. Fast forward to last week. He calls me to ask if I was okay bc of all the riots near me. And that was it.

I’ve really been debating on trying to reconnect with him. Bc I want to know about my father. I’m hurt that I dont really have that relationship to lean on whenever I need it. And I really want my future kids to know their grandfather. But I also have a anger towards him. About not being in my life for basically 21 yrs and having to see my mom go through shit with no help. Also another thing that I can’t wrap my head around is that I’m not his only kid. I have 3 sisters and a brother by him. And He has been in all of there life’s, but for some reason I’m the one he barely talks too.

He always comes over and helps me, and he remembers my code number to get my rewards when I go to the counter without me saying it. I only go in once every couple weeks so I think this means something. We joke a lot and I do honestly think he is into me too. 

But he hasn't asked me out is the thing. And I dont feel comfortable making the first move. But I know that he doesnt know if I'm single or not, and I'm too afraid to ask him if he is seeing someone. I also don't want to overstep because I've been hit on so many times at work and I know how it feels to be stuck there, especially if you're not interested.

So I need some advice. Do I just wait for him to make the move? I don't want to slip my number to him like we're 14 ffs.  But I dont want to push. I'm kind of old school and feel like the man should pursue, but I mean I'm not getting any younger either lol. The last guy I liked I waited too long (like over a year) and he started seeing someone else about 6-8 months ago. So I dont want that to happen again either.

But we both seem to be really into the outdoors and have a similar sense of humor. Plus I mean let's be real, he is so fine lmao.

So I need some advice. 

Also something to keep in mind: I can be kind of bold in my responses to certain things, but not aggressive when it comes to hitting on someone, unless I'm pretty drunk. Lol. Also people have told me that I look unapproachable and that i look like I think im better than everyone (I dont though, which is the shitty part....) so I half wonder if he thinks that when he sees me but I'm nice to him?

Shortly after that, I receive a reply to only me saying “then why did you?” My response: “to let everyone else know. There are 1000 people in that distribution list, and I wanted to try and assist and avoid any issues. With respect, please refrain from the snarky responses - I’m trying to work. Thanks!”

1038,"Hello and thank you for reading. So a bit of background. My mother and my brother have always had a little bit of a rocky relationship (not extremely bad just a bit strained now and then). This went on for a long time. Him and I have been frustrated some times with the things our Mom says to us but we have generally ignored it. Him and I were never close, not hostile just we are separated in age so we never really had much in common but we never fought with each other.

Anyways He had moved back home briefly after he lost his job as small ship captain but he got a new job fairly as a computer tech, saved up some money and left home to the east coast to be a ships captain again (got a good job to). He was living on the east coast after he left home (about 5 states away from our Mom). This was late 2016 when he left home for the final time. I'm living in another state so I just spoke to him and my Mom during this time. 

He left home and every thing seemed fine. He flew in to visit me during the holidays along with my Mom driving in. We had Christmas together in 2018. Every thing seemed fine. Then in early 2019 he just stopped talking to her. Would not answer her phone calls or text. Emails sent him would go unanswered. Gift cards sent to his email would go unopened. Emails or calls from me would also be ignored. Now here in 2020 you cant even call his phone number anymore, ""Call can not be completed"" and all that. Things sent to the address he had last given her is no longer a valid address. So no way to send anything or contact him (nobody else in our extended family can contact him either). Some of his mail arrived at Moms place like a storage unit expiring (he had prepaid like a three year lease). Well Mom has been worried sick since it seemed like something happened to him. He does a lot of sailing of various boats away from the coast so a number of people think some thing has happened to him since its like he dropped off the face of the earth.

Cue just last week. Where I was able to get in contact with him through Steam. I had been sending him messages begging him to contact our mother and just tell her hes alive. Well he finally answered me. He is indeed alive and well but he has informed me that he doesn't ever want to talk to her. While it was through typing his words had a very really edge to them. He wants nothing to do with her and has no intention to speak to her again and never wants to meet her again. Not for a particular reason he just seems to be done speaking to her. And he had a real finality to his words.

So my question then becomes do I talk to my Mom about this? She would fly to his last known location and start searching if all this crazy stuff was not happening. Shes worried sick about him but how do I tell her that he wants nothing to do with her and even hates her? Do I say nothing? If I do say hes alive then how do I answer her follow up question of why he can not be contacted. Thank you very kindly for reading.",15Jun2020,1

1041,"There’s this guy who I’ve been friends for a while. We flirted a lot. I told him repeatedly that I didn’t want to commit to anything since we live very far apart and that I don’t want to date him. However it kinda turned into an almost relationship and we even said the l word a few times, but I still told him it can’t be serious, because I don’t date long term. Eventually he had an outburst and angry texted me about how jealous he was and that I’m an attentionwhore etc, and blocked me. I felt really guilty that I’d led him on.

About a month later I added him again to try to get some closure on the whole thing. We talked for a bit and he was ok but said about how everyone seems to leave him and that he still has feelings for more, and so stupidly of me said I still kinda feel the same way but don’t want to date someone on another continent. (As soon as I said that I realised I was accidentally leading him on and stopped).

Anyway I stopped being the first to message because I was so worried I would hurt him and he isn’t very mentally stable (he thinks he might have BPD), so I was worried he would hurt himself and then I would be responsible. Anyway since I never was the first to message, he eventually stopped messaging.

Now I feel bad, like I’ve left him when he cared about me. I’m debating whether I should message him, but I donmf want to make things worse. I just want closure, to know he’s ok and that he doesn’t have any bad feelings about me.

I probably sound like such a cunt. I know I made mistakes but I didn’t mean to hurt him. Should I message him and try to still be friends (to get closure), or should I leave it how it is?",15Jun2020,1

- After coming out of a toxic relationship of 2 years, I was depressed, overweight, and broke af. After suffering for so long, I decided to whip my life around. Now that I am a few months into my self-improvement journey, I feel the great benefits of the actions I took. 
- I can be timid and slightly awkward, but once I get comfortable around others, my personality is  joyful and laid back.
- I truly try to treat everyone with respect and kindness and to keep an open mind. Mental health is something that I cater to on a daily basis. 
- Others describe me as creative, strong-willed, and accepting. 
- I have a dry-ish sense of humor.
- I’ve lived in many places in my life, both in and out of the US (I currently reside in the US).
- I love spending time with friends and family, traveling, and making someone smile.

1048,"My boss mentioned to one of the coworkers that I always seem really bored/distracted during our meetings. 

I’ll admit, I am. Since COVID, we’ve had daily meetings everyday on zoom. There’s no agenda and usually it’s just my boss complaining about one thing or another. Or essentially having a conversation with one person on the call and the topic doesn’t pertain to anyone else on the call. We have a really casual environment in general so I just slipped into a bad habit of answering emails during the “meeting” or just kinda zoning out. All my coworkers agree these daily meetings are excessive and kind of a time waster. One of them has asked if we could make them every other day since we don’t have much to talk about (like I said, were a pretty casual group). 

My boss said something to my coworker and then they told me. I feel badly that my boss didn’t address it with me. 

Should I just be more attentive in meetings and look for ways to speak up? Should I apologize? 

If he does ends up addressing it with me, what should I say? Just sorry &amp; I won’t let it happen again. 

I do feel really badly about it having been so obvious that I tuned out.",15Jun2020,0

1053,"Worried a tinder match might be stalking me online?

Hi all, 
I’m writing this because I’m freaking out at the prospect of this happening. 

I had made a tinder, matched with a guy who I only exchanged a few sentences with, not enough to establish anything except where he worked since it was visible in his profile. I did not share any of my own information. It was a public halloween event. I deleted my account only an hour later after making it and didn’t think anything of it. I had decided to follow the Halloween event on my instagram since I had been there in the past and was a fan. About two weeks later (yesterday) I got a follow request from that event. I found it odd because they only follow about 100 people, have over 1,000 followers and I have a private account with a very low (20) follower account. I’m becoming nervous that this request was sent by that match.  I denied it and blocked the account. 
 
Today I also received a random person add me on Snapchat, from quick add. I’m thinking this one is more of a coincidence, but it freaked me out too. 


Am I overthinking things?? Or am I valid for being pretty freaked out right now? 

Any advice would really help, I’m generally an anxious person and this gave me a panic attack last night.",15Jun2020,1
1054,"My grandmother has met a ""man"" on an online dating app. The scammer is using a fake online profile and pretending to be romantically interested. Shes very lonely and this man or group of scammers is taking advantage of her. Me and others have tried to convince her that this person is not real and that they will eventually ask for money, which they did. We literally told her it was coming and it happened (luckily she was aware enough to not send any). Even after that shes holding on and allowing herself to be lead deeper into this situation by talking with this person each day. The scammer pretends to be a man from the southern united states and talks to her for an hour or so each morning. I have gone to the police with this (in Canada) and they advised theres nothing they can do since technically the would be scammer has not yet broken any laws, which is true.

What I want to know is how I can prove that this man is fake, or prevent any money from being stolen. I do not believe my grandma is in the best of mental health either, although it doesn't appear to be too serious yet but it certainly is a factor.

Its been suggested to request a video call - my concern here is that the man in the profile actually is in on it, which would basically destroy our chances of proving to my grandmother that hes a fraud",15Jun2020,1
1055,"hi guys sorry this is long but can someone please give me advice on how to feel better about myself. recently i’ve been starting to love myself more by working out, taking care of myself, etc. but i always get these moments when i suddenly think about all my past relationships and a wave of depression just hits me. i feel weak and numb and just sad.. so long story short: my first relationship was in high school. it lasted 6 months but he was my first love, even though he treated me like crap. for example, he would yell at me, be extremely touchy with other girls in front of me, force me to go to restaurant just to be like “oops. i forgot my wallet” etc. he ended up dumping me because i got upset everytime he’d flirt/be touchy with other girls. it took me so long to get over him, even though i honestly deserved better. fast forward a year and a half later, i met my second boyfriend. we dated from high school to college and that lasted 1.5 years. he yelled at me as well sometimes and everytime he made me upset, he would never try to solve the problem. he’d just be like “oh ok sorry” and go to sleep. he’d never try to comfort me, so a lot of times after we fought, he’d never talk it out with me. he’d just go to sleep, and i would go to bed crying. during valentine’s day, christmas , birthdays, he’d be like UGHHHH and think it’s such an inconvenience to make time for me or buy me a small gift or even write me a card. (which i don’t mind about materialistic things, but at least make time for me is the least u could do) but i loved him too much so i stayed with him. then he started not making time for me anymore, because he was “busy” . but he spends days hanging out with his friends and these random girls. he couldn’t even make 30 mins for me. everytime we called it felt like a chore for him. we didn’t hang out in almost a month because he was “busy” even though he was hanging out with other random girls (who aren’t even his friends). i got mad over this so i called him crying, and he broke up with me over the phone that night. i was extremely hurt, i stopped eating, and i had upcoming exams and didn’t do well on them. i was in my second semester of college and was already struggling with mental health due to stress. fast forward a few months later, this guy started chasing me. at first i was being extremely careful because i did not want to be left again. but he kept showing that he was super interested, and he would always tell me the right things, be extremely sweet to me, text back fast, (just did things all my exes never did for me). i slowly started liking him, and we agreed that we were exclusive and not talking to anyone else. he would call me and we would spend hours on the phone talking at night. fast forward a month after talking to him, he suddenly ghosted me one day and i found out he had a gf? don’t know if they were together the whole time we were talking but i was extremely hurt, again. i just don’t know why i keep getting played and keep getting treated like this. it’s so hard to love myself after always being treated like this because it makes me wonder what i did wrong, or if i’m too unattractive or something. now i’m extremely scared of having feelings for someone again because everyone i start liking ends up treating me like garbage and throwing me away when they get bored. everytime i think about the past, i get extremely depressed , wondering why me. why did i have to be treated like this always. everytime i thought i loved someone, they treat me terribly. how do i stop feeling bad about myself?",15Jun2020,1
1056,"My brother(24m) lives with my husband and I. For the most part its been a comfortable arrangement: no fighting, bills paid, privacy respected.

But today he is driving me up a wall. He's off work, watching Netflix in the living room, and I'm doing homework in the kitchen. There's no separation between the rooms so it's been difficult.

He listens to tv and music stupid loud all the time. Normally it isn't an issue because he's either in his room or we're watching things together.

1057,"Hello! I'm a law student who got accepted to their first internship. I'm very invested in human rights, especially LGBTQ+ rights and womens rights. This was the reason I started studying law at the first place but after a couple of years I realized this isn't what I want to specialize in. I'm still and will forever be an activist and advocate for these issues. I'm gender non-conforming and I'm a feminist, I have a minor in gender studies... This is a huge part of who I am and what I believe in- it's not just an area of law that I'm interested in, it's bigger than that. 

Anyways, I've been struggling with finding an internship this summer. A lot firms just don't hire anyone because of the virus and the rest  just don't want to hire me. After 30+ applications and 30+ rejections I've become pretty depressed about this. I'm a very ambitious AND anxious person, so not being accepted for an internship equals to being a failure and a sign that I will never have a job in the future in my mind. I know this doesn't make sense for everyone but this is kind of how I measure my self-worth. This week, finally, I got accepted to a firm. They specialize in intellectual property, competition law etc. and I really want to see if this can be an area I can work in. I was pretty excited to receive the news. This is when I started to do some research about the lawyers that work there (I didn't do this before because I found them through my schools network and didn't feel the need to). Everyone that works there seems fine, they're from good law schools, some of them have phds and the firm has international connections. 

BUT then I found the founding partners' twitter and he is openly homophobic and a misogynist. He has tweets that claim womens' rights are ruining our families, Russia has great laws about LGBTQ+ and we should learn from them (which I'm from a pretty conservative country where LGBTQ+ rights already kind of don't exist), rapists should be let out of jails if they have a kid with the victim (this is a common belief here because child marriages are also common and once again very conservative country) and all sorts of stuff like this. This guy is everything that I'm against and I'm pretty sure I'm everything that he is against. I have no idea why he wants to hire me even though my CV is FULL of womens rights related activities. 

On one hand I feel like if I accept this internship I would be betraying myself, but on the other hand I feel like I'm making a big deal out of just this guys' tweets and a stupid 1 month job.  I despise every one of his views but this will be an online program where I will never see him (except for a final interview) and just complete online tasks for them that are related to energy law, competition law etc. (so not even human rights). What would you do? Am I being stupid for caring too much about an employers views or is working for someone like him disrespectful to myself and things that I stand for? Even though it's just an internship, as I said, it's a huge deal for me to do one and this decision is really really frustrating for me.",15Jun2020,1

1059,"Hi, guys. I need some advice, fast. 

I'm currently finishing my graduation and to do so I have one last paper to deliver, my traineeship report. I can either deliver it by the 22nd or 23rd of this month and defend it in July or I can deliver it on the 30th of this same month and defend it in September.

Here's the thing, I'm in no way close to having it done, but I told my mentor I could have it done by this Wednesday (stupid, yes, I know) so she could review it, correct it and then have me send it to the coordinators on the 22nd or 23rd; and now I'm kind of facing the consequences of that stupid statement. I have a lot to correct and review and I haven't even started writing some other important subjects. I thought that if I pulled an all nighter and worked on it throughout the entire day of tomorrow (for me it's Tuesday) I could have it done. However, I'm not so sure anymore. 

Do you guys think I should call and inform her and defend it in September or can I, in some way, pull this off? 

I chose not do defend in September, because basically everyone is doing it and I didn't want to be giving too much work to my mentor during the Summer nor did I want to be preparing for it during the summer either. Just really wanted to get it done. Guess I fucked that up. :-(",15Jun2020,1
1060,"I understand it is normal to have a libido, but I am **really** sick of this now. I have had enough. I now can't function at work because the libido is there continuously.

It feels much more than just chemicals in the human body. It feels like a powerful, independent force that flows through every part of me. I feel it on the surface of my skin, in my organs, in my blood. I just want it to leave me alone. I feel like I am enslaved by it and kept in shackles. Every day the cycle repeats. I've been single for 3 years and very happy on my own. I am very career driven and doing so well. All I want is to devote my energy to my career, but the libido is starting to cause serious distress in my life. It's significantly affecting me thinking, focus and ability to concentrate. Because it is summer now, there are at least 4 to 5 times during the day that I realise I must not stand up, so I have to remain sitting in the chair, typing for another 90 seconds to avoid a nightmare scenario. It's making me miserable because it's too frequent.

This is the next problem. I am now also being kept awake at night by the same one dream. I dream that I am walking in a park, holding a woman's hand (not anyone I know), and then she hugs me. Then a marriage ceremony between us happens. Then in the dream a sudden surge of enormous sexual energy floods my body and it wakes me up. Then the effects are sill there, and I am kept awake for hours. This dream keeps happening though, and it's a different, unknown woman I'm dreaming about every time. But the scene plays out the exact same like a tape on loop. I don't care about dreams. It's the insomnia I experience after. No other dream types keep me awake.

This is the most intense it has ever been in my life. I always heard that a man's libido is the highest when he's 18, but this is not the case for me. I'm no spring chicken either. I'm 33, and a perfectly healthy male. I have a fit body, have an excellent diet, and recently went for a doctor's assessment, yet test results said I have no health problems at all.

Is there any medication someone can recommend that will drastically reduce libido, but not result in any horrendous side effects? I do still want to remain healthy. I was about to buy one product but a friend warned me it gave him some insomnia and one other nasty problem. Any scientific responses and medication recommendations will be sincerely and greatly appreciated. There's obviously a chemical/physiological imbalance occurring in me, but I can't calculate what the source is. i am just looking to take some corrective action.",15Jun2020,1

But I want to be honest, I really do miss her. I don't really know what I want myself.

Hey guys. A bit of a backstory before I get into my situation. My (22F) ex-boyfriend (27M) broke up with me around last year after dating for some time (We were pretty serious, we both met each other’s families etc). We broke up bec he was moving away to a different continent and he said it wasn’t going to work out since he doesn’t see himself having a future with me. We ended it on good terms. When he got to the new country he started speaking to me non-stop. Saying he misses me and he still loves me etc. coincidently I got a job in the same country as him, ever since I mentioned it to him, he said we should probably try this relationship again once I’m there. this was post corona so my job has been put on hold. For the past month he’s been saying he’s having a really difficult time because he’s very lonely. He’s been speaking to me less and less ( which I don’t mind because I understand we have our separate lives going on). He called me about two weeks ago, said he misses me , loves me etc but also casually mentioned a lady he works with has a major crush on him, and he laughed it off. He’s been posting lots of stories with her on Instagram - ignoring my messages and calls. Today he told me he’s going to stay over at the same colleague who has a crush on him house and it’s nothing serious, he said he’s only doing it because he feels lonely. Am I right to feel hurt? Or am I overreacting? This man constantly tells me he loves me and wants a future with me and I just feel so stupid because I don’t know if he’s just saying that because he’s bored or lonely. I don’t know if I should just move on and forget about this relationship",15Jun2020,1

Plus he told me he would help me a bit. Instead of helping me he's thought of a new purchase he wants to make, and he so close to being able to buy what he wants again, meanwhile I been working my ass off for months and still not even half way rebuilt from the money I gave him, and he's double what I have saved and has also been able to splurge on other materialistic things.

1070,"I've been struggling with this ever since I started college and almost dropped out completely my first semester over it. I didn't know what I wanted to study, so I defaulted to comp sci because I enjoyed it in high school, but as I got deeper into it I lost all interest or passion for it. After a few more years, that loss of interest extended to college as a whole, and my sense of self worth is basically totally gone. I haven't made a single friend on either campus I've been on, and I can only recall maybe two or three professors I genuinely liked. I feel utterly alone and unable to talk about this with people irl because it's embarrassing, especially considering I'm overdue for a degree and keep failing classes. I don't feel like I have any excuses to explain why I'm doing so badly in college, especially when I did so well in high school. I always got the impression my parents had high hopes for me just because of that, and I don't have the heart to tell them the reality of the situation, and considering it's been 5 years since I graduated high school, any explanation I can think to give just falls flat.

What do I even say to them? I've been straight up lying to them about how progress has been going, and I feel terrible about it and accept that this is a hole I dug for myself, but it's something I've never been able to get myself to do.

1071,"TL;DR: Hi, so I (F14) just found out that my entire family has been saying shit behind my back. They are leaving for the mountains and they invited every family member, but me. They don’t know that I know they are going. I’m not sure what to do? 

So this whole story starts last year when I changed my wardrobe to less feminine clothes. I used to wear a lot of dresses and colors, but now I wear all black. I’ve always known my family had a problem with this and they would occasionally say things like ""you were better before"" or ""it’s just a phase, you’ll grow out of it"". They also hate the fact that I skateboard now. According to them, i’m going to end up doing drugs. My family is a somewhat ""model family"" so I think by me dressing like this, it ruined their image. Although I never thought I dressed bad or went over the top.

My younger cousins started to get really awkward around me. Like I was going to get them in trouble at any moment. I overheard my older cousin (by a year) saying that I was a bad influence to her younger sisters. I’ve never really done anything super bad, but I brushed this off. 

Today my other cousin (let’s call her El) came clean and told me what everyone has been saying. Apparently it’s not just my cousins, but also my aunts and uncles who trash talk me to their kids. They’ve said things like, ""fucksoggysoap dresses lesbian"", ""let’s not invite fucksoggysoap anywhere until she’s normal"", ""fucksoggysoap is a bad influence and going down the wrong path"" and other stuff like that. They also planned a whole trip to the mountains and didn’t tell me.

I do identify as a part of the LGBTQ community, my dad is an alcoholic and I have pretty general issues with my mom. I have struggled with self harm and insecurity since middle school and had my fair share of shitty friendships and bad relationships, but again nothing SUPER serious. I often feel a lot of shame surrounding being “overly sensitive” or “dramatic” because I am VERY sensitive. Especially because both of my parents had very difficult lives, I have a tendency to be very shameful about my emotions.

I feel weak, shallow, and invalid when I get sad about little things. Please note that I am absolutely not asking for pity or anything, I don’t want to come off as pretentious.

\- It's an ASUS laptop of some sort (it says ""SonicMaster"" at the top right if that helps you identify it)

\- The laptop monitor was removed so we connect it to a monitor with a VGA connector

\- The laptop doesn't charge. It's usable, you can turn it on, but it always stays at 0%

1078,"So I've been friends with this girl in high school. She was my only and great friend before I switched schools due to depression. About 7-8 years later weve gotten in touch again through fb. I was delighted when she reached out to me as I was often thinking what shes been up to etc, but couldnt find her. 

Over time however I have realised that she is holding resentment towards me for not reaching out to her (I couldnt find her even tho I tried often, she knew about this). She had her own traumas throughout the years and wished I was there. Eventually I started noticing that she got more joy from my misfortunes, wasnt empathetic etc. Told her friends about things I told her that I clearly asked to stay between us. So eventually I confronted her and we stopped talking for over 6 months. 

She reached out during quarantine and I thought why not, maybe she matured (were 24 now). At first it seemed like she has. She recognised her previous issues and is working on improving them very hard. However recently I've been having a very tough time with my boyfriend, she was there for me. Until things started getting better. When I told her that I talked things out with him and that were ok, instead of being happy for me she started asking me about all the things I was going to tell him but havent yet, as if to shift focus to the negatives. I am getting this insidious vibe again. I feel like I should once and for all cut her out of my life - but I'm worried she would start talking shit to my boyfriend and spreading lies to him and my friends... my relationship with him is still in a fragile state so the last thing we need right now is her interfering.

I don't want to tell him bc i don't want this girl to get hurt bc she's had a crush on him for so long and i think she should get over him. The thing is he had dated two girl in the past few months and none of those relationships lasted for more than 3 weeks and he was the one who broke up with them and he was also the one who confessed his feelings to them first. I talked to him a while ago and he said that he knew they liked him but he didn't like them at all and both confessions were lies! I asked him why he asked them out then and he just said that he doesn't know and he thought he might start liking them while they're dating. I can't tell her this bc he told me to not tell anyone. The main reason i think he's gay is bc he's so into ""yaoi""(gay manga,anime,games,etc) and no one knows about that. He told me bc I'm also kinda into yaoi(i'm a girl btw) and he keeps sending me yaoi games and stuff and he's played all of them soo many times he literally knows everything about those games and mangas. I've somehow indirectly asked him about his sexuality but he always changes the subject with a joke or something. But for instance yesterday we were talking about this yaoi game and he said that he likes this character so much and he said ""he's totally boyfriend material for me"". I don't think that's something a straight person says lol. But i also can't tell her about this bc he doesn't want anyone to know he's into these kinda stuff.

1084,"Some backstory: I'm 18 years old and from New York City. I came back home here to the city from college in March when the outbreak started. My father is the only other person here at the moment. Since he is about 70 years old, he's considered to be the ""at-risk"" population.

A couple of weeks ago, a couple of my friends and I decided it would be nice to play some music outside in a nearby park. We agreed we would always keep at least 5-6ft apart and would all always wear a mask. We also would not be sharing instruments or touching anything other than our own belongings. I thought this would be safe and reasonable since it was outside and we would all be wearing masks. It's also compliant with the guidelines set by the governor. Although our city, New York City, used to be a hotspot, it has become much safer and the cases are going down. 

I've been incredibly diligent and responsible about being safe ever since the outbreak started here. Since my father is in the ""at-risk"" population, I have only gone outside to do grocery shopping once every 2 weeks and only to the park for quick walks. I haven't met with any of my friends or interacted with anyone. I always wear a mask as soon as I step outside, and I don't take it off. When I come back home, I go straight to the sink and wash my hands very thoroughly. 

Here's where the overbearing part comes in. Although I planned the outside music playing 2 weeks ago, my father just said to me now (1 day before we are supposed to play) he's going to call his doctor to see if it is safe for us to play music outside. He says it's because he doesn't want to catch the virus and end up in the hospital. 

I completely understand him not wanting to get the virus. No one does. What I don't understand, however, is why he would just decide this now. When I first told him about the idea to play outside 2 weeks ago, he said it was a good idea and was okay with it. At least a couple times a week, he goes outside to talk with a couple friends in the park and has been doing this regularly. This seems hypocritical to me. 

In all likeliness, he's going to ask me to cancel playing music outside. How do I tell my friends, now that it's one day before we're supposed to play?

My father has always been pretty overbearing. He was the kind of parent who would email all my teachers very regularly through high school to see how my academic performance was. I believe he does these sort of things because he cares very deeply about me and worries a lot. 

He  wouldn't let me play video games or watch any television until high school. Up until then, I could play 20 minutes of computer games a day on his computer. 

He constantly questions my life choices and how I'm preparing for the future. He wants me to ""not waste the summer"" and to figure out a plan before tomorrow about what I'm going to do. He wants me to take online classes through the summer. I had a really difficult time transitioning to online classes for my regular college classes and I don't think I could do it. I already have a remote internship at a small magazine and am working on my 2nd language skills every day. It's not good enough for him. 

I'm already stressed enough about the future without him constantly on my case.

A couple of my close relatives also just died recently, so I'm trying to get through that as well. He doesn't seem to understand how that's affected me. 

Whenever I see my friends interact with their parents in such a friendly way, I think about how different that is from how I interact with my father. Can anyone else relate to this experience?

My question is; how do I deal with this and respond without hurting his feelings? Whenever I kindly and respectfully asked him not to email my teachers or to be so overbearing, he would go to the other extreme and say things like ""ok I won't ever talk to you again"" or ""ok I won't ever ask you about school again"". 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. If you have any clarifying questions, please ask.",15Jun2020,1

1087,"Hi -

My family is pretty dysfunctional and tend to yell at each other all the time. Not only does this make them pretty unpleasant to be around, but this has gotten to my mom pretty bad and now she takes really minor things as a huge problem. I love her, but I don't really know what to do anymore.

For example, I was on a call with friends, and I talked about a situation in which my brother mentioned a license plate with ""hentai"" on it at his college and I had to explain wtf that meant to my mom and how that was pretty awkward, and she then managed to seethe about me talking about it for multiple days straight and make a huge deal about how I was making the whole situation out as her being cringe and embarrassing. She shut down the entire conversation of me trying to clarify it, and said that ""everyone thinks that way about her anyway"". Huh? I tried to make things right but she had nothing of it. She accuses me of hiding things when I tab out on my computer when I walk pass and makes it into a huge deal. 

Everyone is always mad I never spend time with them... but whenever I spend time with them, it becomes this huge passive aggressive shitfight over something extremely minor. They are always angry I care about my friends more than I care about them, but my friends are all reasonable people who don't get angry over such minor things and project all their anger on me.

They then turn it into a whole thing about how useless I am and how I don't do anything for myself... but they baby me so much that I never even get an opportunity to do anything. I would cook, but nobody teaches me or lets me. My bro is 24 and doesn't peel bananas by himself but he doesn't get shit for it when not even I do that. Wtaf?

1089,"I'm not diagnosed with any mental illnesses, nor do I self-diagnose. I just feel extremely disconnected and, well, derealised. I have been for ages now, everything is very blurry.

I told my mom about it for the first time because it just felt like the right moment to let her know what I've been experiencing. Maybe I could get a councillor something, you know? Just some type of help. But, she turned around and told me: ""Wow! You are so lucky, so many people have tried for years to get into that state of mind!"" she then went on to explain some things about astral projection, different dimensions and similar things to those. 

But this isn't ""astral projection"" or whatever. I don't even believe in those things and I never knew she did. I told her it's a horrible experience, I feel like nothing is real, like I'm in a dream. I explained how I can't properly focus on anything, how my reality is distorted and how forgetful I have become, but she stayed stubborn and told me to ""cherish it"" and ""take advantage of it!"".

Honestly, I feel pretty dejected, I guess. I would much rather get professional help, but it doesn't look like I'll be getting that any time soon. (I'm a minor so I need parental agreement to getting any kind of professional help.)

I did try to bring up this topic again since, but it got shut down pretty much immediately. She even told me that she was proud her own child could ""comprehend another dimension"" or something along those lines. What? 

My mom never spoke like this before. Is she becoming delusional? Or is this just a new belief she has adopted? What do I do? 

I've done pretty extensive research on my 'symptoms' and ways to try and fix it myself. I've tried waiting it out, grounding, new hobbies and environments.. but nothing has helped in any way.

I'm not really fond of online therapy (e.g. sites like betterhelp or 7cups) because they seem very amateur and they did not help me at all when I tried them out. I'm aware every person on them is different, however I just generally didn't have very good experiences with them.

1090,"Over a year ago my boyfriend got his licence. I can't remember the context but a while after I spoke to him about drink driving. He comes from a family of moderate - heavy drinkers and it's the type of thing I thought there was a chance he would think little of, having a couple then driving. I think it's completely irresponsible, so I said I wouldn't be happy if he did that. He said ok. 

We went on a trip. Stayed in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. We drove to dinner, got pizza and he got a glass of wine. I lost it. We were practically in the middle of nowhere, and I had no choice but to have him drive me back to the cabin. In the end, long story short, I said I don't ever want to be put in that position again. 

Then we discussed it another time and he said he didn't think about it, but if it was that big an issue he just wouldn't have anything, no big deal to him. Somewhere along the way, weed became part of the agreement. 

All was fine and well, until today. Well things are not fine and well, many issues. But he was off work today. Decided to smoke some. Usually he smokes a little, just for creative inspiration or some shit. Then he got a call and, turns out he met his father, who needed to jump his car for him. He then took the car for a few laps around the block. The block, for context, is in the capital city of my country. It was at least 20 minutes. 

I found out this evening that this is what happened. As far as I'm concerned we're done. I gave fair warning, I would not be with someone who's going to do that, no matter how small. He said he needed to because when you jump a car you have to drive it a while to charge it. Dunno if it's true or not, presumably it is, but his dad was there, he could have driven it no problem.

I don't have a job lined up in my target city (Boston, MA). While I have a competitive resume for many entry-level marketing roles, employers seem reluctant to interview a candidate that isn't already living in the area.

1095,"For some context, im a 14yo girl (but i only just turned 14, so i was 13 for this whole school year im talking about in this post), and i started 8th grade last year. 

So. Let me start fromt the beginning. I played volleyball for 6 years. I quit because the coach was awful, then he quit his job, and the new coach was even more awful (but that's another story lol). So at the beginning of the last school year (8th grade) i had to figure out what to do as a physical activity, bc my parents have always said that me and my brother have to do at least one physical activity (like volleyball, basketball, etc). I started to go to dance classes, because that's a physical activity, and i thought I'd like it (and i had danced for a few years when i was like 8 years old. Also the national dance festival was supposed to be happening this year and i wanted to participate in that). These classes were for my countrys traditional dances (search ""tautas dejas"" on youtube if you wanna see what they look like). all dances (with very few exceptions) are made for 8 pairs of dancers (a pair is a girl and a boy). At the beginning i thought there would be a group for dancers from 7th-9th grade and a group for 10th-12th grade (oh yeah i didn't mention, this is my school's dance group).

 Well, there wasn't a seperate group for 7th-9th grade dancers (probably bc there wasn't enough dancers (cause remember, there has to be 16 - 8 boys, 8 girls)), so we (the 5 girls and 2 boys) were left with this (bc the 10th-12th dancers where the ""main"" dancers and we were apparently just there for no reason):

40mins of just practicing the basic moves with these 2 girls, that were older and came to teach us bc they wanted to be dance teachers and needed experience. The actual teacher hadn't actually arrived yet when we were doing this part. Later on in the year, the girls sometimes just wouldn't show up, or they would show up, but just sit there and we wouldn't actually dance. The girls also just weren't nice. They were quite rude and disrespectful and had this ""we are better than you"" attitude, which just made me hate dance class even more.

Then the actual teacher would arrive. This is also when the 10th-12th graders would arrive. They would practice various dances, but because they were already 16 people, we (the 7th-9th graders) would be left dancing on the side. The teacher would pay no attention to us. This was actually the most fun part, because we would actually dance the dances, not just practice the moves, or warm up. Sometimes, if one of the 10th-12th graders wouldn't show up, bc they were sick or something, one of us would dance in their position. This part would last for around 1h and 20min.

So yeah. I hated this. The classes were on tuesdays and Thursdays and they were the days i hated most.

One of the main reasons i went to the classes even though i hated them, was that this year, the national student's dance festival was supposed to happen. It happens only once every five years, and its awesome (if you want to see what it looks like, search ""skolēnu deju svētki"" on youtube, you should be able to find it). All the dancers (there are thousands of dancers) stay in schools in the capital for a week. You practice the dances every day, and at the end of the week, there's multiple concerts and the whole country watches them. It's super fun. I participated in the last one, and it may have been the best week of my life lol. You stay in a school, in the capital, with all your friends, and you get to participate in this *huge* festival. Its the best.

So, needless to say, i really wanted to participate in this festival again. Remember, all the dances are made for 16 people, so only 18 dancers from one dance group can go to the festival. I hoped so much that i would be able to go. In the end, only one girl from 7-9 graders would be going to the festival, and even though i was really sad it wasn't me, if one of us had to go, it had to be her because she was genuinely the best dancer. That said, i thought the whole situation was really unnfair, because there where people who would be going to the festival, but frequently didn't show up to class, or didn't actually want to dance. Why could they go, but i, who was genuinely always trying to learn and do everything, showed up every time, except when i was actually sick and couldn't go, couldn't? And it also wasn't the case that i was bad at dancing. Sure, i wasn't the best, but i wasn't bad either. Idk i just really feel like it was unfair.

So yeah, I've been talking a lot about this festival and you may be thinking ""hmm, considering all this covid-19 stuff, are large gatherings of tens of thousands of people... Allowed?"" and the answer is... No, they aren't. The festival was canceled, and will be happening next summer instead.

Prepare for some yelling

SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I WENT TO DANCE CLASS 2 TIMES A WEEK, HATED IT SO MUCH, HOPED I COULD GO TO THIS STUPID FUCKING FESTIVAL, THEN WAS REALLY FUCKING SAD WHEN I COULDN'T GO, BASICALLY 2 DAYS OF MY WEEK ALL YEAR WERE RUINED BC I HATED THIS DANCE CLASS. I DID ALL THIS BC I WANTED TO GO TO THAT FESTIVAL. AND THEN ITS CANCELED? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

So yeah i did this for fucking nothing.

So now we get to the part this post is actually about lol. I dont want to continue dancing, as you can probably guess. A few hours ago i got a text in the dancers group chat from the teacher. It said that tomorrow there's a dance class, because we have to start learning some dances for a concert or something like that. There's literally no way im going. I'll make up some excuse. I think my parents will be fine with me not dancing over the summer, because i work over the summer, so i wont have the time or energy to go to dance classes too. 

The problem is, i dont want to dance anymore, even when the new school year starts. I don't want to ruin 2 days of my week for another year, spend 4 hours every week in a dance class i hate, just because there *may* be a chance of me going to this festival. I just won't do it. But i also don't know what I'll do instead of dancing. Right know im thinking ill just go to the gym and won't do a specific sport, but i don't think my parents, especially my dad, will be happy about that. They were already really mad when i wanted to quit volleyball, and i think my dad is still sad that i don't play it anymore. So i think they'll be really angry if i say i want to quit dance too. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my parents or make them sad, but i also really really don't want to dance anymore. Right now my only hope is that all my other extracurricular activities will be happening on the days when dance class will be, so i have a valid excuse for not going anymore. Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this situation? 

Sorry for the super long post, sorry if nothing makes sense. I tried to explain everything as good as i could, but english isn't my native language. Im also sorry for ranting so much. I have just been angry about this stupid dance class for a year and i haven't had anyone to whom i could tell about it. If you read this far, thank you lol

1096,"It’s late I’m currently writing to the abyss which is the internet  because I’ve been really conflicted on this friendship I have......
I always used to excuse this person distant and cold behaviour as being part of their personality but as time has gone on I find myself being a victim of their micro aggressions . The person kinda finds ways to belittle me like trying to make fun and tease my religious beliefs , telling me I’m too naive and  being passive aggressive on text and on group chats we are on. There’s sooo many other things but despite the negatives we have a lot in common and a good friendship.....
It’s just exhausting when that person acts like that because I don’t really retaliate and when I do I’m made to seem like I’m overreacting....my other friends aren’t like this towards me at all........
It’s getting to a point where I feel drained and used and I’m starting to want to keep my distance for that person ....
It would be a shame because me and that person have had many good times and shared many good moments but from time to time I feel undermined by that person...

1099,"I'm a 14 year old female.

I'm currently in highschool (I live in Australia so we don't have middle school btw) and I don't feel like I have enough time on my hands. I have 4 - 6 hours after school to myself that my parents are aware of. I usually do school work then, sometimes I fit in about 30 minutes of entertainment (video games, reading, drawing, ect.) so I still have plenty of time to work, but when I get to bed I feel like I haven't achieved what I wanted to, even though I often do.

I sometimes (ok this is gonna sound real silly) have a little cry when I'm in my bed. Maybe I'm stressed? The loads of work I have and problems with my family and friends just breaks me down sometimes, and I vent it through a good cry. Some people say it's a sign of weakness, and so be it, but to me it's a vent.

After a while I ended up sitting in bed for 15 - 30 minutes and then got up and continued working or playing video games or something, and I would sometimes stay up until 11pm - 1am. I know this is super unhealthy for my adolescent body but I feel like if I don't work more and I get a bad grade I've let myself and my parents down.

Is this normal? Staying up all night? Feeling like I need to cry to feel better? What can I do to fix this? Any time I can fit in more work/give myself time to fix my mental health? Any advice will help honestly.",15Jun2020,1
1102,"I have come to face the reality of it. I can be submissive. I don’t have a lot of confidence at the moment, and whenever I build myself up and feel good about myself, someone on the outside puts it right down, and idk how to defend myself.

Now I’m coming to terms that it’s me not other people. I have to heal myself, but I struggle with defending myself with the people in my life that do think so small of me. I gained 70lbs over the span of 9 years as well and that definitely didn’t help. Also, I’m a 28 year old female. I started to feel like everyone was against me, but I think I am doing it myself.

1103,"Throwaway account because I feel like it's the right thing to do for some reason. 

I don't even know where to start with all of this. It's years worth of small issues just piling on top of themselves to create a big issue now.

I guess I can start with the fact that my family consists of my mom, brother and me (my dad died when I was really young). We live in the house owned by my moms parents. Because of the small size of the house I've lived with the grandparents my whole life while my brother and mom live on a different floor.

I've struggled with anxiety and depression since forever but in 7th grade of middle school it got really bad and it just kept getting worse. I had no motivation in school and could see no future for myself because I was convinced I would kill myself before I turned 18. For this reason I had nothing that I really tried with. There was just no point in it i guess. My grades were shit, I was failing subjects left and right and my gpa was always around 3,5 (the failing and lowest grade was 1). I got into high school and my grades stayed the same because the teachers just made it extremely hard to get a grade higher than a 3. 

2018 was the year when I struggled the most. I tried to end it and I failed. I didn't tell many people about it but I tried to change my ways after that. I stopped self harming, stopped taking bromazepam pills that I kept stealing from wherever I could get them and worked on the addiction I developed. 

2019 was a hard year too. I was extremely lonely, the grandparents started doing fucked up shit and became extremely abusive to me mentally. 

I had recently accepted my sexuality and met a girl. She made me want to try and had given me a reason to live. (Not out to my family, just to my closest friends)

2020 quarantine with my family was a huge issue. Tensions between my grandparents and I were huge with constant fighting for dumb shit because they were just bored out of their minds and they used their energy to make my life a living hell. My gf was there for me as much as she could be over text. I distanced myself from my family as much as I could and spent all of my time in my room eating only my own food and living separately for the most part trying to avoid any contact with them and they still keep putting me in fights that I'm not even a part of.

I was working really hard on getting my grades up to at least 4.0 gpa but I couldn't get it over 3.90 because my teachers are assholes just for the fun of it and not just to me so i'm not saying this because i'M An eDgy tEeNaGeR aNd NoBoDy UnDeRsTaNdS mE. I KNOW I worked my ass off to get my grades up and it still wasn't enough.

I recently started thinking seriously about college and how to move out of my country to go to one but the fact that I had no money meant I probably couldn't even afford college where I live currently. With my grades I can't get into college here for free. My country isn't a part of EU so free education isn't a thing if I go to another EU member country. I started looking for a job with the hopes of getting my drivers licence knowing that I can't work during school (to be able to live alone) because my school hours wouldn't allow that. 

My gf and I broke up recently which fucked with my mental health a lot and on top of that now the grandparents are threatening to sell the house which would force my mom, brother and me out into a small cheap apartment with barely enough to put food on the table. 

This would take any chance of me even going to college or creating a future worth living away from me because I'd need to figure out a way to just move out and be on my own and out of their way quickly and with a year left of high school I'd probably need to drop out to be able to work full time. 

My mom is putting all the blame on me when I'm not even the cause of the fights. She and my brother just wont listen to what I'm saying and I feel alone. There was an instance during quarantine where I literally got threatened and lunged on with an axe by my granddad and got the police called on me (because apparently i'm causing family violence here?) and everyone is overlooking that and wanting me to act like everything is fine. 

I'm falling back into suicidal thoughts and I can't see a future for myself again. I'm afraid that soon it's all gonna be too much and I will just OD on some pills or something just to be able to finally stop worrying about everything.

Idk what kind of advice i'm asking for here, I just need to get it out and maybe someone may be able to just convince me that everything will somehow be fine or something.",15Jun2020,1
1104,"I'm stuck between a bit of a rock and a hard place and I need any advice I can get. My mother in law moved in with my fiance and I right around the time this whole COVID thing broke out. 

She has a terrible history with us, and has lived with us twice before, and both times she ended up moving out when I feel like she should have been thrown out LONG prior. Long story short, she has a history of drug use, and when she lived with us, all she would do is sleep on the couch, lock herself in the bathroom for hours (obviously nodding off) and on several occasions got busted bringing people into our house when she thought she wouldn't get caught. Only reason I didn't tell her to pack her shit is because my finance just KNOWS that she can ""help"" her mom. She wants a better relationship and she is willing to overlook some bullshit to try to be a positive figure in her mom's life. I get it, but it puts me in a shitty situation constantly. 

Now to the current situation. Her mom was doing fairly well with us up until about 2 weeks ago, at which point my fiance thought she saw someone else in the room we are letting her stay in. First she tried to lie about it and joke it off, but when my fiance pushed, her mom told her that that there was someone in her room and it was her friend who walked her home because it was late when she came home. Now we are usually a very open home, and we don't mind you bringing someone over, but when you're obviously hiding them...well..there is usually a reason you lie about having someone over and it's not usually because they're a good influence. So we put up a camera on her door. Motion activated, only checking it when she comes in between midnight and 6am. Not trying to infringe on her privacy, but needing to know if she's bringing people over under our noses.

We had the camera up for a few days and nothing happened, so I stopped checking it at all thinking (hoping) she just fucked up that once and that was it. Fast forward to this weekend. We moved the camera to our bedroom so we could keep an eye on our puppy while we were out shopping and taking care of errands and whatnot. We checked the feed a few times while out to make sure the pup was doing okay, but nothing interesting. We get home and I'm hanging out in the room and I decide to check the motion recordings because it was going off the whole time we were gone and I wanted to see what my pup was up to. Disheartened to see my mother in law ON VIDEO spending nearly 30 minutes literally taking tool after tool out of my tool box and trying to pick the lock on my finances money box. HER DAUGHTER'S MONEY BOX. 

Now, I have to be honest. The shit she has put us through, I was already wanting her out. So I almost should have been happy to see this. But it legit almost made me cry. I got myself together and I told my fiance and I know it hit her the same, but she was just like ""We have a date night tonight, I don't want to stress about it now, anyway I took the money out so whatever she got wasn't more than $10."". So we kind of went about our night, but it definitely put a damper on things. It's hard not to think about it. 

That was Saturday. It's Monday. We haven't talked to her mom, and we don't know how. I want to kick that fucking bitch the fuck out of our house and never see her theiving ass again, but my fiance still wants to help keep her on track and try to ""figure it out"". But people don't change, they just get better at lying. 

I have considered cutting things off over this. I have a hard time seeing our lives going anywhere good if she continues to let her mom walk all over her. All over us. Because if I accidentally caught her stealing from us after one day of having the camera up....she has stolen from us before. MANY times before. But it sucks because she's my fiance, I obviously love this girl, but I just see this shit happen time and time and time and time and time again, and all I can think is, well, are you just going to let us get taken advantage of until we really get fucked over? 

I just want some points of view. Especially from someone who has been in a similar situation. This just sucks. If it were up to me she would have never come and lived with us, and I have made that abundantly clear to the point of maybe even being a bit disrespectful about it, but this is a woman who has R.E.P.E.A.T.E.D.L.Y. disrespected my woman, my home, and my own self respect.",15Jun2020,1
1105,"So, I’m sitting here right and my coworker who was also a really good friend at one point was like “wait an hour after your shift and I’ll buy you coffee so we can catch up” and I agreed. Now, this person basically abandoned me at a really vulnerable time for me because my mom was sent to the er and since then, we haven’t really talked. Like, literally yesterday I told my friend that they really fucked things for me for a long time with their actions. 

But when they asked I just kinda, folded? And now I’m sitting here waiting and when I texted my friend about she said that it sounded like a toxic friendship so like am I being horrible? I was going to go get coffee anyways but then they offered to pay so why not right? Like is this an okay thing for me to be doing? Because someone offering to pay for a three dollar drink isn’t that bad right? 

So yeah. Is just catching up with someone after they offered to pay for my drink like, rude on my part? Am I being toxic by accepting when I just yesterday I said (in a list of other people) that this person helped contribute to my life being hell for a while?

1106,"I (23 trans male) have only lived in one state. I have always wanted to move to a nearby state. The plan was to move between August and September of this year. Due to current events I will not be moving until next year. When I first made the decision to move a few family members expressed disapproval because it was ""too far away"" (4 hour drive). 
I dislike asking for help especially with money. Recently I have seen several of my friends making GoFundMe for things and decided I too would give it a try to get help with moving expenses and  making that transition easier.
I made the GoFundMe, included my estimated monthly expenses (will post expense breakdown in comments if its wanted), and posted it on the Book of Faces social media. My sister (26) commented telling me that $2000 was way too much a month for 1 person. She lives in a cheap area of the state where a studio is, on average, $800 a month and a 2 bed apartment is on average $1,250
Where I plan to move rent for a 1 bedroom is $2000. My total budget is just under $2000. She's not the only one that was like that regarding my GoFundMe.

1110,"My boyfriend and I got a place this past January and we are very proud of it! My brother needed a place to stay and so we invited him to move into one of our spare bedrooms as we have a 3-bedroom. He moved in this past March. 

It is now June and I regret asking him to move in and feel awful about it. However, he does nothing and we have had plenty of serious discussions with him about not cleaning up and not paying his share though he has a stable job and 3 days off each week! 

My boyfriend and I clean everything, buy all the cleaning supplies, buy all the groceries and buy all the toiletries. My brother will not even clean the dishes he uses and though he eats the food I cook, he never offers to clean and dry the pans. If my boyfriend does the dishes and we leave for the day, we will come home to my brother playing videos and the dishes sitting in the strainer. He has never cleaned the bathroom and has only done dishes about 7 times in 3.5 months. That is not an exaggeration. When it is recycling day, he says, “I worked all day I didn’t exactly plan on coming home and putting the recycling out,” even if we all worked that day and knew we had to do recycling that day. 

He also says things like, “I have work tomorrow, I don’t want to do chores. I just want to enjoy my day off.”

He makes excuses for everything and if we try to he real kind but serious about it, he becomes verbally aggressive. 

If he is the person who uses the last of the toilet paper, he never puts a new roll in the holder and he also never takes a new pack from the closet to put in the bathroom. He also never buys toiletries but will come to me and say, “hey, we’re out of toilet paper,” if I’m in the middle of working because sometimes I work from home. 

He will also eat in the dining room or living room and he will have food left on his plate and simply leave it there with his full drink and go to bed, leaving the mess. If he eats fast food, he’ll leave the bag and food wrappers and the soda... and in the morning he will leave for work and not clean it. This happens often.

I have pets and I stress that he cannot leave food out because the pets will get into the food.

I also tell him that if he cooks, he needs to use the right tools on the pans.. for example, I told him to only use the rubber tools on my non-stick cookware yet he cooked, he used the stainless steel tools on them and destroyed them... and refuses to by me the same set which was pretty expensive... he only cooked for himself 2 times and in those 2 times he managed to destroy the pans when I specifically asked him to ask me if he forgot which tools to use. 

He also leaves food in containers in the fridge for a very long time and doesn’t empty or clean them. He is very much like our mother. One time I went to her house for New Years after not seeing her for about 6 months... and she had a rotten turkey in her fridge from Thanksgiving... 

He also tells his friends that it’s hard to live with my boyfriend and I when it really isn’t. We are very laid back... I don’t think expecting cleanliness is terrible... He doesn’t really like to be held accountable for anything as we didn’t have either of our parents growing up. 

Anyway... What should I do about this. I plan on giving him the boot in a courteous way.. telling him he has 90 days to move... What do you think?",15Jun2020,1

So I guess I've known her for 2 years now, liked her from the start and over the past year have grown more and more drawn to her.

Physically speaking I don't think she's out my league, my main concerns are potentially losing her as a friend, which would really hurt me, or causing awkwardness in our friend group. ""Luckily"" we will only be housemates for another 20 days, and for the next uni year we will be good friends and plan to hang out often. (Same uni)

I have cause to believe that she would be interested due to our flirty joking however I sometimes think I may be reading into it. Either way the thought of potentially missing out on something with her is not a great one, to say the least.


We're alone in the house for the next couple weeks, spending our time meeting up with friends, and drinking/doing some coke(not often) and watching movies in the evening.

Basically I'm too pussy to say anything, even when under the influence. Should I wait until we move out and she has the space, doesn't feel trapped by awkwardness if she wants to say no? Or should I wait till we have some weed brownies so I can say i like her, and she can say what she thinks, and we don't have to be awkward about it.

1116,"Hi. I’m a 19 year old girl who is struggling a lot with college. This year was my first year studying a course in marketing. Basically when I graduated secondary/high school I was offered to do this course for free. At the time, I didn’t know what I wanted to study I decided to do it.

I started this course knowing very little about what I was going to be studying but I ended up not liking it. The first trimester went alright, I got some decent marks but the second trimester was when I started to lose interest and motivation. Despite that I still got some pretty OK marks. 

The third trimester I found a lot more difficult and was when everything went downhill for me. That was when the whole COVID-19 lockdown started and classes were made online. At this time I lost all my interest and motivation to study. I did try to do some work but it was just too hard. I think during this whole lockdown I only showed up to about 2 online classes and completely gave up on the assignments. I’m really upset about it and I feel like this whole online class is not for me and it has ruined all my chances of passing the year. I much prefer being physically in a classroom rather than being behind a computer screen.

Recently I was sent my overall marks for the year via email and of course, I have failed the year. I’m really upset about it despite my lack of interest in the course and have no idea what I’m going to do now that I’ve failed.

I often then tell myself that I can’t just take a backseat and “watch” the conversation like I always do. So I try to come up with something to say, but I usually only make a short comment or two that is barely on topic which is pretty pathetic and probably makes me seem uninterested in the conversation.

1127,"So I got horny, as many guys do, and started looking for someone sext with. I found someone and after a few minutes they claim to be underage and have my Facebook, Instagram and twitter and are gonna post the pictures unless I pay them $500 dollars.

1130,"So first of all I know I'm going to sound like such a horrible person but I've wanted to break up with my current girlfriend of 3 years for a few months now but I have no idea how. I think one reason why is that she genuinely has not done anything wrong it's just a few things here and there.

 Like for example we've been together for 3 years and I've never met any of her family, she says it's because her family are a bit crazy but I've just kind of accepted it when my friends tell me it's really strange. There are other small things that annoy me like she always checks my Snapchat score to see if it goes up so she knows if I've messaged someone and ignored her (which I sometimes do as she can be a bit much some times) I should also note that we are in a long distance relationship and see eachother one weekend a month.

 I'm 20 and she's 21 and she's always going on about having a kid and I keep telling her I'm not comfortable talking about it but she just rolls her eyes or gets upset. I think one of the hardest part is that this girl is madly in love with me, like she would do absolutely anything for me and I feel it would absolutely destroy her if I broke up with her, I've never broken up with someone before, this is the first relationship I've properly had actually but I just don't feel like I would be able to spend the rest of my life with her.

So yeah any advice would be greatly appreciated. (sorry for the long read)",15Jun2020,1
1131,"I've had trouble wrapping my head around the meaning of this, it seems like so many people have different interpretation of it that I'm not sure what it truly is.  


I've for a long time struggled with seeing myself as a good person and only recently learned to look at it from a different perspective, namely because I often feel cold and detached from people which makes me feel like a cruel, bad person. Then there's the claim that people on the spectrum of autism like myself lack empathy, and I guess I do....but do I?

  
Here's what I know. I have a hard time reading people, I need clear signs and directions to know what someone wants from me. Basically, it's difficult for me to read people.  


On the other hand I've always had a strong desire to better other people's lifes, and to ease their pain if it's in my ability to do. When I see someone cry, there's this feeling in my chest. Like, I don't feel so much sadness as some kind of conflict or urge to do something, learn what's going on and help, be it an emotional or practical response, but also a desire to just sit down and think about it.  


Some kind of feeling, though I don't know what to name it, but I do feel something intense, even though it may not be like feeling what the other person feels. I can't seem to translate the signals that I receive properly, but I do always feel that urge in my chest, which makes me want to act, and otherwise contemplate.  


So what I feel, is that empathy? Is it something else?",15Jun2020,1

I hate asking questions at work bc I have this theory in my head that they’re gonna find out I’m dumb even faster. 

Every time I want to learn more about something, I read about it..listen to documentaries...then forget almost every fact I’ve learned. So when I go to have a conversation..it’s familiar but I can’t recall anything I learned.

Im struggling so much to actually sympathise with people playing the victim so much. 
Not that I don’t think there are racist people, but saying (and I’m paraphrasing a speech I saw before that’s gaining traction) “ because whites have privilege pay up to black folk, if you don’t, you’re racist because ur not using your privilege ” and I’m not even joking.

1135,"So there are serious talks that came up over the weekend about moving into an apartment. This is something I want: the freedom of being my own person and adjusting to being so before more permanent housing decisions are made. I'd be just a couple miles from home, in a great complex, and I get so excited at the idea of being on my own. But, the only thing holding me back are my dogs.

I've had one of them since I was five, and the other was one I got back in 2016. I chose her, I love her, pain as she may be she's my baby. My dogs are my world and I want to bring them with me, but there are no private outdoor spaces in the apartment complex. This wouldn't be an issue if Lily, my girl, wasn't so unpredictable with her energy. She's a 60 pound lug, but when she gets worked up, she HAS to go outside right that second. Toys don't hold her attention, she's an outdoor dog and I can't take that away from her. That's not in her best interest. So, obvious solution is that I move out, and the dogs stay with my parents. But just the idea of that makes me want to tear up.

They're my world, I am supposed to be there to take care of them. But I also got Lily when I was 16- life had far different priorities then, and I wasn't thinking ""how am I going to feel when I'm twenty and want to move into an apartment."" I don't want to miss out on a bit of time of freedom to figure out what I want in life because of them. Them being nearby and able to visit any time is good, but we all know it's not the same thing.

I'm just really torn on what to do, and I haven't been able to get any solid feedback on what I should do. Literally there isn't a single other negative in my mind to doing this besides being with them, but I know eventually the feeling would pass. I just don't want to upset their lives and mine by becoming a visitor rather than the person they live with. Any help would be great.",15Jun2020,1
1136,"So my Asian mother works at a beauty salon that is catered to African American Beauty.  My Korean 5’foot mother is constantly harassed and yelled at and she is fed up and doesn’t know how to respond to these people.  She has told me earlier this week, a African American lady came up to her and started yelling at her for bringing covid to the states and said that it was because of people like her, yelled at her for being “Chinese” even though she’s not.  Another group of black people shopping at her work place started to blame her and her Asian coworkers for stealing jobs in America, even though my mom literally did nothing.  Another story she told me was the time she caught a lady for stealing and she happens to be black.  The lady lashed out and started to lose it in the store.  She started to blame my mother for being racist and that she is being searched because she is black.  I guess due to the current situation in the world, she wanted to take advantage of this situation.  My mother clearly saw her steal and it had nothing to do with the color of her skin.  It’s experiences like these that my mother is starting to build a negative connection with the black community and I don’t know how to explain to her that it is not ok to hold a prejudice.  I know her feeling are valid and that what they have done is not ok however, I don’t know how to let her know that her experiences do not makeup the whole black community.

1143,"Two friends and I started a podcast over a year ago. We gained some nice momentum, had a blast making it, and had a nice following of listeners.

During all this COVID shutdown, we lost access to our studio we used. It took a minute, but I built a studio at my apartment for us to use.

Lining up schedules is hard as we’re all busy. But one of them just completely lost motivation to continue in the month we didn’t post. He’s totally done.

A bit frustrated, but there was still two of us to continue and we have some good back and forth energy. But in the turmoil of this, the other backed out too.

I really felt like this was the beginning of something. We had awesome synergy, interactive fans, and we all loved doing it. I don’t know if I can carry a show by myself without a cohost that I vibe with really well. But I still have a lot of drive and passion to continue making content.

1151,"My fiance 29m and I 25f met in western mountainy state in 2016. He was in the military, originally from a small East Coast state. I had recently moved to current location from my Hometown in a warm, southern date with daughter, now 5F. When we first began dating, he lied about being in the military. I didn't want to date a military man, mostly because I didn't want to be forced to move and uproot my life. 

When he had the option to renew his contract, I told him that I didn't want to continue dating if he remained in the military due to stability reasons and because I didn't want to move. He decided to not renew his contract and pursue his dream career here. 

We have been together since 2016, living together since and engaged since 2019. Well now he is pressuring me to move to small east coast state to be near family,  or to other states nearer to small east coast state. Here's the thing: I have no desire to do this. 

I specifically moved to NOT be close to family. I find familial obligations overbearing, and i honestly dont really like the majority of his family. The few times I've visited I've been anxious the whole time. I don't want to live there. He really misses them. It's not financially feasible to visit more. I also have worse job prospects there.

1153,"My mum and dad have both hit me over the most ridiculous of reasons. My mum has pinned me down and hit me over and over again while yelling in my face to ""keep screaming, no one is going to help you"" over swearing and not doing chores and my dad has slapped me across the face really hard when he thought I hurt my little brother which I didn't, he hit his foot off the radiator. These are only 2 things they have done to me. Other stuff they've done includes my mum throwing chairs at me, hitting me with a wooden spoon (not as a spanking for a kid but when I was 15 and can be reasoned and talked to so there shouldn't be any excuse) and nasty comments from both of them on my weight, my personality, my choice of hobby, activities, etc etc, the list goes on forever.

I have huge problems with people hitting their kids and I've done my research as to why it's wrong and even with this research, I still try and justify them and defend them from my own accusations and thoughts about them and that they're bad parents and that they shouldn't have had kids if they weren't prepared to deal with these things. They've also gaslighted me into believing I wasn't hit a few times even if it was immediately after they have hit me. They led me to believe that every kid is hit by their parents and then say that they would never hit their kids. Obviously it's very confusing especially right after getting hit when you're still having a panic attack from it. 

My dad has told me he has hit my older brother and my mum has hit my older sister although I don't remember hearing them screaming and they had locks on their bedroom doors unlike me so they had some protection if that did happen. I can't remember most of my childhood only small bits of getting yelled at by them and spanked and called nasty things by them, I also remember getting shoved and locked under the stairs and told that rats and demons were going to eat me and kill me when I was really small by my sister but that's just another shitty thing but I wouldn't be surprised that if my older siblings did get hit and that I just can't remember. My younger brother has definitely never been hit though. If he was it wasn't as punishment and it was probably an accident while messing with my dad. My dad also says it's my responsibility to deal with my problem with being hit by them and it's my burden to carry and that my older siblings turned out fine even after being hit and I'm just looking for attention and that they shouldn't have to apologise for doing the right thing. 

I've talked about my situation with a close friend online and he says that I have probably developed ptsd because I experience invasive memories that are way too vivid and when I experience them, I have huge panic attacks and freak out as if I was experiencing it all over again, they might be flashbacks? Idk tbh. Obviously take this ""diagnosis"" with a pinch of salt. I've also never told any of my irl friends these things and idk if i should. 

For the past couple years I've been trying to find ways to cut them off but it's difficult. Recently I've been having a wave of invasive memories constantly, I can barely sleep. I've had a strange urge to get out as fast as I can like a fight or flight response but idk if I should waste resources that could be used for someone in immediate danger as I don't think they'll be hitting me anymore as I just turned 18 this march. I don't even know if there are any places that help people in my position, normally it's for women who are experiencing problems with their partners not for people having problems with parents. I don't think it's the best idea to go to a homeless shelter due to the virus but I've been considering it but my parents might find me there and confront me and publicly humiliate me for trying to get away from them.

 I don't have a job at the moment but I'm looking for one. I don't feel the most comfortable working at the local shops due to the virus but I'm going to be applying anyway so I can try save money. I also don't have enough money to move into an apartment or anything yet and in the plan I've been making for the past couple years it means I'll have to stay with my parents until I'm finished college just so I can save some more so I can get out easier without relying on them at all and to cut them off a quickly as possible. My main problem to get out is money and I'm only just finishing school this year and hopefully doing computer science next year so I don't have much experience to get anything other than minimum wage.

I'm also wondering if I should be trying to cut them off at all. I know they're toxic at times and they make me feel like shit but they're still my parents and maybe they were really trying or maybe I was just too much of a shitty teen to not get hit by them. They can still be nice and there are days when I think we can actually get along but these memories make me hate them so much and it makes me angry and hurt and sad and there's way too many emotions that are coming from these memories and maybe it's my fault I'm remembering them and can't stop thinking about them but it's hard to control it but it could also be their fault for giving me these memories but I could also just be trying to play the blame game and being selfish and overly critical and I hate thinking I could be such a horrible person to do that.

Tldr; my parents have hit me and been nasty to me and I don't know if I should leave or not and if I should, how?",15Jun2020,1

1161,"So basically, with the entire virus going around, and college campuses being shut down, my friends and I were kicked out of the dorms. The thing is that there was one friend who was pretty quiet and didn't hang out with the rest of the people on our dorm's floor, but I was pretty outgoing, so I often would hang out with him separately from the group. We're pretty much as opposite as they get. Over time, we got closer and became pretty good friends.

Since we were forced to leave the dorms, we obviously don't see each other as often because we live in different states. We both agreed to keep in touch, and we jokingly said that it would probably be me initiating the conversations we have online. During the school year, he replied enough to the point where I wouldn’t notice his absence, but now I really only hear from him once every 2-7 days. We've video-called once in the past 3 months. I don't really want to overwhelm him with multiple video-calls because he said he doesn't really do them often. I know a lot of it has to do with the fact that he's not really good/used to texting people because he's a bit of a quiet dude, and I'm someone who's completely used to it since I'm more outgoing. I just can't help but wished that he texted a bit more; I just miss him a lot. I told him I wanted to hear from him more, but all he really said was that he was a bad texter and didn’t know what else to say. It sucks because he’s using his phone, he just doesn’t really text me.

1162,"My mom (60) had a really hard life and she takes it out on me (25).
Since I’m a little kid I hear about how my grandma died when she was only 6, and the rest of her life wasn’t easy as well. She married her 1st bf, who is my dad, and he had problem with drugs and she took care of him. When I was 19 left our house. 

I get that her life is the worst, but since I’m a little kid she expected me to stand out for her on things I didn’t understand at the time... like when my uncles made mean comments towards her she expected me to understand and always told me that if she had a mother she would fight for her. 

She always told me that I don’t love her since I’m a little kid. I feel that she built so many EXPECTATIONS over having a kid that she never thought I wouldn’t be a copycat of her, or the answer to her problems...

I slept in her bed until I was 9 years old cause their marriage has been broken already when I was born. I’m a person with boundaries issues, or maybe it’s not an issue, I just don’t like a lot of hugs and snuggle with my parents, and that’s enough for her to tell me I never loved her. Cause I’m not good at saying. And she’s always telling me I don’t. And the older I get harder she resents me.

I grow up listening to this kind of stuff and I still listen to it. She slut-shames me all the time and verbally abuses me. I try to tell her how I feel but it never works. She denies and says that she can’t remember things well. Since my dad left it’s been even worse, I feel like I’m on a bad marriage with my mom. That I took the place of my dad. 
This quarantine has been the worst thing for me, cause now I have to be with my mom everyday, only the two of us. She’s deeply depressed, she only talks to me to tell me I hate her and I’m just like my father despite the fact that she’s the perfect mom. She did a lot of things for me, that’s true. But it’s killing me to be in “prison” with her. 

I know I need therapy, but it’s not a safe space here to go on online therapy cause I can be heard, I’ll feel heard even if she doesn’t... 
I have a sister (40) who is really my cousin, but it doesn’t make difference for me cause we were raised like this. She says that’s how my mom has always been, but probably she didn’t take so much on her ‘cause of the blood relation. She expected ME to be perfect for being the result of her love for my dad, I guess.
I have been thinking about my life lately, what I want in it, she also always told me that people who doesn’t have kids are unhappy, but I don’t see many happy mothers around too. My mom’s friends usually resent them as much. I think I should just take care of my 3 nephews and have the best life I can.

I have been googling differences between a period and implantation bleeding and pregnancy bleeding but I am still unsure. There is heavy flow on at least one of the days. I had unusual discharge over the last month. I took a pregnancy test 3 months after I had sex (I know should have done it sooner but I thought I had a period so I was safe) and it was negative. I have also gained 5 pounds over the last month. My breasts ache sometimes (they never did before) and I don't know if I'm paranoid or if my areolas got bigger?",15Jun2020,1
1165,"I had gone through two interviews with two different district managers. I thought it all went very well. Mostly I spoke to one guy, let’s call him Jim. Jim told me he would be calling me back early on in a week or so after the second interview. The call never came. This morning, I suddenly received a phone call with a familiar caller ID. It was early and I wasn’t expecting anything. That was my fault. 

The entire time, I thought I was speaking to Jim. But it was actually the hiring manager from my very first interview. He gave me all the info I needed and wanted to extend an offer (which he will email). At the end, I said “thanks JIM” and I didn’t realize my mistake until later on. When he first called I didn’t hear his introduction because the signal got muffled. The two men sounded exactly alike to my 8 AM brain. 

He didn’t correct me when I made this truly awful mistake. But I have been cringing and beating myself up and hating myself all day. I’m wondering should I bring it up next time to apologize? Will there be a next time even? 
So I didn’t know where to post this but I’m hoping someone can help me out. Right now I feel the worst I’ve felt in a while. 

My family tells me I’m way overreacting and 1. He might not have even really noticed/has forgotten and 2. He might not even really care. 

And now I hate myself even more cause what if he takes back that offer? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! 

Ps: I do have awful anxiety, in case it wasn’t clear in this post lol 
Tl;dr: was expecting call from one manager, got an unexpected call from a different manager who says he is going to give me a job offer but at the end, I called him by the name of the first manager (by accident). I hate myself now and can’t stop cringing.",15Jun2020,1
1166,"A little context, I have been wanting to get a tattoo for a really long time. I love the idea of carrying someone's special art style with you for the rest of your life, especially if its something meaningful to you specifically. 

Additionally, I'm currently 18 years old, but i'll be turning 19 in July, and I thought that would be the perfect gift to myself to commemorate it. 

The first idea I came up with my mom disliked and encouraged me to change my mind about what to get. I respected her opinion and decided to come up with something more memorable and special to me. I came up with the idea to get the characters Calvin and Hobbes, from well, the Calvin and Hobbes comic series, because I would stay up late at night as a kid reading a big book with the comics in them. I even remember my parents specifically getting me this book when I was younger.

I was really excited to tell my mom my new idea because it was a lot more meaningful, but her response was the exact opposite from what I thought. Her response was, ""Mmmmmmm... No."" because, ""You'll probably regret later on in life getting a cartoon tattooed on you."" my brother asked a very good question, ""How would you know? You've never gotten a tattoo of a cartoon?"" but she was hard set on the idea that I would regret it, even after explaining why I wanted it. 

So what should I do? I really want to get it anyways, but I still want to be respectful to my mom. Thanks.",15Jun2020,1

1175,"I’m 14 (m) I turn 15 on the 22nd so in a week I have a 17(f) sister my dad is 56 and my mom is 53. They constantly fight about anything and everything. I’m not talking about little arguments I mean full on yelling match’s. It’s happens ever since I can remember. My dads a owner operator truck driver and since covid hit he’s been home for 2 months so tensions in the house have been running high. My mom just now got a part time job at a grocery store and is her first job since 2016 when she got hurt in her last job. That has always been a fight between them. In 2018 my sister was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer so that made things worse. 

My dad doesn’t like my maternal grandmas husband and hates that we call him grandpa but he’s the only one we’ve ever known and he’s always they us like his grandkids. My mom is kinda meh in my dads family since all my dad does with them is work on his brother’s property in the garden and in the pasture, work on his semi and deer hunt. 

My mom hates working In the garden in the heat and he’s constantly telling us to go down and work it while he’s gone since mom didn’t have a job. This year both Sister and mom got a job so he’s been telling us to go down to uncles to work the garden early in the morning before the heat. 

Yesterday was their biggest fight ever dad was leaving today for a load for the first time since April so he decided to grill chicken and squash he burnt the squash since it was cut thin and that pissed him off. After dinner I go take my shower and when I’m walking to my room they’re fighting about who cut it so small. I think something else was said because 20 minutes later dad asks if mom wants to sleep on the bed sit in the living room she says the living room. 

Next thing I know dad is saying he’ll just leave that night for some reason and they start yelling something and dad stays he’s done and he’s leaving mom says something about the garden and dad roars back something about my uncle they had their door shut and I could hear them with my door shut and my tv on. I do the only thing I know to do. I go in the back yard behind the back shed and sit on my moms grandfathers old work bench I sit there for about 5 minutes before I start crying about my parents fighting and if they would get a divorce. 10 minutes later my dad walks out and asks me if I’m alright I say yes and he starts in on how he’s tired of mom not working, mom not loosing weight,mom not paying the bills the way he wants to so he knows how they’re done, mom not wanting to spend time with his family, mom pushing our relationship with step grandpa and so on and how it’s not fair for him. He tells me to go inside since it’s 9:30 at night and mosquitoes are out. 

I’m still crying so I go into the bathroom to wash my face when I walk out dad tells me it’s nothing to cry about and to go wash my face again. When I’m done I go into my room and lay in my bed face in the pillow and continue crying I’m in there for another 20 minutes when my dad comes in again and sits down on my bed next to me. He tells me it’s been coming a long time and that he’s sorry kids get wrapped up in parents fights and he asks me if I want him to leave that night to go down to uncles since that’s where his truck is at I tell him I don’t care since no matter what no ones going to be happy. After another 5 minutes he gets up and tells me they’re going to work it out gives me a hug and leaves. By the time he left I had stopped crying but after he walked out I start again and I fall asleep lying on my bed with my face in my pillow. Dad wakes me up to say bye this morning and he leaves. 

This morning mom tells me she’s tired of if the fighting she’s tired of him pushing the garden and uncle so hard. I go outside to play with my dog. Sister walks out to talk to me and Tells me there’s nothing to be scared of but if dad makes her chose sides she’s siding with mom and I should to. 

I’m tired of feeling like they want me to chose sides. I’m tired of the fighting. I’m tired of them bad mouthing the other. I’m tired of feeling isolated. 

I’ve never been close with my dad since he’s gone al the time and he’s from the school of parenting if boys get in trouble no matter what girls get away with it all and you yell at a boy 1,000 times before you raise your voice to a girl. There’s been times he’s yelled at me for the smallest thing and not even said anything to sister for something worse. I love them both but I’m tired of it all I’m tired of my dad not wanting to do anything with me but dying how he wishes how he could still do stuff with his dad who died when he was 14 I’m tired of it all. I want to talk to my friends but I do online school at home and all my friends go to our church. I don’t want to text them about it I want to talk to them in person. I’m jut tired of it all.  

Mom and dad seem to have got over the fight since they’ve barely said 3 words to each other today when he left that’s one thing I don’t get they fight and as they like nothing happened. They talked to each other in the phone and they said love you to each other. I don’t know what to do nothing is set in stone but it has been a long time coming I don’t know if they’ll get a divorce I’m just tired of all the fighting.

1176,"Hello Redditors! I am currently seeking advice on humility and how to stay level-headed. I am a 24f, who has grown up being extremely insecure about myself because of childhood experiences (abuse, bullying, racism, strict religion, etc.). Within the past couple of years, I have become confident in my appearance, ethnicity, and overall self-worth for the first time in my life. I was accepted into my dream master's program, am signed with a modeling agency, and have partnered with a successful investor/businesswoman to open a business in a few weeks. While I am very grateful to be where I am, I have to admit the amount of attention and praise I am getting from others is making me feel uncomfortable. I am afraid if that as life goes on (and especially if the business I am opening becomes as successful as my partner believes it will be) I may pass the threshold of confident to vain or entitled. What can I do to keep myself confident, yet humble?

He obviously is the father of my child and wants to be part of the birth, but he’s really hurt me and I’ve spent a lot of my pregnancy heartbroken and sad because of his actions! Also we have a very dysfunctional relationship right now where we bicker and I just cannot remain calm around him and don’t really want him to be my birthing partner because of this. 
I want to be calm and have someone who is going to keep me calm and I just am doubting his ability to do this. 
I feel like if I don’t do it his family are going to hate me and I’m going to be painted out to be the bad guy even though he is the one that cheated on me and has been totally horrid to me.

1179,"Hello,

I'm Ojus, a current business management student at a community college. This summer semester is my last one before I graduate. One of my required courses is a capstone course where I am required to find a job and work at least 224 hours. My college started last week, and I've been having trouble finding a job for the past three weeks. From the start, I made sure to contact career services at my school and they helped me create a resume and cover letter for my job search. I'm wanting the job to be remote due to the current pandemic as I live with diabetic parents who are in their 60's. I don't want to risk spreading the virus to them, so working from home is very important. 

Aside from searching career boards like indeed and monster, are there any other methods I should be using to find a remote job? Where else should I be looking? Who should I be asking to find out about opportunities that I can apply to? The course requires that all I need is a supervisor above me, it can be any job. My professor even said he is widening what is allowed due to the current worldwide situation. I need to find one in the next week or two otherwise I might have to face getting an incomplete for the class this semester, which is something I want to avoid.

Important Note: I don't have any prior job experience nor any volunteer work. This is one of the reasons my resume is a functional template that way I was able to focus more on my skills rather than past experience.

All advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :D",15Jun2020,1

1181,"As the title suggests, these dogs are routinely stealing pads out of the bathroom trash can and ripping them up, leaving pieces scattered around. I'm at a loss of how to confront this situation because I'm a man and I really have no place in telling someone how to deal with this sort of issue.

At first it was just on the back porch me and my girlfriend would find these ripped used pads and sort of just avoid that area hoping they would notice it and deal with it.
But we have since been there all together and they didn't even acknowledge it, 3 girls use that bathroom and there's 3 dogs. Only 2 of the girls own the dogs, one has two and the other has one. So I don't know who's dogs/pads are responsible. My girlfriend puts hers straight in the outside trash so we know it's not hers.

Today I caught one of the dogs in the act chewing up a LOT of pads on the couch, so I confronted the dogs owner and let her know what had happened and she sort of just brushed it off and said ok.

She came downstairs to pick them up off the couch and as she was walking past a suggested using a trashcan with a lid, which she sort of just ignored and kept walking past.

It's sort of getting out of hand at this point and it's quite grotty, I've asked my girlfriend to speak to them but she's very shy and non-confrontational in that respect so she won't do it.

1183,"Due Corona virus I was furloughed from my job (job#1), so since I didn’t qualify for government assistance I went out of my way to find another job(#2)

So I got a job in a very famous grocery store chain as a cake decorator, and they said that they were going to train me to transfer me to a new store that they were going to open in mid August. I was really excited and happy about it because they pay me great, I learn a lot of things, the company offers amazing benefits and if I stay there lo enough I can make it a career. 

But... it has been a very sour experience, nobody is training me, they expect me to learn by asking by questions, which I do but my co workers have a very nasty actitude and aren’t really helpful, their responses sound annoyed and sometimes they ask me the same question back with a nasty tone saying something like “I DONT KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK?” (Example: where do we store the cakes?. “I don’t know where do you think?” *we have more than one place where we keep them...) it feels like I’m bothering them and is kind of humiliating. 

Another shitty thing about the job is the bullying, I can hear the department manager and assistant manager yell at my co workers all day long, and the things they say are quite rude as well, for example the A.Manager was yelling at this woman saying that she was doing something wrong and that he’s tired of her bullshit, and if she doesn’t want to work today she can go home right now, and when she tried to talk back, he interrupted her yelling I DONT KNOW, I DONT SPEAK PHILIPINO and he left the bakery. (She’s from the Philippines and has a strong accent, but if you pay attention you can understand her perfectly) 

And just like that lady, there is plenty of other co workers who are victims of his behavior.  

The problem is that, nobody can learn anything properly in that toxic environment, so there is a lot of mistakes and lack of productivity, everybody is so scared of screwing things up and since everybody wants to get promoted, they shit in your face constantly so they look better. 

Anyway, they never did a thing to me, until yesterday, this co worker, who is supposed to be training me (she’s not) went to talk to A. Manager to tell him that I’m too slow and that I do things one by one, which is a lie btw. 

Yes, I am slow, but it’s because I’m learning, I have been in that job for like 3 weeks. 

So what happened? A. Manager calls me and tells me a bunch of nasty things *with a sweet voice because he’s cutting some slack for me because I’m new* but in between the things he said was “you have no drive” and other stupid things. I explain to him that what my co worker said was wrong and he didn’t believe me anyway, he said that I better get better and soon. I was speechless.
After my shift I cried in the bathroom for a while. 

I found out today that A. Manager is actually getting promoted to Manager of The new store, so he’s going to be my boss. 

I want to quit now, but I can’t, my other job#2 just started to open so I don’t have enough hours yet.

Everybody tells me that I shouldn’t quit, that I should fight this but I don’t want to, I don’t want to be in that nasty environment and become one of them 

I’m planing to reduce my hours and slowly quit when my other job is giving me 40 hours weekly. 

Ps. I am a badass amazing worker, I work really hard, I’m never late,  I’m really helpful and obviously I have drive, he was just being an asshole.  They LOVE me In job#2, they love me so much that I’m getting a pay raise and I’m getting promoted soon.

Is this a friendly message? Do you think the person who sent it to me cares about me as a friend?

'Yeah there's a really nice park only about 10 mins walk away from me, though it is getting quite busy at the moment and getting quite hard to social distance there just because of the number of people walking around. The park you go to sounds nice - is there a lake that people swim in? The dancing is going well, it's not so much that the pace is slow, but I just can't really learn a lot more as really the best thing I can do to improve my dancing is to 'listen' to my lead through the movement which is obviously impossible since I don't have a dance partner. Haha how long is your hair at the moment? Have you thought about getting someone to cut it for you? I cut my boyfriend's hair a little while ago and it took about 2 hours but he was actually really pleased with how it went (and I was relieved haha). I have never done pilates but it does sound similar to the flexibility - I paid for a 4-week long flexibility yoga class that I do every sunday on zoom and then stretching by myself every day, the goal is that hopefully by the end i should be able to do the splits!

Her parents are rich, she has a trust fund. Her parents just BOUGHT her and her husband a house. Long story short.., we have an ok friendship. I’ve never felt super comfortable around her or felt I could just speak my mind ( everyone has one of those friends right ? ). I feel I just can’t relate to her in any way bc she’s never had to work for anything in her life. She’s very high end with everything, even her personality.

I’m not her closest best friend either and she’s had gatherings where she doesn’t even invite me... which has bothered me seeing stuff on Instagram where I wasn’t invited and I thought we were friends.
Anyways, it’s been a few months now and we haven’t talked. I’ve been going through a lot of personal issues that I know she can’t relate to. She texted me and I’ve just been taking a super long time to reply back bc of all of these reason. She has double and triple texted me asking me if she did something to upset me.

I met this friend on Discord, at first we just talked about silly stuff, but them my job contract finished (I used to work 8h per day, 6 days a week),  I discovered I had a problem on my knees so I had to stop even my freelance job that kept me standing for almost 8 hours straight and the cherry on the top, my parents where really mad at me for not getting a job. Staying at home hit me really hard, sometimes I didn't want to get up in the morning, I didn't desire anything, I just wanted to cry all day long. That's when our internet camaraderie turned into friendship and he helped me. He talked to me, we spent long hours just talking about how my life was, how I was feeling, we watched movies together, he was always remembering me about my gloves, about drinking water and sometimes he yelled at me for not eating enough.

I got better and found a new job and I know that he did a major part in it, because he was always there. Now comes the bad part. I discovered from a third person that he used to have a friendship like ours with another girl and he went to visit her once and tried to kiss her and she said not, because he was just a friend, after that he started to use me to get her mad, said stuff like ""I'll talk with Gabi, because she doesn't make me feel bad"" (that girl has depression btw) and it happened many times.

I can't say for sure that he started saying this stuff after the girl rejected him or if he did before or I was in a really bad place and it didn't matter at the time. He kept saying stuff about we being friends with benefits, a lot of times, even when I said that it wasn't going to happen. He talked a lot about my butt, about slapping it if I didn't behave or something, he just stopped after I told him I have him arrested if he touched me without my permission and he got mad at me, because he was just kidding and I know how he is, so I shouldn't act like that.

And sometimes looks like he's always saying that what he likes is better than what I like, like food or movies or series, it's always ""Oh you like that but I prefer this"" or ""I think mine is better"" and it's getting on my nerves. Besides he tries to decide some stuff for me, last time we fought because of a sock!

So after all this I started to keep away from him, but I don't know if I'm doing the right thing after all the things he did to me, after all, he helped me a lot when I had no one, he heard me, he tolerated a lot too. So am I doing the right thing pushing him away? Am I being an asshole? I don't want to be the kind of person who only goes after the others when I need them.",15Jun2020,1
