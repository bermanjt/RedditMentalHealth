1,"We’re putting our clocks forward tonight. Tbh it’s unnessary as we are at the western edge of the time zone, so it’ll be getting dark at 7:30pm anyway without the clock change. 

The issue I have is adjusting mentally. So like  it doesn’t “feel” like the time. I’m sitting thinking “it’s 11, but it feels like 12.” Part of this is because we haven’t flown anywhere, so the daylight is the same if you know what I mean.

Then for the first few nights I end up going to bed really late.

So I’m not sure how to adjust to this. It’s always a nightmare, and it always puts me out of kilter.",29Mar2020,1

Hey guys. I’ve been using the messenger app without having a Facebook account for about two years (I just clicked create a new account and I’m pretty sure I linked it to my Instagram account). Last night I decided to finally get a Facebook account. I linked my facebook account to my phone number, the same one I used for my messenger account, and then when I opened the messenger app my old account and all my messages were gone. I tried using the switch account button but it didn’t work because I used the same phone number for both my accounts. My friends said that when they tried to text my old account it didn’t work and said something like your are unable to contact this person’. Normally I wouldn’t give a shit but I’m at uni and need to contact people in my group project (due this week) and I forgot their names lol. We had a group chat on my old messenger account rip. So if anyone could please help me to recover my old account, that would be epic and I’d be so so so grateful.",29Mar2020,1
4,"I'm torn. All in all, I'm usually great at everything except school. I'm a freshman in college, but I can tune motors, build cars, read blueprints, and do all sorts of wild stuff, and I've been able to do lots of that since middle school.  I'm certified in structural welding, and have a few Hvac certs. However, when it comes to college I'm failing. It's strange and pisses me off that I just can't take hold of information for once in my life. Specifically math, but sometimes other subjects give me trouble. My aim is to try to study business and hold a degree, because I adore watching stocks and reading economic reports. However, my mind struggles with the easiest stuff sometimes. I grew up in a family that's supportive, and helped me with tutors all throughout school but even simple stuff just seems to walk out the backdoor. A number of people say that I should just go work in the trades, but I don't want to do that ALL my life. I've seen what 10, let alone 20 years of working trades can do to people. what should I do?",29Mar2020,1
6,"My brother is in the 8th grade, is basically known as the trumpet prodigy in the school.  He’s the one gets all the solos, he was the only 7th grader to make it into the All Shore Intermediate Symphonic Band, and he’s like the band teacher’s pet.  He’s extraordinarily good is what I’m saying. 

Two Tuesdays ago, he got his braces off, which he’d had on for the entirety of his trumpet playing career, and now his ability to play has gotten a lot worse.  He can’t hit the high notes anymore, and his tone isn’t very good either.  It’s been around a week and a half and he’s been practicing every single day, and he apparently hasn’t made any improvements.  And now every time a bring up his trumpet, his face drops and I can tell this whole thing is putting him down.  He’s worried he’ll never be as good as he was before.  I don’t want him to give up, he’s so extremely talented.  Does anyone have any advice for him?",29Mar2020,2
7,"My job wants to give back and help the community in this time of need. We want to deliver food to medical professionals in the area, but I also suggested trying to deliver food to senior centers/nursing homes or just the elder community in general. I believe elders and medical professionals are feeling the impact of COVID19 the most right now.
The food we had in mind would come from a local meal prepping company that prepares a variety of healthy meals ready to eat. The only issue we face is trying to get it delivered.
Does anyone work or know someone who works in a nursing home/with seniors?
Of course we wouldn’t go in the building ourselves, we would just have a representative or two at time of delivery and hopefully we can drop off at the doors and staff could grab the food?

I want to call around but I am not sure how to ask or who to talk to.

Any suggestions, tips, or alternatives would be welcomed. 

Thanks!",29Mar2020,2
8,"Hi everyone, I didn't know whether or not to post it on here or another subreddit but here we go. So I (22f) have been with my boyfriend (20m) for little over a year now. We met in college and during that time for a while we had a turmulous relationship that including us experiencing with various substances which we stopped doing and getting into petty arguments but the arguments weren't happening frequently just normal fights. In January, we both moved back to our respective states and entered a long distance relationship- we live roughly 4 hours apart. 

Since moving away from each other we have been having petty arguments and I believe it's because we live apart and we're not used to being away from each other for this long plus since this pandemic is happening we have no clue as to when we'll see each other again. When we argue, we usually come back to our senses and realize it was a stupid argument. A month ago, a co-worker gave me tiny pinky finger bump of speed and I right away decided to tell him about it because we agreed on being open in whatever we do and he had told me to just be careful. Then, we got into an argument that day because I guess he didn't know that speed is meth and said how could you that, you told me you would never do that, etc. and I told him that I would never do it again and I even changed my schedule because he suggested it so I won't be influenced and even started talking to a therapist. I also want to say that I have been relatively sober since moving home minus that awful incident and a glass of wine with my mom back in early Feburary. 

Last week, I came to him telling him that I feel insecure in the relationship because of how he treated me last year (which I've forgiven him but it takes time for me to get over it because it really did a number on me in regards of my self esteem) and I just wanted to be open and communicative with him because we both agreed to do so. When I told him, it ended in an argument because he said that he's obviously changed and I basically shouldn't dwell on the past because he is a different person and he loves me and I shouldn't compare myself to other people. What I wanted to do was just let him know that I'm feeling insecure and the reason why and I never intended on it becoming an argument. That Thursday, we decided to take a break so he can have some space and so he can create some boundaries because he felt as though I frequently come to him telling him my problems and I get now that I shouldn't always do that because he is not my therapist and there should be a line between that. 

Fast forward to yesterday, he told me that he wants to break up because he is still stuck on me taking a bump of speed and that he has lost all trust in me. It hurt me because I thought we had talked it over and I promised him that I would never ever touch that stuff and it was just a one time thing. We talked on the phone and at the end he said he would think about everything I said and that we will talk Monday. 

When we were together last year, for the better part of the beginning he wasn't the best partner but I stuck by him and was patient because I saw the good in him and I knew that he can change and become a better person- which he has. 

I guess why I'm here is because I don't know what to do...I want us to continue out relationship because he is honestly such an amazing person and I care for him a lot and we've both made tremendous growth. I have been working really hard on becoming a better partner for him and becoming a better person and I wish he could see that. I'm just confused as to why I had been so patient with him last year even though he continued to hurt me but he has become a better person but he can't do the same with me even though I fucked up one time. Is there a way as to how I can try to gain his trust back? Is this just another stupid argument? Am I in the wrong or is he overreacting? I don't know what to think right now...or what I can do to salvage this...


TL;DR: I broke a promise I made and now my boyfriend wants to break up. I profusely apologized and told him that it was the worst mistake I could ever make. I don't want the relationship to end and I really want to salvage it.",29Mar2020,2

13,"Toss Away and also first post ever, so if this is hosed I am sorry.   

I live in a two unit apartment with a shared door, it is the only entrance and exit to the property and also the only way of accessing the basement where the laundry is located.   I live in NYS. 

My neighbor in one of the units hasn’t had a job in a good long time.   He is out of money and washing pants with shampoo.   I feel bad for the guy so I have turned a blind eye to a lot of stuff.   With covid I am now concerned.  

I believe he is running a business selling illegal stuff from his house.  At all hours of the day and night strangers, including some homeless people, stop in to do business.   There have been somewhere around 30 people in the last 24 hours.   They are all using the same door, I have bumped into them in the hallway while doing laundry and in the street.   My other neighbors have asked what is going on.   It concerns me that he is inviting people into the property all the time, he is leaving the door opened.  This presents a health concern for me and my family as well as a safety concern with the number and type of people coming in and out.   

I feel like I should report this, but I fear retribution, and I fear that morally cutting off his income and potentially getting him arrested during a public health emergency is not the right thing to do.   I am really struggling with this, my health is important especially since I am taking care of my parents, but also I don’t want to be the person that ruins this guys life.

14,"I work for Mark's private office. Over the past few years, it has been hell here. Management bullied us and created a hostile work environment, workers have been sexually harassed, and an employee was even assaulted. The issues here have been extensively coverage by the press, just google Mark Zuckerberg and family office. When some us complained, they shut us up, even fired a few. In order to get justice for the employees here, I need your help to find a loophole in the non-disclosure agreement and the forced arbitration agreement we all had to sign. If you have any legal advice, please post!

&amp;#x200B;

This NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into by and between \[MPPR LLC; Weststeet LLC; Limitless Specialty Services LLC\] a California limited liability company (the “Company”) and \[NAME\] (the “Employee”), as of \[DATE\], to protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information (as defined below) of or related to the Company and its Affiliates (as defined below) that Employee may receive, access or otherwise become aware of, in connection with the services (the “Services”) that Employee is providing or may provide to the Company and/or one or more of the Company’s Affiliates, Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them on Exhibit A attached hereto.

2. Employee shall take all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information from disclosure, using at least the same level of care asd Employee would use in the protection of her own Confidential Information.

Following the completion or termination of the Services, or upon the earlier written request  of the Company, Employee shall (a) promptly return to the Company all Material that Employee had accumulated or developed, whether completed or in process, and (b) delete from all of Employee’s computer systems, databases and devices all Materials that Employee had accumulated or developed, whether completed or in process. Employee shall not archive any Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any Materials. 
6. Employee hereby recognizes and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to grant Employee any right, title, or interest, by license or otherwise, in to any Confidential Information or Materials, including, without limitation, any inventio, patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right.

Other than as necessary or appropriate to fulfilling her duties as an employee of the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Employee shall not give any interviews for, participate in, pitch, write, prepare or assist or otherwise facilitate the preparation or making of, any films, documentaries, shows, presentation, advertisements, books, articles, blogs, podcasts, news or talk show segments, or any other publications, broadcasts, or recordings, or make any remarks or comments in connection with any of the foregoing, that mention ro relate to the Company or any of its Affiliates or the Services, in each case, without the Company’s prior written consent, which the Company is entitled to withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.

9. Employee’s obligations under this Agreement shall survive the completion or termination of the Services and shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue in perpetuity thereafter. 
10. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that state and without regard to any principles of conflicts of law. 
11. **ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY HEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND ANY OTHER DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE EMPLOYEE AND THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S AFFILIATES (ANY OF THE FOREGOING, A “DISPUTE”), SHALL BE DETERMINED FULLY, FINALLY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY NEUTRAL, BINDING AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL PROVISION OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.** The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or any successor thereof) in California. The arbitration will proceed before a single arbitrator, and it shall be initiated and conducted according to the JAMS comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator shall follow the substantive laws of the State of California, to the extent such laws are not inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, in adjudicating any Disputes. The arbitrator shall issue a written statement setting forth the award, which shall be final and binding, and basis therefor. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction, including awards of attorney’s fee and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Judgement on any award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction in California, and the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of such court for this purpose. 
12. Except where prohibited by applicable law, in any arbitration arising out of any Dispute, the arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party the cost and attorney’s fee reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator determines a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some, but not all, of the claims and/or counterclaims, the arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in instances where applicable statutory provisions require an arbitrator to award attorneys’  fees and costs under a particular standard, the arbitrator shall award costs and attorney’s fees in accordance with those statutes and applicable case law interpreting those statutes. For example, under California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (the “FEHA”), the arbitrator may not award costs or attorneys’ fees to the Company for defeating any claim brought by Employee under the FEHA unless the arbitrator deems such claim to have been frivolous or filed in bad faith. 
13. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of na arbitration proceeding and shall not, without the prior written consent of the other party, disclose to any other person or entity the fact, existence, substance, contents, or results of the arbitration, any arbitration hearing, the awards of the arbitrator, or any processing in connection with the arbitration, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits or to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law or judicial decision. 
14. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, (a) the Company and Employee expressly intend and agree that class action and representative action procedures shall not be asserted, nor shall they apply, in any arbitration arising out of any Disputes, (b) the Company and Employee agree that each will not assert class action or representative claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise, and (c) each of the Company and Employee shall only submit its or her own individual claims in arbitration and will seek to represent the interests of any other person. 
15. Nothing in Section 11-14 of this Agreement shall be construed to prevent either Employee or the Company from obtaining available provisional injunctive remedies from an appropriate court before an arbitration is filed, upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief. The request for a provisional remedy does not remove the dispute from final resolution by the arbitrator and does not waive the requesting party’s right to arbitrate or compel arbitration of claims arising out of or related to this Agreement. 
16. Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that money damages or other remedies at law would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy for any breach or violation of, or default under, this Agreement. In particular, Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that (a) each of the covenants set forth in this Agreement is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the Company and its Affiliates, (b) the nature and scope of each such covenant is reasonable, and (c) any violation or breach of any such covenant may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company and its Affiliates. Therefore, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent any such breach, violation or default by Employee to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof against Employee, in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of which shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that Employee will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that there is a sufficient or adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law, in equity or otherwise. 
17. If the provisions in Section 11 of this Agreement are determined for any reason to be unenforceable or inapplicable to a particular Dispute, then the portion of such Dispute that is not subject to arbitration shall be instituted exclusively in the federal and state courts having competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, Claifornia. Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such Dispute or portion of such Dispute that is not subject to arbitration, and waive any objection or defense of inconvenient forum or improper venue in connection therewith. 
18. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to 18 U.S.C Section 1833(b), Employee shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, of (b) is made in a compliant or other document filed in a lawsuit or other document filed in lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. If Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of Employee and use the trade secret information in the court processing, if Employee files any documents containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
19. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision or provisions shall be ineffective only to the extent such invalidity or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or provisions, or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or a waiver of such provision on any other occasion. 
20. Employee shall not assign or transfer any of his/her rights or obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall bind or inure to the benefits of any successor of any party hereto to the same extent as such party is bound hereunder. 
21. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions, representations, promises and agreements among the parties with respect to such matters. 
22. This agreement can be modified, supplemented or amended only in a writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 
23. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall consities once and the same instrument. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that delivery of a signature by facsimile or in .pdf form shall constitute execution by such signatory.

I have a 13 year old little sister that is diagnosed with Autism and OCD, she is also about 6 foot tall. We also have a 13 year old brother and 9 year old sister. For the past year I have not lived with her. Her behaviour left me (26) living in fear and significantly affected my mental health while living with her as her behaviour escalated. 
Personally myself and many members of the family do not believe these are correct or complete diagnosis'.
Our Mum has suspected something was atypical with her since she was about 4 and it took 4 years of her persisting to finally get a diagnosis. 
Until recently she had been living with her Father, however as he is high risk and due to recent incidents involving the police needing to be called she is no longer allowed to stay there. 
She is very violent when she thinks something 'isn't clean', even after cleaning/bleaching the toilet 3 times all over she will claim it isn't clean as she can 'smell wee', she will not allow anyone to enter her room, she has to do all her own laundry as if anyone else touches it, it has 'germs' on it.
This is all daily behaviour for her. CAHMS refuses to work with her as she is 'hostile', she hasn't been to school in a year as we can't physically drag her and force her to stay there.

The 'incidents' include:
-smashing the glass on our Mum's front door window to force entry into the house
- wrapping a scarf around my dog's neck and threatening to strangle her as we were in an argument
- throwing away her Dad's essential medicine that he will die if he doesn't take
- messing with the settings on her Dad's medical bed
- weeing herself because the toilet wasn't clean
- threatening our Aunty with a knife because she was told she couldn't use the washing machine as her Dad's medical items were in the process of washing
- Throwing Bleach/Cleaner/whatever liquid she can get her hands on (including a smoothie from the fridge) all over the house
- cutting holes out of her clothes where there was 'dirt' on it.
- fracturing our Mum's rib attacking her.

And many, many other things.

To explain my dislike of her only being diagnosed as asd/ocd:
- She can 'turn off' her behaviour if she thinks someone is recording her (though recently it makes her behaviour worse) 
- her behaviour often isn't impulsive, it is calculated and devious. She will wait and deliberately go for the thing that she knows will cause the most upset. 
- she thinks everything is a joke and no one can do anything that will actually affect her
- if she can't be bothered she can ignore things that would usually cause a 'melt down' 
- she seems to enjoy the upset and fear she causes through her behaviour and threats, she has said she doesn't care and has even laughed at the scars that she has left on our little brother. 

The issue we are having is: until last month the police refused to intervene, the issue for a over a year seemed to be:
Social Sevices won't evaluate her unless she's arrested, the police won't arrest her until social services has evaluated her.

There is no helping us. Within the past couple of months people are starting to actually act, for instance after messing with her Dad's medical bed and him phoning the police asking for her to be removed, they (after a year of leaving her with him despite his pleas and begging he was feeling threatened) arrested her and she was in jail overnight.
She was released, but had to go to our Mum's house.. This is awful as she has some sort of dogma against my Mum, our little brother and sister and  just Mum's house in general.

She had a 'meltdown' because she believed that Mum's dog had done a wee (she hadn't) it got throughly cleaned, but she decided it wasn't good enough. My Mum for a change shut my sister in the bathroom and locked the door because she threated to ruin all the food and the current situation limiting availability, plus our Mum currently out of work and not having the spare money.

My Mum phoned social services and told her she was in the wrong and she can't shut my sister in, it's her, our youngest sister and our brother that have to all be shut in the bathroom. My Mum argued that she had previously thrown bleach everywhere, sprayed cleaner in the cats face, broken the front door window to escape the house... Social services did not care.

What is my Mum supposed to do?!?!
As my partner is still working I don't want to take my younger brother and sister and put them at risk, plus my brother is extremely attatched to our Mum since his Dad's accident. As Dad is in extremely high risk he can't take the other two who have been in school. 
Police will either not do anything or just arrest her overnight then release her back to Mum again.
Social Services have also acted like they don't give a $h%£.

Please. If anyone has ANYTHING they can advise, anything at all, we are desperate.
We can only imagine that people will only really care and get involved if/when she actually does stab, kill or poison someone or something.",29Mar2020,0

However I am under the age of 18, have no job, and can’t order anything without my mother knowing. I have enough money for an item (around $200) that I really would like to order, but I’m not sure how to buy it without my mom being suspicious of how I payed for it.

18,"Just half an hour ago, my mom walked into my room, plopped onto my bed and started asking me what I was doing, how my online classes are going, etc. 

Then, out of nowhere, she asks if I had been talking to a boy she introduced me to. Last time we talked was in June and the only reason why I dmed him in the first place was because my mom made me. I answered no and she forced me to message him again. 

The thing is, I have no interest in him (he lives all the way in Texas btw whereas I’m up north) and she forces me to talk to him. 

I’m f17 and I’ve never had an irl boyfriend before. I had one my freshman year but my mom quickly put an end to it because it was long distance and she doesn’t believe long distance relationships are real. 

The only time she talks to me one on one is when it’s about boys and I hate it. Whenever she brings it up, I get super anxious and cry once she leaves the room. 

People have told me in the past that I need to talk to her but that seems impossible. Whenever I have tried voicing my opinion, in the calmest way possible I should add, she ends up yelling and crying and usually takes away my phone (most of the time, to look through it). 

I really don’t know what to do. Also, sorry for the longish read.",29Mar2020,4
19,"I (F,23, no previous respiratory conditions, been treating anxiety) have been self-quarantined with my family for 2 weeks now. My boyfriend (23, has bronchitis) is in the same situation.

We are in Brazil where the lockdown is not mandatory but strongly advised. Only essential services working. We both have health insurance and live in a good neighborhood, so it’s very safe in theory. We leave our houses to go to the supermarket and pharmacy. 
I’m currently not taking any meds and the pressure of this outbreak is making my anxiety bad. I can’t sleep, can’t eat more than a meal per day and am haunted by the constant thought that my bf is going to die from this disease. As I said before, the real chances are very small, since both our families are quarantined. I think about the possibility of him dying all day - very invasive thoughts - and cry most of the nights. I just sleep when I’m finally exhausted and that’s when I dream he’s dead. I’ve been panicking because he’s at risk due to bronchitis and I’m afraid he won’t make it. Right now he’s healthy and has no contact with infected people, so it’s not a rational thought. I don’t know what to do bc sometimes I think I simply am not going to stand this situation anymore.

I wanted to join the army because I got caught up in all the glory and other things played up by friends and the recruiters. Also due to my whole family enlisted at some point in their lives.

23,"This will be long and I’m very sorry in advance. My mother is almost 70, and she recently joined Instagram to follow my family as we have moved to another state recently for a job. She loves seeing the pictures and likes to follow other accounts that are mostly family or dogs. 

She has a few different mental illnesses that she can live with if she takes her meds, however those same meds seem to have impacted her critical thinking skills and her memory to a degree. She has always fallen for what she calls “business opportunities” which are in reality pyramid schemes or just outright scams. She has lost tens of thousands of dollars. She owns a couple rental properties which I mostly dealt with when I was younger, until I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. She survives with those and is always trying to help single moms, as she was one, or anyone down on their luck. She has been taken advantage of a LOT. 

However, over the past five years, she has mentally gone downhill and has become even easier prey. My aunt and her church are her biggest support systems locally but she doesn’t tell anyone everything. She hides a lot and if anyone says anything to disagree, she will put them on an info diet or just cut them off. One tenant “works” for her doing side jobs but she just blindly trusts him and pays what he asks for no apparent work. He told her that he needed a car but couldn’t get a loan so she went out and BOUGHT HIM A CAR with cash that I think must have come from her retirement. He was supposed to pay her a monthly payment but he rarely does and she put the title in his name. 

She has fallen for people online who tell her they’re men, usually single fathers, and are wealthy and tell her all the nice things and pay attention to her. Then she ends up buying them a plane ticket or buying presents for their alleged children or whatever. Once the money dries up, or they get what they want, they disappear. A couple of them proposed to her (never having met in person of course) and she accepted. A couple years ago, she texted me excited about her wedding to one of these men and that she had “finally found (me) a daddy”. I replied back that I was 35 years old and did not need a daddy. I stopped hearing of this person and she let it slip later that she had paid for his plane ticket but then he disappeared. 

Now, this is happening again. Someone on Instagram contacted her right after she got on there and has spun this whole lie again. He (I will refer to this person as a he just for ease) has convinced her that he is a single father in love with her. He has told her that he is a 41-year-old man who lives in California but immigrated from Italy and has said European men love older women. He said he immigrated to marry a woman in America and they had a child and so he is now a citizen. But that the woman and he divorced and she and their son are now living in Australia. He told her he was a contractor in a city in CA. When I searched his alleged name, no contractors came up by that so then he said he was a civil engineer. Now he’s telling her he is applying for a job in Denmark but is having trouble purchasing something to apply and needs Bitcoin. 

The amount of craziness that my mother is believing is insane to me. My aunt, my husband (who is also 41) and I have been pointing out all the red flags and I got her to finally watch several episodes of Catfish to try to get her to understand how people can fake pictures, social media, etc. It didn’t really work. He told her that their relationship is affected negatively by her telling people and so now he’s telling her to cut off her family. 

I see this person’s account as one she follows on Instagram. I don’t know how to stop her giving this person money or stop her heart from being broken again. She ignores all of us and is ready to cut us all off. She is already having money trouble and will have nothing left for her remaining years. Is there any way I can expose this person or report them or anything? My aunt thinks she would be suicidal if this person broke up with her or disappeared so I have to be very careful. It is so hard for us all to watch this and I’m hoping someone can tell me how to protect her. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR  My older mother is being preyed upon by a scam artist. How do I help her?",29Mar2020,2
24,"I think I have a problem with conforming, because I feel like it´s something that society forces on me. I´ve always valued freedom above everything and don´t like to be tied down unless it´s my choice to. I´ve been wondering for a long time whether or not this is a rebellious phase I´ll eventually grow out of, but it´s been a couple years now and I still feel the same way. I can see the benefits of conforming to what society expects you to value and do, but it´s not worth it for me. To clarify, what I mean is not that I am a ""rebel"" in the sense that I refuse to follow rules, but more in the regards of values. I feel like society wants me to value certain things and thereby act in a way that is harmonious, content, quiet etc. Now, I totally understand why, but it just feels wrong. I´m not a sociopath, I guess.

I was born and raised in a wealthy first world country, but have distant family members that still live in rural towns in China. My father made it a point to take me and visit them throughout my childhood in order to widen my perspective. Yes, you read about poverty online, but you don´t understand it until you´ve lived there and felt it yourself. It´s hard for me to go around pretending as if everything is fine whilst doing all these typical, opulent middle class activities. Oh yes, don´t worry, you look fine in that photo. Oh yeah, look at that tryhard, what a loser. Yeah, I´ll ditch school to go to your party. Yeah, I´ll buy all these useless things because they look cute. Haha, just spent 500 dollars on a sticker. Oh no, the 20th boy I´ve liked the past month doesn´t like me back, my life is over. Yeah, I´ll virtue signal with you. It´s just so stupid and I get bothered to the point that I think I´d probably function better just having grown up in the bubble as everyone else. I hate it that people don´t appreciate how blessed they are simply by the virtue of having been born where they were. I hate the culture of contentment. I hate how fixated we are on harmony. It´s so hypocritical so say things like ""Don´t be materialistic"", ""You try too hard"", ""Be happy with what you have"", when you´re born with a silver spoon. People only say that because they were born into ""wealth"" It´s such a typical thing for rich people to say. ""Money isn´t everything"" - Multi-millionaire.

But

I understand that most people here (in my country) probably weren´t raised the same way I was. It´s not really anybody´s fault. I just feel like my perspective on the world is in misalignment with the society I live in. I´m at a crossroad where on the one hand I find it difficult to ignore what is going on in my head, but on the other where I kind of want to force myself to get along with more people. I have a couple of friends with whom I share values, but I´ve very often dismissed potential relationships on the basis of their world view (which reflects on their values and actions). I just don´t know what I should do right now. I hate hypocrites more than anything in the world, but it feels like I have to become one to fit in / succeed. Networking is everything, and I guess I just gotta dive into it even if it feels disingenuous.

Any advice?

25," 

Beginning of the year started off as a downhill! T\_T;; In such a short amount of time I started texting to a classmate of mine about little things because I wanted to be their friend. Have like interests and all that. But it's hella, hella easy to tell that the classmate liked me. Though even with that I still wanted to be their friend. So one day when they confessed I infirmly replied no and I wanted to be friends and obviously they'd try again. They really want to get me to like them and I've heard about how their childhood went (the abuse, drugs, relationship with parents) i felt terrible and I wanted to make them happy but I'm sure that to them that they think that a relationship may be the ONLY way to happiness. I disagree with that. Time skip a bit later I hear some rumors about them that were confirmed to be true and it brings out the really nasty stuff about them... That brought my whole day to a zero. I realize that this person has been very touchy towards me despite not knowing them for long but I've always brushed it off to a side that it was just a typical friendly gesture. Back when I heard about this I broke down during class because I didn't want to see them. Ive met the person, the real evidence against them. I've told my friends about this and they told me that I should not hang around them and disappear on them because they were being toxic. I don't really understand what toxic could mean but I heard it was something along the lines of using someones emotions. They apologize a lot for no good reason. They often have times when they're super upset and have real bad anger issues. they think real positive about me but not for themselves. They're super needy of me and would become angry and annoyed if I weren't around one day to chat with them. They can talk continuously about me and in the end it could just be a conversation about me but rarely not that much of them.

I'm reminded of a promise a while back that they wanted to keep which was to talk after graduation day. I really don't want to talk to them because of the correct rumor (and me being afraid) but thinking about it makes me feel guilty. In all the honestly, despite all the friendly gestures and gifts, I feel that it makes me a bad person because I've accepted those gifts and such but I've made sure I didn't NEED those gifts. Ive made it clear to them already that I don't want to be in a relationship, that we could just be friends and I've ignored them since the day I broke down. They don't even know why I've been around them for that long. I'm sure they have mental issues due to traumatic experiences which is why I stayed around because I was worried. I've talked to a counselor about this with evidence and they should've had things sorted out before the whole covid-19. Ive deleted all their contacts except on one platform but should I delete that too?

TLDR: Classmate loves me but I don't love them back. The reason why I've stayed with them for long was because I was worried for them but I broke off contact because I was afraid of them over a certain thing they did. I deleted their contacts except on one platform and im reminded of a promise that they want to talk after graduation a while back before all this drama. Should I delete it and completely ignore them or not?",29Mar2020,1
26,"My (18m) girlfriend (17f) was made to go stay with her very rude elderly grandmother to take care of her. My girlfriends father said she would be there for a week. It has been almost 3 weeks. Her grandmother’s trailer has no washing machine so she has been wearing the same clothes for the entire duration. Her parents won’t answer her calls or tell her when she’s coming home. The other part to this is my girlfriend who is still in HS, cannot complete her schoolwork. Her school like most has moved to online school due to COVID and some of the resources require to be accessed by a school device. Her parents won’t bring her school laptop, and even if they did she couldn’t connect to internet because the grandmother lives in the country, two towns away and several ISD’s from where she goes to school. I’ve been able to personally witness and confirm all of this because her grandmother asked me to come up there to mow her property. The grandmother was polite to me but treats my girlfriend like a servant and belittles her the entire time.

I'm 21 and I still feel like I haven't met anyone who I've formed a genuine romantic connection with. I'm not wishing for a fairytale love story. I just see so many people in my life with their *person* and it's hard feeling like I've never had that.

I've had one girlfriend who I didn't really like tgat much. Then, before this pandemic began, I met a perfect woman on Tinder, but everything went south when I crossed her boundaries and didn't give her any space. In the first case, I wasn't that interested in my partner, and I was with her so that I wouldn't be alone; obviously it ended in disaster. In the second case, I was too attached to the *idea* of a person that I couldn't pay attention to the woman in front of me. That also ended inn disaster.

All that said, I think I've reached a point of maturity now where I'm ready to look for someone to form a healthy relationship with. But now the world is on pause, and I have to wait. And I have to learn to be okay with being alone.

Ironically, I'm super introverted, and need to be alone most of the time. But introverts still have social lives and I feel like I've always lacked that. Perhaps I just need more friends to talk to consistently, but even then, I can't go out to meet anyone now.

Through a mutual friend, I recently learned that she ignores me whenever someone compares us. Like if someone says, ""Wow, [friend] is very good at drawing like [me]"". She gets really angry because of that. I thought that I could somehow change my ways to stop making her mad, but after knowing this, there was nothing that I could do.

I had decided that what this was doing to my mental state was not worth being in contact with her, but she doesn't really have any other friends. I have slowly tried to cut her off, but I can't fully cut her off because she would have no one to talk to. I was hoping for one of our mutual friends to come back from the US, but she changed plans, and can't come back. I don't know if I should cut her off anymore, or if to just hold on until she finds another friend.

I'm sorry if this is all confusing

TL;DR
I've been friends with someone for a long time, but she would ignore me on random days without telling me why. I asked her why before, but she didn't tell me. I found out later that she doesn't like us being compared, so she ignores me for a day. Since I can't change to try to fix this, I have been slowly cutting her off, but I can't cut her off fully because no one else is her friend.",29Mar2020,1
49,"So, I’m on birth control (the pill) but have my few slip ups of missing or taking late, I will admit. This is the only form of protection my boyfriend and I use. My last period was February 22nd-25th, very normal. The next month I had a light, one day, followed by a couple days of light spotting happen on March 18th. This concerned me and I decided to get a pregnancy test on March 27th. I took the test in the morning, after drinking coffee and water which I later learned you should take it before doing that, anyways. The test came up with a solid negative line but had a very very slight bit of a positive line. Very faint. Almost impossible to see u less you look really hard. Assuming it was negative I set it down and went back to sleep (it was about 5 am). I woke back up a couple hours later and out of curiosity looked back at the test to see it was the same but the positive maybe just a tad more prominent. After doing some research online (not always a good idea but I can’t help myself) I am torn between it being an evaporation line or a faint positive. Any advice from someone or some people who have had this same experience? Also, if I should test again, how long should I wait?",29Mar2020,1
50,"I have an old friends number. Me and her were really close. Me and my girlfriend agreed we won’t talk to her for personal reasons. But I have the urge and need to talk to her... 

I have -and it sounds very weird- caller her with my caller ID not showing just to see if my number was blocked and it wasn’t. When she answered, I froze and muted myself. 

I’m scared if I talk to her she’ll tell my girlfriend and issues will be caused between me and my girlfriend. But I really wanna just talk to her. I just... I don’t know what to do.",29Mar2020,1
51,"My question is; how do I do deal with the damage? 




Background info; I am in 9th grade, most of this is online since quarantine and all. I have a boyfriend already. There is a new kid from a month ago, very racist and very spoiled. He constantly calls my friend beaner as an insult. He himself has no friends as far as I know. He did stare at me a lot before school got cancelled which I always thought was because I was Salvadoran (again, racist) so I ignored it. I don't really like confronting people that much.




Actual issue; I got a message last night from what I assume is new kid's brother. He started teasing me and saying sexual things to me until he sent me a picture of drawings saying that it was the new kid's. They weren't exactly innocent drawings either. Mainly sexual and just very graphic images of me. There were a few other people too but mainly it was me. It was just unsettling. I turned off my notification and chilled out while trying to forget it. I thought it'd be better to do something in the morning and just tune out then. I slept and when I woke up, I had a bunch of messages from others. Apparently his brother posted it on his account and news spread. The new kid messaged me and said he was sorry. I told him it was okay and that he should get rid of the drawings which he sent me a video of him doing (threw in the fire place) so that I know he followed his word. He started talking about how people kept sending him really harsh messages. He even sent a photo of a text telling him to go die. I told him to deactivate his account so that he wouldn't have to see that shit and make a new one without his name or phone number attached. We kept talking on there and he really has been going through it. I told my boyfriend as he was mainly friends with everyone in the school. He got upset and bothered. He did get some people to lay off him but he still got bothered by it. He kept saying how I shouldn't be talking to him and that I am just gonna enable him to keep going. I kept telling him that it'll be fine and I will keep him in the loop should anything happen. He eventually agreed to it but he is still uncomfortable with me helping the new kid. Tho I wouldn't do anything, I highly value loyalty in myself and others too.  







I know this guy is like a grand asshole but he is also a person too. I believe that no one deserves to be bullied at all. Thing is though I don't know how to make it stop and what I can do. This guy is spiralling and I am not sure how to help him. I have spiraled (alone) before in a very bad depressive episode so I emphasize. He keeps saying that he hates himself and doesn't wanna exist anymore. The few girls he drew are pissed at me for helping him tho, they even got a friend to ""try"" to hack my account so they can find his new one. It didn't work though. What can I do to help him?",29Mar2020,1
53,"Hello there. A few days ago, I posted on this sub about my mom (52 F) she got mad at me because I confronted her about her narcissistic behavior. She’s in good terms with my brother (who apologized even though he did nothing wrong) except me. She hasn’t spoken to me in a week. But she has yelled at me, tried to kick me out, I told my dad (53 M) if I could stay with him and he said no, that I wouldn’t have the same comfort. And here’s the thing that’s been bugging me: my mom kicked my dad out because of our safety, but the minute we disagree on something, she tells me to clean up my shit, and throws whatever is in sight at me. She throws my clothes, I asked her why, and she said “Because I want to throw your clothes.”
Like, wth? Just yesterday, my brother and me went to get groceries with my dad, and my dad didn’t even ask how things were with my mom. He asked via text, but he doesn’t ask me irl. Then, my mom yelled at me again for something that happened a few months ago: I got money from a scholarship, and I wouldn’t give her any money, since I’ve been saving up for college. (I once gave her a hundred bucks, and to this day, she hasn’t paid back) and she said I should’ve given her my money since I owe her my life, since she took care of me, fed me, and so on. I told her that, as a mother, that’s her role. And she said it wasn’t, and that I’m supposed to take care of her.
I think the reason why my dad is more caring over text is because he’s trying to get my brother’s and I custodies. My mom, ALWAYS, whenever we go out with our dad, tells us that we shouldn’t talk about anything personal with him. 
I turn 18 in July, and I wish I could run away to college and never look back. Both of them have been very abusive (mentally, physically (only my mom) sexually, gaslighting, etc)
I actually wanted to go to a college out of state: it’s in the capital, but my mom said absolutely not. My dad also said no. I have some family from my dad’s side there. My mom often tells us that they hate us, but I don’t remember them ever being mean to us. I think she told us that so we wouldn’t reach out to that side of the family.
I also been thinking about telling a teacher about this. Maybe they can help me make a plan, right? 
A friend is also applying to the college I want to attend, so I wouldn’t be entirely alone. I get why they’re scared, since bad things happen. But I’d take care of myself just fine! 
I just want to run away from this mess. I’ve been crying myself to sleep for the last week about how I just want to run away from here and be the true, amazing me. I feel like I can’t truly be me here. My therapist told me that running away isn’t an option, and that I should confront them. But she doesn’t get that it’s not safe for me.
Just thinking about the time they overhear that I was bi makes me shake. My mom almost hit me again. I get scared every time I hear my mom’s footsteps. And whenever she goes out, i feel so much relief. I honestly want to live my life free. I want to reinvent myself from this mess.
I should mention that I’m attending college this fall (my local college, it was both of my parent’s idea) but they often do international exchanges, and that could also be another option. But I don’t want to wait that long. I honestly don’t think it’s good for my health to stay here. I already have OCD, anxiety and ADHD, and being around them just makes it worse. I just need and adult that can help me make a plan. As I mentioned, I was thinking about telling a teacher, but I’m afraid they’ll tell my parents, or think that I’m overreacting. I don’t know what to do anymore. In the worst case scenario, my mom would just threaten me to put me up for adoption again. But I’m about to be 18. Can’t I do something? I should also mention that unfortunately, I don’t live in the US.",29Mar2020,1
54,"Last year in 2019, I was a freshman in college. First semester was rocky, but second semester I had finally settled in and it. was. awesome. My best friend and I lived in the same dormitory building, and we saw each other basically every second of the day-- we might as well have just been roommates. We would go for late night trips to the dining hall to eat cereal, some nights when our roommates were being annoying we would even just walk around campus in our pajamas late at night. We went out every weekend to parties, and we just had a good ass time together. I felt like my college was actually a home, not just a college campus/bubble of misery.

Also, my sleeping schedule wasn't fucked up like it is now. AND I worked out a bunch and was super fit. Not that I'm fat now, I just don't feel as great. I was super productive, waking up early every morning to run and going to bed at 10 OM sharp on weeknights. I definitely feel that that play a decent part. I'm always fucking tired now.

Around exactly this time last year, I met a guy through a mutual friend. He was amazing. He was my first huge crush. I'm talking like, major butterflies, like I was just totally head over heels. He would take me to parties over the weekends, or we would hangout in one of our dorms. He was so patient, goofy, and funny. I honestly thought and still think that we could be so good together. We talked from this time last year to about June 2019, then he ghosted me. I was SO giddy when we were talking, though. Anyone who has had a huge crush on someone knows what that feels like, and it's super fun to feel that way. Since then, I haven't had another major crush, I haven't met anyone who's given me butterflies. My life was already great before we started talking, but as having a crush goes, the colors got even brighter during that time. It kind of felt like everyday during that time period was like summertime, even though it was only March/April and we were still in school. 

I think back to my life this time last year and it just feels so happy. Running around campus with my best friends, it was springtime and about to be summertime, partying every weekend, my classes were going really well, I was fit, I was talking to a really amazing guy. The over the summer, nothing even happened to make me upset. I just slowly started becoming less and less happy. By the time sophomore year started in August 2019 I knew immediately it was going to be a shit show. It was just a culmination of everything-- I hated my living situation, I felt like I didn't get to see my friends enough, my anxiety came back for the first time since high school. Now that it's been a whole year since the last time I can honestly say I was truly happy, I'm getting an odd sense of FOMO, but it's like I'm jealous of myself from last year. It feels so stupid and embarrassing to admit. 

I just want that period of my life back. Even though it was like a solid 4-5 months, I want it back. I know happiness comes in waves, but it fucking sucks to be so miserable here. Sophomore year has been such a shit show and who's to even say that this summer is going to be better? I'm taking almost a full semester's worth of credits.",29Mar2020,1
55,"I (20F) have a difficult time initiating sex with my (26M) boyfriend. It’s not that I don’t want to have sex, in fact a lot of the time I do I just feel embarrassed or shy to initiate it. My boyfriend is normally the one to initiate sex. I know it bothers him that I don’t, and I do not blame him. It would hurt my feelings if he never initiated sex with me. I understand this is a problem in our relationship and I want to change it about myself. Every time I try to I just get embarrassed. He has reassured me that he likes my body, and I like his but I don’t understand why I feel so awkward or truly just embarrassed. We have talked about my feelings and he is always very reassuring, it isn’t anything he has done. We are normally a very affectionate couple so he says he needs me to be very direct in showing I want to have sex. Things like kissing and cuddling are very normal for us, so doing those types of things doesn’t really show him I want to have sex he says. He wants me to be more overt but it’s difficult for me because I am shy. I guess I am afraid he will think I’m gross or think that something sexual I try to do will be awkward.

56,"Because of the virus billions of people including me and my family should stay home for the best. 
I’ll keep it short, I’d like some help or some ideas for me to help my grandma cope with being lonley beacuse she lives alone. 
We have different houses but we dont meet for obvious reasons. 
She is in her 60s and healthy but because she lives alone, she gets very lonely sometimes and even depresed. 
We are her only support including her sisters and a few friends but we cant meet each other now. 
We talk every day on the phone which is the only thing I can do 

She has nothing to do but watch tv (which the news and ALL that information she consumes is not good for her mental health) she also cleans and cooks herself (she is not good at technology btw). 

In comparison, I personaly can help time pass by watching a tv show, reading a book,doing hw etc

58,"I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm sorry if this post ends up with a lot of unnecessary details and emotional venting, but I feel like I'm having a breakdown right now. My best friend since grade school (I'm 29 and she's 30, long time), and really the only friend I have remaining after my ex pretty much manipulated me into weeding them all out, is in the hospital right now on a ventilator since Wednesday night. It's not going well. She had to be restrained in order for the responders to care for her and get her into the ambulance and wasn't very coherent. I'm not even able to visit her, but from what I hear it's getting slowly worse. She caught COVID-19 from work despite taking precautions, and now all 3 of us have it (we live together at the moment). 

I have some pretty nasty asthma, I can't breathe lying down, can't remember the last time I had solid sleep, and my thoughts keep flip flopping between memories of my friend and I growing up, and the absolute fucking grief I feel knowing that she's likely not going to make it through this. At the same time I'm afraid for myself and my kid. She was in better health than I am, I'm terrified I'll wake up unable to breathe and not even be able to call for help.

I feel so incredibly selfish and guilty for even trying to think far enough ahead to consider the ""what ifs"" of where I'm going to go if things end badly. I'm angry at my own thoughts, like I'm already leaving her behind even if I know it's rational to have some kind of plan. I haven't slept properly in days, I keep texting her even knowing she can't see them or respond, knowing if she does get through I'm gonna get roasted for some of these sleep deprived crazy messages, but I don't care.

For years my ex ruined my self esteem, isolated me from friends, convinced me to leave my job and for the most part stripped me of any aspect of my life that I was passionate about. He treated my daughter and I poorly in a lot of ways and after helping me see that and taking me in while I got my life back together, this shit is happening. It would be like a slap in the face for her knowing I was thinking of going back. But I don't have any money, I was talked out of finishing school, I haven't worked in years. I don't think I even qualify for the stimulus, and I have no idea what I'd do with my daughter if I were to even find work. I doubt I'd be hired for anything more than retail or something similar, aka I'd have to leave home. It's all so fucked. I'm sweating and shaking, and I can't fucking breathe, I've lost my voice coughing, I'm so tired and sore, I can't even think straight let alone deal with all this. My only comfort right now is my daughter pretend-playing as the world's cutest doctor and giving hugs as medicine. She has it as well now but she's as healthy as ever, which I'm grateful for.

I don't know. I'm sorry this is long. If anyone reads this, please don't fuck around with covid.

This was done over messages because of the coronavirus which closed down our school. She didn't reply to me for a week. A week later, she said that she got invited to a another group, and that she will do it with them. So far in my team, I have no one. I desperately asked my 2 other friends but they said they were too busy. (Everything is closed down.... WOT?) The deadline to submit the teams are tomorrow, I got no one, I will be alone. Yay.

There aren’t many jobs available now, so when I saw community staff at a local senior assisted living I thought how great would it be to make a difference in someone’s life versus waiting for new job postings or working at amazon breaking my back. 


I got hired for full time with no experience, they are going to train me of course. However today after my first day of training online I’m a little nervous, mostly nervous for assisting with incontinence. Sorry if I sound immature but I really hope I don’t have to wipe ass...I think my hiring manager did say something about my title not necessarily having to, I think she said something about getting training to do that would pay an additional 2 dollars to the hourly pay. But it didn’t sound 100% certain that I wouldn’t be. I don’t mind help with showers but the poop part, would be icky for everyone involved I’m sure. I’m nervous if I’ve made the right decision, I do want to help but I don’t want to look stupid for not wanting to complete a possible task. A big reason why I applied is because of the coronavirus effecting the senior community, and I know senior homes need help right now. I would probably leave this position when things get “back to normal” anyways. 


I am also a student so the less work hours the better. What do you think? I’m not repulsed by the idea, I think we will all need help one day and I should treat these people like how I would want to be treated or like family. 
The poop thing though...

Last year I came to terms with myself and realized I like women (I am a woman).

Now.. I really am confused because I don't know if I really just don't like men anymore. When I see their bodies, it's whatever to me and not really pleasing, but women on the other hand are just gorgeous and pleasing to me. When I see lesbian couples I feel like I would love to be with a woman. I don't know if this info adds anything, but I'm from Venezuela, a very sexist country, but now in Europe.

68,"I guess you can say I play online games too much, but my mother is often passive-aggressive and toxic; often getting angry over the slightest mistake (or taking a second too slow for her liking).

Oftentimes, when she's in this state (which is very frequently), she resorts to degrading me. Calling me Worthless, stupid, etc., with a frequent threat of eviction on top of generally making me feel bad.

For context, I'm in the Phils. and our culture is *very* big on following the elders silently. Now, with mom, I feel generally strangled all the time: Can't talk without getting yelled at, the smallest action scrutinized and always unsatisfactory; leading me again to being degraded.

Now, I play games (online) because that's the only place where I feel **valuable**. Appreciated, even. The compliments there feel real compared to the compliments of my mother, which are often followed by her saying my passions are worthless and that I should focus only on my studies.

Now she often demonizes gaming, saying it destroys me; and I think her words are starting to get to me. Is it really an addiction if it's the only thing keeping me from feeling truly worthless?

And no, I'm not a shut-in. I've won international competitions and am an honor student; on top of being the current holder of the title National Impromptu Speech Champion. I'm also the model of my school in terms of extracurricular (intellectual) activites like Model UN and Impromptu Speech. So I don't think I can be considered a NEET or anything similar.

My mother has also degraded the above by stating they're useless in the  eyes of academic institutions to the point they're damn near useless in her (and slowly my) opinion.

69,"I’m not looking for a literal diagnosis but rather if the signs I’m presenting may *just* be similar or should be looked into further. No special expertise needed. Just want some opinions on this.

I have no particular fondness towards anyone. Everyone I’ve met with so far and the everyone that I’m still in contact with all feel below me. I have a strong dislike towards others *because* I feel above them, as if we can’t relate or we’re too far apart. 

I’m never happy, sad or angry when it comes to life, though I do feel irritation very well. People irritate me *a lot*. A majority do. This may be one of the reasons I feel so above or strongly about myself. 

I have no problems manipulating people nor separating myself from them completely. You use those you need and discard the ones you don’t. It’s a given that relationships are based on what a person can offer you. I accept this. I don’t feel guilty about this. My morality and hope for humanity is slim to none.

I don’t feel the need to cure what I may or may not have. In the long run I see it more beneficial. If nobody means anything to me as much as I mean to myself then I’m fine with this. I don’t need anyone other than myself.

I also have suicidal thoughts regarding this. I’m not miserable and I’m not joyous. I can embody a happy, emotional, supportive person but at the end of the day I’m not. My life has no meaning if I don’t succeed at what I put so much effort in to do. I blame my higher thoughts for myself to be the cause of my suicidal thoughts. If not my rather self-centered nature.

I always feel I need to be in power. It’s either my way or nobody’s. If I’m opposed I feel understandably irritated but may sometimes feel physically violent. I want to monopolise people. I feel the need to be desired, but not to reincorporate these feelings. I don’t get much of a thrill out of things. Rather, I entertain people for the short while that I’m interested.

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I am just really struggling. 

Last year, my sister was raped by someone we all called a friend. He was found guilty, but allowed to stay out on bail until sentencing. Which was meant to be last week. 

Because of corona, the sentencing was indefinitely put on hold. 

We’re all really struggling with this. Knowing he’s out there. Knowing he is happy with his family after destroying someone else’s life. And he’s just free, for however long...

I don’t know what advice I really need. But anything to help us hold it together over here. We’re all just strung out on this and drained from fighting this. Anything would help...",29Mar2020,1

75,"I didn't have a good title but let me explain:

I'm a married man and new dad to a 2 month old. My sister in law has had previous relationships that always fell thru because they would always treat her wrong, life changing decisions pretty much (including engagement). At some point, she wants to have a child but she now prefers a donor seeing how difficult it can be having a partner. I've spoke to my wife already about it and even briefly mentioned it to my sister in law. 
I would love to donate to her. I just feel that there's more love to it. Knowing who I am and how much a good husband/dad I am to her sister (my wife). Yea, it's like a father/uncle situation but no matter, means I'll always be here for her too. That male rolemodel going beyond.
However, I wondered, is it illegal with documentation and such? Sorry for the bad grammar, figured I ask since researching tends to lead into incest related cases when it's simply my awesome sis in law. 
She deserves so much, she works so hard. Very determined and super loving towards her family and close friends.",29Mar2020,1
76,"Recently i got into a textual conflict. A person was commenting that how celebrities should be ashamed and are pathetic people because they are not donating during this Coronavirus outbreak. Now here's a fun fact, the person calling them out has never done a charity work, in his entire life. During a natural calamity in our locality, there was a small fund collected in our college and a lot of people made contributions of whatever they could, but he wasn't among them. 

When i said him this he said he said if he had  money like celebrities he would easily donate a large chunk of it. There are few NGOs associated with our college and some of the students volunteer to work for them and this requires no money. He hasn't even volunteered for any NGOs. So i called him out on my WhatsApp status for his hypocrisy. Now he didn't like it and told me to delete the status. I didn't at first, but after some time, he told a friend of his who is our common classmate. That person told me to remove the status in a threatening manner. I just didn't want to spoil the friendship between us, so i removed it. But i told him that, he had crossed the line. 

He was talking in a foul manner, but i tried to keep my composure and asked him why he was talking like that. In that conversation i feel i went too low than i should've, just to avoid conflict. Now it's not like that the person threatening me could do something to me, because i have some very strong friends in college, but i chose not to involve them. 

When i joined the college, i had always had a motto: not to have conflicts at any cost. It was not because i am weak, but before that at school whenever i had conflict with anyone, my ego wouldn't let me talk to them. And it took a toll on my emotions. Now this time although, i was successful in avoiding a conflict, i am holding a grudge against him and i can't get this out of my mind.  Partly because i never expected him to behave in this manner with me. I feel like i went lower than i should've gone. Should i stop living with this attitude?",29Mar2020,1

79,"Alright Imma share as much detail as possible so the full story is given, therefore the best advice can be given.

I am currently a 19 year old male freshman in college. The girl in the story went to my middle school, high school, and college. The person this story is about is a 19 year old female.

I didn't really know her in middle school, and rarely talked to her freshman and sophomore year but we knew each other. Throughout middle and high school Ive never really gotten any female attention so I had gotten accustomed to just accepting any female talking to me as just being nice. During junior year we became more acquainted but still not really friends. Once it was senior year of high school, we had more classes together and talked more, but nothing more than that. After the first semester I would say we were friends, I still just assumed nothing more than that. She texted me over Christmas break a decent bit, I was still oblivious, we never hung out over this time. Once we second semester started we continued basically just texting and talking in school. Once it hit about March though she actually asking me to go sledding once, and then asked for a ride to a game, and I think like 1 other invite to hang out. My friends weren't big fans of her, and basically encouraged me to say no. Over the week she sent that stuff I left her on read a few times, made up excuses, or just responded the next day saying I didn't see it. I did this mostly because I didn't even think about whether I liked her or not, even though I enjoyed talking to her. Well even after all of this she decided to ask me to a school dance, but eventually bailed on it (I assume cuz she didn't want to be rejected). I learned this year that she actually had prepared a poster as well, so she was pretty set on doing it. After that we still talked in school but didn't text, and when she did, I was very brief in my responses. Eventually she just stopped trying and we didn't communicate anymore.

Well once school ended we didn't have any contact, and college started, it wasn't until about 2 months in that my friend recommended I pursue her. At that moment I realized that I did miss seeing and talking to her, so I started to snapchat her and talk over that. ramped that up to asking if she wanted to get food with me and one of my friends (I know bad call, but I didn't wanna do 1 on 1 since it had been a while). It went well so as it neared exam time I asked if she wanted to study and we did. Asked her again to lunch but she was busy with exams/sorority stuff, so I payed off until it was Christmas break. Over Christmas we snapped a lot and texted some, and I asked her probably 2 times to go get some food but she said she was busy. Since then I only snapped her until school started. We texted about classes a little and actually ended up in 1 together so we sat next to each other. We talked during that but eventually she found out one of her female friends was in there so she talked to her more than me. I only snapped her during this time and texted only about classes though, and eventually decided it was time to move on. After a month I had successfully moved on until I saw her at a party while I was with my friends. At that point I didn't care we just said hi, hugged, and me and my friends moved on. 10 minutes later she texted me ""wya"" and that was all that was needed to obsess me again. That was 2 weeks Ago, and now Im still obsessed, just recently she left me on opened on snapchat and Im feel like its time to move on for good. Im struggling with how to do this though, I feel like if I just tell her I like her to get it off my chest then cut contact that Ill be able to move on, but maybe I'm not thinking straight.

Any advice helps. I like her a lot, but at this point I just need closure with this so Im not driven insane.",29Mar2020,1
80,"I honestly think my mom is developing Alzheimers. But I dont know what I, an 18 y/o who hasn't even gone off to college yet, can do about it. Note, while I'm 18, She's always been the forgetful type, but recently it's been to an extreme. Like just this morning, my brother and I played cornhole against her and my brother's wife. They won, and she got all excited about how she won and everything, so I guess you could say the game was somewhat of a big deal in her mind. Well by late evening, she couldn't remember if she won cornhole this morning or last night (granted, she was playing cornhole last night). Additionally, she couldn't even remember who it was she played against.

For dinner we ate chicken. We were using paper plates, and we fed skin and unwanted meat to our dogs as a treat. I went to throw away the plate for my dog, and she made it a point to tell me that I could throw it in the fire instead of walking to the trashcan. Not even five minutes later, she asked me if I threw away my dog's plate. She watched me throw it in the fire, after telling me to throw it in the fire, and I guess she couldn't remember that.

These are just examples from today. There's been some recent cases these past months that have made me suspicious. On the flip side, it could just be paranoia because of said recent cases and this truly is just innocent forgetfulness that I blowing up in my mind. She gave up alcohol for Lent, so she cant blame her forgetfulness on that. I'm just concerned and I dont know how to tell for sure or what I should do. I dont want to make this something it's not, and itd be pretty embarrassing for her if I claimed she was developing Alzheimers when she's truly just being forgetful.",29Mar2020,1

i have this friend who is really great and i love her and appreciate her. however she's made some hurtful comments to me repeatedly and i've always let them go because i'm not a confrontational person and i can just get over it. however she demands a lot of respect (very vocally) from everyone in her life and is constantly telling people that how they're treating her is ""unacceptable"" (like even if someone forgets to pay her back $5...). i once shared with her that i never tell people when they've hurt me because i just feel like they won't care enough to change their behaviour, and will just get defensive or find a way to make it my fault that i was hurt. she told me that if there's ever anything she does that hurts me, i can always tell her and she won't do that to me.

so earlier this week i finally spoke up about something and i was respectful, only explained my point of view and the specific actions that made me feel a certain way, and didn't make any assumptions about her. she replied accusing me of misunderstanding her and defending how she was such a nice person for listening to me complain about something that was bothering me (which seems like the opposite of something a nice person would do tbh). i replied clarifying my point of view so that maybe she would understand where i was coming from and she's been ignoring me for 4 days. i feel hurt because whenever she is upset with me i go over right away and hear her out and don't make excuses for myself (i know that even if i don't intend to hurt someone, i don't get to decide how i made them feel). i'm not getting the same respect from her that she demands from everyone in her life.

i messaged her again yesterday to clarify that i'm not mad at her and she doesn't have to reply if she doesn't want, but i needed to tell her how i felt. she's still ignoring me. this woman is a full adult and i feel this is childish. but am i judging her too harshly? am i the one at fault?",29Mar2020,2

I'm a sophomore in highschool and things are starting to ramp up for me in terms of the real world, but I've always had an issue in my life that I could never overcome, and that's being committed to healthy tasks.

In terms of school, this is mostly habits of procrastination that I've never been able to grow out of. I am above average education wise and look to have a good future, but even now I struggle to maintain good habits in order to do well in some of my easiest classes. Knowing how the world is changing around us (not only because of the virus, but on the topic of achieving happiness in today's society), the idea of not finding a reliable source of income scares me. 

This problem isn't only confined to school though, as it deeply affects my relationship at home with my parents as well. Both my parents are extremely religious and I'm totally fine with that, but my inability to maintain a spiritual connection to my religion has led me to be further and further away from both them and my religion.

103,"Me (22F) and my wonderful boyfriend (21M) have been together for around 9 months now. 

The first 3 months were amazing and we fell madly in love - then we went to different universities and started a long distance relationship. 

The next 3 months of long distance were very hard for both of us because we missed each other so much. Despite it being hard, we didn’t fight much and there was a lot of love between us.

The next 3 months, and leading to today, have been very hard and different. I am in my final year of uni so I have been very stressed. I became quite insecure and needy, we have had a lot of arguments about how often we call/text and I’ve been quite intense to be with. He’s a very laid back easy going guy, and so am I usually but it’s been hard and I can feel that I’ve been pushing him away. 

Now - both leaving uni because of corona and going to quarantine with each other. It’s going to be interesting spending so much time together again after being long distance. I really do love this guy and I miss how things used to be, before I made it harder and more difficult. I want to make amends in this time and make it fun and happy again.

109,"To preface this a bit no, this has nothing to do with the Coronavirus or the social distancing. I've been in this situation for quite some time now and it's been more or less the same. So I know a lot of high schoolers right now probably have concerns that are in the same ball park as mine but in reality they are pretty different. Also sorry if this is long, I'm not good at shortening things so I'll just leave a TLDR at the bottom. 

Anyways I'm currently in a situation where I'm enrolled in online school but am still technically a part of my physical school. It's set up that way by the administration so that I can do all the ceremonies (which don't seem like they will be happening now) and get a legit highschool diploma like the rest of my class. However I'm a master procrastinator you see. I managed to waste 4 months of work time by playing video games, having a horrible sleep schedule, and just occupying myself with basically anything else. I know to many on here this is probably going to be inexcusable behavior or just takes a bit of willpower to overcome but I can assure you this is more deeply rooted than that. 

I literally do not feel like I can do my work anymore. I've had bursts of energy (maybe once or twice a month) where I complete a fraction of my assignments and studies but it's just not enough. I've tried fixing my sleep schedule, planning a daily routine and it all just falls apart. I see the importance of graduating highschool and avoiding the GED path but I'm just too god damn lazy to do it. 

When I go to sit at my computer I get distracted by literally anything and everything and my focus breaks constantly. Writing one essay completely drains me for the day and considering that I still have roughly 80+ to go after that one that really isn't good. 

If anyone has gone through anything similar and has any advice I'd appreciate it. To better explain my situation I essentially have less than a month and a half to complete two and a half entire courses online. It's also not something you can really speed through either, as assignments are locked and you have to constantly coordinate and talk to your teachers which is extremely frustrating and prolongs things. 

TLDR: less than 2 months to complete 2 and 1/2 entire classes online and I have terrible procrastination and a short attention span when it comes to the coursework. not graduating is not a viable option so for someone in my situation what would you recommend doing?",29Mar2020,1

In addition, I got denied from this school I really wanted to go to so I might consider transferring after a year. However, if I go to community college then I can stay at home and have a bigger GPA since the classes are easier. I’ll also take more time to help my anxiety so I can go to my dream school next year.

114,"This is where I begin my story.... I’m 18 years old and for awhile I’ve felt signs of being lonely and overcame depression form the past. I’m a high school senior where 90% of people hate me and hence why I feel alone a lot of the time. All of my friends are outside of school.

I live in the tri state so when we went into quarantine I made a pledge that I was gonna tell the girl I like (also from outside of school) to let’s go on a deeper level of a friendship. I met this girl back in august as she just moved here but we felt a good connection from day one. 

Regardless me and her got super close and I began to get really food feelings for her and good vibes all the time. She started talking to someone and I didn’t think much of it as I was blinded by the situation at hand with the virus. I was not only looking out for myself but for my family the last few weeks as all this went down.

I found out yesterday there together and I feel just down and upset as I felt I missed out and I’m very selective when I like certain people because I see something beyond a few months, I want to go the whole way. I went for a run yesterday in a park nearby. I saw a lot of people my age with a significant other and I even got to sit down and admire nature. I looked around and felt alone. I wish I had someone with me.. it’s so ironic to me how everyone has told me even her. How do you not have someone yet? I’m a perfect type of person. I don’t like saying that about myself. I don’t feel I did too much to have anyone. It’s one reason why I had depression and it’s something I’m still fighting. I feel just overall upset and being in quarantine doesn’t help as I’m separated from everyone. 

I’m just trying to cope with this whole thing and I’m working through this in anyway. Everyone stay safe and thank you for reading.",29Mar2020,1
115,"I literally live in a cycle of realizing I don’t meet societal standards and therefor feel like my general assertion/confidence is unwarranted, so I show none. I can’t break the perspective that I shouldn’t participate in relationships. I find the benefit to be freeing up part of my consciousness, to focus on other areas of life in a much more intense way. Part of me does yearn for a meaningful relationship of some kind, I substitute with canine companionship and several very close friends. Is this normal? Is this a healthy choice? Has anyone felt this way and acted on it like this? Genuinely am not concerned with pity, I like to view my “problem” as just a general event brought on by the infinite possibilities of the universe.

121,"My husband and I have been married for a little over a year. We already have one baby. Where we live, rent went up A LOT, so we moved in with my parents until we can purchase a property or find an affordable place to rent. Obviously we're having a little bit of a setback with the coronavirus pandemic, so there's that. My period was 8 days late. I took a test. I'm pregnant. 

Terminating the pregnancy isn't an option for us. I don't feel comfortable with it at all. I haven't asked my husband what he thought of it, but I doubt he would be okay with that option either.

I brought up adoption. He said no. His reasoning is that we already have the one kid, what if she asks why she doesn't have any siblings when she's older and then we tell her we gave her sibling away? 

I tried explaining we're not in a position to have another one. We were using contraception, and obviously that failed. I was going to have my tubes removed, but with the pandemic, the surgery was put off, so here we are. I don't want another baby. Emotionally, I can't handle it. I've been struggling with PPD and I've come close to harming myself. I'm on medication now and I've been doing better...but still not the best. I really, honestly cannot have another one. I don't think I'd be able to handle it.

I did mention that if he was adamant about keeping the baby, I would not want to be the stay at home parent anymore. I would want to work and have him stay home, or we would have to find a nanny and make sure we get nanny cams and we would obviously have to have our own place by then...it's just really stressful even thinking about it. I didn't want kids to begin with. Now I have one. I wanted to be done. I was going to get sterilized. And now contraception failed, again, and I don't know what to do.

122,"“We are the only beings cape able itself reflection.” 

This statement haunts me.. the truth in it.
You see, I’m absolutely bewildered and in awe of life. The rules, regulations and restrictions along with the endless possibilities... The thing I have to accept but struggle to the most to accept is how we are all going to eventually waste away and die, if not sooner, maybe perish in some twist of fate or tragic accident. To say the least it troubles me. Deeply. On a level that would seem impossible to most. Of course it’s not always on my mind, it lurks in the shadows of it and reveals itself. The fear, the inevitability of it all gnawing at my thoughts until there’s nothing left but that. Terror. In its purest and most human form;. It just loves to pray on me in the night time it creeps into the covers and insomnia settles in to rest. 
The other thing I struggle to believe is how it seems that everyone is just okay with this?! How. Do they realise that everyone they’ve ever met will be dead this time next century or so! That everything will turn to nothing? It feels that I am screaming into an empty void with no echo. No one to hear me or catch me when I fall into the depth of insanity and drown in madness. Maybe I’m the selfish one. The one who refuses to acknowledge that one day they will be no more. This fate is one that everyone pushes to the back of their mind and simply don’t think about because of the unpleasant nature of this thought. I heard this quote once it’s unsettling yet beautiful: “ Life and death have been in love, longer than words can describe. Life sends gifts to death and death keeps them forever.” I must confess there is such beauty in life, it’s wonderful. Experiences that build memories, tears, laughter, love, tragedy.. it’s all the same. How we are born from the stars and the earth and how we will become the earth. NO! I think to myself I can’t accept it I won’t! But then again..what difference does it make wether I accept it or not the outcome doesn’t change only the fear and frustration increase. The only way to be happy “expect nothing and accept everything” and how we must be happy in life and enjoy what we have. But, what is happiness? Emotions? Chemicals. People tell me to not worry about the things we cannot change. THAT IS WHY I AM WORRIED. I don’t really worry about the things I can chance because of the solid fact that I can change them. The pointlessness is exhausting for me not liberating as some see it.. I wish I could chance my view, my perception of it all but I can’t. At least not as of yet I pray. I don’t believe in god. That will take too long to explain if I delve into my beliefs on religion and how it’s all not real etc. I wish that I could step outside myself. I feel trapped inside myself, engulfed in flesh and bone. I want to get out, for a day, a minute even a second or two. I’d look down at the backs and fronts of my hands in turn, feeling out of place and too self aware. Try it. And get back to me. If you think about it all long  enough you’ll go mad, and that’s exactly what it’s done to me folks, that’s why I am here writing this desperate to find an outlet, reaching out to others in hope to find someone who can help or understand. I am losing hope. Empty yet carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, along with the lightness of anxiety and heavy sense of dread. Help me to understand, to see, get me out or away from this state of mind. How can I stop this?! Before it’s too late...",29Mar2020,1

I’m never sure of what subreddits to use but this seemed like the most appropriate.

I’d like to start going on runs, working out and eating healthy. so far I think my mum has stocked us with enough healthy food to keep me going for a week of being healthy but I just wondered if anyone had any experience or ideas for keeping organised and motivated to do this? any apps, programmes or routines they could share? any recipes or food ideas? my goal is mainly to give my body a detox during this boring period of isolation.. feel free to dm me if you have a detailed response otherwise comment for others to see as well :)

Her father (37) and I have been together for 10 years and have two small children together. Her mom isn’t in the picture at all ever since she walked out of her life when she was 1. Tonight she came to me and asked me if we could talk. 

Last year she told her father that she thought she was bisexual, and her father chalked it up to teenage puberty and hormones and told her she couldn’t decide that because she was too young to understand what it meant and because her hormones were going crazy. I told her things could be confusing at that age but reassured her I’d support her either way. 

Around September I found out she was looking up information on hormone therapy and how to become a man. We discussed it and she said it was just something she was curious about. 

Today she confided in me that she was considering being trans. She’s been speaking to her social worker at school about it who sent us a letter saying she was very depressed at school and recommended some youth programs. Her social worker didn’t mention the trans part just said she was feeling down. She asked me to please keep it a secret from her dad since she felt like he would disapprove and try to change her mind. She said she was considering having her breast removed and had always felt uncomfortable about her high pitched voice. Recently she convinced her dad to cut her hair real short and said she got confused for a boy at school and that made her feel really good. 

I feel lost on this subject and don’t know how I can help her. I also know her dad will dismiss it as being just a teenage phase and she’ll get over it. He might even get upset and say she’s mental.",29Mar2020,1

My friend from my old school who we used to hang a lot at school has changed a lot, as in how he acts, I’ll start from the beginning. When I first went to this school I had no one else to hang out with other than my friend, we’ll call him ‘E’ just so you don’t get confused who I’m talking about. and another one named ‘J’, we were like a trio we liked games, memes, and YouTube, but that all stopped when another student entered the school and my friend ‘E’ from our group started hanging out with him, all I had was ‘J’ and after a few weeks or so I wanted to hang out with ‘E’ again and when I did he changed a lot, when I started hanging out with him again he was not like what he used to be, he now only hangs out with this new guy and only cares about stuff that is considered, “cool” such as sex, cool shoes, and drugs. I’m not saying those things are bad but it’s just I’m not interested in those things. One time we were in class one time and in class we were watching a film about chemistry and after that ‘E’ and this other person who will call ‘M’ started talking about sex and other stuff related to it, and after hearing all about it ‘M’ asked me if I watched porn, I wanted to act cool around them so I replied with, “Yeah”, and I felt like crap after that. I then decided to stop hanging around them and hang out with ‘J’ again because I knew he wouldn’t talk about that stuff. A year later I got hit hard with social anxiety and mild depression and as I went to school that year I always wore a hoodie since I felt very upset with myself and my life, and as I went to school, ‘M’ started calling me emo since my hair was naturally dark and covered my face and since I was wearing a hoodie. It really annoyed me that year so I never spoke to him but I did speak to ‘E’ frequently about music and games. Near the end of 2019 my parents moved me since I asked them if I could because of all the crap that happened in the year at the old school, and so I moved schools. At the new one that I’m currently at is amazing, I have a group of friends that accept me as myself and it feels so good to be accepted. Last week I texted ‘E’ about a song I liked and he thought it was good and we also talked about other things, after that conversation I had with him I felt as if he wasn’t interested in anything we used to be into but he’s nice to me though he’s just not the same anymore but I feel like he doesn’t want to talk to me.

For our first year and a half, we lived 3 minutes down the road from one another and about 9-10 months in he went to his hometown for a weekend and had sex with a high school hookup partner. He kept it from me for 4 months, then told me as we were making major career moves and struggling to find positions in the same city. We took a break and I laid new ground rules and forced him to make sacrifices but we ultimately stayed together, and have lived for the past year or so 250 miles apart. We made a plan to see eachother every other weekend, organized our entire schedules with work etc around that, and have stuck to it for the most part. About a month into LDR he went out with some of our mutual friends + some acquaintances and got blackout drunk, and supposedly he doesn’t remember but they told him he was heavily making out with one of said acquaintances at the bar. He “told me as soon as he found out”, “isn’t the least bit interested in her in anyway”, “doesn’t remember a single thing about that night”, etc. I wanted to burn them both alive. But I wasn’t gonna drive 250 miles to incriminate myself. I wanted to break up, but he drove to me to convince me why I shouldn’t, vowing to never partake in any mind altering substances without me present, among other things that were enabling or risk factors for his shitty behavior. I stayed with him, and this weekend was supposed to be his turn to come to me. He complained all week of runny nose, sore throat, cough, etc so obviously with COVID-19 pandemic and some of his symptoms resembling those, when he asked if it was ok if he didn’t come I said of course. But he, a man who generally goes to sleep at 2-3am every night and texts/calls me frequently throughout the day, has over the last 2 days ghosted me for long periods of time and “fallen asleep” at 10 pm (last night) or “forgot he had a phone” at 845 pm (tonight). I know everyones isolating right now but I am genuinely concerned. People are lonely and bored, it’s absolutely possible. I’m N O T going through this again. We have new career moves to make in the next 3 months and were planning to live together then, but I am absolutely not signing a lease with someone cheating or engaging in otherwise shady dishonest behavior.

135,"Help 
Also remember this is a hindsight kind of thing after much self reflection and internal conflict, debate and ""shoulda woulda coulda's""

Short version I've been in a relationship with someone I'm not physically attracted to he's already met my family they love him but i don't know what to do 

I guess the question I am asking is how do I break up with him as nicely as possible for those who do not want to read the entire thing 

In 2018 I was at the end of an on and off again relationship of 6years I went on vacation to vegas with the intention of dating *not starting anything but having fun 
On my last night there I was sitting by the pool and a guy asked to talk to me I was still drunk and hungover from the night before but we had great conversation hit it off exchanged numbers with the promise of keeping in touch even though we live about 5hrs away from each other...
A few weeks later we began texting each other we spent hrs on the phone, video chatting etc so his appearance wasn't a shock to me I definitely believe in calls over text so it was mostly calls we talked about everything he is smart and funny 
a month after constantly calling, texting, and video chatting I finally went to see him so his looks were not a surprise to me he was almost 300lbs at the time we met in Vegas but I was looking for something different than all my ex's so I decided to give him a try...I'm 135lbs
I will admit that I was super sexually frustrated at the time because it had been some time since I had been with someone and we were definitely sexting etc. so i initiated the sex talk I knew what was up when I went to see him and I got super drunk and we had sex etc. He stealthed me a few times that first night (looking back I should have made a bigger deal about it than I did) 
Fast forward to Christmas of 2018 I went to his company Christmas party as his date (he expressed that he was glad he met me because I had the look he wanted to portray) thought nothing of it 

Okay fast forward these once a month encounters about 6 months (I'm a single mother of one who works full time so this isn't something I do regularly so these weekend getaways are just mini vacations for me hes in his last year of school with no kids and works fulltime so the same thing for him) we are still talking for hours a day his personality is amazing makes me laugh is ambitious pays for everything and is generous etc (I have always been the one to pay in my relationships) everything I want in a man the ""I love yous"" start then we made it official after valentine's day 2019 I wasn't seeing anyone else this entire time so why not I thought but I'm still drinking when we see each other 
He made a comment about how he feels like I have to be drunk to have sex with him 
After he made the comment about my drinking I felt bad so I stopped drinking so much maybe a glass or two of wine at diner or a mixed drink a lunch etc. Not enough to get me drunk (maybe I was subconsciously using the alcohol to give me ""beer goggles ""now looking back) hes started working out in the gym and I told him how I admired his discipline and he made a comment about how he wanted me to remain attracted to him I thought nothing of it at the time just awww thanks for thinking about me but I hadn't at that point ever thought about it 
we started talking seriously about our future together he met my family child as well and remember we only see each other once a month for 3-4days back when we first started talking before we had even had sex he said he wanted a prenup because he planned on making a lot of money and he didn't want it taken from him in the event of a divorce Sex was part of his list of ""hypothetical"" (or so I thought) demands at the time at least 4times a week he has a high sex drive etc I'm still not registering the physical part of our relationship I'm just thinking we are talking hypothetically because we literally talk about EVERYTHING so fast forward maybe 3months after i stopped drinking it starts to hit me he smelled like old house and wet dog one time his feet stunk another he is larger so he sweats a lot and when he's on top it literally drips all over me from legs to even a few times on my face to the point sweat spot from him I tried to encourage co showering to ensure I never had to smell him again but sometimes he seems resistant to showering on multiple occasions stating we haven't or aren't doing anything as to say showering is pointless because we are just staying in which would be fine if he didn't want to have sex with me 
As stated before we talk about EVERYTHING plastic surgery came up early in our talking (maybe we were talking about celebrities or something) he said the only thing he would ever get was hair surgery because of his early onset baldness *which isn't an issue 
Plastic surgery came up again last week and I was discussing all the things I would want done and again he said he wouldn't get anything done because he saw it as taking the easy way out for weight loss I said continue working out and then get a tummy tuck etc when you reach your goal weight and cover the scars with a tattoo or something like some women do with their c section scars *he already has half sleeves on both arms he was still totally against it I asked him was it the pain he was afraid of or the procedure itself I even showed him some before and after pictures hes lost about 40lbs on and off on his own and hes starting to get skin I work in healthcare and although I'm not a doctor I noticed some weight sores in his folds on his back while rubbing lotion on it one day 
Please believe me when I tell you I am not shallow at all I have a list of things I'd love to change about myself and I am realistic about my physical appearance 
But recently my eyes have been wandering and I feel the walls closing in I don't think I can have him on top of me for the rest of my life as in marriage and he is definitely not with an open relationship (yes we do talk about everything distance has definitely been good for us in that aspect) he wants children and so do I we had a scare he stealthed me 
Everything else is perfect what should I do? I already feel shallow and ungrateful because so many ppl want the type of man I have and I prayed for a man with all his other attributes but everytime he brings up sex or says something about being intimate it almost repulses me 

Is there any advice that you can offer me please help",29Mar2020,1

139,"Disclaimer: this is a long story. 

First, some background info:

So I (F) have this friend who I have known since we were in fourth grade. We were best friends growing up, she was always coming over to my house because her family was pretty toxic. When we were 16, she came out to me and confessed that she was in love with me. At the time, I didn't really know how to react but we stayed friends. After moving out, going to college, carrying on with our lives, we sort of grew apart and lost touch for a couple of years, dated other people. I began questioning my sexuality and having thoughts, wondering ""what if"". Last summer, we were both visiting our hometown and we met, caught up, got along great. She was in a long term open relationship with another girl in another state. We continued getting along and soon realized that we had feelings for each other, which, being young and caught up in nostalgia and emotion, we indulged. And it was amazing, I fell hard and fast. But she had to leave, which basically broke me. I tried to keep in touch but she just sort of disappeared, other than the occasional late night call where she would confirm that she still has these feelings for me, and then disappear again. Eventually she blocked me and my mom on all social media and the line was completely broken. A few months later, she posted on Facebook that she and her girlfriend were getting engaged (a friend told me). I basically tried to let go of her because it seemed clear that she had chosen the other girl and I had a life to live. A few more months pass. Two weeks ago, I got a call from her in the middle of the night. She was crying and rambling that she left her girlfriend and skipped town. Apparently it had been a toxic and abusive relationship. She poured her heart out that she never wanted to cut me out and that she felt so stupid and she had made a huge mistake because I was the best thing that ever happened to her. I was thrown at first, because you know, whiplash. But we talked every day for the next few days and started filling in blanks and making amends. And I just wanted to help her at that point, because first and foremost she's my oldest friend. We started talking more and more, getting closer again. Even entertained the idea of her moving to where I live and getting an apartment. For the time being though she went to her dad's because it was the only place she could think of, which turned out to be a bad idea because he's a horrible person. So she left there to go to her mom's, hoping it would be better. Which it was at first, but then some bad things happened. 

So here is the actual meat of the story: 

My friend is an alcoholic. She has had a tough life. So many bad things have happened to her; so many people have hurt her, and alcohol became her coping mechanism. So while she was staying with her mom, she drank, despite my warnings and her better judgement. And one night she called me late, upset, drinking, saying that her mom and step dad had abruptly accused her of doing something she didn't do and got very aggressive with her. I talked her down, but then a few hours later she called again, clearly more drunk, and rambling that she could hear her mom saying ""no"", and she said something along the lines of ""if he touches her, I'll beat his ass"". Then she hung up and I was unable to contact her for an entire day. I was going mad with worry, texting her mom, her step dad, her brother, her sister in law. Finally I got a call from her phone and it was her mom, telling me that she was in jail for assault against her and her husband. She claimed that she wasn't the girl I thought she was, said she hooked up with some random guy, had been calling her ex asking to go home, made sexual advances to her husband, and had gotten violent with her multiple times. She said that on that night after my friend hung up, she busted into their room and started beating them. She was arrested. That call left me utterly at a loss. And something just didn't feel right. What her mom told me just did not sound like the girl I had known for 12 years. It almost seemed like she was deliberately trying to hurt me and get me to leave. 

Now completely overcome with worry, I started searching for any information I could and contacting everyone I could think of. I found where she was being held, what the charges were, contacted the jail, but I couldn't actually speak to her. Today, her mom called again and told me first that my friend was in a hospital and that she was going to get her the help she needed. She also apologized because she was wrong about the guy she thought my friend hooked up with. She very firmly asserted that she would be taking care of my friend and emphasized that she wants her to be healthy and happy. I asked her to just keep me updated because I want that same thing. 

So at this point, I don't know what or who to believe. And I don't know what I should do; although I know that at this moment I can't do anything since she's thousands of miles away and there's a pandemic going on. 

I would believe my friend over her mother any day (her mom has a track record of being manipulative and spinning stories to her advantage). But I also know that my friend is an alcoholic and when you're drunk you can do things you would normally never do. There's only one thing I do know and it's that I love her. I miss her. I want her in my life. I want her happy and safe. I also want to believe her, but I can't help but feel uneasy. Like, what if her mom was telling the truth about everything? What if my friend only said all those things to me because she was drunk? What if I'm just an outlet for her storm of emotions?  What if she disappears on me again? And if she cares about me as much as she says she does, how could she do this?",29Mar2020,1

146,"So last summer my girlfriend and I broke up and it was pretty bad. I had been an unfaithful piece of shit. She tried to figure things out but back than I didn’t want it.
Now I know why I did those things and why I have been such an asshole. Since then I have grown and matured as a person.

I have been with 2 other girls since then (one as a „rebound“ and one that I actually kind of liked but things didn’t work out)

So 2 days ago I decided that my ex deserved some answers and shot her a text that was about 1000 words: explaining why things happened and why I acted the way I did. (Not a Text that was giving a vibe of getting back together: just answering things that have been unanswered)
She replied thanking me but also saying that after 8 months she figured out most of that stuff herself. But generally a nice message.

My general problem is that I actually miss her. But I still kept in mind that part of the reason I cheated was that I was miserable at some points of the relationship (not to justify my actions). And it has been toxic from time to time but mostly our 2,5 years were amazing.

Also when I was in that relationship I kind of let friendships strive because she didn’t like a lot of those people and naturally I spend my time more with her than these friends. Now I am closer with them again (also that “rebound girl” is in that circle: my ex always hated her and probably does still as we fucked around just a couple weeks after our break up)
I don’t want a relationship to ever ruin my friendships again.

But then again I think about her and miss her, listen to the playlist she made on Spotify right after our breakup (that I can see she listens to as well since I messaged her) and I cry like a little girl.

Is it possible that I just start accepting the situation as I have been just distracting myself since the end of the relationship (after a week or two of drinking alone and crying) or that I just get emotional about it because I have just now started to look into myself and realised what I ruined?

147,"This guy had a vendetta against me and him and a group of guys were able to grab me and restrain me, and film this video of him hitting me, then they lowered me to the ground held me arms down while he got on top and they filmed more of him “beating me up” (with my arms being held down and him sitting on my legs). 
Then the people filming and other guys he had there actually “counted me out” and he stood on my chest and they took photos. I was restrained the entire time. 


This question isn’t regarding dealing with them (I.e reporting it to law enforcement), for various reasons that won’t do anything. 

I’m just having a really hard time dealing with it, since it looks like he beat me up when really it was a whole group of them holding me down the entire time. I’ve considered going to therapy, but I don’t know how talking about it or taking pills is going to reverse th effects of them having this stupid, “fake” video.

I also play music, and don’t know how to continue doing that with such a video in existence, making me look so weak. 

Just don’t really know how to handle this. I’m a very honest person, and things like this drive me crazy. Had I legitimately lost the fight I wouldn’t care at all, but something like this even if I wasn’t the victim, would still really unnerve me.",29Mar2020,1

149,"I’ve been single for 6 years. I’ve had one real relationship that lasted 20-22 and I’ll be 28(F) in less than a week. The one real relationship I’ve been in I can truly say was more of a case of two people who really really wanted to be in love so they manifested it. I’m not saying I didn’t love him, I think I did. I’m saying that I knew the night he asked me to be his girlfriend I probably should have said no because I subconsciously saw the way it would end and it ended just that way. With a lot of heartache. 

So now, I find something wrong with everyone. It started as determination not make the same mistake I did the first time but it’s been so long now I’m starting to wonder if I’m just scared of commitment. I’m doubting my own sense of a “red flag” because now I’m wondering if just some shit I’m creating to find a reason to not date that person. 

I’ve also had thoughts about sexuality lately. I am bisexual and have been out for a long time. I’ve never seriously dated a woman (long term, there was one semi-serious girl I dated). So I don’t know if that’s curiosity I need to fill but I have even wondered if maybe I’m a lesbian and I run from men because ultimately, I don’t really want them. 

I’ve even considered asexuality but I can’t quite wrap my head around that being the case because honestly *I love sex* I’m just kind of scared to have it with the wrong person because sex usually means attachment. 

So I dunno. I’m confused. I *feel* like I know what I want, but even when I find something that kind of fits that mold I find a reason to walk away from it.

It got cancelled due to the whole pandemic situation but the airline is refusing to refund, instead offering vouchers valid for one year. Thing is, we were both on an exchange program in Europe, so vouchers are useless to us because the airline only flies *in* Europe and we do not *live* in Europe. 

I paid for the tickets and then he transferred me the money equivalent to his ticket. I just now received the vouchers and was told that they can be used for anything, such as upgrading the seat in a long flight. I told him as much when I emailed him his voucher, as he has yet to go back home, whereas I already left. He leaves in April. 

But now I’m thinking that I should transfer him his money instead? Not sure if that’s the right thing to do. I already lost money because the vouchers arrived after I went home but he can still use his, so it’s not completely useless.

154,"For context, I’m a 19 year old girl attending university (now online). I’ve had long, thick, straight, boring black hair for almost my entire life.

I’ve tentatively asked her how she would feel if I shaved my head and she freaked out on me, telling me that I’d be ugly. I believe that she‘s attached to my naturally thick hair because hers has always been thin. My whole life she’s told me how much she loved my hair. But doing this would be a personal statement that I can do things that scare me. Also, I hate dealing with long hair.

I got bored and unfriended him and about a month later he friended me back and was like can we hang out. We hung out actually started talking, getting to know each other. Had a series we’d watch every time he came over. It was great we’d become like best friends that randomly had sex. But then he told me he liked him and I was like sorry I’ve been talking to somebody he said it was cool he didn’t wanna interfere, and he completely respects that. So we continued our friendship with no sex. I ended up dating the boy I was talking to. I told him and he once again said he respects me enough not to do anything but he wanted to keep our friendship, so we did just that. When I had this boyfriend, the fuck buddy/best friend had told me again that he liked me. And we talked all the time I told him we was like my best friend and he said I was his, he asked me what I would say if he asked me out and I said I’d want to talk about it in a more serious light (like we’ve never talked about us as a couple) that was the last time he ever mentioned anything relationship wise. I ended up breaking up with the boy. And me and the friend would still hang out and we had sex again. 
Well out of nowhere he started getting all short with me and shit and getting mad at me for nothing all the time. I finally asked him what was up with his vibe and he said that he just didn’t wanna talk, we were just fuck buddies.

I’m the only one who listens to rap and electronic music. I’m the only one who plays videos games. Shit kinda fits itself. They are jock types. One guy just got suspended for bullying a kid out of the dorms and partying in dorms. 

They started calling me gay because they think it’s funny. At first I didn’t respond but they kept doing it. I know they think i’m a pussy behind my back, which normally doesn’t affect me, but when it came to college reputation and my college world, it really affected me mentally. 

I’m joining the same frat as them, because I have nowhere else to go. No other friends were made. And these are the only people I know. They are nice sometimes and we party, but it’s put me in a bad depression and has caused me some suicidal ideations.

The problem is that they do it in public, and it’s contagious. My friends at home overheard what they were doing and starting calling me gay too. Everyone I meet they call me gay because they heard it from the suspended kid and more.

165,"I keep going back and forth on this, and wanted advice. 

I just realized my neighbors are having a baby in the next few months (I saw the baby bump). My guess is she is six or seven months pregnant, putting the due date in May-July?

My lease is up for my apartment on September 1st. I LOVE my apartment and there are no negative drawbacks of living here - EXCEPT the walls are THIN. I can hear my neighbors clearly when they are speaking in a normal voice. It normally doesn't bother me but a baby is definitely going to be loud and disruptive. Their bedroom shares a wall with my bedroom (which means I'm screwed if they keep the crib in there) and their living room with my living room. I'm worried that I won't be able to sleep, and getting enough sleep is a huge deal to me. I'm also worried it will just disturb my peace at all times of the day. 

I know babies are loud but I don't know how disruptive it's going to be since I've never lived with/next to babies. I could buy ear plugs and wear them constantly and get white noise machines, but how effective would that really be? I also know it's temporary, but this could potentially go on for a whole entire year or more, right? What if the baby is a super quiet baby? Or what if he's colicky? 

I won't have an opportunity to try it out before I make the decision to move - my landlord requires 3 months notice, so I will need to have my decision by June 1st, which is right around when I think the baby is due. I could try to ask him for some extra time to decide, but I'm not sure if he will let me. 

As for moving itself, it would be a pain but doable. I could probably find another unit in the neighborhood for the same price I'm paying. My unit is a very good value (and super cool - everybody compliments when they visit it), but I could find other one bedrooms for the same price in the neighborhood that would be fine to live in. I would have to probably pay for movers since I don't have friends/family that can really help. The thought of packing and unpacking again also makes me want to cry.

So please reddit what do you think - is it going to be as bad as I think it's going to be that it would justify moving?",29Mar2020,1

167,"I’ve been seeing this guy exclusively for over a month now. We’ve been exclusive from the beginning. In the most recent conversation we’ve had about our dynamics, he said “I like you, I’m not seeing anyone else or planning to see anyone else. I really want to see where this goes” (pertaining to a relationship). 

The problem is, I am now tired of being in the gray area. I feel like we are more of an “upgraded friends with benefits.” Meaning — we do spend a lot of time indoors chilling, having sex obviously, watching Netflix, cooking/eating — but I’ve also met his brothers and friends, hung out with them, gone grocery shopping with him, etc. And in front of his brothers and friends, he’s definitely really affectionate towards me (kisses, hugs, hand holding, etc). 

We do live kinda far (45 miles), so when we do see each other, we spend all day together and recently, I’ve been sleeping over his place. In the last month, we’ve spent like 10 full days together.  

When we are together, things are super great. However when we aren’t physically together, I feel really detached from him. Meaning, we barely text, we never call.. it’s like we are living two separate lives and in two separate worlds. We don’t really stay in contact or are updated with each other’s lives when we’re not physically together — which is why I say, it feels more like an “upgraded fwb” type of dynamic. 

Frankly I’m kinda over this. I don’t want to wait months to see if he’s willing to be in a relationship with me. I know I could just continue to see him and go with the flow and have fun, but I feel like I’m past that point. If we aren’t going to be in a relationship, I feel like I want to just end this. 

Tldr: Guy and I have been exclusive for a month. He keeps saying he likes me and wants to see where this goes. I’m getting sick of being in the “gray area.” Am I rushing things by having this ultimatum mindset? Either we’re official, or goodbye? Lol 

Oh and this whole quarantine thing isn’t exactly helping the situation. I know he wanted to do more outdoor activities (amusement park, going to a hockey game, etc) because he says that’s how you really get to know someone. But obviously we haven’t been able to do that",29Mar2020,1

169,"For a little background- I live in Sacramento and my family is in the Bay Area. The amount of confirmed COVID-19 cases is minimal here, but on the rise in the Bay Area. My parents are both 60 with semi-decent health; my Mom has Parkinson’s and my Dad has a long history of sinus problems. My younger sister has asthma and a history of bronchitis. 

I have an 8 month old daughter and my parents and sister want to visit, but we are both mulling it over because of all the risks. We have all been working from home, except my fiancé who works at Target. We have a cleaning routine for when he comes home, and he’s vigilant about washing hands at work and he wears gloves. 

I don’t want my family to miss out on seeing my daughter for months on end... but I also don’t want to risk any of us getting sick. I’m a huge proponent and advocate for social distancing, so this is causing a huge dilemma in my mind. I feel like in this situation I’m mostly thinking about my Mom, because she’s already showing early signs of dementia so I don’t want her to miss any time with my daughter before it gets too late. All that being said, is it too risky? Or is it okay to allow a visit or 2 as long as we take precautions?",29Mar2020,1

171,"Hey everyone, I’m posting here cause I can’t talk to anyone I know about this. I live with my parents and my siblings. I think that my older brother (21) is going crazy and I’m actually quite terrified and don’t know what to do. 

My brother kind of isolated himself from the family since he turned 18 and keeps to himself a lot and doesn’t really interact with us unless needed.

A few weeks ago, he told my mom he doesn’t trust her or my dad anymore out of the blue. My mom obviously was taken aback and asked him why. After a while of them going back and forth, he said that it’s because he knows my parents secretly put cameras in his room and sends my siblings to spy on him. He said he’s seen my younger brother peeking through the window because my mom sent him to. He also mentioned my little sisters are also told to spy on him. All of this is false obviously, my parents wouldn’t do that as they’ve respected our privacy and even if my parents ask my siblings to do that, they wouldn’t. 

My mom thinks it’s because of sleep deprivation because he said he was barely able to sleep for the past weeks. He blames this on us constantly knocking on his door or being too loud (which I understand because I have 4 other siblings who are all 7-16 years old). The thing is, we only ever knock on his door if we have food to give him. No one really bothers him and if we’re being too loud all he has to do is ask us to be quieter which he never does. 

I think that this has something to do with his mental health and maybe drugs. I think he’s definitely becoming delusional and it may be because of his history with drugs. My parents don’t know about any of this by the way. Since he turned 18, he went to raves and did plenty of party drugs (molly, ecstasy, acid, shrooms, coke, etc). The thing is, he wasn’t responsible in his drug use and this led him down to a pretty rough spot in his life and when he was 20 he was completely sober. 

The reason why I think it’s drugs is because of his reason for stopping (I also use these drugs but I know my limits and I’m responsible with it so I don’t blame it on the actual drugs). He stopped taking and using anything because he felt himself becoming cynical and his mental health was terrible. I think he either might be taking something again or that his mental health has been so shot that he’s going psychotic. He’s currently in his room yelling about how he wants to burn this house down and mumbling other things that I can’t quite work out. I’m in the room right next to his and he often talks to himself a lot which I thought he was on the phone at first but he’s just talking to himself. He keeps yelling at my dad to turn the camera off from his room but wouldn’t show my dad where it is and let him come in. 

I’m pretty scared and don’t know what my brothers capable of if I’m being honest. I suffer from a lot of mental health issues too and a huge one being paranoia but even when I’m paranoid I can tell what’s real and what’s not. Please if anyone has any advice or insight let me know. Anything, even if it’s just talking to me. I’m scared for the safety of my family and the well-being of my brother.",29Mar2020,1

Then I felt something pass by my feet, I looked back and it was a black snake (not sure if it’s black because the room wasn’t well lit or it’s really black), about a foot or a foot and a half long (30-45 cm). I turned back to talk to my friend, who was on the phone with me at that moment to tell her that a snake got into my hose. After saying that, I turned back and the snake was nowhere to be seen and there aren’t any openings so I’m positive it’s still in my house.

I have been in recovery from an eating disorder for almost two years now. When I started recovery I had little to no fat on my body. However, within those two years or so I’ve gained all of the weight back. Granted, I still workout (lift 3 days a week, cardio around 2 days a week) but I still have noticed that a majority of my weight goes to my stomach and it makes me really self conscious.

181,"Ok so let me give some backstory, I dated someone (guy A) for about 1.5 years from September 2017-February 2019, we broke up then about 1-2 months later dated his “best friend” (we will call guy B), i say that in air quotes because everyone (including themselves) believed they were really close when in fact guy A was slowly getting tired of guy B’s bullshit in being a selfish jerk. Dating me essentially was the last straw, at the time i was naive and didnt really think it through more cautiously and i believe the two reasons i even liked guy B was his wild/free-spirited personality and the fact he showed interest in me, I eventually broke up with guy B in November 2019 and haven’t dated anyone since due to school then the COVID-19 keeping us in our homes. During the time i was dating guy B, guy A started dating a mutual friend and they have been together 8-9 months now. I think they are a great/cute couple and i hope they make it to one year, i still talk to guy A and we are still good friends, recently i took the time to apologize to him for the way i made him feel when i dated guy B, guy A was very forgiving and he appreciated my apology.

So with the explanation out of the way heres my issue: I think i may have feelings again for guy A, im not into ruining relationships or anything like that and i truly respect what guy A has with his new girlfriend. All i mean is i just wanna know why i have these feelings? And the best way to figuring out if they are true feelings for him or something else? My theory is that I haven’t dated in awhile so my brain just sees guy A and goes “oh look something familiar”and it is not a true crush. My second question i wanna know is if they are true feelings how can i go about getting rid of them? I feel bad having a (maybe) crush on a guy who is taken, plus based on our past with the ‘dating best friend’ thing won’t make chances any better even if guy A ever broke up with his girlfriend lol. My final question is lets say i know it’s a true crush, i can’t get rid of these feelings, and sometime down the road guy A becomes single would there be any kind of chance he could have feelings for me too? Again i highly doubt it with our past but im genuinely curious to see what people think on this. The original reason i broke up with guy A is because we naturally lost feelings for one another, i think a second reason (but not the main factor) is also because dating guy A almost felt like being married, he was my first relationship and so at the time it felt like too much and i wasn’t ready to be in a relationship where i already felt like i settled down, i was 16-17 when i was dating him. Im currently 19 so my other theory is perhaps that since im older i find the husband type more attractive now? Im not sure.

So yeah those are my questions: Why do i all of a sudden have these feelings? Is it even a real crush? Or do i just miss dating in general? How to get rid of these feelings? Is there a chance that we could be together again if i cant get rid of these feelings and he becomes single?",29Mar2020,1

But my sister thought it'd be a good idea for her daughter to spend the night with me so we tried it and she didn't want to after already being her and like I understand because she's just a kid and her dad recently walked out of her life and she's scared her mom will do the same.

187,"I am certain you guys always get advice about love and what not (I'm new here) so here's another one, to be completely honest I am not expecting much ""ground breaking"" advice, I am just hoping putting this out there will ease my mind a bit.

So I fell really REALLY hard, recently, for a guy that  I have known for 3 months. I met him on tinder, we went out for one month, and we've been friends for 2 months, because while we were going out  I was more into the relationship than he was and we mutually decided to end it, it took me a couple of weeks to get over him, but I did it and I was completely fine. I wasn't even heartbroken when we ended thing, mostly disappointed because I actually saw something with him in the future, but I guess not...

Anyways, me and him have gotten quite close, we text everyday about the most random crap and became really good friends, but here's the thing, this week out of nowhere, I got these REALLY strong, loving feelings for him. I have been in love once before, and it is really weird that I am having them for someone I've barely known (for 3 months, like come on heart 💛 get it together, you know?)

I can't sleep, eat, think, breathe, function without thinking about him and it is getting on my fucking nerves. Here's the thing, I am not sure if I am in love with him or with his life. He achieved all the life goals I wanted to achieve because he had opportunities that I only dream of having. His life is what I have always craved for me. I have never gotten jealous in my life before, because I genuinely do believe in ""everything happens for a reason"" and the ""best is yet to come"", but he is the first person I have actually been jealous of. It is such an ugly feeling and I genuinely hate it, but can't help it.

My friends keep telling me that I have achieved so much more than any of them have, which technically is true and he himself admitted to me not that long ago how he is amazed by  my crazy-ass life and how I have dealt with everything and that he is a bit envious of me, but for some reason I am still very jealous of him.

I’m on the pill and take it pretty consistently (I’ve missed it once in 3 months and a couple of other times I’ve been late but remember to take it), but because I’m not perfect and because I’m paranoid we use condoms as well. 

I recently had to go home from college in the US due to COVID19 and now that I’m home I literally cannot stop worrying I’m pregnant. I haven’t missed my period yet (I.e suppose to start in a couple of days), and every time we had sex before I went home we used a condom and obviously I’m on the pill.

I'm late for things, I turn up at the wrong place by accident, I forget things I'm supposed to do, I lose my stuff (money, keys, phone, wallet) all the time, etc. In addition to this, I always seem to accidentally break things or make things dirty sometimes without remembering even touching them. It's hard to live with people or have close relationships because this makes everyone angry and think I don't care. The thing is, I care a lot but have to focus on it constantly, if I even have one day where I'm really tired and don't concentrate on not losing or breaking things I end up with no keys, losing money, everything a huge mess. 

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've tried:

\- Having a set place for everything and always putting things in that spot (this has helped a lot but then one day they're not there and I can't remember how)

\- Writing lists of everything I need to remember and what I need to do every day

\- Setting alarms for 10min before I need to leave so I start leaving then and am on time

\- Repeating in my head where I just put something/what I need to do with something explicitly

\- Cleaning/sorting out all my stuff regularly so I don't have too much 

This has all helped a lot after practicing for a couple of years, but even after all that effort I STILL lose important things at least once every three weeks and can't stay at friends places because I always do at least one stupid thing like forgetting to wash a plate or accidentally taking the wrong toothbrush or knocking something over.

Secondly, with all of this virus stuff going on my parents have implemented a rule that I'm only allowed to go places withing walking distance and I'm not allowed to go to other peoples houses, other people are also not allowed to come over to my house (yes I know it's for my own safety, though there are only 2 cases in my county) but that leaves me stuck with only being able to go to places like the  cemetary, a small park with a merry go round and two toddler swings, the baseball field that is currently empty and my backyard lol I actually feel super cooped up and I miss talking to people, it wouldnt be such a big deal if I could actually get my phone to work so that I could call people without the line kicking me off because my internet is shitty, oh yeah, and I can't even get facetime to work, it takes forever for even just a message to send and it's just annoying.

Lastly, this is probably going to sound stupid coming from someone that's still underage (by that I mean under 18) lmao but I'm having issues with my boyfriend,  he's about a year older than me and we've been friends with eachother for about solid 3 years, we didn't officially get together until like early january, I knew going into the relationship that he struggles with communicating and whatnot just because of how long we were friends beforehand, but at this point I honestly feel like he's just not interested in me and I'm not really a priority, like i know that he's been pretty busy lately with helping his dad renovate the house, his music, and trying to work towards getting his actual license so he can drive (he has his permit now) 
Again I feel like it could just be anxiety but at the same time I feel like if he really wanted to he could make time for me, by that I mean more than like 10 mins of his day to message me back and if I'm lucky he might call me for a few minutes, usually even when we do call and talk he ends up cutting it all short by saying that he's tired and had a long day but then a couple minutes after we end the call it says he's online so I'm pretty sure he just doesn't want to talk to me, I also feel like when we do talk our conversations don't go very deep because he always ends up changing the subject, most of the time all he ever wants to say to me is 'how did your day go'  'good morning'  'good night'  'love you'  'what's up' or he'll bring up the same few stories and reminisce etc...
Maybe I'm just making him uncomfortable with 'deep' conversation or talking about things I'm interested in or find entertaining, I often feel like I'm really just annoying to him and pretty much everyone else and that could be why he isn't wanting to talk to me

221,"I’ve had this clay piggy bank in my bedroom for upwards of 5yrs that I put any spare cash I have in (approx $20+ a month), it stays in the same spot on my bookshelf it’s not very obvious but my family knows what it is (they couldn’t know how much I put in). Yesterday I was moving some books around and moved the piggy bank and it felt light. Upon further inspection it was obvious that someone had made a hole at the bottom of it and glued the pieces back together (poorly because it was sitting wobbly from the unbalanced bottom with a small hole). I broke open the piggy bank and there was only $50 in there... The clear culprit is my only brother; he only has a part time job but somehow always had money to spend carelessly. He also was smoking weed heavily for about a year and a half and is now trying to quit, so maybe he took the money for that? This is all speculation. I couldn’t know when the money was taken because whenever I put money in I don’t lift or move the piggy bank. I don’t know when the last time I moved it was so I can’t be sure of the timeline. I also don’t know exactly how much money was in there because I the amounts of money that went in we’re irregular. I asked him about it before going to my parents to give him a chance to come clean but he denied it. I told my parents and they don’t want to start trouble with him because he’s going through withdrawals right now and they don’t want him going back to smoking.

222,"Hi Reddit! This is going to be a fairly long post but I feel that it is urgent so I will get right to it…full disclosure I did post this in r/mentalhealth as well ([https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fqzrvp/can\_anyone\_help\_me\_figure\_out\_what\_this\_is/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fqzrvp/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_what_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) but I want to make sure that I get the advice that I need.

I just got off of an hour long phone call with one of my closest friends that I met during the early stages of college. My first two years of college were spent in a town other than my hometown where I got the opportunity to become close with a very diverse group of friends. Over the years, we have gone in different directions but our paths have continued to overlap and we have been fortunate enough to keep the “family” close throughout despite being in and out of different cities over the years. Before I came into the picture, my closest friend of the group (we’ll call her Liz) was already close with another good friend in the group (we’ll call her Jenna). Liz and Jenna got along very well because they both came from small towns in Texas and both came from families that were heavily affected by abuse, drugs, alcoholism, addiction, and even the foster care system. Fortunately, both ladies were strong, intelligent, and mentally stable and made their ways out of some pretty bad situations. Liz is the one that I just spent an extended amount of time on the phone with and the “family” member that I have always felt closest to. Liz and Jenna still work together, Liz being Jenna’s boss, and when the current pandemic began Liz was trying to determine who would, unfortunately, be laid off or furloughed until such a time that business could resume.

To provide a little bit more background, this is a small business with a tight-knit group of line staff who frequently hung out together outside of work drinking and smoking weed. They all knew each other quite well and were comfortable enough with each other that they all knew that if anyone needed *anything* they could always reach out to each other and even sleep on each other's couches if necessary. Everyone was also aware that Jenna was going through a tough time with her family (her sister who had been living with her especially) and was going through a period of depression for the last five months or so.

So, a week or so ago, Liz was calling all of the employees that she intended to keep and fielding them to ensure that if they were kept they would be able to be flexible with their schedule and hours. Jenna knew that this was a serious conversation and something to be taken seriously, but was obviously not aware of the reason that Liz was asking these questions. Jenna assured Liz that she would be able to work whatever hours were given to her. Jenna being on the schedule still would have put her in a very good place as she was already squared away with her apartment complex so that she would not have even needed to pay rent until at least June.

Out of almost nowhere, Jenna called Liz back and mentioned that she had made the decision to move back home to the town she had grown up in and where her family still lived. She let her know that she wanted to be clear that she would not be needing any hours at work and that she wanted to “be safe” and go ahead and move back near her family where she didn’t have to worry about paying rent or anything. This was an abrupt move to a town three hours away *in one night*. Jenna packed several bags to bring with her to her new home but left her apartment still full of her belongings. When Liz inquired as to where she would be living and why she had decided to move away from a job she knew she had, a home she knew she had for at least a few more months, and why she had not bothered to take her stuff with her, none of the answers added up. Jenna mentioned that she would be living with a friend of her brother’s friend and that she was currently living in his living room but that he had a shed in his backyard that they would add drywall too and run an extension cord to for a small window unit air conditioner. Other than that, no running water, kitchen space, or bathroom would be available to her in this shed. None of this made sense as the apartment that she was living in already had all of these things and more and would accommodate her for at least two more months even if she lost her job amid the pandemic.

Liz repeatedly told Jenna that she had a home in her spare bedroom if necessary and would not need to pay rent and that if she needed money or assistance that she would be more than happy to help find solutions. Jenna assured Liz that she knew this. Another concerning factor was that one of the things Liz and Jenna had both told each other for the more than nine years that they had known each other was that they would never, under any circumstances, move back in or near their families. They are both level-headed, intelligent women who knew that being around those kinds of toxic situations would be detrimental to their mental health. When none of the reasons that Jenna gabe Liz made any remote sense, her first thought was that maybe she was using harder drugs. Jenna primarily smoked weed and did not have any drug dependencies to speak of, to say that she might be abusing any prescription drugs or even other hard drugs such as meth or heroin would not be *that* far fetched. Jenna had grown up around these kinds of things and had experimented with some prescription drugs, shrooms, etc. from time to time, but never had a real interest in them and recognized the dangers of them.

Of course the idea that Jenna had moved back to her hometown to use drugs more was concerning, but the real concern came when other employees were drilling Liz about what had happened to Jenna and why she hadn’t been seen or heard from. At this point, I should also mention that Jenna had still continued to call Liz on a daily basis (twice daily from what I understand) just to talk. She would give reasons like “I just feel better having you on the phone,” etc. Liz and myself, both being clinically anxious people, both thought that this would indicate that Jenna is anxious or worried about something - maybe it is comforting to have Liz on the phone to help ground her for some time. On at least one of these phone calls Liz asked Jenna what she had been up to and how she was doing, her response was that it felt good to be at the lake. She grew up near the lake, it relaxed her, and she enjoyed being near it. Jenna mentioned to Liz that she had spent six hours just staring at the lake. Again, to Liz having grown up around family members who used drugs like meth, this sounded like she might have been using harder drugs. When Liz mentioned this conversation to other employees though, they mentioned that maybe Jenna was “at peace.” Liz and a couple of other people made comments like “Oh, good for her. I’m glad she’s found peace in her life.” As you’d think, being at peace would be great! The person who brought this up; however, provided a grimmer description of what it meant to be at peace. This person said that being at peace could mean that someone had reached a point in their depression where they were at peace with the hardships of life and at peace with the idea that suicide was the solution. With all other details, including that Jenna had up and left her apartment and all of her belongings at a moment’s notice, this felt like it might make all of the pieces of the puzzle fit, that maybe Jenna had made peace with the idea of ending her life and that she was enjoying her last moments peacefully by the lake in her hometown.

Unfortunately, I had no other possible ideas. I did suggest reaching out to the suicide hotline to see if they had any suggestions or idea. My other idea was this; presenting the situation to Reddit in hopes that either someone who has been through a similar life experience, or someone who might be a professional in mental health/drug abuse could provide some sort of insight. I am hoping for ideas on how Liz (or even myself even though I am outside of the situation and in a completely different city) can connect with Jenna to figure out what is going on or even peace of mind knowing that something else is going on. Please, if anyone has any helpful thoughts, Liz and I would love to hear them. Also, if anyone has any suggestions of other Reddit communities that might be able to help as well, please let me know.

Stay safe and healthy everyone!",29Mar2020,1
223,"Not sure if anyone can help me but here it goes. 

My younger sister has been with her husband for 6 years, married for 2 in July. He’s a bit of a goofy ball and my views and his are polar opposites sometimes. Regardless I still love him as my family. 

Anyway recently my sister confided in me that her husband is depressed. At first I thought it was because she wasn’t ready for a kid and he really wanted one. Then he was out of work because he had to have surgery. Now that he’s back at work and they’ve discussed kids his mood has not changed. 

I worry about him because from what he told me he’s been self medicating with CBD since the surgery (not shade to CBD if it works for you good for you). Recently he started smoking weed and has hinted to doing harder drugs, thankfully not heroin. Tonight he posted a song to his Instagram story titled “hate myself”.

This has brief dark material ahead so continue with some caution. 

So there’s this man (about 50-60 years old) that texts me quite frequently, most of the time it’s later than 9pm and it’s usually about working, me as a child (mind you, I hardly saw him when I was a child.), and how i’m doing lately. He isn’t related to me by blood but he could technically be referred to as my step-uncle. Nothing about this seems strange except for the fact that he’s been accused of shooting his son and covering it up as a suicide, all while his younger brother and sister watched it happen, and molesting his daughter which caused her to become addicted to heroin and other hard drugs for most of her life, though she’s clean now and has cut all ties with him. 

His wife/my step-aunt/nanny tried talking my stepmom into committing suicide, (with text evidence even though she denies it.) and they invited me to spend the week at their house only two months after the incident. But it got pushed back because they got sick and I couldn’t go. After this happened, I told my dad about it and he told me to not go because “I don’t feel safe with you there by yourself, there’s some sketchy things going on in that house.” He’s told me not to talk to either one of them but when they message me I get too nervous to ignore them and him and his wife both know how abusive my stepmom has been to me in the past and they’ve used that to get me closer to them and further from my dad and stepmom.

He constantly tells me of who I reminded him of when I was a child and tells me that I remind him of his ex-wife ‘so much.’ I’m a 19 year old guy, (ftm, started transitioning when i was 15.) But besides that, he usually tells me that he thinks about me a lot and if I ever get too depressed I can call him, he has also given me $250 without me asking for anything, sent me old pictures of him around my age telling me the types of drugs he used to do, and since nobody has been hiring me he was saying that I should go to the state where he works and find a job there, which makes no sense to me because because I have no money to get there, no way to get there, and nowhere to stay if I do get there, meaning I would have to stay wherever he does, plus he doesn’t stay there all the time, he spends a few weeks there and comes back to my state, where would I go? 

Is he just trying to be friendly towards me, kind of like a fatherly figure? Should I just steer clear of them altogether? Or should I tell my dad even though I’m scared he might go over there and shoot him?",29Mar2020,1

236,"Ok. So, I live and on the property owned by my boss. We live a quarter mile down the same road from each other and you have to pass my house to get to hers. 

She has separated from her husband multiple times for various amounts of time due to alleged infidelity, exploitation, and verbal abuse. 

The last time they separated, my boss and I were both getting mysterious no caller ID calls. They sounded like butt dials half the time and sometimes left short voicemails full of background noise. My boss thought it had something to do with her husband cheating. After they separated the calls stopped. 

They got back together a few months ago and the phone calls came back sporadically. 

My boss works third shift and is not at home during the evenings. Around midnight, I hear a car go past my house. An hour later, I get three of these calls and one voicemail. The voicemail is muffled and mostly background noice. But a clear voice, said the husband’s name in an aggravated tone. 

The voice definitely was not my boss’s. 

Not all of this definitively adds up to her husband cheating. But I have a gut feeling about it. 


So here I am. With some information that I don’t want. Do I give the information to  my boss and let her decide? Or do I keep the information to myself and pretend I don’t know? 

There is also the complication that if my boss kicks her husband out again, it could directly jeopardize my job. It’s complicated—I’ll spare you the details. 

The other complication is that these people are like family to me. More like my boss is my mother in law and her husband is the stepfather.  Every interaction I’ve had with the husband has been pleasant. Like the way your cool uncle you live around treats you like a child. Despite that, I know people have the ability to be one person to the world and another in private. 

So what do I do?

TLDR; I have information that shows my boss’s husband might be cheating. Do I keep it to myself or do I tell her despite it may affect my job?",29Mar2020,1

I'm having the urge to hurt myself right now. All I've done is scratch at my skin with my nails and left light scratches on my arm. Luckily I trimmed them the night before. I'm really fighting the urge to grab something from the kitchen. Counselling and therapy are off the table, I don't have access to them. I'm really craving that release of breaking my skin, but I know it's not healthy. What can I do on my own to combat this?",29Mar2020,1

240,I’ve been unhappy for a while. If I’m alone I’m sad but if I’m with him I’m even more sad. He’s in an online open relationship and he’s seeing me until their lover moves down here in a few years. I was happy at first but now I feel like I’m being used. I’ve tried to walk away from this because I was too confused about what we’re doing. I’m not allowed to see or talk or have sex with other guys but we’re not dating or exclusive. Whenever I try to end things he cries and I can’t bare it so I come right back. I’m scared. I’m scared of being alone and I’m scared of life without him because he’s become all I know. He’s very emotional and inconsiderate. My mood swings and depression are out the window.

243,"My best friend (20f) is experiencing an extremely traumatic phase in her life and I want to help her prevent emotional baggage or trauma that could effect her negatively later in life.
In short- my friend works an extremely stressful job practically every day of the week. She also has devoted a great deal of time to working out, meal prepping, etc. she used to be heavily addicted to Xanax and other drugs and eating unhealthy and sleeping all day and completely switched her life around for the better. She is always a very positive and uplifting friend- the friend that seems like she always has her head on her shoulders/ knows the solution to things.
Her household is extremely toxic. Her mom screams at her for practically everything she does, and she has been trapped at home with her because of the corona virus. Every day her mom has ‘episodes’ of her screaming, crying, acting delusional etc. today my friend walked into the bathroom to her mom hysterically crying about losing her hair and not looking young anymore. ( hearing this made me want to cry, I don’t think her mom is a bad person and I feel absolutely terrible hearing that she is going through a crisis ) but she is using her daughter as an emotional cushion. She screams at her, controls her, makes her tell her every single thing she’s doing at all times, etc. 
On top of this, the mother is planning on having them back their bags and move to Florida ( from Washington ) when all of this is over- and if my friend doesn’t come with her then the mom will expect her to pay her a ton of money which I don’t fully understand why.
Lately my friend has been resorting to taking a lot of Xanax when she has alone time. She locks her self in her room and bars out until the next day. I’m not one to speak because I also resort to Xanax binges when I’m stressed, but my friend has a terrible history with it and I’m just scared that my friend will spiral if things don’t look up for her soon.
There is no way for her to prevent or avoid what she is going through. I don’t want her being an emotional cushion for her delusional mother to have a negative effect on her later in her life. What suggestions can I give her? How should I go about helping her?

The problem is that I work early in the mornings and she has a tendency to stay up late working from her PC. This is causing me no end to sleep problems because I am a light sleeper and any sound she makes tends to wake me up, at which point it's a good 30 minutes before I can fall asleep again. Obviously this is more or less ruining any chances I have of getting a good nights sleep and we aren't really sure what to do about it. I already own a powerful fan due to my having tinnitus so I use that to drown out most noises but she still tends to wake me up at least once a night, sometimes several times. I try to ignore it but it's starting to have an impact on my waking hours with the constantly interrupted sleep.

We tried room dividing curtains that were specifically sold as sound dampening but they really didn't seem to do very much. The light from her PC was certainly blocked wonderfully but the light was never really an issue for me in the first place. We don't have the option of any permanent room alterations so putting up something like a genuine dividing wall can't be done. Really not sure what to do here, maybe try another brand? Are curtains really going to help? Hoping somebody knows a good option.",29Mar2020,1

His issues are different from mine...but we're doing a LOT better after meeting in this group. I mentioned I really like playing Stardew Valley and one day he gave me his number and asked if we could play together sometime. We started playing together and talking while we played. While I didn't like him romantically at first...I started crushing on him. We laugh a lot together and there have been signs that he likes me too. One time I told him that I was a libra and he was a Scorpio and he looked up how compatible we were. Another time I told him I was glad I met him and he said sweetly ""I'm glad I met you too"". We recently watched a movie together over Discord. I couldn't stop smiling. He recently asked me to go on a nature walk with him. I've been looking forward to it for days. Should I confess I like him on our walk? It's been bugging me for days and I really want to know for sure if he likes me back. I'm hesitating because I like hanging out with him so much and I really don't want that to end. I really hope that the signs I listed point to him liking me.

258,"We have lived in this house for about ten years. It wasn't a great house when we moved in and it's in worse shape now. The property management company that handles the property has a reputation for being a bit shady- in our last apartment through them, we replaced some broken blinds when we moved out with some identical blinds but made the mistake of telling them. They said they replaced those blinds, claiming they were the wrong kind (they weren't) and charged us for it. 

Now that we are looking to move out, I am trying to decide if it would be better to try to repair the broken things here before we go or leave it to the landlord/owner to decide if they even want to do the work on the property or scrap it. 

Problems:

1. The doorknob to the bathroom was old and broke apart. 

2. There's a 1-tile area in the kitchen where water got under the tile and warped the floor a little. There are also other damaged tiles that have been scuffed up permanently. 

3. We never had the gas turned on because of how draft the house is and we weren't using the 2nd bedroom (electric stove/dryer) so the gas meter was taken by the gas company and they said there would be fees to replace it. 

4. The carpeting is bad. It will need replacing in the living room and master bedroom. 

5. The front screen door has a bent arm from the door being blown open. 

6. The back screen door blew open &amp; broke off overnight in a heavy wind storm. 

7. Many years ago, there was a shooting at a house nearby and we found out later that a bullet hit the side of the house and it was hidden behind a tall shrub alongside the house. It cause a lot of moisture to come in behind the tub wall, damaging the drywall. 

8. Tree roots have caused cracks in the basement walls/foundation. The basement has flooded multiple times, causing damage to the walls and extra moisture. Which causes mold to grow in crevices and in the bathroom if we don't keep the place ventilated and the walls cleaned. 

9. The biggest issue is the bathroom. Years ago, we told the maintenance man we thought the toilet had a small leak. He looked at it, flushed it a few times, and said it was condensation. Gradually, the ""not a leak"" did long term damage. It damaged the flooring under the toilet, causing it to sink in every so slightly. So the bathroom floor will need ripped up and replaced as well as the linoleum and the leak in the toilet fixed. We should have reported it as it got worse but by then, we were afraid they would blame us, try to evict us or charge a ton of money and money has been pretty tight up until a year or so ago. So the bathroom is in bad shape all around, between the tub wall needing torn out so the drywall can be replaced and the floor needing replaced. 

10. We have mice that come back every year. They get rid of them, then next winter they come back. It never ends. And we can't leave a lot of poison out because we have a dog and cat. 

Between all the repairs and ongoing moisture/mold problems, should we even get everything fixed ourselves and risk wasting money if they're going to scrap it? Or if they could repair it for less? I'm just afraid of getting sued but we want out.",29Mar2020,1

Please no judgement :)

Ok so due to covid-19, I no longer have any shifts at the job that I had just been employed at. I really want a little bit of money, for myself and in case my parents lose their jobs or their hours are cut, so I thought why not sell feet pics? My parents are against it but I'm gonna try it out. I just have a few questions.

How do customers pay - do I need to get paypal or can I just send my bsb and account number and they can transfer the money?

Where do I find customers/where is the best place to advertise? Craigslist, reddit...?

How do I send the photos? I used a camera so the photos are quite high resolution and will be too big to send over email. Can I just put the photos in a google drive folder then send the link?

How should I price the photos? My feet aren't the prettiest but the photos turned out decent. I was thinking $5 per photo, $20 for 5, $40 for 10. Also can I say no refunds?

262,"I am 43 years old new divorced...It was a horrible divorce so my mother 66 invited me to come stay with her to heal rest up and get on my feet...The virus is throwing my plans off but it is for all..

I help her with extras around the home pay for things when she is short or do food shopping and paying..  Not tech rent offically.

I have lived here about 90 days or so maybe 100. So there is the back story.



My mother is a wine drinker every nite and she usually shares with me as I just picked up the habit here I was never a drinker before.. At times she gets upset say if I fall asleep too early on her clock ect...Yesterday I had two cocktails and napped for an hour....She after having drank a full bottle of wine herself dump mine out took my credit cards my debit cards my checks and pretty much trashed the room I stay in..

She was screeching and screaming a bit tipsy I would say and slapping me ...

Well today I had just found out that she had all my bank cards and I hit the roof as she refused to let me have them..I did not harm up but I yelled then I tossed her fork into the sink and shut the door a bit too hard she then decided to stab me repeatedly with a fork in my chest...Which she said I deserved...My brother came out and I went to her wallet to look through it to find my only access to my money....She then started punching me in the face and my brother pushed me back when I tried to push her off me pretty much stopped me from just even getting her off me and she blacked both my eyes ....Then I said I will call the police about my credit cards and banking cards...it became clear I was starting to swell and bleed a bit where she stabbed me so I told the police what happened and they said she must give my property back and I can buy a bottle of wine or a book she has no say over that.   They did say if they show up and see blood or a swollen or red face they will arrest her..

Well my brother then says well I  will just say you attacked her and she was defending herself...I was the only one hit and the only one bleeding and brusied....They quickly realized that if they did not give me back my cards that the cops would arrest her so my brother than said if she is arrested for stabbing you once they leave I will beat the shit out of you and throw you out of the house on the front lawn...They even tried to tell me to leave tonight out of the blue...

Couple questions....Should I go to the police station with these injuries and have be on record as I fear even if I leave soon it will happen again...

The issue is if I leave the home to say buy a bottle of wine or say go to the police station they are saying they will just lock me out on the front steps..

I want to know if someone can do that as she said she will lie and say I never help with anything money wise and that there is no lease..it was an informal agreement.  Do I have some sort of time frame and would the police force me to be let back in if they did lock me out....For leaving the home really...She also locks me INSIDE the home while she sleeps and thinks its normal to do so.

I am stuck as I have black eye and stab wounds and I feel like she wants to control every thing I do and if she does not like it she will literally punch me take my things or lock me out...Do I have any rights here and what be the best course with these injuries...

A bit more info I suffered strokes giving birth to my daughter and have dementia so i cannot drive and I am considered somewhat disabled and yet yes this is still happening and I fear its going to get worse esp with my brother egging on the violence ...She was happy laughing and mocking my eye and stab wound most of today...

Getting up and leaving in a day with dementia and this virius probably is not a good idea but I am at a loss if I should let the police take photos to build a case if it keeps happening.   Can I be locked out for no reason or any reason she deems or do I need notice...What are the steps I should take to protect myself and not end up on the street with no car and brain damage yet if I stay here I will be abused more its been going on 3 days of screaming slapping punching stabbing and more threats...

263,"Hello Redditors

Yesterday I got fired from my job. I had worked there for 10 months as an intern. I had a really good relationship with everyone there. I made very good impressions on everybody for being working there few months. This week many people was getting fired for companys fear to coronavirus lowering their cash flow. That was not the only reason I got fired. Boss knew I was interested in moving on to other area in the same company, so he choose to fire me because I was not interested anymore working in that area. Many of my coworkers were amazed that I was fired and some of them tried to convince the boss to keep me but they couldnt. Im gonna miss a lot of them. They were all good to me and teached me when I was new. I gonna specially miss this girl to who I started to feel some love to her last 2 weeks. We used to eat everyday together, talk and joke together. I dont know if she was on to me. She have a boyfriend but she told me that she didnt wanted to be with him anymore. We talked on the phone for 1 hour after I got fired. But now she seems very cold when answering messages. Also I dont know if Im really in love with her or its only because she was the only girl I talked to in a while. Last time I had a gf was when I was 14. Since then, talking to girls is hard for me.

264,"Let me start by saying this is a hypothetical worry of mine that I want to be prepared for. If you can’t tell, I’m a pretty anxious individual. 

My parents are both in their late 50’s, with my mom turning 60 this July. I’m 19 years old and an out-of-state college student sent home by coronavirus. 

My dad still has to go into work in proximity to others during this pandemic. My mom has been working from home, but both have still been going out grocery shopping. I came home from New York City and my best friend from school tested positive - she’s now fully recovered, its been 15 days since my last contact with her and I haven’t shown symptoms, but my boyfriend who I spent a significant amount of time with before I found out my friend was positive has now also caught the virus (assuming from me as an asymptomatic carrier) and I’ve watched him struggle to breathe, talk, and experience all of the awful symptoms over Facetime. 

My dad doesn’t have any known underlying conditions, but he smoked for years before quitting about 12 years ago and eats like garbage (and I can never tell him otherwise). My mom has a respiratory condition (pretty sure it’s chronic bronchitis) and I believe she’s still being medicated for an open heart surgery she had my senior year of high school. I believe both are incredibly vulnerable and that if one gets it, there’s no question that the other will too (we live in a small house). 

What happens to an orphaned 19 year old? I have a sister in another state that I’m almost positive I’d live with when I’m not in school, but I don’t know anything about how I would fix life after that while obviously being an emotional wreck. How would I move out of the house I’m currently in (my parents don’t own it)? How could I efficiently get rid of all the furniture and get money from it knowing my parents wouldn’t be able to leave me much? What happens to my health insurance?

Soon, we started doing almost everything together til this day. We began to catch feelings for each other but I decided I wanted to keep our “relationship” or “dalliance” private. Of course he agreed but  I know he didn’t really want that. People always assume we were in a relationship and I went so far as to telling them that we were cousins so that they would stop thinking that. I believe that he is getting the hard end of the stick because he wants this relationship more than I. My grandma always said “ it’s better to be loved than to love”. I am really starting to understand that now. We’ve had this “relationship” for a little over a year now. Multiple times I’ve tried to go back to being friends and stop being sexual but it just didn’t work out right and I couldn’t go through with it. I’ve came to the decision that I’m going to either be friends or make the relationship official. I feel terrible thinking about how much it would hurt him to be friends and I feel uncomfortable thinking about how the relationship would go on (we’re starting college soon). I guess I have the idea that can be described as “dating to marry” so I always think of the future. I see no point in wasting time now unless I can really see myself with them. Even still, I feel like it would kind of be a safe option to just choose him because at least I will have a man who actually loves me and treats me right. He’s not the cutest person or sharpest tool, but I know he would do anything for me. I really do love him , as a musician partner and friend for sure, but I’m not entirely sure if being together is the best thing for us.

269,"TL; DR: I have two options for uni and I’m not sure which one to choose: go straight into med school (which is possible where I live but not a good option looking at my grades and courses - but the option my parents prefer the most), or get an undergrad and then study dentistry (which I prefer even though it’s not as “prestigious” - and the option my parents don’t really like). 

So my parents really want me to study medicine, and anything else is kind of not really accepted; I know it’s wrong and they should let me pursue whatever my passion is but there’s nothing I can do about it, so I’ve kind of reached a compromise (with myself - when I told them about it they weren’t that enthusiastic). I decided I’d much rather study dentistry: it’s still medicine but much easier and less stressful, etc. I’m American but I’ve lived abroad my whole life and I really want to go to school in the US, but my parents are really strict and overprotective, and I’m the eldest child so they have no experience in this whatsoever, and so they’re pretty against letting me go on my own. My mom did say that if I get really good grades she’d send me to Houston because it’s really good for medicine apparently but I’m not sure how serious she is lol. So anyways, about school, I have two options as of right now. The first is, if I want to go to the US and study dentistry, I’ll need an undergrad first, and I really like kinesiology, so I feel like that’d work. It also helps that it’s focused on the part of biology that I actually like learning, so there’s that. So what I would do is get my bachelor’s and then go on to do the 4 years of dentistry (and I’ll do all the prereqs while getting my bachelor’s). But my dad doesn’t really like this idea; he said he’d rather I go to school where we live right now and I’ll be able to graduate in 6 (I think?) years rather than 8 - this bring me to the other option. 

My other option is to go to school where I live right now; there’s a pretty good medical school and my parents really like it, and would much rather I stayed near them. But to be honest, I think we all need a break. They’re really overprotective and stuff and yeah I understand why but I feel like they robbed me of so many experiences. But anyways, the school here goes straight into med, and I don’t take chemistry or physics (I do IB and take biology and math at standard level), so I feel like I’m not ready at all. That’s why I want to get a bachelor’s in something else first: I can do courses in the sciences and math and prepare better, which will hopefully ensure I do better than what I would do here. For some reason my parents think I’m capable and whatever, but I know my work ethic and the necessary work ethic of a doctor and they’re just not really anywhere near each other. 

So my question is, what is the better option? I’m really sorry if this is unclear or all over the place haha, quarantine has me losing my mind. Thank you so much!! If anybody has any questions/doesn’t understand something, please let me know!!",29Mar2020,1

In my opinion, middle eastern boys are extremely attractive, but I assumed maybe the people around me don't think so because they aren't used to foreign men? I'm pretty sure middle eastern/arab men are known to be attractive, but I just came to that conclusion after trying to figure out why people say that. 

I also know my boyfriend isn't ugly, because I have eyes, and because a lot of girls have a crush on him. And no, he doesn't flirt with girls. Girls come up to him first and strike conversations. I'm just really confused. 

There is also another theory I have. He doesn't look the same on his social media. On his Instagram, he looks very young because he hasn't posted in a long time. Could that be why? People who see him in person think he is very attractive. 

I don't know what to do, I feel super upset after that person asked why my boyfriend is ugly. It is really rude and makes me upset.",29Mar2020,1
273,"I no longer live in my hometown, however it’s a 3.5 hour drive away. I currently live in Los Angeles and as you all know there’s the whole COVID-19 thing going on. 

My mother, through absolute mismanagement of the family inheritance when my grandmother passed away a few years ago, sold the family home that had been in the family since my great-great grandparents purchased it. It was the last sizable asset she could get a large sum for, as she had already pawned the family jewelry like my great-great grandmothers wedding ring. 

I tried to go to my hometown a couple of weekends ago so that I could say goodbye to the house, take some photos and video, and get some closure with the last anchor in my life to my family. The family that’s no longer alive but who are very dear to my heart. The weather conditions were less than ideal, with some ground level fog in a part of the mountain pass, so I turned us around because it just was not safe to proceed. 

On April 1, this upcoming Wednesday, the keys will be turned over to the new owner (who was the realtor for the house), and that will be it. 

Normally I’m excellent at making decisions but this has me paralyzed. I already don’t like going back to my hometown for reasons I don’t care to disclose here, and the drive also makes me rather anxious when driving through the mountain pass. Sometimes I’m able to push through my anxiety and it’s okay, but other times if I don’t “listen” to my anxiety and ignore my gut it will just punch me in the face afterwards and it leaves me shaken up for days. 

I love that house because of what it symbolized, and the memories I had in it, as well as the connection it gave me to those special people who are no longer here. I am upset beyond words at my mother, who is notorious for being so irresponsible (she’s textbook narcissist with borderline personality disorder and just an absolute mess), and this is all her fault. 

My great-grandfather converted the garage into a bar, building the actual bar himself. Now that’s all going to be torn down by the realtor as he’s making it a garage again and is essentially gutting the house to upgrade it and flip it for profit. It’s a large house on a large lot in a cul-de-sac in a great area of town with fantastic schools. He’ll absolutely get that investment back and then some. 

With the whole COVID-19 stuff going on I’m doing what I can to self isolate as I’ve been home for 3 weeks now, only going out for 2 walks, 1 grocery store trip, and 2 doctors appointments. Friday an alert came through the phones about not going out over the weekend, that beaches and hiking trails were closed to the public, and to just stay home. CDC also says to be careful when traveling from places with known cases. Both LA and my hometown have cases, but statistically I have higher odds of coming in contact with corona there than I do in LA (confirmed cases/population ratio). 

I’m also afraid that if I do go up there that something in the news might change and I won’t be able to get back home to my cat and everything. That there might be some addition to the precautions already in place. 

I just don’t know what to do. This whole situation has me feeling so heartbroken. It will pain me to see the house empty, stripped of furniture, wallpaper, wall fixtures, drapes, and other items... but also at the same time I can touch things my great-grandfather touched and made, touch the house, make a video where I talk about each room and what was inside as well as some memories.... all while not really adhering to social distancing (would have to get the keys from my mother and stuff plus she still has to get boxes out of the house to put into storage). 

I put a call into the realtor this evening. I managed to find the public records of the sale to get his name and called his publicly posted phone number on his website. Just to see if there was a way after the virus stuff passes and I can safely see the house, but according to my mother (who is a known liar), the realtor is moving full steam ahead with renovation work with construction people coming later this week. Hence why I went around my mother to call this guy and see. I left a voicemail and so who knows if he’ll call me back. 

I’m debating driving tomorrow (Sunday) morning, seeing the house, and then driving back. It’s just A LOT of driving and I don’t know if I want to see the house like that. Plus I can’t/shouldn’t really do an overnight as hotels likely aren’t safe right now and my boyfriend and I both have work Monday (from home, not in any offices).

I’m honestly worried that if I don’t go I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, and that will give me mega anxiety. Decisions where it’s just so final have a tendency to mess with me. But when my grandfather was about to die, in 2018, I didn’t go see him. Instead we spoke on the phone for a final time, and I chose not to go fly out of state. 1) is just seen my grandmother literally die in front of my face the year before and didn’t want to endure that again, and 2) last time I saw him was years before that and he was so healthy and strong so that’s what I wanted to remember him by. My decision for that was in favor of my own mental health. His funeral services were in my hometown though and I absolutely was there for that. 

Control is an anxiety trigger for me and so this whole scenario is like a perfect storm where I don’t have a whole lot of said control. 

What would you do? 

TL;DR Mother royally screwed up and had to sell family home that’s been around since great-great grandparents. March 31 is last time I’ll be able to get inside home to say goodbye, but it’s a 3.5 hour drive from where I live (Los Angeles) and there’s a lot of emotions, anxiety, and kind of a viral outbreak.

281,"I’ll include a tldr at the bottom because this might be long

Firstly I am an extroverted-introvert (19m) and have just finished my first year of university. I have probably one real friend in all my 19 years of existing.

I don’t have a problem in making new “friends” in social situations because I’m confident when I want to meet new people. But people either end up not wanting to talk to me afterwards, making friends in another social group or only talking to me when they need my help with the work on the course and then ignoring my messages when all it is a simple “hey” or “how’s it going” after I help them out of the kindness of my heart with nothing in return. 

Since year 12/13 I was pretty much alone in school with no affiliations to any social groups because I joined late. Due to this I would just talk to whoever was around me at the time. I just carried on being alone, expecting me to have another shot at it at uni so I held my head up even though those two years were hell going into school and being a loner every single day.  

Now I’ve only come to realise no-one ever wants to message me. So I thought let me try to message people that go to the same university that also went to the same school back home to “rekindle” whatever relationship I had. All of these ended up in them replying to my initial “hey” and not responding after that.

So with no new friends apart from the people that I smoke weed with that I met at university, (who only talk to me when they want to smoke and all hang out together without me because they study the same course), I have no-one who wants to message me and no one to talk to apart from one person who went to the same school and we see each other still.

I participate in football on Saturdays to meet new people to no avail and am thinking of going to the gym next year. What should I do, I’m tired of being alone ( not suicidal or anything, not even close)

TLDR: people only message me when they need something, people ignore my messages and no-one wants to make new friends with me even though I’m friendly from the get-go.",29Mar2020,1

My type of work requires me walking throut the building interacting with other departments and employees. I sometimes deliver mail it parts for inspection. I have been wearing gloves all week at work.


I came home on Monday evening and ended up with a sore throat and a fever which came on rapidly. I immediately called my boss as I was concerned about the Corona virus.


On Tuesday morning I called out if work and called my doctor's office. I was assessed by a Triage nurse over the phone. Then the doctor called me back and said another phone assessment and said I was a probable case for Covid-19, but that it couldn't be confirmed because testing is only available at the ER. And to only go to the ER if my symptoms got worse. 

My symptoms were, and have been, fever if 102.2, a sore throat, swollen glands, dry throat and cough, and a sever headache. Tylenol keeps the fever down to 99.9.  My breathing is Ok so far. 


The head of HR called me at home that same morning. I told her I was VERY concerned about the other employees I was in contact with-about 10 of them directly. She said she was sending out an email to all employees. 


She lied.  I found out today that no email went out. She told the person who sits next to me to go home....but never disclosed why to him.  They then deep-cleaned my desk and area only, and that's it. 


An employee called to see if I was coming in today, so I was shocked to learn by accident that noone had been contacted about their exposure. 


I called HR and asked why it wasn't done. I was told someone from their Legal department would contact me. A few minutes later their company lawyer called and told me that they were 'not legally obligated to notify anyone"". and that I, or other employees could never be able to pinpoint where they contacted this virus from.

I was livid. I went into my computer and sent an email to the 10 people I had contact with and told them every detail of what happened, including the fact I would have spoken out sooner but had been told they were all emailed already. 

I sent the email and included my boss, HR, Legal and all other departmental managers. I said in my email that I appreciate the stressful, unprecedented position we are in as a company to work hard to remain open, to avoid layoffs, etc, but that u felt a moral obligation to let them know they were exposed.

Throughout the years of my childhood with my brother, it seems to be satisfying to him that he steals my shirts, deodorant, cologne, my favorite t-shirts, phone chargers, gaming headsets I put aside, (you get the gist) up to now. I go into our room, to go grab my phone charger which is at the head of my bed. And it’s not there. I ask him where my charger is and said he didn’t know, which struck a nerve and confronted him about stealing and how he hasn’t been taught a lesson about it, throws a charger at me (which was one of the chargers I had bought acouple months ago) and I completely lose it and slam the door as I left.
It really bothers me that I’ve never had any personal privacy or anything with this kid, and I have to hide everything even from him. I CANT EVEN SLEEP IN PEACE WITHOUT HIM STEALING MY VAPE UNDER MY PILLOW. 
I am not a violent acting person, despite the dark thoughts of doing harmful things because of his actions.

From one side, my mother is alone and needs to have an adult beside her to keep her company and protect her from anything that might arise. From the other side, I suddenly appeared on my father and brother's lives and they got so happy for it, now I'm just gonna go, leaving this void behind me causing them and myself a great deal of pain.

My mother tells me she can handle herself, but I can't rest easy knowing she's alone during this crisis. Also it is very much safer to spend it at my father's as we already stocked up and have masks/gloves for the outside, while my mother has none of those protections.

Oh reddit, what should I do?",29Mar2020,1
307,"A few years ago I was friends with this guy, we weren’t super close or anything but I’ve always really liked him. He’s a few years older than me and we haven’t spoken in about a year. In the past I had always initiated contact - added him on Facebook, messaged him a few times and followed him on insta. I really want to contact him again, maybe ask how he’s going and what he’s been up to. Trouble is, I don’t want to come across as clingy or anything since he’s never messaged me first in the past. He’s fairly shy. 

Guys, if a girl friend contacted you after a year of not speaking would you find that cute or straight-up creepy? What should I say to him? Any help would be appreciated. I just miss him a lot lol",29Mar2020,1

I’m in a new relationship , I called my boyfriend hella times because before all of this happened me and my boyfriend got into a argument and which was around (4pm) and it’s (2am) and still haven’t returned a call or a text. I feel like I’m going to lose my mind I lost somebody so dear to me and all I just needed was my boyfriend to be there for me. At this point it’s like idc about the argument we had before all of this happened I just need him to be on the phone with me , I can’t stop crying I just don’t know what to do.

313,"My boyfriend and I don't text one on one that often and for a while Ive wanted that to change. Now with the quarantine I finally got the courage to talk to him about it. I sent the first text and he didn't reply a day after freaking out about it I asked him what was up. He just told me he was busy and stuff and likes alone time alright that's fine but I asked him if we could text more when he does have free time. 

He didn't directly answer that question and just told me to not think he is ignoring me and that his way of coping with this situation is ""going to his happy place and being antisocial"". I want him to be happy of course but I'm starting to worry. He talks in a discord chat with all our friends and has been kinda active on Instagram, but when it comes to our one on one texts he doesn't respond. 

I don't want to push the matter because I already have twice and if he really just needs space I should give it to him but I just want to know if he is alright. School doesn't open until April but we still have school work and stuff which keeps everyone busy but I can't stop worrying. Should I just leave it until I see him in person again, do I text him, do I call him? I guess I'm not really understanding how to go about it because it's the exact opposite of my copping mechanism.

314,"So I’ve known my boyfriend for 2 years and we’ve been dating for about 8 or 9 months. 
He’s Bengali and I’m Turkish which is fine we’re both happy and our cultures are pretty much similar anyways. Then his mother comes in.
I’ve never met his mom before, however I was joking around with my boyfriend and decided to follow her on Instagram and she followed me back. She knows what I look like, that we call often, BUT she doesn’t know that we’re dating and thinks that me and my boyfriend are friends. 

Despite not knowing me, I know my appearance (obviously not Bengali) is an issue for her and my boyfriend has called her thoughts “really shallow”. Then one night I was talking to him and he stayed up late because he was coughing so badly. So his coughs were keeping him awake, not me. She walks into his room and sees that he’s awake and automatically knows that I’m on the phone and assumes that I’m the reason that he’s not sleeping. She literally says that she’s going to message me on Instagram in order to say some not very nice things to me, of course, since I’m the big bad non Bengali girl forcing her independent 21 year old son to stay awake because I’m holding a virtual gun to his head smh.

He once showed her a photo of me with my arm looped with another guy’s, just to ask “do you think she’s pretty?” So just a general convo with his mom in which he asks her if I look nice. She then looks at the photo and says “why is she holding onto him like that? Girls and guys shouldn’t be doing that. How do you know they aren’t dating?” I got upset at this, because it’s like, this woman has never met me before and already I feel like she’s trying to in some way put doubts into my boyfriend’s head about me and my character.

I’m so scared that one day because of her shallow and traditional ideals, my boyfriend is going to leave me. I literally feel so much anxiety every time I think about it.

What would you do in my situation?
Should I just act like I’m fine with everything and not stressed?

I’m so angry and so upset at her and the worst part is that I feel like my boyfriend is already being influenced by her, due to the less time he spends with me, the way he talks, he’s less affectionate etc.",29Mar2020,1
315,"I don't know how to explain my feelings the best right now but I thing I should tell you some background information.

I met my crush around 2 years ago in a online game. In the beginning I was going through a tough a patch in life. I had just graduated high school and working a dead end crappy retail job. Not really knowing what I was doing with my life. It had gotten to a point that I actually thought about killing myself.

So when I met him, I was not in the best state of mental health.

I was wondering around this game, looking at new worlds and just simply exploring.

When I had ran into a guy and his friends. I was too shy to talk to anyone so I was simply a mute but it didn't matter. My crush was a very outgoing person and at the time it seemed like he wanted to be my friend.

I sometimes look back at this and just wish I had logged off or never installed this game.

After meeting him, he introduced me to his friend which suddenly became my friends. I had suddenly gone from being alone to being surrounded by people that I honestly thought cared about me.

He gave me a reason to look forward after every shitty job shift and any crap my family would give me.

In a way he gave me a reason to kinda live.

Which I guess is kinda why I fell for him. It's sadly the only reason I can think. Because by all accounts he was never really the kind of guy I would have a crush on. He was actually very different from all my previous crushes. 

 My crush would tell me and his bro friends about his past sexual experiences, getting drunk and talk about the latest tech, anime and video games. 

In all honestly other than a love for dogs, anime and video games. We had very little in common. But I guess he gave me hope when he told me about how he would like a girlfriend that liked anime, since his ex's never seemed to care.

I kept my feelings for him to myself for over 6 months. It sadly wasn't until I got jealous over a girl he was giving attention too, that I realized I had a issue.

That it was starting to hurt to see him talk to another girl, to talk to anyone but me.

I started feeling like I was a crazy person and it scared me.

So I did the best thing I could. I tried talking to a mutual friend and confess my feelings. But instead of having any compassion or understanding. It kind of seemed like I was annoying her. She wanted to bring another girl that knew him better than anyone. Someone I knew never was anything more than a friend to my crush.

I honestly regret telling them my feelings. Because instead of letting me personally tell my crush my feeling, my friend had it in her head that she should break the news. 

Needless to say it didn't go over well. 

As expected he rejected my feelings. An I honestly understand why.

But when I tried to personally try to talk to him about it he simply told me ""I don't want no drama"".

I felt that when he told me that it meant he didn't want anything to do with me.

I felt like a burden, like I was just being an annoyance. I honestly couldn't help but cry for days after that.

But you can only cry for so long until your tears run out.

I couldn't help but explore some virtual worlds in the same game I played with him. 

It felt weird hoping from one random world to another looking to talk to people, as I honestly felt none of my friends cared enough about me to listen to my problems.

But after hoping world after world I settled on a small one and met a girl.

She actually asked me how I was doing and while I know it's a common simple everyday question. I couldn't help but break down and pour my heart out. I know its selfish to tell a complete stranger your feeling but at that time I felt like I had no one.

So I told her my feelings, thoughts, emotions about this man. A man that never cared about me. A man that has already forgotten about me and moved on.

An instead of blocking, muting or ignoring me. She listened. I'm still moved by her kindness.

She listened to my sobbing and crying sorry ass. An gave me some advice. 

She told me I needed to block him out of my life, create a new game account and disappear. Make new friends and keep the ones that care about me.

I took her advice, stopped using my old game account and created a new one, made new friends and over time let in the old ones that seemed to somewhat still care about me.

But even after all this, if a mutual friend mentions or slips out his name I feel heart broken.

It hurts to remember him.

It hurt even more when a friend of ours confess that one of the reasons my crush told a friend not to date me was because of my weight. I honestly never thought my looks mattered to him before.

An when a another friend was screen sharing on discord and I was doing my best hentai moan impressions and laughing with my friends. My crush apparently thought it would be fun to join. 

It hurt to know that he just wanted to join me because I could sound like some xxx rated anime voice actress. He never wanted to hang around me like that before but because of a new trick I learned he had a short interest in wanting to rekindle our friendship. It had been over 3 months since I had cut ties with him then.

He hurts me without even trying.

Sometimes I feel like its my own fault. I hang around some of his friend and while they know I don't like talking about him. He still comes up every once in a while and honestly it hurts. 

 I'm still the same idiot 2 years ago, I've just accepted that people can like me just the way I am. 

But I honestly wish I could get rid of this feeling. It's not as bad as it was a year ago but just because it doesn't hurt as much, doesn't mean its not a problem. If I join a world my friend is in and he's there I have to leave or if he joins a world I'm in because a friend is with me. I feel like I need to leave. Even if he is blocked and muted. I still don't feel comfortable being near him. 

It's been about a year since I actually last talked to him and I want this feeling gone. I don't feel depressed or suicidal. 

In fact my life seems to be improving in many ways. 

But my heart is still broken and no matter how hard I try fixing it, it doesn't want to stay fixed. 

Thank you for reading my story and any advice would be appreciated.",29Mar2020,1
316,"My wife and I have a cat who can't live a fulfilling life anymore. Lindy (our cat) is 21 years old, and in the past two weeks she has gone blind, can barely walk, can no longer groom, and barely eats or drinks. She is miserable and has given us plenty of signs that it is her time to go.

I want to have vets come into our home so that we can finally let our girl rest, but my wife won't have it. She has said that she would rather let our cat die naturally, and she just won't let go. When I see Lindy laying there, clearly in pain, falling asleep between the water bowl and her bed (about three feet) because she just can't make it that far, it is all I can do to keep from crying. I'm crying right now just typing this out.

Lindy has been a good cat, and lived a good long life, and now I want to help her pass peacefully. How can I help my wife come to terms with the fact that Lindy is suffering and that the last gift that we can give her is to not let her suffer anymore? 

I've tried telling her just that, but it doesn't change her mind. I want to be supportive and respect my wife's feelings and choices, but I also think Lindy deserves a peaceful passing and not one filled with pain.

317,"Most people would be surprised if they found out I have a major depressive disorder- I grew up relatively “normal” I had a loving family, had friends, and did average in school. When I turned 19 my dad ended up passing away from cancer. He was our primary income provider, as my mom was a stay at home mom. Immediately this had a impact on my life as I was in college at the time- and could barely afford it as it is. 

I’m 24 a single male, and just feel lost in life. Most days I just hope things will eventually get better but know they won’t. I feel like I do all the right things- but don’t feel better. I go to therapy, I’m on medication, I work out everyday, yet I’m still cursed with this depression. But some days I still struggle to get out of bed, and even feel so grossly unconfident in myself. 

I feel like most girls find my diagnosis unattractive so I hide it from everyone close to me- and I then wonder why any girl would want to be with such a colorless schleeb like me.

Nothing bad towards her, but she’s either embarrassed or dismissive for other reasons.

I have no other symptoms, the itching comes and goes. It’s around the area, not just on my actual asshole. It doesn’t itch all the time, just occasionally. I have similar itching on my legs or back sometimes, just not as bad, not sure if that’s related. They come around the same time, mom says it’s heat rash.  It acts up most at night. It’s been happening for a really long time, at least a few years. I tried to eat liquids and soft stuff for a while in case it was those little ruptures or something but it didn’t work.

320,"So, here's the thing - I'm a high schooler that really wants to get a rhinoplasty (nose job), but I am also a bit hesitant because I really don't want to be known as the girl that got a nose job during high school.

The surgery wouldn't be completely cosmetic, I have severe breathing problems because of my nose. However, there are some parts of my nose I would like to be fixed; I have a bump on the bridge of my nose and the tip droops down. This means part of the procedure would be covered by insurance (reconstructive surgery) while the other part wouldn't (cosmetic surgery).

I know that getting the surgery would give me a huge confidence boost (and correct my breathing which is a huge plus) but I don't want people to make fun of me for getting plastic surgery. My parents are supportive and are happy to pay for it.

What do you guys think? Should I just do it? Also, would you judge me considering it was partly a medical reason?",29Mar2020,1

The whole relationship was long diIstance so it was pretty easy for him to keep it from me until i found his instagram by accident. When i tried to confront him about it he immediately started ghosting me. Blocked me on everything. Discord, xbox you name it. 
 
I tried to get in touch with his other boyfriend and tell him what was going on, but he had blocked me too. Probably my ex manipulated him into doing so.

324,"Ever since 2018, when my family found out of my mother's drug abuse (I believe it was meth), the relationship between my parents has been rocky. The smell of cigarettes became stronger at home, the arguments became loud enough for my younger siblings to notice and it always ended with my mother runing out crying. My father began sleeping in the living room to avoid her and his temper became worse,it felt like we were walking on egg shells every time we were around him.
Soon enough, the stress and the worry of them separating got to my head. I was scared for my siblings, scared that we would be separated and left with alone my mother or father. They are old traditioned mexicans, emotional, and didn't have the patience to deal with children. I was afraid what would happen to them, especially my younger brother.
I'm not proud to say this, but I started to cut because of this. I was terrified and had no where to go, not to mention no one to go to. 
It only got worse when my mother somehow got the suspicion of my father cheating. She started to involve me more and more into their problems, using me as ""proof"", convinced that I had seen the affair. She set up cameras at home and made me help her, and even when we were having lunch at the table a simple move like wiping his face with a napkin would set her off, saying he was giving his side girl ""signals"". 
I didn't believe my mother and I still don't want to , I always knew her as a person who over exaggerated at any chance possible, and a lair isnt too far off. My father is the type of person who never lies, helps out others at any chance and tried to get me out of their problems. Since then the intensity has died down, and it all seemed like it was swept under the rug. I got help by my school counselor and have been clean since December.

A few days ago my mother my mother threw a bra into my room, telling me that she found my clothes in their pile again. I wash my own clothes, sure it could have been mixed into their pile while switching from the washer to the dryer, but it isnt mine. 
There is only three women in this house, my mother gave it to me saying it was mine, so it isnt hers. My sister it too young to even have this, and it definitely isnt mine. 
I would have ignored this or come up with an excuse if it was the first time, but it isnt. I now have 3 bras and 2 panties that dont belong to anyone here. The schools have been shut down and I cant go to my school counselor. I definitely dont wanna tell my mother, home barely just got better and I dont want to ruin it . 

So, what do I do?

325,"Hi, it's my second time coming to this subreddit for advice. I have mental problems so I tend to shy away from people, and I like having time for myself. I rarely respond to any of my Messenger/LINE chats, and if I do, it's needed. \[e.g friend having a panic attack, online school work, parents\] 

Now, a guy added me online and I accepted his friend request because we had a lot of mutual friends. I was also somewhat popular with his seniors at his school, so I just shrugged it off. He started talking to me, looking back now, it's such a sob story because he uses depression and his broken family as an excuse for the girls to pity him. Unfortunately, I also came from a dysfunctional family and officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety. My replies were bit robotic, as I was busy playing videogames.  I could already pick up he was trying to hit on me, as he began to be clingy (he was sending kissy emojis and hearts) and coming from someone who got out of a relationship twice, I was a veteran at this. I gave away a sign I was not interested in dating anyone, nor pursuing a relationship as I have my own problems to sort out first. Now, this is where the problem arises. He finds out I have depression and he uses it to form a prince charming type of persona towards me, he asks me if I need help or that he's always there for me no matter what. I told him I was fine as I have a counselor I visit weekly, and I use videogames as a form of escapism. 

His obsessive behavior also grew when I posted a picture of my best friend and I on my IG story, he sent weird messages like ""wow u didnt even think of me"" and even added a clapping emoji. I was utterly confused because I never considered him as my close friend, or a friend at all. He was only an acquaintance.

There was this time where I didn't reply to anyone at all except my best friend for a week, he went batshit crazy and sent multiple texts everyday. He even threatened suicide, because all of his friends left him. I replied and said I was fine, I just needed a break from social media because it was toxic and bad for me. Then he goes soft and begs me not to leave, I just left him on seen because this was so stupid. Yesterday, he sent me a video and sent a bunch of kissy emojis and hearts emoji, then he spammed ""i love you"" all over. I was uncomfortable, and it worsened my anxiety.

I made $300 USD over the course of some months doing simple graphic designs and surveys online.

So fast forward to yesterday, I have the $300 on PayPal and I’m ready to transfer it to Skrill ( Similar to PayPal but is more friendly in my country) but Skrill doesn’t take PayPal, it takes BTC and other services.

I decide to look for a Currency Exchanger online on those forum websites. I found a guy we talked for almost an hour about everything and I’m ready to do the deal. He was charging me a 30$ fee which was understandable and then there are fees along every currency change I go through [ PayPal -&gt; Guy -&gt; BTC -&gt; Skrill -&gt; Bank ] which would add up but I need it.

24 hours later he is active on the site and on social platforms but is ignoring me on some and blocked me on some.

With this Corona Virus Pandemic going on and living with my grandmother I was really banking on the money as I lost my job due to the virus and the money would have helped us make do for a decent time.

I have tried the resolution center and I also contacted support but someone I did a Design for chargedback and the claim has not been settled so it is giving me an error when I attempt the chargeback on PayPal.

330,"I have been living with my daughter (24F) and her bf (19M) during the quarantine. My daughter believes that science can weave miracles and help us avert major catastrophes, but her bf is a philosophy student who is skeptical of the degree of control scientists have over the situation at the moment.

I was a witness to a few playful science vs philosophy debates between them in the initial stages of the pandemic. Since they had no way to decide the debate, my princess proposed a bet. She said that scientific discoveries would ensure that there would be no more than a TOTAL OF 700,000 people infected all over the world. She expected the scientists to come up with rapid testing kits and medicines that would curb the spread of the virus or something. Her bf responded that the TOTAL number of people infected would be way more than 700,000. My daughter wanted her bf to admit defeat on his twitter account if she won. When she wanted to know her payoff in case she lost, he asked her to follow him into their room. When she emerged a minute later, I could make out that the bet was something significant because she was looking quite embarrassed.

The whole day today, she has been glued to the news and is checking the latest figures. As the day progressed, she started giggling more often and casting bashful glances at her bf. I want her pretty face to brighten up with the pleasure of victory. Her bf has been making irritating comments that he wants her to ""surrender"" the moment it crosses 700,000 although he would want her to win. Quite incoherently, he has praised her beauty around 10 times today. I haven't been watching the news myself because it fuels my anxiety. I am not sure whether my daughter is winning or losing but her expressions suggest she might be winning.

332,"26m from a strict education based background.(not from u.s). My parents( mainly my mom) have been really pressuring me to study for masters degree( of their choice) and get to our state medical college and this quarantine is making things worse. 
From start, i never really had any interest in medicine but my parents were hell bent on it. The pressure never really got to me at that time( dont know how) but during my long college years(6) and now working, i am literally at my threshold. It has got to a point that whenever they dont see me with a book studying they get mad. And it has affected me in a way that i have completely lost my urge to study. It is affecting my working life as well. I have tried twice now to get into masters with no interest of my own and have failed. They also take all my salary to invest in mf.(i dont mind that tbh as i have little needs).
Fast forwarding to today, the quarantine has made a house rat.I watch tv, movies, play some games and talk with friends but no study. So my parent are kindoff done with me. Last night they told me you will just work an average job for the rest of your life with no credentials and that they are ashamed when people talk about me to them( which they have told me a 100x).
My whole family including my 2 sisters have been gold medalist( highest honors) in there fields so i get why my parents are so critical of me.

337,"Hey guys, I hope this post won’t go unnoticed because I really need all the advice I can get. Soo, two years ago I started hanging out with 3 girls, let’s call them Eva, Haley and Sam. I don’t want to bore you with the details because a lot happened during our friendship (in case anyone wants some clarification I have no problem explaining I just thought it was unnecessary to include such details in the post) but the main thing is that the last 2-3 months of our friendship things weren’t ideal. We were fighting some times for no reason and Eva and Haley started hanging out with some other guys so they would go out a lot without me and I just felt that we were drifting apart. So I tried to voice my concerns to Eva and even though I thought she would completely understand, she kinda ignored me. And this continued for a while until one day I snapped at her and I sent her some mean texts and told her that it was best to end our friendship. So this is how I stopped talking with them. After almost a year of that incident I have realised where I was wrong and were I was right and I know that the texts I sent her that day were pretty fucking hurtful and I regret sending them. But, the thing is that one major reason as to why I decided to finally end our friendship was something that one other friend of mine had told me, which she swore was true until I found out 3 months ago that it was a lie. So now not only do I feel guilty for being mean to Eva, but I feel like shit for ending our friendship for something that wasn’t even true. Obviously I felt unhappy before my other friend told me that lie and obviously I would have talked to Eva at some point but what made me do it this way and right then was that lie. Anyways, in November I started talking with Haley again which was amazing! But I learned afterwards that when Eva and Sam found out that Haley talked to me, they got mad at her and started to slowly push her away. Not only that, but they told some of our mutual friends some not very kind things about me. And I mean, I understand that my behaviour was shitty and that the texts I sent to Anna that day were mean and hurt both her’s and Sam’s feelings but I just didn’t think that they would still be so mad at me. And before I learned that, I really wanted to send Eva a text to apologise. Like it’s eating me up this past year and I just feel like after I stopped hanging out with them I stopped feeling happy. And this past year has been fucking hell and the only thing I ever do is I look at our old photos and regret ever sending those messages. But now that I know that they hate me, I don’t think that sending her an apology would be a good idea. I obviously don’t expect them to tell me that everything is okay and start hanging out with me again, I just really feel the need to tell Eva how sorry I am. I know that it isn’t just my fault that everything happened like that but I know that not being more rational when sending her those messages was my fault. Along with many other things. I just don’t know at this point what to do. Do I just continue on with my life and let that in the past or do I put my ego and fear of rejection aside and send them an apology without expecting them to respond/ be forgiving? I know that I want to apologise to Eva but I think that I’m not ready to be left on read or reading a reply that isn’t the one I hope for. Thanks to anyone who might take some time to respond or even read this post. It feels better to get it off my chest!!

i was in a relationship for 1.5 years and cheated on them five times, i think. that was the longest relationship i had— i lied a lot in all my past relationships and normally broke it off out of guilt. i’ve managed to convince myself time and time again that i want other people to be happy so i try to keep EVERYONE happy by never denying them myself... in reality, i’m just selfish and never want to make any fucking sacrifices.

i know what i’ve done is wrong but WHAT IF THIS IS WHO I AM. so what if i’m introspective. so what if i don’t act that way anymore... does that MAGICALLY make me a good person? does anyone actually have depth, or are our actions actually a full representation of who we are?",29Mar2020,1
347,"Hey guys, I’m looking for some insight on this so thank you for taking the time I read!

A long term online bff of mine is pretty emotionally self centered, I didn’t realize it until now though. 
They tend to get mad over little things, without consideration of the other persons feelings.

For instance, I stopped talking to people last yr due to depression. My friend knew this, yet took me off socials because she was mad I was unresponsive. It felt inconsiderate. 

That was months go, I reached out and We’re okay now. 


Recently, they got mad again bc I didn’t want to play video games with them. Literally displayed same attitude, I got sick of it.

Finally got the courage and asked why they get mad sm. Their response went from hurt and defensive to having sudden realization of their toxicity and apologized. I told them how it affected me and they basically begged for me to stay and be their friend. 

We’re okay again, I felt bad and felt it was good they  realized what they were doing. Just not sure if they meant it, given how sudden they switched up after I pointed out their inconsideration for others.

All I want to do is go home, that's all I think about and care about.... is home and sleep. I don't feel compassion like I used to.. even if my face says I care. I really don't.

I feel guilty feeling this way considering I used to almost love for everything in life and now feeling like a faker. I don't feel like I'm a nice person as people make me out to be. I could care less about anyone. I'm apathetic, in other words.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, me and my live-in girlfriend had to return back to our parents houses because the city we used to live in was really under high risk. We went to our parents' houses. Our Parents live 4 miles away from each other.

My girlfriend wants me to spend every day at her parents' house, which I'm not at all opposed to. But we are not allowed to go outside, be traveling from place to place. I have tried and also have been beaten by the police. She never understands this and throws all kinds of tantrums which take a toll on me mentally. Today is my birthday and I want to die because of her abusive behaviour.

I want to break up, but cannot because there are way too many commitments I have made with her and it is near impossible to leave. I love her a lot but I hate her attitude.

I struggle to do this most of the time. I had a rather harsh upbringing filled with manipulation. I was belittled and had to follow obscure rules or there would be hell to pay.

I don’t think many of my relatives like me much. They seem to lecture me over opinions I share on my Facebook page. I don’t mind healthy discussion, but I don’t want to have the morals police breathing down my neck. 
My mum constantly messages me complaining about posts I’ve shared. I tell her to ignore them and scroll on, just like she tells me to do, but she tells me that I just shouldn’t post stuff she doesn’t like. 

I live twenty minutes from my parents place, yet they rarely come and see me. When they do, my mum will mention how untidy my house is, and then lecture me about comments I’ve made on social media. They’re usually here for about ten minutes, and they only ever come to see me if they’re already in town. Mum expects me to drive to their place, but even when I’ve done that, I still get a lecture, and all Mum and dad do is mess around on their phones the entire time. 

My sister lives two and a half hours away. She’s married and has two kids. My nephew (3) and niece (2) are gorgeous kids. My parents visit them more than they’ve ever visited me. They’ll drive to see them and spend the whole day with them before coming home. They’ve never spent the day with me, and I’m positive that it’s because I don’t have kids for my mother to fawn over. I’m not worth spending time with because I’m single and childless. 
My mother will spend over two hours on a train to visit them but she won’t drive twenty minutes to see me. 

I actually resent them now. They’d never admit that they’re ignoring me, Mum never admits she’s wrong. Ever. She’d say she loves me equally as my sister but if she did, why is she so uninterested in spending time with me? 
I’m pushing them away and my resentment comes out on social media where it seems that everything I post is wrong, or offensive to someone. When I’m criticised, I fight back, and I can be nasty. If they just left me alone and stopped attacking me I wouldn’t be so angry at them.

365,"Dear Reddit,   
 

I am in a rut, and have been for a long time. I’m a final year medical student attending a (highly regarded?) medical school. I am in my early 20s still, and I honestly cannot complain about my life in any meaningful way. I have a good group of friends, a supportive family, I’ve had financial stability throughout my medical school and I’m in good health personally. 

All of these things are an absolute privilege and I completely understand that in the context of this lifestyle and the opportunities I’ve been given, I really should be happy. 

But I am just in a rut and I don’t know why.

I am not lonely (all going great on the romance/sex part), I don’t have low self-esteem. 

I think I just have a dumb problem where I thought life would be more exciting and I’d have more of a fire to be motivated to achieve in an excellent way. I am on track to be a surgeon, so it’s not that I’m unaccomplished. 

It’s more that I just feel like there’s a creative/business aspect of my spirit that is undernourished. I have taken up side-classes in writing and music, I volunteer in the community, I enjoy seeing my patients. But when I sit in the quiet moments and just think to myself, I feel like there’s something missing in my life.

I honestly just worry I’m a narcissist or something, and wanted to see my faces on billboards or have fallen for this trap of fame being the true measure of success (I really am not famous at all and I get that this is really just vanity). I really know rationally that people who attract a large following or audience get that as a byproduct of living an authentic life, and the work and accomplishment comes before recognition. I also know that recognition doesn’t actually change the motivations behind doing the work in the first place. 

Anyway I think I’m freaking out that I have an impending 80-100 hour work week schedule once medical school is done, and I just don’t know if I should just accept a future of anonymity or go out on a limb and enter the oversaturated marketplace of people who share their lives. Is it childish/silly to seek attention in this way. Why isn’t it enough to settle for the well wishes and investment of my loved ones and friends. It is just an ego thing and I honestly don’t know what to do about it.

Interested to hear what reddit has to say :)",29Mar2020,1
366,"Some context:
For as long as I remember I've been attending church since young and for 18 years of my life I've just been going just because my parents told me to. But then I started questioning some of the messages that were being presented in sermons like: LGBT is bad and whoever doesn't believe in God will go to hell. It was in college that I've met a group of amazing friends and none of them are Christian or even religious in general. And one of my closest friends is part of the LGBT community. And since the country I'm from is relatively conservative, people are generally against same sex relationships but there is a (gradual) growing acceptance of it. But my parents are very against it and always preaches to my sister and I that these people are ""bad"" but to me it's just bullshit. People around me in church were also some of the biggest hypocrites I've ever met; some going to church just to socialise while others simply don't practice what they preach. Overall I'm tired of being confused and tired of pretending that I like being in church when all I want to do is gtfo.

A few months back he was only paying me 11$ an hour but he was leaving for weeks and leaving the store for me to completely run; I then got news my grandparents were selling the house and that I’m unable to go with them so I needed and deserved a raise. I brought it up at our next meeting where he pretty much praised me for running things so well and so I was like great because I need 33k haha. I honestly don’t think it was too much to ask for as I deal with all employees, scheduling, invoice, truck, inventory, customer complaint, everything else that it takes prep wise to run the store... anyway he said he would get back to me. Few days later he came back with a “deal”.. he said he’d pay me 12.50 and a bonus check starting at at least 150 most 200 every 4 weeks, then he said or 12.00 bonus check and extra 50$ for your phone bill BUT if he does this for me I have to make a long term commitment to him?? Which he didn’t even give me an exact time... and I have hard time standing up for myself so in the moment I was like shit I guess just pay my phone bill.

So now I’m stuck with the 12.00 and no phone bill ugh so frustrating! But I also feel guilty because he does things like buy me AirPods for Christmas or  he gave me a gift card for new shoes!

The first two times, I was so nervous, nobody came and it wasn’t good.

The third time, I came, she said she came (she didn’t), she was on birth control. From the moment I came, I felt regret and fear, for upwards of a week after I felt paranoia.

I am scared I cannot get past this fear and I will never be able to be intimate with a woman. I am horrified of the consequences of sex. I do not think I could handle a girl getting pregnant with my kid and keeping it. It would be life shattering, and I don’t know if a little pleasure is worth all that.

I have never had causal sex (I have heard this can be a sort of “practice” for sex with a partner). How do people do that without being in constant fear? I am in constant envy of them.

I am just as horny as any other 19 year old, if not more so, which makes this even more frustrating because the desire is there and strong. Masturbating is about as interesting as eating a chicken nugget at this point, I basically only do it because it helps me not be so uptight sometimes and sometimes it helps me sleep.

373,"I’ve been talking to this person and its getting serious. 
I have a habit of using a certain nickname for every person I’ve been interested in. It’s cute and they always really like it. I say it without thinking and it usually ends up sticking. But this person I’m talking to told me they really like nicknames, and they like getting different, special ones. But then quickly said this nickname in particular is what they want me to commonly refer to them as. 

It feels sort of shitty knowing this has been a habitual thing with my partners. I want to make this person feel special. Do I tell them this is a common nickname I used in the past? Or do I just keep using it and let them enjoy it?",29Mar2020,1
374,"Strap in this is a long one. So, iv'e been depressed since about 8th grade. I started smoking weed in 10th grade because I hated my body because I had stunted growth. Weed started as id smoke it when I had nothing to do, but day after day of going to community college I caved in, and started smoking pretty much everyday (no longer caring about driving while high). This was somewhat due to a lot of my girlfriends friends, and my girlfriend (18F) having dab carts. Shit, Ex-girlfriend as of like 5 minutes ago, ill get to that. But anyway awhile went by, still depressed, but better when stoned, also something to mention when I used to be stoned back then id call myself squibbly because thats what my girlfriend would call me because id act completely differently (that's relevant ill get to it).  Relatively recent (Pre-outbreak) I was smoking in my ex girlfriends friends car with one other friend. I gotta super stoned, which is normal but this time, my brain started taking more control than normal, and I started fantasizing about me, fucking my girlfriends friend. I gotta pretty into it, then realized what the fuck was going on and started freaking out. The freak out escalated, (ive had plenty of freak outs while high), but it got really bad to the point where I was thinking about killing myself, and then it all climaxed, and I dissociated. First it started with me realizing how much I think about killing myself, I have a memory of me telling my dad I was gonna kill myself when I was young (idk 7?). I've been thinking about killing myself just occasionally my whole life, and oddly casually. Only in my adolescence has it been that I thought ab it when I was suffering, but in my younger years I guess I just did for fun? Not sure. Then I started seeing the world as almost 2D, but still 3D. Almost as an alien from a different dimension saw the earth. I saw people, many people, all driving around to where that had to go. I saw people in the cafeteria walking around and talking. And then I started panicking even more, its kind of hazy, I thought the universe might have been created by some 4D being and now were just sitting on its night stand, or maybe this planet is just a breeding ground for the strongest being (based on how natural selection would work, it is the same way computer simulations run till you get the based product, just keep trying over and over till you get the best, eliminating all doubt). Then I texted my girlfriend for a bit, took a philosophy test in which I remember feeling completely insane, and I wrote a P.S. at the end and the only thing I remember writing was ""the universe is so simple"" which sounds conceited, but I was getting at the idea that our perception of reality is only limited to what we know, and we base all our believes on that perception, and all our laws are grounded in that reality, how could someone possibly imagine anything else? You cant.  So anyway after that realization my girlfriend sat me down in the cafeteria the next day, and basically was like you need to get your shit together, so I started cleaning my room and taking care of myself (I wasnt showering for awhile). I'm back at that point now btw (why would I? I don't leave my house). So Basically things continued and for the most part I was alright. Then I started feeling shitty again, idk it just happened. Then Corona happened, and now its getting recent. I've been really fucking shitty, for the past few weeks. I dissociated again and realized im probably schizophrenic. So I have a better understanding of these dissociations now. I believe it is either A all schizo thoughts or B my mind opens whether that be the schizo or not it feels like my thoughts come from an objective place and a lot of the time make a lot of sense. The last time I dissociated involuntarily this time was sort of by accident. I was just relaxing just smoked. Started arguing in my head was like alright lets see how this goes, bam next thing you know it im realizing how pointless this video game is, and realizing my body feels like its possessed (this was interesting, I have something wrong with me idk what it is, I pop my pimples, chew my nails, and something else that I dont wanna share, but its gross and akin to the other two (gotta keep some secrecy for this monologue to be interesting). So when I was DSed (dissociated I dont wanna keep typing it though) I was having thoughts like ""why does my body hate me?"" ""why can I only control my hands?"" ""what part of my brain controls my body?"" And this got me thinking, so i started trying to talk to that part of my brain didnt work but later I started having that. It was like aspects of my personality were taking turns at the podium that was my train of thought. Some of me I recognized, and some went too quickly for me to understand where it was coming from. I felt Me as in Me sober not dissociated it was weird. It felt warm and sort of loving but also very tiring. Also ive just been having a lot of thoughts about how pointless life feels you live as a cog of the machine of humaity, and idk it just feels really shitty. The only economic strategy that has worked is different iterations of ones based on knowing full well humans are greedy. We just made this society because theres so damn many of us because the dice rolled out that those trees happened to die forcing our ancient simian ancestors to the ground. So anyway back to my girlfriend. She just broke up with me. I didnt see it coming somehow. But anyway it was cause of a lot of shit but basically I just always seem unhappy with her, which I do a lot. She has like different ways of acting and some really annoy me and some make me happy, but as she said about half an hour ago ""it seems like the things you dont like about me out way the things you do like about me"" Which honestly i think is accurate. Also ive been losing my shit lately as ive just explained, and telling her about my suicidal thoughts. It feels overwelmingly shitty to be broken up with rn with everything thats going on. I havent seen her in fucking weeks and I miss her so much. Also shes been hanging out with one of my friends when I cant see her (my dad is afraid of getting sick), then she was texting him and not me all day today. She said that. But i dont know i dont think shed ever cheat on me but its a lingering thought for sure. She was really broken up on the phone, lots of crying. I couldnt cry. She commented on it that it validated a lot of her thoughts she had about me. Now im left here. What the fuck do I do? I already felt like I was teetering on the edge, and now the only form of what I thought was stability in my life is gone. And shes completely right, weve been bad for awhile, and in all honesty I dont know if it was meant to be. But right now, I know I miss her so fucking much and seeing her face again might give me hope.

I know I need therapy, ive been trying. Also with whats going on right now I dont wanna just talk on the phone, I feel like my problems are very deep seeded and idek. I'm so sick, of just trying and trying and trying, and getting kicked down, and people say ""oh thats life"" If that's life I dont see the point. It's also really hard when you feel like every aspect of your life doesnt matter. I wish I could just exist without having an issue with it. I'm sorry I didn't try harder.",29Mar2020,1
375,"Hi there, I graduated university in 2017 with a CS degree through an engineering program. There, I learned a lot about abstract computer science theory, math, and natural science. However, in post grad, I find that I am deeply lacking knowledge regarding the humanities, social sciences, and the skills associated such as writing and communication. I find myself spending a lot of time learning about philosophy, history, religion, gender, race, and much more through reading books and watching videos.

The logic I held as an undergrad was to spend 4 years learning something completely foreign to me - computer science. I think I've always known I was more of a humanities based person on the inside, but I thought it'd be interesting if I totally suppressed that interest in favor of something completely foreign, and frankly uncomfortable to me - computer science. So I reasoned that I would spend my college years learning computer science and would spend time and energy towards liberal arts post college on my own time, since I felt that would happen anyways but not for computer science. I guess I could've done both, but I rationalized that I wanted to go as far as possible with pure CS in undergrad and felt studying liberal arts would detract from my net total CS learning.

Now armed with a pretty solid CS foundation, I'm looking for ways to supplement that knowledge with the humanities and social sciences. However, it seems like most grad level degree programs are more pre-professional, not as say unstructured as a traditional undergrad program where you can sort of pick and choose your courses.

So my main question is what are the best paths are there to learn more about the humanities and social sciences? I provided the above context in case anyone had a suggestion.

I honestly don't just want to be a software engineer, and I struggled through 4 years of CS to not just write software but to do combine the CS engineering mindset with the liberal arts to do something meaningful and help advance society.

Thanks for reading - looking forward to your thoughts and happy to elaborate on further details if I can.",29Mar2020,1

Now, because of the Corona Virus Lock Down (plus the fact that I broke my arm a couple of weeks before that), I haven't been able to do any sport for over a month now. I leave the house once a day to go for a walk (currently still permitted) and I do a little bit of core exercise each day (that doesn't put strain on my injured arm).  


It's a good thing that I'm not hugely sad about it, but I thought I'd feel a little sad.",29Mar2020,1
377,"i’ve recently realized i’m particularly (exclusively) attracted to guys i can impress/provide for. i have a very dominant and motherly personality and almost every guy i’ve dated has either not had a car at the time or still lived with his parents or was “in between jobs”... i have an odd ‘i can fix them’ complex. this preference of mine makes it really difficult to meet ppl outside of my comfort zone and ppl who can provide for ME or even meet women i’m interested in! 

i’m actually in a relationship rn with a guy who is struggling to go back to college after dropping out... i really like him though, so hopefully it’ll last a while! in the case that it ends, do you have any advice for meeting people that have their shit together and can help support ME?",29Mar2020,1

I also have a dry cough, but I think its more of a cough that Im forcing because I feel like I want to, rather than one that’s reoccurring that I cant hold in. Ive checked my temp and its normal. I wake up every morning with a bit of a sore throat and stuffed nose but that always clears up when I get out of bed. For all I know, it could be stress.

380,"      (TL/DR at the bottom)
     My brother (21M) has not spoken to me(18F) in at least 6 or 7 years and I have no idea why. We got along fine before, and would always play together when we were little or on vacation, so I'm not sure where it all came from and I can't pinpoint an exact moment when it started. In this time he has fatshamed me, made me feel like I didn't exist and degraded me to the point of me self harming and wanting to kill myself, all without acknowledging my presence or speaking a single word to me. (I.e he would flick water of his hands in my direction as if I wasn't there, I'll say something and he won't respond, he has said he doesn't have a sister (other than my other sister) etc.). He is currently in university, and has not permanently lived at home in 4 years. My brother went to a university close to where we lived, but 3 ish years ago my family (my parents, younger sister (10y/o), and I) moved to another country. My brother has a strained relationship with my parents, because of my father (who we all have our issues with). My mother tries to justify his behaviour saying ""we abandoned him by moving"" and ""he was bullied"" and ""he'll grow out of it"", but he's an adult now and I honestly can't deal with it anymore. Plus he treats my sister normally- plays games with her, talks to her, messages her when he's at university, etc. She actually has the most contact with him out of our whole family.
     2 years ago, my brother spent the summer with us and sent me into the worst episode of depression I have ever experienced. I spent countless nights crying myself to sleep, banging my head against the wall, hiding in a corner of my room barely able to breathe. Even after he left, I was so stressed and overwhelmed that I almost failed my last year of high school. I was severely depressed and ended up going to therapy after finally having the courage to tell my parents about my suffering (they were aware of my brother's treatment of me, but I always dealt with it, occasionally cried and 'recovered' outwardly, but obviously inside, I was pretty much destroyed). But my therapist had limited time before retiring and we spent most of our time dealing with the consequences of my brother's visit- so trying to pass senior year- and never really were able to work through my issues with my brother. (I live in a country where I'm not fluent in the native language and in an area where it's difficult to find therapy offered in English so I've been unable to find a new one).
     With COVID-19, for some reason, he decided he wanted to come stay with us again. My parents say they're on my side and if he does anything else bad that they will send him to stay with other nearby family for the duration of his stay, but he hasn't done anything outside of the usual ignoring me and I feel like I can't ask them to choose between him and me.
     He's only been here a week and I'm already reverting back to who I was a year ago and I don't want to go through that again. So basically my question is, how do I deal with him/confront him/ move on from this? I move for university in the fall, so I will finally be able to cut him out, but until then I have to walk on eggshells with him so I don't undo the ""progress"" that my mother claims he is making. I just want this issue to be over, but at the same time I'm kind of scared of him. When he enters the room I feel so drained and distant. I've spent too much time blaming myself for the way he treats me and trying figure out what was wrong with me that made him do this, which isn't fair because I was only a freaking child when he stopped talking to me... 

TL/DR My estranged brother has pretended I don't exist for a long time and he is now staying with us for quarantine and I need help trying to deal with him. And my mother is constantly trying to justify his actions to me.",29Mar2020,1
381,"Before I was mostly just an anxious, sweet kid who just kept to herself. Despite having ptsd I still had a lot of friends and a supportive family until I figured out that my parent tried to abort me and allowed me to get molested at the age of 6 and never told me about it then lied about it then told the truth because she couldn’t handle the guilt, then lied about it again (she was clearly gaslighting I’m not sure if you can tell). 

After years of domestic abuse, alcoholism, and addiction I became insufferable. I constantly lash out at people, want to bash their heads in, and play victim even when it’s unintended. Then I get upset if these people don’t want anything to do with me (mostly my family). I’m just like “wow you people are so fucking sensitive, at least you’re not getting choked, spit on, or burnt with cigarettes.” Even the “messed up” people I’ve met/ befriended in my area are shocked at how cold I am/how much I’ve changed and eventually drop me. It’s annoying because they assume that idk what they’re doing w the whole ~self care involves leaving toxic people, have boundaries.~ if you knew what I went through and we used to be friends for years prior, shouldn’t you want to help me? You’re seriously going to shit on me to others and call me toxic to my face after everything 

I don’t know if I’ll get back to normal. It’s already been over a year since the abuse or since I used alcohol/drugs. I don’t trust the therapists in my area since I recently moved to a town full of sheltered people The three therapists I wentitwere too busy being shocked at how fucked I am to treat me properly and were constantly trying to shove religion down my throat in “subtle” ways since they didnt actually know how to deal with me. My mom is paranoid of me leaving the house even though I’m 20, almost done with uni, and perfectly capable of working and driving so I just stay home to make her feel better since she keeps freaking out every time I leave the house (yes, I am capable of empathy, surprisingly). She genuinely believes I’ll get myself killed or kill someone else if I’m not under supervision. I’m so used to having these thoughts that it seems stupid to act on them, especially since she’ll probably kill herself/become vegetative if I do, leading to a cycle of more dysfunction within my family. Obviously if I didn’t have people who cared i would have killed at least 10 people already before killing myself. So don’t worry I’m still grateful for what I have lmao

I’ve clearly taken on many of the characteristics of my abuser. Im so annoyed at people who use their therapy voice on me to tell me this when they’re literally just neurotypical idiots who think they can play psychologist after reading one article on self care. Like yes, I can fucking comprehend what you’re saying, you can’t even do basic math you stupid piece of shit. I don’t have to take unsolicited advice from your dumbass.

I’m sickly self-aware and I genuinely hate myself for allowing this person to turn me into this. I never loved him (it was the drugs lmao) but cared so much about him and felt some weird need to save him. He just used this against me and now I hate the fuck out of everyone and believe that everyone has awful intentions. 

How does anybody become stable and able to trust after something like thisAt least I get good marks so I’m ok right?. I’m a total dumbass in everything else so please stop using my academics for validity Nd Psychiatric hospitals are a hassle to get into so please don’t recommend this to me.

My issue- 
So before I moved my mother was with this super toxic man, he would beat the hell out of her, in front of my siblings. He sent her to the hospital a while back too. He hates children so he would always trash us to our faces and to my mother (she does nothing about it) 

Long story short he was inappropriate with me and touched my thigh, a couple times. Next time my ass. 
I finally told my mother and she ofc didn't care, she said she needed his side of the story and that she didn't really believe me or believe he meant it ""that way"" 

I moved out into my friends place and she eventually left him. But of course this mf waited till I moved out of the province and got back with him.

Everything was done for me, from my gran making all my meals, even as an almost full adult, to my mum cleaning my room for me because I never did. When I moved out and into my uni dorms, in another part of the country from everyone I know and love, I started making excuses for myself why I wasnt doing anything - including my share of the cleaning in the communal kitchen ""Oh I'm just back from work and I'm exhausted"" ""Not feeling too well today"" ""I have an essay to write I'll do it tomorrow"". Almost 3 years later, I'm in my own studio flat and have a boyfriend and I have realised - I'm really just lazy after having everything done for me my entire life. 

My boyfriend pointed it out. He was the opposite of me that his family shared all the work load, no one was exempt. So I want to change, but as they say old habits die hard. I found if I get into a routine, then things get done eg. I eat better, I clean properly and I dont leave my uni work to the day before it's due . But as soon as I fall out of that routine things go back to the way they were and I turn lazy again. 

Since the whole pandemic I'm finding it hard to keep a routine and I'm finding myself slipping again. Basically I'm looking for any advice on how to keep to a routine without falling out of it. Any advice is welcome! I really want to change and stop being the lazy spoiled brat I was raised as and become my own responsible person, especially since my boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together next year

392,"A bit of background first: I am French in the French education system, I have been studying engineering for four years and did two years of scientifically-oriented high school before that. Hated the high school except that one subject, biology, taught by that one teacher. Failed/dropped out of my first year of college, which was a non-specific, high workload and competitive curriculum that drove me deep into depression for which I took meds for 8 months, changed for a more specific programme that was less time-heavy and more group-work oriented and I am about to finally finish my bachelor. 

I hated the whole process since I started doing science intensive curriculum in high-school and could only ever tolerate (but loved) the subjects taught by the teachers I loved. I have been dragging my feet and hiding my stress from myself for years. The main reason I (probably) will manage to graduate is my boyfriend, who I met in my course, who pushed me to work.

Now boyfriend’s back in Mexico and planning to start working. I was always told growing up that having a Master’s degree is the best insurance of a good career, a safety blanket to always fall back on. Plus, education is very cheap in Europe (I am looking at programmes that cost no more than 3000€ a year, most of them completely free and my family can afford it). That came mostly for my dad. So I grew up not even thinking of the idea of not doing a Master’s. I have found a few options, a bit more oriented towards a subject I think I like, design, as I was studying Mechanics and Aerospace engineering till then and liked the mechanics part. 

Still, now I don’t want to live like this anymore, doing something I don’t like but do because I am academically inclined and getting passing, and even decent marks is not too hard for me. I am just not sure if I would really like any master’s I found and would get into and if I don’t, I won’t have the force of pushing through it like I did till now. I have been stressing out, in sort of low-grade depression, for almost as long as I have been doing my bachelor’s. I don’t want to see people, talk to people, I don’t have any hobby except watching videos all day, have no memory or focus. I lose so much hair it’s terrifying, it only stops in the summer when I’m not in school (has been going on for two years). Finishing the last projects for that degree is very painful. I limit the sport I do and refuse to meditate because those activities make my emotions surface and I start crying uncontrollably.

My plan was to enroll in a 2 years Master’s programme in Europe (usual length in EU), and then move to Mexico with my boyfriend, work either in an engineering company, assist him as an entrepreneur or something else (like teaching French). I am starting to think that I should stop living my life like this and maybe doing a Master’s isn’t the thing to do right now, so another plan would be to, when I will have done my mandatory internship and the coronavirus craze will be over, take some time off and work for some time to figure out what I want. Engineering is all I’ve been doing all my life because my father and grandfather did it before me, I don’t know how to do anything else and I don’t know what I would like to do.

A few problems with that: I would probably go do those six months in Mexico, and don’t know if I could ever have the strength to come back, without him, to do my Master’s if I decided to. It would make our two years before being together and starting our family two years and a half. My father is emotionally unstable and will freak out if I tell him I am postponing my Master’s indefinitely and moving to Mexico, especially if I don’t have a precise plan of action. It’s a conversation I would not wish on my worst enemy and will be extremely hard, especially as I am not in the best emotional shame myself. Finally, I am scared as shit of giving up on the life plan that’s been ingrained in me since childhood and making such a bold move. For the reasons aforementioned I can’t really discuss that with my parents, and my boyfriend has heard me talk about it so many times but can’t really help.

I am sorry if the post is a bit disorganised, unclear, and long, but this has been putting me in very distraught states and I cannot get help from anyone around me. I will make corrections and clear up any detail needed.",29Mar2020,1
393,"Okay I need some help here. I'm a 13 year old girl and I've had ""anger issues"" in the past and present. Not diagnosed, but I get irritated very easily. If someone even breathes next to me when I'm in a bad mood I go up to my room and start freaking out and punching/kicking everything I can. (I'm not kidding. Someone actually breathed and I freaked out.) I've dabbled in self harm a bit but not that much. So the thing I need advice on is if it's normal to have very homicidal thoughts, to the extent where I've planned how I would murder my friends. My life and social situation is fine, I'm not being bullied, abused, or anything. Sure, I may have people at school who don't like me but I like it when they get mad at me. It feels like I'm important. I love starting fights too. I frequently imagine who I could beat up. Once when I was tackling someone (in a friendly game of football) I gave them a bloody nose on accident. I felt so good. Even when I'm not angry, the thought of killing someone calms me. When I think of their family I can't imagine them feeling sad, like it's just one big blur for me. I wouldn't torture them (unless they deserve it, like 2 specific enemies of mine) I would just shoot, or stab, them. Is this normal? If it isn't, what should I do?

399,"My partner (20M) told me today that I am too attached to him and that it's unhealthy for our relationship.

We've been together for almost 4 years and live together, all of my friends and family live an hour or so away so I spend most of my time with him when I'm not at work.

He said that we should do more things separate, like hobbies, and I agree.
I have things I do that he is not interested in but there's nothing he does outside of the home--all of his hobbies are gaming and watching YouTube (which isn't my thing)

He said that I get too upset when he isn't home with me and says that it's unhealthy being so ""co-reliant"" and that I should let him go out and not be angry or upset with him.

Though the only reason I get angry or upset is when he either leaves without telling me where he's going or he tells me he will be home at a certain time and then comes home wayyyyy later - I am angry /upset by this because panic sets in and he doesn't answer his phone.

I know I need to calm down and not take everything to heart but I've been like this for 20 years and I really do want to change but don't know how.

My idea of love is that we are both devoted to each other, we do whatever it takes to help each other and make each other happy. We look after each other, we spend our time together or doing things for one another
~that is my love language~
And I've always wanted someone who will do that for me as I do that for them

His idea of love is that we do things together but we do things alone too, that we are complete opposite in interest and that opposites attract. 

He was raised to be pretty much self reliant and taught himself mainly everything so maybe thats where this sense of being okay alone comes from 
I was raised relying on my family (my dad passed away when I was younger so my sister and mum and I bound together to get through) and didn't like being alone, I've always loved company and find no solace in spending time completely by myself. 
I have told him this many times. 

I have talked to a counsellor briefly, I don't think couples counselling would help much and I've suggested making a list of things we can do together and things that we can do separately months ago but he never made the effort to really do it meanwhile I made a list in my phone and suggested ideas of things for both of us to which he rejected.

I don't know what to do and I don't want to end things, I want to fix it and be better for him and for us.

Also want to make clear here that I am in no way controlling him, he can come and go as he pleases, and I am not using my mental health or dads passing as pity so please don't go there 

Any advice is welcome💛

Now I don't know how to choose where or what to learn out of my options.

While I pretty much already concluded that 8 want to study computer science, as it interests me, I have a passion for it, and it got a great job market.

The problem is I didn't get accepted into the regular universities where I live in this major, while I did get into a prestigious private one that I really like and feel I fit into.
The prestigious one is really expansive (while the regular ones are subsidized by the government), and I really can't see myself forcing my parents to help me with it.

1. Anyway go to the prestigious university, as its the obvious right path, despite my conscious.

412,"Hi all! My mom is 47 years old, and she is dramatically changing her manners from day to day, and I don’t know what to do, and I am so worried for her. First of all, she started to talk so fast. Although I tell her that she talks so fast that I can’t even follow, she only thinks I am a jerk and don’t want to listen to her. She doesn’t even realize that she talks so fast. And as you see she is getting way aggressive on very simple things. She yells and sometimes throws things that she never used to doing them before. And she is always depressive and pessimistic now. I mean that I wanted to talk to her to figure out what’s happening but she suddenly accuses me for being the worst person on the earth. When she saw her friend texted “ ok” to her question, she  said that she’s changed a lot. She says her friend doesn’t care her at all and she is evil. She also talks to herself too rapidly and yells randomly. I ask why she talks to herself or yells, but she doesn’t believe me that she even does them. Once she told me that she didn’t know why she was angry but her head was full of anger, and she wanted to act violently with anyone when she was outside. She says that she want to suicide when she only sees a spoon on a table, she thinks that look like a big mess. I try not to trigger her with cleaning everything. But she finds something to fight, something that is so little. Also, she is normally very intelligent person, however she says, I have to say that way, very stupid things. For example,  the earth might be like plate and scientists must be lying. If I try to explain at all, she says I am evil, and starts to throw things and yell. That’s why I don’t want to talk to her anymore, because that makes her even more depressed. But I don’t want her feel lonely either. She lost her car key a day before and woke me up and said I must have steal it. Or a thief from outside must come and steal it. But I say that there isn’t any other things stolen plus the car is still outside, she thinks I must have stole it then since I try to explain. I said if she looked closely to her bag or such common places, but she said that I am evil to say this to her, and she isn’t stupid. She said she looked, but I found the key in her bag. She never believed that I found it but stole it. I just want to cry. I am so overwhelmed. Normally talking must help. But she talks things over and over again too and the things that are always depressive and makes her even more angry. It’s not good for both of us. She has a coworker, who she thinks she does everything to kick her out, and talks about her all the time and what she does. But it is almost always the same things she did two weeks ago that Monday. Maybe that person is a trigger of all but now I realized that she is exaggerating what she does too. If she doesn’t talk about her, she talks about what happened twenty years ago between my fathers mother and her. Surely, I know that my fathers mom was not a nice person, why talk about her now ? And why talk about the same things over and over as if I listen for the first time ? 
Moreover, there was another friend, and she said look at her facial expressions! Did I do something to her ? I did nothing wrong but she is acting that way ! And I literally see that her friend was just so nice and nothing as she says happening. She always things everything is made up, a trick , and every person is somewhat evil. She talks a lot of conspiracy theories. She also started to speak when she sleep sometimes. Also she suddenly wakes up and says she can’t breathe. We went to a doctor and the doctor found nothing but might be panic attack. Can that be the cause of all ? I thought maybe finding a new hobby might help to distract her mind. But again she refuses to do anything. I first thought maybe she have bipolar disorder but she actually never happy once but constantly depressed over what I have no idea. She became unbearable now. She seems to melt from day by day and I want to help her, but I don’t understand what’s it. Has anyone experienced something like this? She won’t go to a expert at all.  I am helpless. Recently we learned that my mothers mom has Alzeimer, and my mom thinks it’s made up. She acts her so badly as she does too me, but this is the times that we need to support each other. I can’t recognize my mother anymore. She was a brilliant and kind women and now all of a sudden  very rude and silly. She is here but not here. I miss her a lot. 😣",29Mar2020,1
413,"Hi there,

i'm currently in quarantine and as i suppose you are too. I found myself being busy for the most part until I recently noticed that there are many things I am missing out on.

I am in my last year of school and we're not doing any online lessons in my class. I suppose my teachers think we're smart enough and can educate ourselves well enough.

I started to test this and on my journey I found quite a few interesting things that I want to tell you:

-First of all, if you want to educate yourself, you literally have no excuses, it all comes down to your mindset. I found it easy to have a specific time set only for studying or doing regular other productive things. Since I am a little weak on maths, I decided to do maths at 12 am, that's how my day begins after waking up and breakfasting. And this is particularly easy for me, because there is a guy who streams on YouTube for the specific content I need mainly for the quarantine. To find that flow of work, you need to commit on something and work on it, if it fails approach it differently.

-Finding sources for education has gotten so easy and there are so many people providing them: I started learning programming and on my way I found many ways how to learn. For example on Udemy, YouTube and many other, the list is too long, but I can show you more in the comments if there is a demand. And I would really advise you to really look for some yourself, I haven't figured out most of the online education providers and I'm sure more than enough.

-Reward yourself: You have more than enough time now and it's totally fine to use that time for your own well-being. Nothing can stop you from that, but keep it simple and only use it as some kind of reward. Use it wisely like snacks for your doggo. If you give them snacks for doing nothing, it won't bring much.

Do you have to tell us any cool things since the quarantine began? 
I noticed that many people are giving free things away now more and more  Especially online courses and eBooks or subscriptions. Even on the more erotic side there is free stuff.
What are free things that you found?",29Mar2020,1

Just as some back story i live in the countryside where there aren’t that many people my age. The one group of friends are potheads and some are daily coke heads.

They are mostly alright people, however i feel like i have outgrown them and their conversation. Also this one guy (who owns the house everyone goes over) manipulates me a lot. He is very clingy and emotional, will do anything to get what he wants and if you don’t you’re a bad friend. 

He has never done anything major to make me fall out with him, but its lots of little stuff like he would owe me £20 for months, then after i bring it up multiple times he would say “don’t worry i will pay you back”, only to message me the next week saying “I’ve bought a drone!”. Then i never hear a word about the money. 

I tried ignoring his messages for a while because i was sick of him but he would be like “So are we on a no talking basis then 😅?”.

Thing is he realises that i am empathetic and a push over, i don’t know if he sees me as a friend or just a puppet. 

I personally believe the whole ‘you are the average of the people you hang out with most’ thing. But i am worried about being lonely myself. Also he isn’t lazy and he does make me do some fun stuff and exercise. He is selfish and manipulative but on the flip side he does cool shit that i also like.

As a child who got brought up in a cultural and religious family I had been taught a set of values and morals to believe in as well as pride, cleanliness and self respect. The fact that I chose to be with the woman of my life and married her recently who also happened to have sexual intercourse before I came into her life really bothers me, I feel guilty and upset at the same time and haven't been able to come to terms with it. I strongly believed in this principal and always sought for someone who would be a virgin and clean. I can't believe myself and even though I love her so much but I feel like it's unfair to me and her when I think like this. I am really under big depression because of this very inner conflict I have with this fact. I got her pregnant and she is at week 13 already. I ask God for forgiveness and help.

I've mentioned it to him and my mother several times over the course of these three years. my mother of course is against it but is more supporting as in ""It's your life and I understand."" My father on the other hand is completely against it, stating: That's not my decision to make because I have younger siblings that need me or want me. I understand that but I also want to live my life. Always felt like the Marines could offer me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Because it's always felt like my dad has looked down on me for anything I've done. Given that my father I think would lock me in the house before he allowed me to leave to MEPS station or even recruiter's office... I don't have my own vehicle or license I do have my permit, but he's very slow and getting me to get my license given the fact that I could leave. I've already contacted my local recruiter, and he even stated he could come pick me up. How am I supposed to be picked up and then expect to come back home after being missing and not face the consequences? And then need to leave out again for a meps station? They won't take me and he's gonna be super angry at me for doing this, not just about going behind his back but joining the Corps.... I'm actually quite eager to hear both criticism and advice. Helps me either way.",29Mar2020,1
422,"So, I'm not the healthiest person out there and often get sick; I also have allergies so I can't really eat some high protein foods. My parents think that sea cucumbers is a high protein food that is extremely good at boosting my immune system and helping me grow into a more healthy person. 

The thing is, though, Sea Cucumbers taste absolutely horrendous (for me at least). Even the smell is enough to make me lose my appetite. To even eat a small piece, I have to pinch my nose shut and swallow it down with a cup of water, and thoroughly rinse my mouth with tap water. Otherwise the taste will make me gag and want to throw up.

425,"This COVID stuff is getting everyone in my family hard. My she who is my mother is the regional director for ambulatory care and she’s pulling over 60 hrs a week and is always on call. My dad has to work in a cramped office surrounded by my brothers playing video games. They are both working hard and I respect it and try to make life easier at home for them. However it’s hard because since I had a dry throat once due to dehydration and coughed, now my brothers scream COVID as soon as they see me. I’m the quiet one, so instead of telling my brothers to quiet, I am forced to stay in my room. Its just easier for my parents to deal with.

It’s small, claustrophobic almost, and I can’t do art there which normally calms me, and I’m not able to leave and go for a jog on the trail near my home to alleviate stress. I understand it’s for my moms health, she’s a hero after all, but I feel like a bird in a cage. My friends say “it’s good for your mom, it’s for her and everyone.” It was just a dry throat though that alleviated with a bit of tea, and my parents know my brothers are loud and dramatic. I can’t even get tested (neither can my mother) so I can at least have a functional family.

All I'm trying to do is not to get hit by her. Because the most recent two times she hit me left physical consequences. She hit my good eye and now it's worse and she left two scars on my neck.

But the thing is,she gets mad about everything. If I cut some sausages wrong for example,she goes absolute crazy and starts to shout at me. If I don't mop the floor the way SHE mop the floor,she goes crazy and call me stupid and threatens to break my phones. Even if I'm just chilling in my room after I did all the chores she asked me to do,she WILL come into my room and starts to have a breakdown because I wasn't spending time with her.

433,"TL;DR: Need help with how to distance myself from toxic friendship

I reconnected with an old friend mid last year, and things were fine for a while. However this year, and the end of last year, it's started becoming really toxic. I know for a fact she does not want the best for me. I know this because she goes out of her way to avoid congratulating me or supporting me with literally anything. It even goes as far as not liking my instagram posts. Who does that?

She has openly admitted to tracking my boyfriend on snapmaps. And me, might I add. There are so many other things, I could go on for days. She really has no life whatsoever and thrives over drama and negativity. I don't know what I have done to make her not want to support me. 

One minute I decide I don't want to speak to her, and she'll call me and want to talk for hours. Mind you its a one-sided conversation the entire time and its just her blabbing on about negative bullshit and just being the worst. 

I'm literally just so fucking done with the entire thing. I want out. But I'm too weak to take action. She's somehow convinced me that I need her in my life. I don't but it's so fucking hard. This whole thing makes me feel so weak and so powerless. If I don't have the balls to cut her off, how can I regain power in this situation?",29Mar2020,1

437,"I am a game developer working part time. I am 29 and live with a room-mate, which affords me the luxury of not having to work full time. I work part time because I want to put as much time as possible into my game development as I want that to be my sole source of income someday. I'm not afraid of working hard, I work extremely hard on my games, but I seem to have a serious problem with working jobs for employers.   

Despite not working full time hours, I find working extremely taxing on my mental well being. This seems to be a trend with part time work, that they are very monotonous and don't offer much in the way of a challenge. Evidently, some people are able to go into a kind of autopilot and just get through the day and not think too much of it. I don't know why I am unable to do that, but I just can't.  

I have reached a point of what I think could be considered some sort of depression. I have become uninterested in doing anything really. Anything that requires effort to setup I just end up avoiding, Most days I'm surprised that I even made it through the day. I often end up sitting in silence just thinking about why I am struggling and what I could do to resolve my issues. I have thought about it so much that I am mentally exhausted and can't seem to make any progress anymore, so now I rarely even try.   

Reaching out for help is not something I normally do. I hate burdening others with my problems and worry that I am just being ungrateful and unreasonable. But this has been going on for years and I have reached a point in my life where I don't think I can keep doing this, I am concerned for my future.  

I know I should be going to see a therapist and I actually intend on doing that very soon, but in the meantime I really wanted to hear from people who may have similar feelings towards work or have any advice for me. It would be greatly appreciated",29Mar2020,1
438,"So, for those who don't know, chronophobia is the fear of passing time. I've been getting anxiety over this since I was 18. Years just seem to pass so much faster than I expected. I remember stuff that happened two years ago like it was one month ago, and I just get this feeling that I'll be 30 very soon and then 40. 

I'm not afraid of death, I'm just afraid of not enjoying my life. I'm still young, and want to create nice memories, I want to reach 30 feeling that I've really lived 30 years, because right now I feel like I'm 16. I moved from my parents home, I work and maintain myself. I lived one year in another country, and it was such an amazing time, I felt alive for the first time, and I'm considering doing it again. But I just feel it's not enough. 

So, people on reddit who are over 30-40, what are those things you recommend me to do now so I'll be happy when I reach your age? What are those great memories you're happy you created, or those experiences that made time slowing down? Please only things that I can reach on my own, avoid stuff like ""experiencing love"" or ""traveling all around the world"". Just things I can start doing now.

447,"I feel so overwhelmed with negative emotions. I am overly paranoid of my surroundings, of what could go wrong any minute, of me being hurt. And that leads to me being a people pleaser. If I notice a slight change in someone's tone, I immediately think they don't like me. And when I feel like they don't like me, I will try to get them to like me. Because I desperately need  people's validation. I have this constant fear and anxiety of people disliking me and instead I end up pushing them away, as if I have the power to abandon them before they do. I have moments where I hate everyone's guts. I have ruined so many good relationships and friendships because of the way I feel. I am in a relationship right now, and I do love him so much. But I can hate him for the slightest things in seconds. My emotions just fluctuate and it's destroying my life. We could watch a movie together, and if the actress is some hot woman, even without him making any remarks, I start hating his guts. I am just so easily triggered. It doesn't make sense. I will treat him like shit for it, and he doesn't even have to do anything for that to happen. He doesn't even understand why I turn to so cold out of nowhere. I just have this huge fear of abandonment, of being unwanted, of being easily replaced, so I always like to act like I don't need people. Because I want to hurt them before they hurt me. To feel in control. And that is a constant destructive cycle. All my last relationships ended the same. I treat the guy like shit, very on and off. I leave every time I feel overwhelmed with my emotions. And they never understand why I don't want them anymore. They never do me wrong, its always me ruining relationships because I am drowning in pessimism. I fucking hate myself and the way I am. I can love someone and give them the world one minute and the next I could literally want to have nothing to do with them. And that leads to me being overly passive aggressive, dissonant and mean. Sometimes when my relationship is doing too well, I like to start an argument. Just to see if they would still stay with me. I say evil things and hurt them, just to see if they would still love me the same. I like emotionally hurting people who care about me, I like knowing how attached they are to me. And I like to end relationships because I want them to feel like shit (because they made me feel like shit unintentionally about something that happened ages ago which I probably hold a grudge over, like how they probably secretly thought of the actress while we watched that movie together). And as soon as I end the relationship out of pure hate, I end up in this depressive episode overwhelmed with loneliness.

459,"I keep wondering if I’m in the wrong for reacting to this, but I’ve noticed a pattern when I date guys.

So i know this most likely wont be seen at all by anyone but hey its worth a shot. 
So i know i guy from school (TF) and we were pretty tight untill he moved away and we sorta drifted away. Recently he hit me up outta the blue and asked if i wanted to meet a friend (NF) of his who was struggling with meeting new people. I said sure and we were in a group chat together. I got to know NF pretty well over the next few days and we started gaming together. I discovered through another friend that i still see regularly (OF) that NF was female and in fact TF's girlfriend. As we got to know eachother more and more i learnt about the faults about the relationship and how she felt trapped and she thought she would never find love. One night TF has a suicidal bout ( apparently these are common) and i learn that he is dependant on her and feels that she is his world. I help him through it with her and OF. We started roleplaying one night when we were bored ( like in messages) and it seemed as if our characters fell in love. Tonight ( time of writing) we finished up as she was in a coma and had written her lover a letter confessing her feelings for her. I didnt read it and instead said that one day it might be read or maybe it wont but either way he will be there for her. I asked her if she would have opened the letter and she said yes, i asked her if it was the other way around would she stay in the chair for as long as she needed him or opened the letter and she said she'd open the letter. TF had another suicidal bout and we helped him through it. 

What do i do next? Do i confess my feelings for her? Do i stay as her friend to support her? What about TF? Is all this fair to him? I dont know what to do. Does anyone have any advice?

But with quarantine I’m stuck inside my house. I was on the free reduced lunch program at my school which helped me get three meals a day. Now I’m barely hitting two meals a day because my sleep schedule is thrown off(my fault, I know) and I really relied on FRL to get me through my day. And my mom doesn’t want me to go outside and get food but snacks and such were things I relied on too. Sometimes I get that hungry feeling in my stomach but I feel guilty for eating because something in my head is telling me to save as much food as possible. But I know I have to eat. I don’t want to go back to how I was and use this quarantine as an excuse. 

We have one scale at home but I’m horrified to even think about getting on and finding out my progress has vanished. 

Are there any foods that are rich in nutrients and calories that I could possibly put on our grocery list to make sure I at least keep my weight on? Thanks.",29Mar2020,1
466,"Hello guys. I am sorry for bothering you again but I had a chain of events that drove me insane recently. I need help.

Let's start in chronological order.

0)As a prelude, isolation has worn down my mental health, I became angry and unstable. I like talking to people generally, usually it helps me with my depression. I am a pretty extroverted person.

1) Cut my own hair messily. It was falling on my eyes.

2) Some guy(we will call him A) messaged me that he apparently got a love confession from my girl friend (B). Which is very weird since I never saw B and A together, et cetera.

3) I am Losing in a multiplayer strategy video game pretty badly, 11 hours worth of effort and cunning planning cast into the sea. I don't want my friends to restart the game because I'm trash at everything, either.

4) Previously mentioned friend (B) started acting weirdly. Sending me overly cloying messages (quarantine made my circle of friends only talk online. I think she might be hacked or something. Even her writing style seems kinda weird. I hate to assume and intervene in other people's private lives but something about her recent behaviour is off. Or maybe she is not hacked and it's just me overthinking and being mad everyone around me is in relationship and I am not able to attract anyone.

5) It became apparent that people notice what I, an idiot, did to my hair under stress of quarantine etc. and started commenting it. I am very insecure about my looks so it made me suffer a lot.

6)Woke up at 2 PM, sad and tired.

6) Went to the barber's to fix my hair, at least something is done.

7) Got reminded that I had previously had exchange spot in Romania with Erasmus scholarship NOT given to me. I am super insecure that I will never be able to study abroad. The general trend shows that I will not go anywhere. I will have an open gestalt, a scar to bear with me my whole life that I wanted to study abroad for a semester with scholarship but I never could not. I am not going to lie, I am pretty spiteful and jealous of the person who stole my place. I feel bad for saying this, but I hope something bad happens to her and she doesn't go anywhere. But yeah, mainly mad at myself.

My job (I teach English to grade schoolers) and university will resume in only a few days, but my mental health is so fragile I don't feel like I will manage.

I know most things are here are minor but my brain inflates them and it all accumulates. The devil is in the small things. I'm weak. I'm even afraid to admit to myself that people lose jobs, families, roof above head and yet they don't cry and yet here I am, pathetic middle class man, weak and fragile. I don't know how to calm myself down and start identifying and tackling my problems.",29Mar2020,1

I calmed down after the initial shock and realizing that she’s alive and I’m trying to keep a positive mindset and hoping she’ll get through this, but at the same time I’m on the verge of balling my eyes out.

472,"Important to note; I have not cheated on my current partner in any way, I have not made any advances on the other man.   
 I don't have any clue how to handle this situation; the man I'm currently dating told me that he will refuse to love anyone else after me.  
   
 I know that whatever happens after I leave him won't be my fault but I care about him tremendously. I don't want him to swear off love for the rest of his life because of me. I want him to be happy, but in reality, I think it's my own selfish fear of the repercussions of my actions that are preventing me from leaving. But I feel a strong connection to the man I'm interested in and I want nothing more than to be with him; he makes me unbelievably happy. A happiness that I haven't felt in years.   
 But I don't want to leave who I'm currently seeing because I'm afraid of what might happen if I do. I shouldn't have jumped into this relationship thinking that what I felt for him was love because it wasn't. It was the excitement of something new, something different, that drove me into this. I am at fault for that and these are the consequences of my actions. I made the mistake of confusing one emotion for another and now I'm in a position where I have to decide to either leave him and pursue my own happiness or stay in a one-sided relationship with him so he can finally be happy for once in his life. I mean, the answer might look simple but, as usual, I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. He's a sweet man, I don't want to break his heart. I don't want to add onto the list of problems for him, I don't want to be the reason he stops trying to love. I don't want to hurt him. I know I should do what's best for me and my happiness but I just can't bring myself to. I'm scared and I'm confused and I have no fucking idea what to do.",29Mar2020,1
473,"For the last three years I have been with one of the most amazing, genuine, thoughtful person I have ever met. He makes me laugh and we have so much in common. But here’s the thing. When I met him I was a mess of a person and nowhere near ready for a relationship. Still, I didn’t want to lose him so I agreed to be his girlfriend reluctantly. Ever since then there’s been this looming feeling in the back of my head that one day I will break his heart. The first two years were amazing but I could sense that we have some differences. He’s five years my senior, doesn’t love to travel like I do, and he is more stable in his living situation since he’s on his own and I live with my parents. Any other couple would have moved in together by now but my fear of commitment has held me back tremendously. This may not make sense to anyone, but I do see myself getting married to him and starting a family one day. So why break up? Because I met him when I was freshly 21 and I never expected to settle down then. I have places I want to travel and frankly I might want to explore my options romantically. I started to become distant and in the last year we have taken three “breaks” all of which I have come running back after a day or two cause I can’t picture my life without him. He’s my best friend but we really haven’t been romantic or had a great sex life. Maybe it’s because I’m resentful, maybe I have lost attraction, or maybe that just happens with couples who have been together for years. I wouldn’t know cause this was my first real relationship. I am devastated, I know my lack of confidence in our relationship was causing me to be super hot-and-cold with him. And he definitely deserves better. In a perfect world I would take a year to be single, travel the world, become whole as an individual, and he will be there when I am ready to settle down. But I know that that’s not realistic and I could be losing him forever. My nephew loses his uncle, my dog loses her co-parent. I feel so stupid and terrible. My friends are telling me I made the right decision but I really need to know what to do, some advice on how to cope with this would be really appreciated. I feel like my whole body is on fire and I want to cry every second of the day",29Mar2020,1

Recently came out to my parents after dating my girlfriend for 4 months.

I’m not ready to come out to my entire family. Half is conservative and the other is inappropriate and will just make jokes that I won’t find funny.

Every day not my mum keeps going on about “when you tell people can I be there so I can see their reaction?” or “I can’t wait to see the look on their faces.”

I feel like she’s taking my sexuality far more than it is. I like girls and that’s it. She wants some amazing response from people and to be praised for it like some abnormal thing and it’s really irking me.

475,"Alright y’all this kinda blindsided me so I’m really sorry if this is all jumbled but I really need some advice/opinions. I’m 25F and he’s 33M and we’ve only been dating for 4 months. 

Yesterday I went over to his house to celebrate my birthday. I had been talking to him about going for a hike at this nature preserve close to his house. I had some friends go and it looked really pretty and since everything is closed due to Covid19 I figured it would be nice to get out for a little and go for a short hike which is something he supposedly likes to do. He’s pretty introverted and it’s like pulling teeth to get him to do anything even when it comes to things he likes to do that involve his hobbies. Weather called for storms so my BF was saying we should just stay inside. I get to his place and I see that the storms aren’t supposed to start till later so I ask him to go for a hike and he gets really upset and says “I guess I’ll get ready then”. The way he said it and his facial expression made me feel like I was a nuisance. I was really excited to spend time with him for my birthday and he completely shot me down. 

We get to the preserve and it starts drizzling a little and I mention that I left my jacket in my car and hopefully the rain holds out. He offers to go back to his car to get his other sweatshirt and I said no it’s fine it’s only drizzling and he asks me again if I want to go get it so I said no let’s just keep going it’s fine and this point he gets really mad and yanks my arm back let’s go of my hand and yells god damnit so loud that the runners in front of us looked back. He started walking away from me. I feel like he snapped on me for no reason. We ended up continuing the walk and he could tell that I was upset. He asks what’s wrong and what’s on my mind cause and I just told him I have a lot on my mind and that my birthday is a really hard day for me which it is for a few different reasons. He asks why and I said I didn’t really want to talk about it and I’m just trying to keep my mind off of it and he gets upset again and says “ I’m your BF and you don’t want to talk about it I guess I don’t know everything about you”. I reminded him that we’ve only been dating for 4 months and I apologized. 

Later that day after dinner we’re looking at movies and I mention renting this movie I wanted to watch with him last week. It was $9 and he says oh that’s too much. So I offer to pay for it and he says we don’t have to spend money. I felt defeated after that. 

I feel like this is such a small thing and maybe he just lost his temper for a minute but at the same time there’s been some other red flags. He’s been to rehab for drinking and he stayed sober for 5 years and he told me he was a terrible person when he was drinking. He’s been engaged twice and said that both woman cheated on him. He’s also very romantic most of the time but now I’m afraid he’s been showing signs of grooming. My mind is all over the place right now. My mom is starting to think he may be showing early signs of an abuser. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend yanked my arm back and yelled god damnit at me when I wouldn’t go back for his sweatshirt during a walk and I’m afraid he’s starting to show early signs of an abuser.",29Mar2020,1

On the seventh month of being together I discovered that he was with other girl, and also I did know that they were hooking up (I discovered it because I talked to her, I wanted to ask her what was happening); then he stopped talking to her. But I forgive him.
Then some months elapsed and he started to talk with her again, I discovered he was loving to her, and also he lied to me about meeting her. Also I discovered this and I had the greatest anxiety attach I ever had, I started to lose the touch with the reality... 
Then we break up, he was with other girls and also with the one he cheated on me, also he had bad traits 
Since all of this 5 months have gone by (all of this happened when he was 16 and at the begging of 17) 
We started talking again and I really feel a change on him, I’m afraid because he also told me several times that he changed before, when he cheated on me and he lied to me
He has done things to gain my trust and also his traits has changed, when we star again he lied to me some times, but no big lies idk, now he’s so dedicated to me and also has suffered but I have a big trauma and trust issues 
Some days ago this girl talked to me and she told me he done so many other things that he didn’t told me, a part of me believes this but other is saying to me “wtf this bitch lied to me and when I was suffering she also was behind him lying to me, she didn’t do anything for you”

Because he and i have a past. 2 years ago i stayed at his apartment for 6 months. And we didn’t get along. I suffered some serious psychological issues just because of him.

479,"Hi everyone. This is a post about my dog. The question may seem silly, but I'm really worried.

&amp;#x200B;

He's a five years old mixed breed (husky/german sheperd/golden retriever/god knows what) and a very sweet dog. I live away from my family because of my studies, but given the current Covid-19 situation, I'm confined at home. Despite everything happening right now, it's nice to live with animals again, and I'm happy to spend time with them.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my dog is bored. He's always laying somewhere, and does that thing where a dog licks his paw until he bleeds simply because he's understimulated. It's so bad he limps from time to time so he must be in pain. You can understand my concern. This issue is known to us and we've consulted a vet several time. We tried to bandage his paw in every way imaginable, we even tried to put a special sock on it. But boy, this dog is as smart as he's stubborn and he always manages to get it off and start again. The vet gave him a medical collar (I don't know the exact term in English, it's the white cone that prevents dogs from reaching their wounds) but he wouldn't have it.

&amp;#x200B;

Those last month have been the worst of them all, as my dog's behaviour slowly started to change. He's never been a huge fan of playing, his priority scale consists roughly of : Presence of his family and Safety - Food - Praises - Play. But now he just won't play, unless food is involved but I can't feed him too much treats since it'd be bad for his health.

&amp;#x200B;

* I've tried the rope game : he does a playful growl seeing it moves in front of him when he's laying down and acts as if he's going to delicately put it in his mouth, but that's as far as it goes. He doesn't even get up to try and continue playtime.
* I've tried playing fetch : he's bad at this lmao,  That wouldn't be a problem if he was having fun, I'd gladly run after him if he wanted to play chase. But he just happily goes to the stick the first time you throw it, then retreat somewhere close and lay down. Then the stick doesn't interest him anymore. I swear all this takes place in less than one minute, the second he lays down, he's over with the game.
* He likes bones, not so much to play with, mostly to gnaw on. I've been trying to find a thick one, like beef bones, so he wouldn't hurt himself with it. No luck so far.
* When he was a puppy, we used to stick our hand under a blancket and scratch. That made him go crazy, he loved it. Nowadays, he'll only vaguely try to 'eat' the monster under the blancket, but he won't get up to really get into it anymore. Again, he stops the game after a few seconds. That's the one that breaks my heart the most, honestly. He really loved this game, it was so fun to watch him 'dig' like a fox trying to catch a mouse.
* The one thing I actually managed to interest him in is a self-made dog toy that hands out treats when you make it roll. He likes it because there's food and it does keep him occupied, but I don't think he's really having fun. He often likes to bring us his toy asking we make the treats fall out ourselves because he doesn't want to try.
* He won't wrestle with you. I think he gets scared of getting rough, of being hurt or of hurting you. He won't bite clothes or anything.
* I've been thinking about hand-sewing him a searching mattress (the stuff where you hide treats and the dog has to sniff, find and eat them). We'll see how it goes I guess.
* To avoid overfeeding him and still keep him occupied, I tried mixing his treats with a few dog-friendly fruits that would have been beneficial to his overall health. He isn't interested in apples, I'll tell you that. All of our german sheperds used to love eating fruits, but I guess he just didn't get the gene. I hope sweet potatoes can prove me wrong.
* I remember him going crazy over plushes, which suffered great ordeals from his baby tantrums. I'm trying to find one that holds no sentimal importance to us, but my siblings and I are very attached to our childhood plushes so he can't have them.
* Petting is okay. Pets are good. He's not exactly cuddly since he likes to have his own space, but people he likes can touch him anyway they wants. He really likes to be pet and will vocally lecture you if you stop. So there's still that, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if he's lazy or if he just loses interest at the light of speed. The vet says there's nothing physically wrong with him, he's in very good health, so he's just hard to please ? I suppose ? He used to get very destructive when he was bored, which he grew out of : but frankly, I regret that. I'd be happier to know that he's entertaining himself by ruining my shoe rather than licking himself to the bone because he's bored.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the matter of walks. He loves walks. He'll get crazy when you get the leash out and start howling and jumping and being genuily exited. You know, like happy dogs get. Furthermore, it's a good way to make him exercize and stimulate him.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately, every walk I try to do is cut short because he wants to go home. He'll get spooked by something, activate his 'alert mode' (he's a very expressive dog, you know when he's expextant or unsure) and get overwhelmed. Just today, he saw people walking by us, stopped to watch them go, started to look around with his ears up and his tail low, then showed me he was not willing to keep going. I think hearing distant cars and city noises, to which he's normally used, achieved to spook him.

&amp;#x200B;

He has always been a nervous dog, but it worsened lately, even when he was doing so good before. To put that into context, the vet said he had been separated from the mother way too soon (we thought him to be at least two month old, the vet told us otherwise) and he also showed signs of having been beaten in the past. You know, this heartbreaking moment where the dog crouches, whimpers and closes his eyes everythime your hand hovers above his head. He doesn't do that anymore, but he doesn't like strangers and he's very scared of most unknown men and blond girls. Miraculously, aggression is not his got-to reaction. We never even heard him growl, he'll just puff and howl to warn us that people are entering our house, then retreat in my parent's bedroom where no one pesters him. Strangers can try to touch him and he'll just escape their grasp if he's uncomfortable, not even showing teath or anything. He's not dominant, neither prompt to confrontation. It's like he has no fight reflexe, only flee.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been known to have some sorts of shutdowns whenever fear was too strong, like the one time he saw a tall man entering his home with a big, flashy moto helmet on that must have looked like some sort of terrifying monster he had never seen before. When those come, he just lays down and don't move or reacting to anything at all. Scary stuff. Then his brain seems to start again and he forgets all of his fears, like everything was re-written in there and now he's okay, now he's happy, now nothing bothers him and even people are not scary anymore. I had never seen a dog do something like that, it's like a PTSD reaction followed by memory loss. Bathes used to get that reaction from him too. It's been years since his last shutdown, but since we can't have people at home for obvious reason, I can't say for sure he's completely healed. This shit was just so fucking weird.

&amp;#x200B;

480,"I know compared to other people seeking advice this is really benign and probably pretty boring, but it’s something I could use some insight on.

I (20) currently live with my parents and all my life have shared a bedroom with my brother, ever since I can remember I’ve never enjoyed sleeping in the same room as him, most noticeable because we can’t study next to each other. 
Recently it’s become more of a problem because of our studies demanding more hours from us and not being able to study comfortably is really showing on me apart from stressing me out.

Our house has two floors, all the bedrooms are upstairs and downstairs is everything else. I’ve tried to take my laptop and books downstairs and study in the kitchen but my family always complains we have to move my stuff each time we eat or we end up eating somewhere else because my stuff is always there, I can’t move it constantly because I’m basically studying all day constantly and it’s caused my family to always end up fighting.

Recently I recommended we empty, clean and paint a room we used for storage so I can put my desk there and study alone, everyone agreed to do it so we’re doing that, but I actually want to put my bed and stuff in there to keep as my own room so I can have my own space in the house (which I’ve never had before).

I’ve kind of nodded towards me moving downstairs to other family members and they told me it would be horrible if everyone slept upstairs and I stayed downstairs really far away from everyone else (kind of like Harry Potter underneath the stairs.

There’s enough room in that place for me to place my bed, my desk and a cupboard to put my books and the paint and cleaning is actually making the room pretty nice, so I want to convince them to let me move there, but I’m not sure how.

Would it be okay for me to sleep so far apart fro the rest of my family if it meant I can keep my own for once in my life?",29Mar2020,1

482,"Not sure if I should move home or stay in NJ. 

I'm (23) currently living and working in NJ. My contract ends at the beginning of April and I was planning to return home to MI at that time. Due to the coronavirus, I have been given the opportunity to extend my contract, this would be either for 2.5 or 5 months. Currently NJ is #2 for the coronavirus and MI is #4 (but also with limitations in testing, who knows). Both states have shelter-in-place (SIP) orders. A travel advisory has also been issued for NJ. I go back and forth between wanting to stay and wanting to leave.

Going home pros:
• Miss the family
• Any job pays more $
• My parents preference

Going home cons:
• My mom and I clash after awhile
• Mom is at some risk to the virus
• New job will likely not be meaningful work (given who is currently hiring)
• New job will likely be higher risk for virus (again given who is currently hiring)
• Department at current job will be understaffed

Pros to staying in NJ
• Meaningful work
• Not leaving department understaffed
• Living with friends 
• Not bending current travel advisories or SIP

Cons to staying in NJ
• Unable to go home until 2.5 or 5 months after originally planned (was looking forward to going home)
• Will be getting another roommate which will cause space issues (my friend/coworker was going to move in as I moved out and she will still be moving in regardless of my decision)
• Will be unable to get mental breaks from roommates/friends as we also work together and there is a SIP. Nervous this will strain good friendships. Do not want to end my time in NJ not liking the friends I have made. 
• Not making much $ 

I am currently working remotely. I am able to work remotely I think as long as their is an SIP in NJ. If I go to MI and work remotely, I will be unable to move back to NJ when the SIP is lifted. My boss is looking a little further into this but right now it does not look like I can work remotely from MI when the NJ SIP is lifted. So I can extend my contract and stay or keep my current end date and leave. Thoughts and advice are appreciated!",29Mar2020,1

She always just starts ignoring me instead of trying to reason, which is frustrating, but I drop the subjects.

Anyway, I am trying to do something to better myself mentally and financially. Up to this point, my jobs have been mindless, physical labor. My current job pays well, but the industry is dead and, quite honestly, I’m goddamn miserable. So, school is seeming like my only option to do something that is meaningful not only to me, but to other people as well. I am about three years (maybe three and a half to four years with me working full time) out from a bachelors in Computer Information Systems. I have an associate degree from another state, and of course not all of the courses transfer, so I have to take several unrelated courses (about a semester and a half if can get into these classes over the summer) which is aggravating but, education is education i guess. So, I was thinking about working on a certification in the IT field ( COMPTIA A+ is the most common one I see and hear about) while taking college courses toward my desired degree. I know it’s a lot. I’ll be working full time, classes every day, then on top of that my certification. But hell, I have to do something. Anyway, i was curious if it is possible, probable even, that I could land an entry level job with a certification but no experience, per se. If the a+ cert isn’t worth it, are there any certifications that are worth it? And how the hell do I convince an employer to hire me with no experience in the field I am applying to?

498,"I (30f) and my boyfriend (25m) are moving in together at a new place next week. This has been planned before the pandemic reached the states and we don’t have an option to back out even if we wanted since both of our leases are up and we’d already put money at the new place.

I have professional movers hired for my place. 

My boyfriend has friends that are helping him. He isn’t using my movers because we live on opposite ends of town and he didn’t want to spend money on movers to go to him.

My question is how do I limit the chances of anyone possibly spreading the virus during this process? I get having them over for beers/pizza since they are helping but should I mention I don’t want them to end up staying all night or would that be dumb since we’d already be at risk from the initial time spent together? Is there any cleaning stuff or anything else I can do to keep us safe? Some of his friends are super immature and aren’t taking the social distancing thing seriously at all which also makes me nervous.

For those who think I’m overreacting to the virus, I’m not. One, we should all be cautious now. Two, I already have lung problems and have to be on oxygen at night because my levels drop too low. My mother also has an autoimmune disease and I’m the only kid who can take her groceries and stuff right now. It is really important that I be extra cautious.

To begin this post, when my parents had me they were at a much older age then average. 

Let’s just say my dad was in his 30s and my mom was in her mid 40s. To make my childhood even more “stressful” they are very closed minded individuals. 

My mom in particular is the main root of this post. what she says is always “correct” even when facts prove her wrong. She the type of person to ask for the manger everywhere we go. 

I was never particularly close with neither one of my parents for several reasons, but mainly because of their attitudes.

Now getting to the real topic of this post. Recently my mom has started spraying an ungodly amount of bleach everywhere. By an ungodly amount I mean, she’ll spray 30-40 times in one of the small bathrooms. No where is safe from her and that damn bleach bottle. She’ll even spray it in the cats litter pan.

She started doing this late at night when the majority of us are all in bed. Now she’s progressed to doing it in the morning, whenever she comes home, and on top of that she is still doing it at night.

It’s not because of the coronavirus because she started this back in Oct. We’ve all begged her to stop because our house is not well ventilated. My room especially has no working vents and a tiny ass window. 

I’ve had to shower and shave several times in a bathroom full of bleach. It’s not a fun experience what so ever. First your sense of smell starts to leave you and then your eyes begin to burn. Lastly you skin become aggravated.


At the age of 17, I graduated from school early. I planned to take a year off from work and to relax before attending college. I’ve been working since I was 14 because my parent rarely bought anything for their kids nor gave us allowances.

But nope.
My mom was not having that she would harass me about it. She would threaten to kick me out if I didn’t either get another job or go to school immediately. Getting threatened to be kicked out was nothing new. I’ve been getting that threat since I was a kid. 

Now that I’ve recently turned 18, I’m now in college. I some what enjoy it but i don’t think it’s for me in the long-run. So I plan on moving out within the next 5 months.

-Here where everything ties in-

As a result of breathing in all of that bleach, I can’t really breath out of my nose. I’m having trouble breathing in general. My eyes are also on fire and dry. Lastly I get these bad headaches because of the smell.

When I can’t breath out of my nose I can’t sleep. When I can sleep, I have trouble concentrating during school. When I can concentrate during school, I have to go back home and put in extra work. The process then repeat itself and gets worse over time.

When I ask her why she does it she’ll say to eliminate odor. I explain to her yesterday, with the bottle in hand that we’re not even supposed to be inhaling that stuff in the way we are. Then I read the warning on the bottle to her and she looked me in the eye and said, “that’s a bunch of bull”. 

At this point I can‘t breath out of my own damn nose or smell anything. What am I suppose to do  20 years down the road when I actually develop something due to this amount of exposure to bleach???

So is there anything I can do such as sue?",29Mar2020,1

511,"Alright, first things first, ive tried conventional methods and they dont work. my problem has less to do with the actual problem and more to do with the finding solutions to the problem. im going to list some conventional methods and my reasons why they dont work for me. before i do i should note that i am not trying to cut out the scary parts, im trying to train myself to handle the scary parts.

1. Turning off sound: doesn't end too well in games with sound cues...
2. Turning up brightness: i play alot of indie games with little to no settings menus, plus high brightness has never helped me too much anyway.
3. Letting the jumpscare happen so you can know what to expect: its not about the jumpscare, its about the tension and anticipation of a jumpscare.
4. Playing with a friend: whats a friend? but seriously i dont have any friends that are actually willing to do it, they are all too scared and they dont care much for horror games anyway.
5. Man up and deal with it: easy to say when you're not having panic attacks playing five nights at freddys...
6. Don't play horror games: thats too wide of a selection of games for me to miss out on, plus its not a solution its just avoiding the problem.
7. Have fun with the poor AI: you have to be good at the game to do that. and to i have to play it enough to get good. and by that point i wouldn't be scared of the game anyway.
8. (Anything along the lines of ""its not real its just a game""): im not 4, i know its not real. im not so much scared im more startled, and i cant handle the tension. i actually like horror stories that dont let me go to sleep, i watched game theory's video on Try to Fall Asleep and i didn't get any sleep that night. it was the best. but i still cant play the game myself, because i cant handle getting startled.
9. Watch someone else play untill you're ready to play: done it, didn't work. watching someone else play is a completely different experience, you have no control and therfor no responsibility. when im playing if something is chasing me i have to keep my shit together and run away, its the stress that causes my heartrate to skyrocket.

So, with all those things off the table, how can i train myself to handle horror games? incase you haven't guessed by reading everything above, no, i dont have a problem with other horror material. i watch horror movies and im fine. however this doesn't extend to watching someone else play a horror game, i handle watching someone else alot better than i do playing myself, but its still pretty bad. i think its because in horror movies its usually pretty easy to tell when a jumpscare is coming... whereas horror games it can happen any time.

Just a quick note before i post this: i played and completed dyling light just fine, the volatiles (the scary ones for those of you that haven't played it) aren't that bad. im not sure why they don't scare me...",29Mar2020,1

514,"My friends apartment caught fire last night around 8 or 9. She was outside grilling with her boyfriend when they noticed smoke billowing from one of her windows. They went inside to check it out and there were flames in her kitchen up to the ceiling. It’s a studio apartment, so there was a lot of potential for damage. No one was hurt, thankfully. 

Luckily, only the kitchen was damaged, but it caused the apartment to be unlivable. She doesn’t have renters insurance (it’s not required for her lease) and she believes it was a grease fire. The fire department was called and I guess they believed her since there was no evidence of accelerant. They didn’t give her much information. 

She works at a restaurant that has already cut hours due to coronavirus orders from the city. She’s in the process of filing for unemployment insurance. 

We have some mutual friends that she can stay with but I think she’s concerned about:
1. What she may be liable for - the landlord has insurance but does it cover something that could be considered human error, like a grease fire, especially if it’s a tenant and not the landlord himself?
2. Finding a new apartment during a pandemic 
3. Finding any sort of financial assistance that will help her recover from this. 

Obviously it would be nice to have her post this so there would be more information, but I’m trying to help her out so she can focus on cleaning her apartment, taking care of her (very stressed) kitten, and find a temporary place to stay. 

Thank you so much for any info you have! If you have questions you’d like me to clarify please let me know! Stay safe and healthy!",29Mar2020,1
515,"Just felt like venting about this on here

So this happened a few weeks ago and I’m really confused and conflicted about it.

so a few weeks ago i was planning on going out with friends but they cancelled last minute. THis guy Cody i met one time at a party reached out and asked if i wanted to go to the beach. I agreed beacause i drove all the way to that area and had nothing else to do. I met him at his car and We talked and caught up cause it had been a year. In his car we started drinking and he kept bringing up how he wanted to hook up in the past but we never did. he asked if id want to hook up tonight and i said something about how i would if i wasnt going to school in Miami and i said i liked someone else at my college in Miami . i also said that i think bc i didnt want to hurt his feelings. We eventually walked out to the beach and we set up blankets. we got under the blankets bc it was so cold and he started touching me and fingering me and trying to make out with me but i like kept turning my head so he couldn’t kiss me and kept trying to push him away and telling him that i shouldnt do this because i like someone else in Miami. He kept saying that it doesnt matter and that he wont tell the person i like. I kept repeating i shouldnt do this and that we should stop. He was like taking off his clothes and mine i didnt really know what to say. In my head i thought id just go along with it until it got too far because I’m bad at saying no to people at times. I was drunk at this point and i told him that some things he was doing felt good but we shouldnt take it further, but he kept wanting to have sex and i told him I didnt want to. he like didn’t seem to listen bc he put a condom on and in my head I was like “what I don’t want to do this right now”. He kept reaching under my skirt and trying to put it in but I kept pushing him away. i kept like twisting and turning and trying to push him off while reasoning with him but he just kept doing what he was doing and was kissing my neck really hard and trying to have sex. He kept using more force which surprised me and I said “ok we’re not having sex right now” and I was saying it in a nice way. But at one point he was holding my arms above my head to get me to stop moving and im not sure if he actually put his penis in because i was trying hard to move, i think he did a very little bit but idk. Bc he didn’t put it in all the way or barely I didn’t think the situation was that bad afterwards. But at one point the condom fell off bc i kept trying to like move him away. then when he like managed to overpower me more by like gripping and holding down my arms tighter I said “you don’t even have a condom on we can’t do this” just to get him to stop or distract him. I also kept saying “why don’t we just finish drinking” to distract him. after a while of wrestling and pushing and talking him out of it, I told him I really had to go to the bathroom just to maybe think it would get him off. I was shook because he got so aggressive by like gripping my arms tighter or just trying to get me to stop moving. Once we both stood up and I thought that we were getting up to leave I sanded off one blanket, and I saw that my phone was buried in the sand and he was like “dang”cause there was so much sand in my phone. he handed me the other blanket and wrapped the blanket around my shoulders and then out of nowhere he tackled me and like threw me into the sand and he was on top of me and i was on my stomach and he was trying to have sex again and was trying to put his penis in again, and it seemed so easy because I was wearing a skirt. i started saying it louder for him to get off I was like “ Cody get the f off of me, wtf stop”. I kept trying to squeeze my legs tighter and i managed to turn around and he was still on top of me but I was facing him and i was like “we’re not doing this you’re a cute good guy but I’m not doing this” I said that to not make him mad and I did used to like him a year ago. somehow I negotiated with him and to get him to get off. I think I kept saying I had to drive early the next day to go back to school Mx but when he was still on top he was saying things like if i dont have sex with him i have to give him a blowjob or that hed give me 100 dollars to have sex. And I said “I don’t want your money this is insane” I also said “stop you just want to sex with someone” and he said “ no I want to with you” I told him that’s not happening and I told him you can go get any girl you want this doesn’t have to happen
I asked him when we were walking back to his car “did you know this was going to happen” and he said no then I asked “then why did you think I wanted to do that or that was ok” and he just said idk
idk i feel like i said things so i wouldnt make him mad or hurt his feelings so idk if that led him on. i also brought up how i hooked up with his friend to maybe weird him out or distract him and get him off or i said it bc i was mad idk why though i feel like im to blame partially idk if what he did was as bad as other people’s situations. But he did say if i hooked up with his friend then why shouldnt i hook up with him. he just seemed really desperate to do all this; he said earlier he hadnt had sex in a long time. When he was like just gripping me tighter I kept saying to him that this isnt ok and asking “what are you doing” “is this for real right now” “we aren’t doing this ok” and he kept saying ""i hear ya"" but would still be doing what he was doing. He would say “ok fine” and stop for a second then I’d loosen up then he’d go back to trying to have sex again. We left the beach finally and he had to drive me back to my car. Idk why but I like apologized to him because I felt bad or felt like I did something wrong cause he was annoyed or disappointed. When we got to the parking lot where my car was I was about to leave and I was like saying bye and I asked if he was ok to drive cause we were drinking and he like reached over and was kissing my neck really hard and he like reached under my skirt and said “just gotta feel what I’m missing” or something. It’s just so cringey to talk about. I looked in the mirror on the way home and there were so many hickeys on my neck; he said he hoped he left some to make the guy I liked jealous. Idk I texted him about it a few days later and he said he was sorry and that that he was drunk but he sent me a explicit pic a few hours later so idk.
I just feel like I don’t deserve to call this sexual assault or I feel weird labeling it that cause I feel I am overreacting. Like I know I had no intention of doing anything with him when I agreed to hang out because I liked someone else, but I feel like I shouldn’t have went.

516,"Before I get into this, I want to acknowledge the fact that almost everyone is going through a tough time during the COVID pandemic and that many people have been placed in very tough and heart breaking positions. My heart goes out to all of you and I wish everyone the best during these uncertain times. 

I’m a 23 year old F from Canada, but I haven’t lived at home since I was 17 (due to going to university, working out west during the summers, and then living abroad after graduation). As I said, for the past few years I have been living abroad, doing a couple of teaching ESL positions in SE Asia and some great volunteering opportunities with awesome organizations in India. I’ve been teaching English online as a side gig the entire time and have been completely financially independent during my time abroad. I was always planning on coming home in April for a couple of weeks to visit family and friends, because last time I saw them was January 2019. I was then going to go and do another summer out west to rebuild my savings a bit (and stay in Canada long enough to reinstate my health insurance), before returning to living abroad. 

However, plans changed and I had to cut my last three weeks of travel short due to COVID. My summer job is now up in the air. I’m back at home with my parents, and there is no real end in sight for this living situation. 

I just feel like all of the freedom I have had over the past couple of years is gone. I went from having my own apartment, eating my own food, driving my own vehicles and having all of the freedom in the world to living under my parents roof, playing by their rules, and not being able to go out and do what I want to do. My parents have made it very clear they don’t approve of my lifestyle (they think I’m fucking around and not doing anything meaningful) so I’m feeling a lot of pressure about that, as well.

I know my complaints are very vain given the severity of the global situation right now. I am incredibly grateful my parents took me back, that I have a roof over my head, and that myself and my loved ones are happy and healthy. I honestly just want some advice on what I can do to cope so that I don’t lose my shit while I’m in this living situation. Thanks! 

TLDR; I went from being completely independent to living under my parents roof with a lot of job uncertainty during this COVID pandemic. Want some advice on how to best cope with these changes.",29Mar2020,1

520,"Half a year ago I (m20) moved to a new town and met this girl and I instantly knew that I liked her. We started doing a lot of things together and had a really great time. She immediately became one of my favourite persons there and is still one of my best friends today. 
It didn't take very long until I had a huge crush on her. Unfortunately I didn't knew at that point that she was gay. I only found out about a month later. When I found out I was kinda sad at first of course. But after some time I realized that there is nothing I could do about it so I'd have to move on. Luckily I hadn't made a move on her already at that time so she had no clue I had a crush on her. So I figured my feelings would just go away after some time now that I knew I had no chance anyways and we could just stay friends. 
It was never an option for me to end the friendship because she is one of the first persons I met in this town and we were friends ever since. She is absolutely one of the coolest people I ever met. 

It all was fine and I didn't feel like I had feelings for her anymore until lately. I hadn't seen her for a few weeks because I was with my parents. When I came back all of my feelings were back the moment I saw her. Now I can't get her out of my head. I even dream of her almost every night. She's just too damn cute. What should I do?

I can tell it affects my older sister’s mood since she didn’t have to grow up with my mom like this. Our family used to be functional when she was growing up, but now that she’s older and out of the house everything just crumpled. My parents always argue like every week, my mom yells constantly every week, there’s always something wrong. And, like I said, I’m used to it.

A couple of weeks ago I hooked up with an old friend. Prior to hooking up I was explicit that condoms were a must as I want to be as safe as possible from STD’s.

When we got together we had sex a few times and he wore a condom every time (we each brought our own). He made several comments that he wasn’t used to them “because my ex was on the pill,” but that it was okay. At one point he tried to push my head down for a blowjob *without* a condom and I refused, saying that he would need to put one on first if he wanted that. 

Anyway, I stayed at his house and I woke up in the middle of the night to him rubbing the head of his penis all up and down my vulva (unprotected). My stupid brain thought “welp, if he has any STD’s then I would have them now anyway” so I foolishly let him enter me without a condom as well (again, I had just woken up).

Now that I'm older and have thought about it, I came to realize I'm really, not into arranged marriages. But I'm curious. Is this appropriate to do with female friends?

535,"My partner and I got together very young (16 and 18) and we have been together for going on 5 years now. We got into a recent argument that really tested us, but we both don’t want to give up on us. We decided the best thing to do was utilize this quarantine time to try and just take care of ourselves and get back to having our own identities outside of the relationship, since we both feel like we kind of just have been only caring about each other. The problem is, I don’t even know where to start!

Of course with the quarantine, school is closed, teachers are assigning online work that i can’t be bothered to do, and i just want the semester to be over. Before i graduate in May, i also need to have my drivers license and a car (i was fearful and lazy with doing it, so i didn’t practice driving for about 2 years). I also have this girl who i am friends with and have been since freshman year, and we both have established we like one another, and we both would love to go and do something, except i am playing video games and doing little schoolwork, along with not really planning on what we could even do.

537,"This may seem relatively trivial I'm sure, but honestly it's hard knowing up from down right now and being on pandemic lockdown may be making it worse, but I'll try to explain the best I can to help you understand.

I am in my early 20's. I recently moved back in with my mother and step father to ease the logistics of moving long distance. I figured I could used this time to relax a bit before finding a job and a place of my own. Well now I'm stuck as the small town im in has rare job openings, and many people in need of work. And now we are really struggling for jobs because of covid-19. 

Background out of the way I often feel confused in social situations, even though I completely understand what has happened, I don't always seem to understand peoples intention. I don't know if im reading into myself too much but here is an example of something I don't understand about my step father. He will regularly ask loaded or unnecessary questions such as ""isn't our dog the best dog you've ever known? Have you ever known a better dog?"" The first time I was asked, I stopped and thought about if for a second. I've had a lot of dogs, you know, but what else am I going to say but our current dog. But he keeps asking the same question!? Ever day, every other day. What is the point? Now when he asks in awkwardly taken aback as I say to myself ""again?"" I feel like I'm in loony town. What am I supposed to do? It's taking everything I have not to be snarky or condescending, and my step father already has issues with defensiveness and being sensitive to other peoples emotions.

 I often spend much of my time doing my own thing (away from my family.) I don't much enjoy watching tv or not being mentally active in some way, while my family enjoys watching tv and shooting the wind. My mother and step father are about 30 years older than me. They both adhere to old values and definitely have hard times differentiating between option and fact, while being intelligent all the same. I feel this wouldn't be as much of an issue for me if I could just play along, but I have a hard time being dishonest.

So what im trying to ask after all of this is what do I have to do to deal so I do rip my hair out or say something stupid? It almost feels like im being antagonized at this point.",29Mar2020,1

He lived in the state of New south wales but I live in the state of Queensland.

With the covid-19 lockdown in full force here there will be 14day quarantine upon entering NSW and another fortnight upon returning to QLD. 

My question is will I be allowed to attend my fathers funeral or will I be forced to stay in a hotel for isolation?   

Also Scomo the PM of Aus restricted funeral attendance to a maximum of ten people I have a big family on my dads side, with his parents and siblings going will I even make the cut?

Because if the funeral is scheduled for some time sooner then around 15 days from now I don't know if it will even be legal for me to attend.

541,"A classic issue. I am deciding between graduate schools during the completion of my undergrad (this May). I’m due to start grad school in September 2020. I live on the east coast, and I’ve lived within 45 minutes of the same city my whole life. 
I have been dating my partner for 3 years now. I love my partner an incredible amount and could 100% see us living the rest of our life together.  It’s a great relationship. 
I now have two options for grad school. One is where I go to a school on the east coast that is ~1 hour away from the city I grew up in and be right near my partner and my family. Option two is to go to graduate school in California, as far away I could  get from my family and partner within the states.  
I know for certain I would love life out in California. I love the outdoors and the way of life over on the west coast. I love the warm weather  and id love to move and learn how to be entirely on my own. Graduate school would provide me the perfect opportunity to move away for 5-6 years (length of a PhD) and come back home afterwards. 
In terms of the programs, both the program on the east coast and west coast are competitive programs that would be good for my career. Neither is so much better than the other that I can solely decide based on the program. They’re comparable. 
Moving away would jeopardize my relationship with my partner. My partner said he’d consider moving out there after 2-3 years to finish my degree, but I know he doesnt want to and would never do such a thing if not for me. I love my partner so much. Should I just stay because the program on the east coast is just as good and this way I can guarantee the safety of my relationship, or put my relationship to the test by moving away and following my desire to go to California?",29Mar2020,1

But lately, she’s been treating me differently. I graduated college last April and lived away from home for 4 years in my own apartments and dorm out of town about 2 and a half hours away from home. Once I graduated I got a job and had to move back in with my parents while I was in limbo of getting accepted in grad school (which I got rejected for so now I’m trying to figure out my life). Lately, my mom has got into the habit of not liking who I hangout with, or the guy I’m talking too right now; which I get is because she’s worried about me. But the way that she goes about it makes me feel so crappy. When I make a decision she doesn’t like she just shuts down and goes and hides in her room and won’t talk to me for a day or a couple of days and she’s super short with me.

I think it’s important to say too that we never broke up on bad terms, it just wasn’t something that was working at the time, we weren’t dating either (just called an ex for simplicity) but it was a romantic relationship. This ended over a year ago, and I have been chill about it until recently. I find that I would like to date her, I like her a lot and I really do believe she is the perfect person to grow with. 

However, I used to have a friend who would have the same things happen to him about his ex, he would dream about her nonstop. But he was borderline psychotic about it. I am just worried that maybe me dreaming about this girl all the time is telling me that I’m some sort of obsessed creep. But I never intend to have these dreams, she isn’t even on my mind as I fall asleep but somehow she creeps her way in every night.

549,"Hi. I’m 19 years old. Female.

I just got into college last year. New world. No family nearby. I was free to do whatever I wanted, go to wherever I pleased. So I attended parties—university parties, as much as I could. And since I only had one good friend in the university (who is not in the same degree as me), let’s call her A, she was the only person I could go to parties with. A would go to parties with her friends and that’s when I met B. B and I were introduced to each other by A so we became friends. Not close friends. But we’d say hi to each other when we saw each other on campus. I’ve always admired B because she was pretty, smart and talented (she’s part of the university dance team). But I still feel awkward around B because the only times B and I would hang out is when A (and her friends) is there. And we never really got to hang out together alone. Which was not an issue then.

FF, one day, first period, we were going to have a test and I forgot my calculator at home. I could’ve gone home because my place was near. But I didn’t. I went to A and B’s classroom to borrow a calculator from A. But A wasn’t there yet and the only person (from A’s group of friends) I could find was B. That time, I really just wanted to go home. I was shy and I could feel my stomach churn while I was staring at her from the door. But before I could move, she saw me and she waved and smiled. And my heart melted KFAJBSISBSJS Anyway, she lend me her calculator, said she didn’t need it yet and all I could think about during the test was how my heart my racing when we were talking and how I couldn’t stop smiling when she smiled at me. DOCBSOSBSI

FF, after that moment I was very cautious of my actions around her and I was more aware of myself when I’m with her. It’s weird how after that, her impact on me was heightened. A little wave and “hello” would make me smile from ear to ear. Laughing at my posts, commenting on my posts, replying to my tweets, telling me she “stans” me, she even reacts to my ig stories. I know those are just little interactions that mean nothing but I’m so aware of everything she does it makes even little things matter...

FF, last January, A told me someone made a move on B. A girl (C) they met at the coffee shop while they were studying. And idk why but I was kind of sad. I wasn’t heartbroken but I wasn’t happy either (?) And then I was comparing myself to C. C was accomplished. She had a job, a car. She would take B to dates out of the city and would take her home. She would send flowers. I couldn’t. I’m a freshman and I still have a long way to go. But I didn’t know why I was comparing myself to C. I still don’t know :&lt; Maybe I just wanted to be accomplished as well? Maybe I wanted to be taken out on dates too? Or maybe I wanted it to be me who would take B out on dates and send her flowers? Idk :&lt;

FF to now, I think B and C did not work out (idk for sure but yey) Anyway, I posted a tweet saying I would do a dance challenge if my tweet would get a certain number of likes. And B was very supportive LOL Anyway, the tweet still didn’t reach the required number of likes so I kind of forgot about it. Until now. B tagged me in a video of someone doing the challenge and told me she’s still waiting for my video. I felt a lot things because it has been so long since our last online interaction and I haven’t seen her since classes were suspended. I was happy and I wanted to reply but there was no reply button. Maybe the OP disabled the comments. So I was wondering whether or not to chat her privately. But why would I do that? Just to reply to that comment?

I’ve been pondering on this for the last 10 hours. And now that it’s almost 12, a lot of things have come into my mind. Things that I’ve been asking myself for a couple of months now since that calculator moment. And idk if i’m just lonely or just sad, or if she’s just different or it’s the quarantine talking. I like boys. I’ve always liked boys. And idk. I never imagined myself with a girl. But she makes me feel things that (some) boys make me feel, too. I’ve had a lot of girl crushes but this isn’t the same. And I’m scared of a lot things. I’m scared that maybe this isn’t really me, that I’m not really into girls and this is just phase. I’m scared of what my parents and my friends would think if I really am.

553,"I'm a boy, but I love girly things: Makeup, shopping, pink, unicorns, glitter, cooking, etc. I really like the idea of wearing leggings, skirts, thigh high stockings, Vans, overalls, high heels, makeup, jewelry, dresses, skinny jeans, etc. But I live in a really Conservative area, so Conservative that some people even harass me for being Jewish, so I can't express who I really am.

Right now I'm 13 and have little freedom. I have an abusive mother, though a really good father, and all my friends and family are unaware of my true desires. As a result, I've fine tuned my career plans to end up with me in a more Liberal area where I can fully express myself.

But despite my intense desire to be feminine and girly, I feel like these desires and interest make me weak, gross, and inadequate. Having these desires makes me uncomfortable, it makes me feel like a horrible, corrupt person. Whenever I look over at a girl in my class whose wearing an outfit I like, I think ""I want to wear that,"" and feel immediate guilt for such thoughts. And before you ask, these desires are not sexual.

Look, I know it doesn't make me a bad person, to like girly things and want to dress like a girl, but it makes me feel like one. I feel like I'm just a gross, lamentable freak. And yet it's a part of who I am, as much as I cover it up, on the inside I see the world through soft, feminine, girly eyes, so I can't deny these desires: I'd be even more miserable.

557,"I have been chatting with my youngest sister (28f) for the past 24 hours about this issue and we sort of have a game plan in place but I thought that the more insight I can gain into this the better, so here I am.

For context, my youngest sister lives in Portland, OR, while myself and the rest of my family (including another sister (31f)) live in New England.  I struggled with an opiate addiction for most of my 20s (I have been clean for a year and a half now after a brief relapse 2 summers ago)  that put a serious wedge between me and my family, in particular my middle sister.  My mom and I had a falling out during the peak of my addiction which resulted in me getting kicked out of her house (I was living with her for awhile).  I have truly gotten my life together and repaired a lot of the relationships in my life including the one with my mother.  My middle sister and I do not really get along still, there is a lot to unpack there and it's not entirely relevant to this so that will be an issue for another time.  I feel my history is important here because while it is a cautionary tale and I think my mother would gain a lot by listening to me, I also feel like she won't take me as seriously because of it.

Anyhow, my parents split when I was 16.  It was very messy and my mom did not handle it well.  She was able to pull herself out of her misery a bit by buying a nice condo for herself, she got a gastric bypass and lost a lot of weight (she was very overweight for most of my childhood), she made a network of friends, and really seemed to be doing well.  However, the gastric bypass made it so she would get severely intoxicated after only a few drinks, even drinking wine spritzers.  Despite being warned by her doctor to abstain from heavy drinking, I could tell she used alcohol as a way to ease her social anxiety and every time she went out she was getting drunk, which was several times a week.  It came to a head a few years ago after she got a DUI and then later totalled her car right outside her condo.  She never faced legal consequences for the accident but I think the two events opened her eyes, at least for a little while.

Recently, I would say 60% of our encounters, whether they be in person or on the phone, my mother is inebriated.  And my mother isn't a ""fun"" drunk - she's normally a combative person (she's a lawyer, and she's good at it) but when she's drunk, you can barely get in a word and she takes EVERYTHING personally.  I have to be very careful about what I say around her so it doesn't turn into an argument.  She gets very slurry with the way she talks and a number of times she has passed out mid conversation, sitting straight up.  My stepdaughter has been there a number of times and while they have a great relationship I can tell how uncomfortable it makes her when my mom is intoxicated.  The thing is, my mom is awesome when she's sober.  Shes intelligent, funny and interesting.  Drunk, on the other hand... She's someone we have to handle, which i know is common with alcoholics.

Her drinking has caused her to lose a number of friendships recently, and in her drunken stupor she has turned to Facebook to publicly announce her mistakes and drama.  I love my mother dearly and I'm embarrassed for her - I'm at such a loss right now as what to do.

I know her drinking is fueled by her loneliness - she's never fully gotten over my father, she lives alone and she's losing friends like baby teeth right now.  I live an hour away and I try to visit/check in with her when I can, but I'll freely admit that I should be doing more, I just get caught up with work and family life.  My youngest sister obviously lives on the other side of the country and can't do much, but my other sister only lives 20 min away and just doesn't seem to care.  So she's really only got me right now, and I know it's time to do something about it.

The coronavirus has really made it obvious this is a huge problem.  The worst part right now is that my stepdaughter's genius mother was exposed to the virus because she very irresponsibly kept seeing clients.  We were going to stay with my mother this week but found out we could have potentially been exposed because one of her clients was diagnosed this past week.  None of us are sick yet but we have to remain quarantined until after next weekend to be safe.  I have stayed in touch with my mom over the phone and video chat, but 90% of the time she's very drunk.  She's all alone, and feeding her loneliness with alcohol.  We have plans to see her after we are cleared, but I am very worried about her.

My sister and I have both tried to talk to her about the drinking before, and it seems to have an impact for a little while, then it's back to the same old shit.  I plan on sitting her down when I'm with her in person, when she's sober, and hopefully getting my youngest sister on video chat as well.  We plan on telling her how concerned we are for her safety (she often drives intoxicated)  but also gently telling her how her drinking is impacting our lives.  I think bringing up how uncomfortable it is for my stepdaughter to be around her when she's drunk will really have an impact, but I don't know.  We have done similar things in the past and it hasn't worked.

I know that the bigger issue with her is her loneliness, so I am trying like hell to show her how much I love her and care about her right now.  I have also reached out to a few of her friends to ask them to check in on her.  My youngest sister is planning on talking to the middle sister to try and pitch in as well.  It's going to be at least a week until I can sit down with her though, and I'm really starting to get concerned.  I feel very helpless right now and I don't know what else to do.

560,"Now, let me put background to this. I started dating my girlfriend in late December of 2019 and it was me who confessed. I liked her for a year and it was wonderful to get it off my chest, even better that she felt the same way. I cared for her and reminded her she was important as much as I could. I got her quite a lot for valentines day and she seemed really happy.

Now as you know, schools have shut down so I can't talk to her in person. I was absent the last day by choice so I could make my self a healthy work environment, but I decided to go and say goodbye to my friends and give my best friend my discord username. My girlfriend told me that someone had a crush on her, which is fine. I gave her a goodbye hug and then left.

Me and my best friend we exchanging memes until it all went down hill (kinda). Here is how it went:
Her: Promise you won't tell ____ I told you this.
Me: I promise.
H: she's cheating.
M: Is this a joke?
H: No.
M: Who with?
H: CT.
M: Idk how to reply to that.
H: That's what she meant by someone had a crush on her.

My girlfriend was so nice but my best friend wouldn't try to break us up. Though, my girlfriend was suspicious but my best friend didn't have any proof.

Can I please get some advice?",29Mar2020,1
561,"There has been an issue between me and a certain person. I don’t wanna go into much details because they don’t matter I think. The thing is, I got hurt and the person that hurt me didn’t do it on purpose. It was my curiosity that got me hurt, I asked too much questions. It’s been some time and it’s all sorted out, but when I think about this, I still feel the same pain and anger I felt back then. I thought I moved on from it, but I don’t know anymore.

562,"My mom has always been really discourteous and generally seems to try to make my life more difficult no matter what. Every single morning for the past week, she has started walking through my room talking on the telephone while I'm sleeping because she sees sleeping as being lazy. She tries to find some excuse to wake me up every day from walking through my room loudly for ""exercise,"" to asking me to telling me to do a bunch of chores around the house that can wait until after I wake up. I almost never remember what she even told me to do because she told me when I was sleeping so she also gets mad about that. I've asked her to stop probably fifty times but she refuses, accusing me of being self-centered or weak. I've told her that she's caused trauma for me (from when I was a kid) and that I tighten up whenever I hear her moving around the house because my initial instinct is that she's coming to yell at me or just to be incredibly loud and annoying for hours. 

She's also been interrupting my zoom sessions with my college classes (full courseload) to tell me to do things and I genuinely believe that she thinks I do nothing all day long and am available to cater to her manufactured needs. I don't want to pushback so much because I'm stuck with her for the duration of the quarantine and perhaps the summer. I also love my dad and don't want to leave him. I've tried to get him to do something about her abuse, but he's focused on keeping the family together and distilling conflict, which means I usually need to be the bigger person because my mom doesn't even realise she's being abusive.

I just don't know what to do. For the first couple weeks of quarantine she was pestering me to look for summer internships that don't exist and now I think she has incredible anxiety that I'm not able to ""be productive"" and ""socialise"" so she treats me like a freak. I'm also gay and not out to her and probably won't be because I'm pretty sure she knows and I want her to do some introspection as to why I won't tell her but so far she just doesn't make an effort. It's very hard for me to hold a conversation with her because she's not really capable of seeing my perspective and just gets confused -- she doesn't want to seem dumb so she just changes the subject. I genuinely hate her and need to stay at her house during the quarantine but I have no idea how to get her to stop.",29Mar2020,1

When we matched he messaged me and was eager to meet. When I confronted him about it he claimed that probably one of his friends hacked his phone and while dating he used the app only once to upload new photos of him but never talked to anyone. 

Today he sent me screenshots of a conversation with a friend of his in which the friend admitted he was the one that hacked his acc and he was having fun.

566,"In high school I (20F) didn't put in much effort or get very good grades. I didn't see myself going to college, it was never something I thought about. I never researched colleges or applied when I was a senior and I ended up taking 2 gap years. The one thing I was always interested in was photography. I took photos all the time, worked with models, and made money off of it. Photography seemed like the only thing I wanted to/ could do with my future. I worked for my first year after high school and the next year I went through a bad breakup basically decided to move in with my friend in NYC on a whim.  I applied to one school in the city as a photo major and ended up getting accepted off the waitlist, basically on portfolio alone since I did poorly in HS. I've almost finished my first year of my associate's degree and I've gotten good grades. The thing is I feel that I've lost my passion for photography. I was so into it when I was in high school and I just never thought about doing anything else. But the past year and a half I've cared less about it, and even being in school hasn't made me more into it. I haven't made any work I really like in a long time. I also find myself really disliking living in New York. It makes me anxious, I hate the drinking/going out culture, it's expensive, the winters are depressing, etc. I have some good friends but the city itself definitely isn't for me long term. 

I've been thinking about going to school for something else, I'm interested in psychology and human development. I never thought I'd be able to go to school for something ""academic"" but I've been succeeding in my few non photo classes. I've realized that I'm capable of doing well in school. My school is pretty exclusively an art school, so I would have to go somewhere else if I wanted to major in something else. My parents recently moved to Austin (I'm staying with them right now because of COVID) and I actually get free tuition in Texas (!) because my dad is a veteran, so moving here would make sense for a lot of reasons.  It's too late for me to go to school here next fall, though, so I would have to take another year off of school before I went to a new school, which isn't ideal.

This is kind of all over the place but so am I at the moment. Basically, I wish I had done better in high school and thought about my future before now. I hate thinking about the fact that if I had gone to college right after high school like everyone else I know, I would be graduating next year. I'm having trouble making a decision about my future, it's a big one and I have to decide if I want to withdrawal from my current school soon. Would it benefit me at all to finish the associate's degree if I'm not really interested in photography anymore? Am I giving up too easily? Should I be trying harder to get back into it since I'm already in school? Should I finish my associate's and then think about transferring/pursuing another degree? I'm not receiving super helpful advice so any opinions would be helpful. Thank you!",29Mar2020,1

568,"Feel free to skip these paragraphs because they are basically backstory.

I plan to move out next year in May. I have a part time job that pays $12 an hour (corona virus did shut it down for a bit though). I am willing to save up as much as I need. I want to attempt to have a few months of rent and a small emergency fund saved up.

I want to move out because in October we moved from Florida to Maine due to money issues and to be with family. My life has been horrible here and I now only have bad things associated with this city. I went through a slightly traumatic event in December and I'd rather not live near where it happened. I also have depression that gets significantly worse in the winter I have now found out.

My boyfriend and all of my friends live in Florida, along with some family and my mom's best friend. I would have a support system in case something happened. My boyfriend's mom would let me stay with them if I really needed and same with some of my friends.

Also, in the city I'd plan to live in, the college's tuition is very affordable. If I do end up moving at the end of 11th grade, 12th grade I could take college courses for free compared to here where I pay over $200 for each course. Where I am now, rent for an apartment is easily over $1000 while the city in Florida ranges from $600 and up. 

My GPA is a 4.03 at the moment and I am going to start taking AP courses next year. I am currently enrolled in a college course and will be taking more this summer and next school year. I am doing good academically and when I get my job back I plan to save up everything I can. If I really needed, I could.graduate at the end of 11th grade because I'd have all my graduation requirements. I know I am capable of taking care of myself. I can cook and clean and I actually enjoy doing it. I know not to waste my money on things I don't need. I'll be taking a personal finance course soon so I can learn how to do taxes, pay rent, budget, and everything else I need.

How much should I save? Is there anything I should know?",29Mar2020,1

574,"Last night I was scrolling through my old photos and videos. I've only had my accounts since 2018 so I expected nothing different than the normal photos of my friends, family, and boyfriend. But when I reached the end I found a video dated June 23, 2017, with a thumbnail/cover photo of a cat. I was confused for a second because I never remembered saving this video, and it hadn't cropped up until that moment. Not to mention I hadnt had my phone or gallery that long. Out of curiosity, one of the dumbest decisions I could have made, I clicked. After all, it was a cat video right? However, when I opened the video and the cat subsided I realized the true nature of the video, a male without his  face in view, revealing himself to the camera, and proceeding to use a knife in despicable ways on himself. As an ex self harmer, and dare I say, a pretty easy to be triggered person, I fell into a panic attack and was in shock. Who would put this video that I obviously didn't download into my camera roll? Why this specific thing? Am I safe to be alone? All these thoughts ran through my head and still are.

For the last few weeks, I almost never leave the house. I only go to the office to do work that can only be done in the office. I am an essential worker as I prepare tax returns and payroll.

My office is only five people and we keep reasonably far away and my boss keeps have the place cleaned since she's afraid of the virus.

Today, I just wanted to pick up some fast food. The plan was to just go to a drivethru and come back. My parents yelled at me. They made me put on a mask and gloves, demanded they take the food out of the packages, and basically were very strict about everything. 

Is this a reasonable level of caution? I felt my general social distancing and staying mostly isolated was enough. I feel maybe they're taking it a step too far but I'm not sure.",29Mar2020,1

I'm not trying to police anyone - it's their business whether they recycle or not - but the issue is that by contaminating our recycling bin with non-recyclables, they are reducing the chances that my (carefully sorted) recyclables actually get recycled. I put a lot of effort into recycling properly, so this is becoming a big source of stress for me. A few months ago, I worked up the courage to go knock on their door and bring it up. I talked with one of the three people and explained very politely that having lots of non-recyclables in the recycling bin can lead to the whole lot being thrown in the trash, etc. She seemed receptive and said she'd pass along the message to the other two people.

Parcel force came to deliver the package, sees the reception is closed and leaves.

Well a few days ago I messaged her asking about him and she ended up giving me his cell phone number, I haven’t really talked one on one with him before so I’m not really sure what to say, I texted him to let him know I have his number and who I am but that’s literally it.

595,"Happened a couple of days ago and I'm still bugging out about it.

I've been working from home due to quarantine but my partner still has to work as she's a nurse. She works really long hours and primarily takes care of her younger sister for reasons we will not get into here.

Her sister (Amber) was doing online school work at the table while I was gaming on my lunch break and began to cry.

I immediately went to see what was wrong thinking it was school work related and started to counsel her, online classes are rough and I've even cried before.

She started to tell me how people still found a way to pick on her since she's bigger(shes just tall and more developed) than the other kids and it's hard to focus on the school work because it's the only thing on her mind.

 The kids are indeed little shits and I've since found them all on social media and contacted their parents letting them know we aren't going to continue to tolerate this. That we'd take legal action if needed if they ever sent another message or looked at Amber in an unappealing way. 

She started to talk down to her self and, ""drunk the juice they were pouring"" I tried to stop it but I think I went about it the wrong way.

I told her she's very pretty and beautiful but that more importantly she's also super smart and will be the one with her shit together in the long run. I told her that she's perfect the way she is and to not let anyone change that.

She started to smile and gave me the biggest hug ever and I started to feel like a dad or at least a big brother. When she let go she kissed me full press on the lips and bit my bottom lip.

I freaked out visually and abstained from saying anything because I honestly didn't know what to say and I didn't want to let something slip that would send her back into that spiral.

I finally gathered the words and said this isn't ok. I'm dating her sister and over double her age and that I saw her as a younger sister. I reiterated that she's very bright and that she should get back to her school work.

Since this incident Amber has started complementing me a lot more and it's making me really uncomfortable. She even asked if she could workout with me and I said I like to focus and I'll have to pass this time. I told her that the three of us could do a group exercise when her sister came home and she immediately looked displeased saying she has a few papers to write later. 

These past few days have been awkward being couped up with her since then. I can barely make eye contact and I know my SO knows something is off. I want to tell her but don't want to seem like I encouraged this behavior because it was not even remotely on my mind. I just wanted to help.

I don't want to hurt her feelings because I feel that she is fragile still from being talked down to for so long and I don't know how to approach this with my SO. I want her to know that she is all of the things I mentioned but that I really meant that as a supportive figure looking out for someone. 

tl;dr:
Quarantined 16hrs + per day with girlfriend's sister(Amber) while gf is at work long hours since she's a nurse. Her sister started crying mid homework because kids were picking on her and I tried to counsel her. Amber hugged me and kissed me after this and I freaked out a bit. She's made other none physical advances since and I'm not sure how to help her maintain her confidence while telling her this isn't ok. 
Also, I handled the situation with the kids locating their parents on social media sending screenshots of texts and told them it would get legal if this continued. No advice needed their, just how to handle the situation with Amber and I.",29Mar2020,0

605,"Hi everyone! Firstly I would just like to say that I am wishing you all well during this horrible time, and I am so thankful to be in a position where I can write this post. 

however, I am having a big university crisis. last year, I decided to take a gap year in order to think more about the university course I wanted to take, and just to have some time to work on my mental health (which has recently taken a decline yet again, but that's a whole different matter entirely :( ). now, in march, I am in the latter half of my gap year, and have applied to a university course that I am ashamed to admit I am half-hearted about. I went through a lot of stress changing my uni choice (I had already chosen a uni, because I thought it was what I wanted - spoiler alert: it wasn't), to something I thought I wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of background might be needed here: I have always loved writing stories, and I have always said that I would like to be an author, but when it comes to it, I doubt whether I would have the dedication to create stories. I would like to think I would. there was a brief time where I knew what course I wanted to do: I was set on doing a creative writing degree, and I told my English teacher at the time, and she essentially told me that ""it was too specific"" and ""I need something that will open doors"" - such as English Literature. she told me that it would be best to do a more respected degree. (I want to add - if anyone takes a creative writing degree, please don't be offended, she wasn't trying to be rude, but it just came out a little harsh I think!) I have a very complex relationship with English literature. I love books, I always have done and used to be able to read books at the speed of light, and now I struggle to read a single page. when I read the modules for the English literature degree that I have applied for now (and am regretting my choice), I only found a few of them interesting. my teacher's words really stayed with me, and I feel like a disappointment whenever I don't consider English literature as a degree. the problem is, English has always been my 'thing', and I don't feel confident doing anything else, so if feel like this is my only option (I did try applying for English Literature and creative writing as a course, but didn't quite get in). 

&amp;#x200B;

overall, I feel so guilty that I am worried about this, because I am so lucky to have a place to study English, but it honestly scares me because I just don't feel the passion for it, but the idea of doing another degree terrifies me. unfortunately, there don't seem to be many apprenticeships in English/books/writing, otherwise I would go down that route :(

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sorry this got so long - if you read this far, I owe you a massive thank you!

I just need them out of my life. Or I need exposure therapy. I can’t do that. So I need them gone.

You may think I’m being dramatic, but only a little bit. The above is 90% absolute truth.

Our bathroom is full of damp. Outsiders will surely vomit if they looked up. There is soon to be more mould spots than ceiling. I’d say it’s 50/50 so far. Who knows who will triumph.

For example, he was telling my brother and I that corona virus is airborne. My brother and I \*gently\* dismissed that claim saying that it was not. He took it as a threat for some reason and now he is not willing to speak to either of us. He says that we are the ones who choose to be his enemies. 

I've never had a good relationship with my father. He has never been my friend, he has never supported me, and never acknowledged anything good I've done. He has been a totalitarian, authoritarian figure from day one. He forced me to wear hijab and I'm scared out of my wits to remove it even though I no longer wish to wear it. If I were to remove it, he would call me a whore and never speak to me again. He would probably go as far as to tell his friends/community that I wanted to be loose. 

He called me a whore yesterday for the lamest reason. I had used a teaspoon of an expensive jar of turmeric. I didn't know it was his. My brother jumped to my defense, bless him. All my brother said to him was to not call me such awful names. He told my brother to shut the f\*ck up. 

Furthermore, he barges into my room and says that he will not forgive me for what I've done to him. I'm not even sure what he means when he says ""what I've done to him"". He also said that I will pay for my sins and transgressions against him. 

I've been wanting to move out for a long time. But I've been so scared. I've also been depressed because I can't live life the way I want to. I toy with the thought of leaving the house but I'm scared of the ramifications. If I do leave and remove hijab, it's very possible I will sever the relationship with my father forever. He will never speak to me again even if I try to maintain some semblance of a relationship. 

I want to make one thing clear. I want to have a relationship with my father. I want to be a good daughter as well as someone who lives her life on her terms. \*\*I should have not have to weigh my freedom against having a family.\*\* 

What if I leave and he never speaks to me again? What if my self-esteem suffers as a result of knowing that I no longer have a father? More importantly, what if God doesn't forgive me? 

What I know for certain now is that I need a job. I need a stable source of income so that I'm able to sustain myself. I graduated with a MA in Biology last semester and it will be difficult to find a job but I'm determined.

**Tl;dr: Have fungal infection in armpits and groin. Rubbing apple cider vinegar on the areas to treat it. It burns but the infection seems to be going away. Is this a good idea?**

-	Age: 21

-	Height: 6’ 0”

-	Location: US Midwest

-	Weight: 176 lbs

-	Gender: Cis-Male

-	Medications: None at the moment, but previously Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Prescription), 1% Hydrocortisone (Over the Counter), and 150 mg fluconazole tablets

-	Smoking Status: Non-Smoker

Previous and Current Medical Issues: I’ve had an ongoing fungal infection in my armpits and groin area since July 2019. For a long time I didn’t do anything about it because I didn’t have the resources to do something about it (poor intern / poor student).

In late December I was prescribed 2% ketoconazole, to be applied 2x a day for 14 days. This was at a walk-in clinic in my hometown. Because my family went on vacation on the 10th day, I never finished using the prescription as prescribed since it wasn’t travel sized.

In early January, I was prescribed 4 fluconazole tablets, 150 mg, taken orally once per week, and those did alleviate the symptoms and fought the infection, but when the prescription ran out the fungal infection came back roaring with a vengeance. This was prescribed by the same walk-in clinic, but a different doctor.

In late February, I was prescribed another prescription 2% ketoconazole, to be used once a day, for 2-3weeks. This was prescribed by my university’s clinic in a different city. The prescription ran out on day 12 and I didn’t have the time or resources to get it filled (had no car and was broke) This fungal infection still didn’t go away. I tried using a 1% ketoconazole over-the-counter medication to alleviate the itching but that doesn’t seem to work.

-	Duration: Almost 10 months

-	Location of Complaint: It exists in both of my armpits as well as my groin (my thigh, the skin where my legs attach to my torso, my testicles, and any place covered by pubic hair) 

-	Photos: I only took photos of my armpits because I didn’t want to upload pictures of my groin to the internet.

-	Original photos of skin condition: https://imgur.com/a/k146Eei

-	New photos of skin condition, after topical treatment of Apple Cider Vinegar: https://imgur.com/a/JmbcaI7

The itching used to be unbearable at times, and I was looking for home remedies to alleviate the itching. I didn’t want to go to a pharmacy, not just to avoid COVID-19 but also because I have a dermatologist appointment in late May and don’t want to use anything that would make my fungal infection anti-fungal resistant.

I tried using an ice pack on my most itchy areas, as well as garlic, but they only provided temporary relief for an hour, max. I decided to use a topical application of apple cider vinegar on my fungally infected areas, 3x a day for a week. Currently on day three of using this.

The itching has mostly stopped and it appears the fungus is going away, because I see more of my normal skin, but it burns and is very painful, and the area is now very red and dry skin is flaking off. The skin there is tender to the touch and now very sensitive, and I’m worried I might get permanent chemical burn scars, especially around my groin which would mess up everything down there. 

Should I continue with this treatment or should I stop? Should I go to a walk-in clinic again or wait until my dermatologist appointment in late May?",29Mar2020,1

The store is very large so whenever I’ve been there I’m never really near other people. Is it safe to go to this store? Or should I just continue staying home?",29Mar2020,2
631,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit. The post title also honestly probably made no sense, so let me try to give some context.

I have a friend who I've considered close for about 8 years. I love being her friend, as we have a nice amount of similar likes and interests that we share exclusively within our small friend group.

This friend unfortunately has been suffering from some physical and mental health issues from early on in life, and as a result has a developed what I feel is a victim mentality. She constantly feels like the world and everything is against her, and she often complains about the various situations she's facing, many of which are valid. As a friend, I listen and try to give advice when solicited.

However, there have been cases where an external factor triggers her, and to another friend she starts talking behind my back and starts making assumptions or judgements on my character which are absolutely untrue, which in a more calm mind-state I feel like she would never do. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but one of my personal pet peeves is when especially someone I know makes a wrong conclusion on my core character. It hurts already, and hurts even more when it comes from someone who should already know that I did not or would never do, say, or act in the way that was assumed. This friend has been confronted previously multiple times by myself in others in the group when I caught wind that this happened, clarified the situation, apologies were made, solutions were thought of, yet unfortunately, it continues to happen.

I'm a huge proponent for positivity and actively keeping my close friend group small and surrounding myself with positive thinking people. She, unfortunately, is the only sore thumb in my current social environment that is preventing me from achieving this fully at the moment. I'm honestly frustrated at this situation and I want to make it work, but I'm losing hope in being able to fix it due to our track record. I've talked to other friends in our friend group who feel similarly about my feelings toward her, but I'm honestly stumped on what to do. 

I know these issues only arise because of her mental health. However, it may be because of my lack of experience in dealing with people with mental health issues to this extent that I don't know what the line is between tolerating/excusing these behaviors and putting my foot down and saying enough is enough. I don't want to come off as a non-understanding asshole, as that is also not my intention nor part of my character, but I'm honestly fed up.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated, as I feel like I also need external, non-biased opinions go be able to help get me thinking more and make what I feel is the best decision based on this situation.

635,"Hello All,

Some context first: I live in the UK and work for a Principal contractor in construction who is undertaking a road improvement job for Highways England. Now, HE have deemed us as key workers due to other activities that my company carries out. However, the job i am on is clearly NOT essential. The work site could be made safe for full traffic to flow through in under 2 days for an indefinite amount of time and any works we do undertake actively risks damaging the infrastructure and/or nearby electrical, gas, water and communication services in the area. 

I have raised my concerns to my project manager. My main concerns as as follows:

1) This is a GLOBAL pandemic and everyone is being asked to work/ stay at home unless your works are either essential or can not be done at home. Whilst the site would have to shut, i can carry out 50% of my duties from home and, as previously said, the work is clearly not essential as it does not benefit any emergency services or critical infrastructure. it's purely to turn a buck.

2) By working we are risking getting hurt on site and in construction any incidents where people get hurt usually require critical care. This means taking away an ambulance, paramedics, surgeons and a intensive care bed from other people where an accident/ disease may not have been able to be avoided.

3) It is very hard to maintain the 2m rule on a building site. We have to share offices, drawings, transport and access ways. Sometimes it just cant be done. We are also all touching the same tables, folders, doors and using the same toilets. You are putting us at a far higher rate of infection by forcing us to come to work for works that are, once again, NOT essential!

4) At my last safety critical medical with my last company at the start of 2019 i was told i have a good lung capacity but the lung strength in the pediatric range. I have no paperwork or contact details to support this and i do not want to take up a GP's time to find out. I appreciate he can't just take everyone's word on something but there are also staff who live with either partners who are cancer survivors or who have a 5 week old baby. Whilst we are not in the high risk category i still feel like we have reasons why none of us should be coming to work. 

I raised all these concerns (getting a but upset as i did so) and his response was that he agreed that the works were NOT essential but since HE have instructed us to work we do not have a choice. He also said that i could refuse to come to work but he would not pay me. I am not in a situation where that is currently a choice, i bought a house at the start of the year so i'm in the process of rebuilding my safety net (god awful timing right!). As I've also only just started with this company i'm very concerned that if i refuse to come from work/ only work at home then they will simply terminate my employment. 

My question is as follows: If i refuse to go to work what protections do i have? What legal protections do i have in place to prevent me from being terminated? Am i entitled to statutory sick pay (not that it's much but better than nothing)? Can they force me to come to work amid a this pandemic? We all know things are only going to get worse over the coming weeks here in the UK and i just want to be safe. 

Thanks for reading this far, getting this out on (Digital) paper has also helped me a lot. Stay safe out there people!",29Mar2020,2
636,I just got out of a two year relationship and it's hitting me very hard. One day I was eating and I get a text from who is now my ex saying she can't do this anymore so I said ok. I left it at that. After that the pain of hurt started to overcome me. I start thinking of how I just fucked up and how I could've helped her with this relationship. It hurts to the point where all I want to do is cry all day. Idk what to do. I've talked to my mom and taking to her made me feel better. I can't control my mind it just keeps running through everything we had together and the fear of the unknown. It hurts bad. I can't talk to her because she said she needs space. Idk what to do. Idk if there's anything I could do. I just need help getting through this. Please help.,29Mar2020,1
637,"Background:

Live in the UK. Flat mate is a school teacher. She was going to go home before lockdown (we all flatshare in London and she's from another place in England) but she was asked to stay on to teach NHS children. Only 3 kids showed up. So she stopped working but stayed in the flat, and her boyfriend moved in as he's out of work now. She and I are okay financially because wages are being paid/I work from home.

I told them I've had Lyme Disease and have latent TB that was treated. I'm not in the at risk category per se, but I have bad health and get sick more than the average person. After hearing this, she didn't even blink. No offer to change her lifestyle, nothing.

She and her boyfriend do not follow that serious of precautions. Don't see them washing their hands much. I don't see them wiping down grocery containers they bring from outside. They don't wear masks at the grocery store. I have been making masks for a doctor in the NHS who is out of equipment and has no PPE. Offered her some to wear with the protective instructions on how to use them properly - won't use them.  (I know how to use them properly and I'm making my own out of the proper non woven material, no arguments about that please).

As a result I've been living in my room with my boyfriend. We never leave except to use the toilet and cook in the kitchen. I don't get to use the flat I pay rent for, have no access to living room or balcony as they are always out of their room. She never asked if we could use the common areas on a schedule, she was content to let us sit in my room all day. Whenever we have to use the bathroom or kitchen we wipe everything religiously and keep separate dishes to try and prevent spread. She was inconsiderate, but wasn't worth kicking a fuss over.

But now she's developed a dry cough, a very persistent one. Still tromping all over the house with free reign. We've waited till dinner time to give her a chance to explain herself, contact us or warn us about it, or tell us how she wants to manage. She has said nothing and continues to act as normal.

So now we have decided to send her a message asking her nicely to self isolate in her room, and offered support. We can deliver her food to outside her room, as we have enough for the isolation period. We've asked her not to go out and get groceries, and we won't be leaving the house for groceries for 14 days in line with NHS advice. If she won't isolate in her room fine, we'll just wear masks and keep being cautious. If she won't isolate period though and keeps getting groceries...not sure what to do. Some friends are saying we should call the police if she does. Am I overreacting here? Curious what you all would do, and what you would say to her.

Please be kind. This is already stressful as hell.",29Mar2020,4

639,"Hi!

This past week during quarantine I decided to channel some of my creative energy away from existential doom and put it somewhere healthier and more productive. I've always thought it would be fun to try and launch [my own youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOyOOQARITuCXzwlbOLsIQ/) and start pursuing a creative outlet with my spare time. I'm really into PC gaming and a game that I really love is called SimpleRockets 2.

SimpleRockets 2 is a space flight and rocket building simulator, similar to Kerbal Space Program (but not the same). I decided that I wanted to start making content based on SimpleRockets 2 since it is something I'm passionate about and enjoy doing. I'm 20, male, and a college student, so I've got decent amounts of free time to work with.

I've put up a couple of videos since I've started. They're short, simple, and if you look at my [first post](https://youtu.be/aL2lFg9_tBo) and my latest post you'll notice a serious learning curve as I've been spending more time working on each video, adding transitions, music, title cards, etc.

Obviously I know it's not going to be an instant success, it will take work and time and dedication and I'm willing to put in the hours. I enjoy the creative process, not just collecting the views.

If anyone has any advice, is a budding youtube creator, or just like space and games like me I'd love to chat and pick your brain.",29Mar2020,1
641,"I am a medical student who has begun schooling from home during my second year because of COVID-19. My fiance still lives with her parents, and her brother (M16) recently began feeling ill. He does not appear to have a cough as of today, but does have some GI issue (Diarrhea), muscle aches, headache, and fever. Oddly enough tho he hasn't left his home for 2 weeks but did interact with a friend he was picking up school supplies from a week ago. I am worried about my fiance and want to be there for her and her family, but I do not know what is right. Her brother is still a kid so he doesn't understand basic distancing advice, washing hands, coughing in elbow etc.. He thinks he is indestructible. He does not consider that he is also putting this family's life in danger as well. I am just sitting at home face-timing my fiance from time to time like a moron while they try and wash their hands as much as they can and avoid too much contact with her brother. I want to be there for her and protect her from this but I feel like I cant. I had told her many times to come stay with me and she refused, because she needed to take care of her family through this too and I understand. COVID-19 is highly transmittable so I am just overly worried. She's the love of my life and I want to protect her. I sometimes drop food off for my parents and sister (who happens to be pregnant) so I can not risk getting sick.

644,"So first some background - I live in a rental home with three other people.  It's a pretty easygoing communal living arrangement most of the time, with fairly regular tenant turnover.  I've lived here for just over a year.  It's a cool spot, and hopefully a good one to ride out the current pandemic.

This January a long term renter moved out and was a new girl moved in - really good fit for the house, enthusiastic, kind, beautiful; you can probably guess where this is going if the title didn't give it away. 

I've been single (of my own/depression's volition) for about three years+ and I honestly can't remember having such strong feelings for someone even before that.  I just like being around her- it gives me this interior glow that is comforting and excruciating all at once.

I don't know if the feelings are mutual - we smoke and chill a lot, do puzzles and work out, cook and generally get along well.  She had a not too recent breakup with an on again/off again boyfriend who she now refers to rather consciously as ""my ex"" rather than by name.  

For my part I'll say this - most of my failings are neuroses and insecurities, as evidenced by this post.  I'm attractive, fit, good hygiene, etc. 

But we live in the same house, with all the complications that brings, and now under quarantine quarters are closer than ever.  I'm terrified to be up front about my feelings because if they are not reciprocated than not only will I have potentially fucked up a friendship but the equilibrium of our living space will also suffer.  

Of course further complicating things is that no one is working or knows what the fuck is happening, or will happen, and stress/anxiety levels are way up.  I'm 5/6 years older and feel like trying to maintain my composure and an even keel is healthier (for her/the house generally) then being like ""hey!  hi.  I think I love you, maybe?""  but the only worse outcome than a deeply uncomfortable quarantine post-confession would be agonizedly quashing my feelings and wallowing in regret afterwards (ask me how I know...).

So all that is to say I don't know what to do.  If anyone has suggestions or perhaps experienced a similar situation in the past (or right now!) I'd love to hear your perspective.",29Mar2020,1
645,"I'm struggling a bit at the moment because my recently ex girlfriend and I are going to have a pretty serious talk soon about how she started sleeping with one of my friends, an outcome which has made me uncomfortable though not angry, especially coming to our friend groups social gatherings (not that they're common with COVID). It's hard to give lots of context because it'd be a wall of text but essentially i know deep down she's a good person who's dealing with her own problems at the moment and made a desperate decision without considering how it would affect me - you just have to trust me on that - but all the same I need to sit her down and explain to her the grief she's caused me and why i feel it was a hurtful thing to do. She has no bad habits, she's just for lack of a better term a bit... selfish and I really want to kind of give her a push in the right direction to waking up to that idea because it was evident in our relationship too and I really do want to see her become a better person. Up until this point post breakup we've had a very amicable friendship, she's very open to listening to stuff like this and i know this is technically on her, but I'd hate to completely obliterate that because I came off as a jealous ex lover or sounded like i was just criticizing her. I should note - she told me this in person i didn't find out second hand, i took it pretty well (exceptionally well) but felt worse about it later hence why i want to talk to her about it. I don't really know how to express the selfishness part without it feeling like an attack on her so i guess if anyone has any advice on how to convey this stuff it'd be very helpful.",29Mar2020,1

And if he's in the kitchen, I'm just waiting until he leaves they room so I can go and grab something to eat. I don't know why.
And when I do grab something to eat when he's around, I assume that he thinks I'm ""fat"" or something.

Or, when I lay down, I'm afraid he might think I'm lazy or something. So I just sit down when he enters our room or change my position if I've been laying.

648,"Pretty much what the title said, hope someone reads &amp; helps. TLDR at the end.

I met my boyfriend, Miles, straight out of college. I was minimum wage, pay check to pay check, jumping on cheap flats. He was already established - an executive in a company that hired our construction firm. Met him through that. Miles was the point person on their team, I was the point person on ours. Few months of knowing each other, we started dating.

I was in a weird financial spot in that time. Just moved out, no savings, company I was working for was not giving my complete pay checks. I was struggling to make ends meet. Miles asked me to move in with him since it was logistically better &amp; it’ll help me out a lot since he was paying for basically everything in the house we lived in too.

The company I worked for could not pay me for months. I couldn’t go back home because of family &amp; safety issues. I had zero money. Miles was helping me with everything, even financially. I had nowhere to go &amp; he knows this. We decided I would resign &amp; he’ll help me out until I find I job.

I decided to quit when I had a new job prospect but was still little payout. I wanted to be in a comfortable position financially &amp; know I can buy things on my own but after a year or so dating I got pregnant. Thought of not keeping the baby until almost the third trimester because I had zero money, no medical insurance, no stable job. 

One thing about me is that I hate being dependent - especially financially. He reassured me he’ll take care of every expenses medically (he REALLY wants a kid). With a lot of talking &amp; clear cut communication he knows my dilemma - I didn’t want to be financially dependent to him, I didn’t want to be dependent on anyone at all.

We came to an agreement that he’ll basically handle everything until I can afford to share expenses - whether it’d be 1 year or 10 years. His career is stable enough &amp; his 1 month salary is big enough to actually feed a family of 5 for a year. Decided to keep the baby. He is the love of our lives, my goodness gracious, he looks like Miles so much!

He bought us a home &amp; renovation to fit our needs, hired two live in helpers for the house &amp; baby so we both can work. I buy &amp; contribute the small things in the household, but ultimately anytime I try to even pay for groceries he’ll stop me &amp; say “just save your money” because he knows the grocery expense is like half my salary already. 

I just starting to get traction in my career, I’m still not making much. I can’t help but get anxious &amp; think of him accidentally dying, leaving me &amp; my son alone. I’m up all night all the time planning step-by-step on what I’ll do with different scenarios in my head. Things like “what do I do when he accidentally dies?” or “what do I do when he gets sick?” I have zero savings until know &amp; won’t even know where to start. I can’t sleep thinking about these things, getting myself anxious &amp; sad.

649," I had made friends with this person, I’ve known for about a year, well on a whim, we have lunch one day, and it turned into me bringing him lunch once a week for months, and eating in my car because his lunch breaks were really short. I got to know him pretty well, and we were pretty comfortable around each other. He would invite me to hang out with friends and would ask if I was coming to parties his friends were throwing. 

 As time I passed I started to like him, and I wasn’t sure how to tell him, after talking with another friend he said you should be honest it’s for the best. So tried to spend more time with him just hanging out, playing cards, smoking, whatever I usually do with my other friends. I texted one night saying I need to talk to him in person because shit was bothering me, and he said he come meet me, and I made it clear it wasn’t drastic, when I finally got a chance to talk to him, I told him how i felt, and he didn’t feel the same way, it did suck, but I didn’t want to lose my friend because of it. 

 Well a week later I text him to see if he wanted to grab lunch and he said he was busy with work, and usually he reschedules it, well he told me he just come dinner with everyone later in the week. Usually I would be like cool, but I was scared that he was avoiding me idk why I guess just anxiety, so I told him you don’t have to invite me to dinner, and if lunch is going to be a problem we don’t have to continue doing that. After that he tells me we can talk later, and say he doesn’t want me to hang out with him alone anymore, but it’s cool if as long as other people are around, saying he doesn’t want to feel bad every time he can’t hangout with me. Idk I feel like if you didn’t want to do something you could have just said so, I would understand, I liked him, but he was still my friend. 

 Well now it’s been almost 2 months and he doesn’t really talk to me, unless he really has too, and his friends don’t really say anything to me either, like I’m okay with just being friends I just want everyone to hangout like we used to. I can’t help but feel like I messed everything up, should I just not associate with them anymore or should I try to give more time I’m really confused! 
 
 To add I’m a 26 year old male, and he is the same age, He has a sister that is transgender, so I don’t think it’s an issue with me being bi, I understand that he could be surprised by me liking him, but he initially said, that wouldn’t matter we could still be friends.",29Mar2020,1

I went to the doctor and she didn’t pay attention to what I was saying and said it’s normal. Since than my parents started to think I’m just making excuses to not eat food.

So, I'm a 19F in college and my friend approached me several weeks ago about a sexual harassment and assault case she and a few other women are bringing against a male student that we both know. The evidence she and the other women have is absolutely damning - texts joking about how he ""basically raped"" these women, joking about how consent isn't real, how the way to get a woman to have sex with you is by wearing her down until she says yes etc. Like 100s of these text messages that he's sent over the past year to multiple women he was once close with, on top of the women's individual stories about the harassment and assault he's subjected them to. The University's sexual assault officer said they have a very strong case against him. It seems like the only route the University can take is to expel him, especially considering we attend a high-profile liberal school and it would cause a massive scandal if he didn't get the punishment he deserves.

Anyway, this is how I play into it: many months ago, I also had an intimate relationship with him for a very short period of time that I ended. He was extremely angry with me - this is when I realized that he is very manipulative and has a temper that is just totally out of control, and we stopped speaking for several weeks. We became friends a short time later though, because we run in a lot of the same circles and, despite his glaring and dangerous personality flaws, he can be charismatic to a point where you forget why you never wanted to speak to him again. So we actually became fairly good friends for 3-4 months - I had no idea about the harassment and assault he has committed against other women.

\[\[\[\[Feel free to skip the details of our relationship, which I talk about for the following long paragraph - they're important to me but not as relevant to the current predicament I'm in\]\]\]\]

But in hindsight I should've expected it, because during the entirety of our friendship, he would ask me almost daily to have sex with him. Early on in the beginning of our renewed friendship, his constant asking for sex ended up in us being intimate on two separate occasions (and it was completely consensual), but soon after that I decided that I didn't want to be involved with him like that because of the issues we had in the past. However, I definitely still cared about him in a warped way, because I was a source of advice and confidante to him about several mental illness struggles that he was dealing with, and I felt like he needed me. But I firmly drew the line at friends - every single time he asked for sex (or implied it, or hinted at it, or suggested it) I would say no, I don't want to do that, please stop asking. Maybe 2 or 3 times during the period that we were friends, I had a serious heart-to-heart with him about how his sex-pestering really made me uncomfortable and that it was utterly fruitless, we were never going to hook up again. And then he would stop asking for several days or a week-two weeks, and then it would start again. Our friendship ended after 3-4 months like I said, when I started dating someone who I really felt could be in my life for a long time (we're still together a year later), because I knew how inappropriate it was to have a ""friend' who always asks for sex when you're in a serious relationship.

\[\[\[\[Okay here's the decision I have to make:\]\]\]\]

My friend who is accusing the male student knows he has had relationships with several other women on campus that have involved assault or harassment. In hindsight I agree with her that his actions toward me constituted sexual harassment, even though the word ""harassment"" never crossed my mind at the time. She wants me to participate in the case as an associated witness, where I wouldn't be pressing any charges but I would speak about my experience with him to give the investigator context. I would be one of about 10 women involved in this case who are either pressing charges or acting as associated witnesses. The accused male student has already received a list of the accusers, and will receive a list of the associated witnesses as soon as they are finalized. I have to decide in the next 3-4 days if I am going to act as a witness.

At first it seemed like a no-brainer. I told my friend, yes, of course I will support your case. I want to play my part in keeping the University safe for women, obviously, and this person has proven that he's a danger to virtually every woman he meets. Over the past several weeks though, I've been thinking about my past relationship with him a lot, and remembering how angry and unstable he is, especially when he is not sober. I've seen him scream at the top of his lungs, throw things across his dorm room, and even physically assault another male student once when he was drunk. The kicker is this - while the accusers in the trial and the other witnesses live in other states, the accused male student and I both live in the same state, only about 20 minutes away from each other, and I know he has my home address. Our school has cancelled the rest of our semester because of the coronavirus, so he and I are both currently in our homes, a short driving distance away. Though we haven't spoken in a very long time now, I'm so fearful that if he sees my name on that list, it would be very easy for him to enact some sort of retaliation against me because I'm in such close proximity to him.

The thing that scares me most is that maybe it wouldn't be immediate. This trial is on track right now to completely end life as he knows it - which I believe he deserves - but that could be so incredibly destabilizing to his mental health. We attend a top-20 national US university, and he is on track right now to become a multi-millionaire Wall Street investment banker or something of that sort. And all of that will be taken away: the prestige of the University we attend, his educational opportunities at other universities, his job opportunities and millions of potential dollars, not to mention several semesters of wasted tuition at a school he will likely not graduate from because of expulsion. I'm worried that all of this compounded loss could set him on track to become very violent a few months down the line, when the reality of his situation truly sets in.

**I know the case would still be very strong without me, considering the breadth and depth of evidence that has been compiled against the student. I have virtually no physical evidence - no screenshots of messages, since my messages are set to delete permanently from my phone after 2 months, so it would only be my story. I still think it's valuable, but if several other women are going to say the same thing, I can't help but think that maybe the anxiety I would feel after participating in the case may outweigh the benefit of my contribution. I don't know how to say that to anyone, especially my friend who has literally been through hell because of this person, I would never want to make her feel like this case isn't important to me, or that I'm not prioritizing supporting her. But if I chose not to participate in the case, that's exactly what I would be doing - being selfish, being cowardly, prioritizing my safety and comfort over our friendship, and over justice. But if something was to happen to me and my family because of him, because of my participation in the trial, then I could never forgive myself and would be filled with sorrow and regret for the rest of my life. I just have no idea what to do. If anyone has advice, I would appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much for reading.**

I have some friends and family who are Trump supporters or on the edge and I want to approach speaking with them in a non argumentitive sort of way. I feel like having real conversations with people is the best way I can understand them and hopefully have them understand and listen to my points. That being said does anyone have advice on how to speak with Trump supporters and also possibly have links of facts that I could use as evidence to back my side. I know why I believe what I do but that makes it harder for me to speak with the other side.,29Mar2020,2
665,"My state mandated a quarantine for everyone and it's lasting 3 weeks. My mother cares for alzheimer and dementia patients so she still works during this time. 

I'm an introvert, but I hate to be completely alone. My only 3 friends barely text me and I'm very socially inept, awkward, and anxious. I'm afraid of forming friendships because I have a hard time trusting others.

My only 2 college classes (including a studio art class) were converted to online classes. 

No job because I have health issues that make working at most places difficult. All the jobs I can work at are too far away from my house and I can't drive, I have no licence nor enough knowledge of how to drive. Working from home isn't an option since I have no computer and no money to start up a business or online shop unless I sell my artwork; but I've tried that before and no one wants to buy.

I have no hobbies other than art, hiking, listening to music, indoor gardening and watching internet videos and netflix. I have no interest in finding a new hobby and can't find a reason to. Everything seems so pointless. So forced. So unnatural. I don't want to live like this any longer. I CANT live this way any longer.

And I almost never have the energy or motivation to do any of those things. If I do, I don't want to do those things alone.

 Or I just don't have a reason to do something. Not even ""do it because I can/it's fun/to spite my depression"". Nothing seems appealing to me for any reason. I want to lay in bed and sleep. 

The person I'm in love with doesn't want a relationship with me right now even though he says loves me and I have cried for a total of maybe 6 or 7 hours in the last 24 hours, my eyes were nearly swollen shut ladt night and still are really puffy (and I broke blood vessels in my face and lost my voice last night). I'm so scared, i am fucking terrified, that I ruined our friendship. He took it well and was open and honest but I'm still terrified.

I have always felt so cold, empty, sad, hopeless and lonely. And now i feel those things even more since the person I'm in love with told me his feelings. He already treats me like I'm his so I don't get why he won't call me his...He was/is the only person that hangs out with me or tells me he appreciates me or shows me genuine appreciation - not even my mom does that anymore (hardly). 

I feel like I should just check myself into inpatient therapy. I feel so awful and I don't want to live on this earth anymore if this is going to be my life...life is not supposed to be constant pain. I've already spent over half of my life (11 years) suffering and wondering when things will get better. I never feel happy. I never cheer up. I just forget that I have problems sometimes.

667,"This  goes back to november, but since the lady who rented out her brother's  flat had harrassed me so much I am making a public account of it. She  has threatened to fabricate stories, wished my parents were dead. She  abused me for 2-3 weeks straight and I have decided not to stay quiet  anymore as she is vindictive and I believe very jealous.

The   12 month lease was under my father's name as he was the sole tenant.  Payable according to the rent were: monthly rent (13500 rupees),  electricity and water. There was no mention of any maintenance. The   building was under Puma  realtors who absconded and the owners who took  possession of the flats were tasked with maintaining it. Soon there were  all kinds of meetings, elections amongst flat owners  to form a  committee, and implement mini money making schemes amongst themselves.   For example, Puma realtors left an unpaid electricity bill of 13 lakhs,  which gave impetus to side money making schemes in the guise of  ""repayment""

My father paid half  the year's maintanence unknowingly, as this lady(Amarjeet) would send a  utility man to collect money each month (about 2500 rupees I believe).   My father thought he was paying tip/bakhshish to the garbage man, guards  for their roti/paani (gratuity for lower income workers)

Rent was  only late  1 month by 2 weeks, because I was traveling out of India and  had to send someone physically to the bank, as the account only accepts  direct deposits (NRO/NRI account).The time the rent was late was also  when there were floods in Punjab.

At  some point this lady started pestering my father to vacate the flat as  she wanted to take tuitions there. He is a patient with a long lasting  condition and her constant badgering was not good for his health.  She  would repeatedly call him and talk about his mental state, pushing him.  He called me up  more than once and I decided to move him immediately  because at around the same time she started insinuating what would  happen if he died. I packed and moved him and left the keys with the  guard. The flat was fully cleaned and pictures and a video were taken .

I  did not inform her, because of her toxic behavior and extremely abusive  tone had started 3 weeks before I decided to move my father out immediately. Her husband and her are bankrupt I believe at this point (got nothing to do with me)

The   rent, electricity and water were fully paid.  She bought up  maintenance  and upon  re-reading the lease I let her no that  maintenance was not part of the lease. She even wanted 5 rupees per  transaction for the money that was deposited as rent! At this point she  starts attacking me personally, wishes my family ill and goes to the  police station and makes an inspector call. I told the inspector if she  has a case, she should get a lawyer. Her vitriol on whatsapp at this  point had been going on for 2- 3 weeks.

Couple of things:

1. She has repeatedly threatened me which leads me to believe she will try to sabotage my work/life by fabricating stories
2. I  am a Canadian. She has also threatened to sue me in Canada. I have  informed the border control as nobody goes on a tourist visa with the  intention of suing. It is borderline scammish
3. Her brother or she have given NO receipts. I have bank deposit slips. Are they evading taxes?Her brother works in the US
4. I  have messaged her on whatsapp of March and let her know that her abuse  and threats will not remain in private anymore. Abusers get away with  far too much. She is vindictive and in her own words ""If I can go to the police in the wee hours of the morning, imagine what else I can do to you""
5. Her  abuses are the typical jealous woman kind. They center around my work,  how much money I make, my family's health, marital status etc.  She also  takes special interest in belittling my elderly father. She is not very  intelligent and doesn't have the capacity to understand any reasoning. I  tried to reason with her previously, but  of March  let her know that she's  dumb and jealous.
6. She does NOT have the money for a lawyer. Going to the police is free.  However, never underestimate the jealousy
7. What are some other steps that I should take to protect myself?",29Mar2020,1
668,"So I (20F) live with my (21M) fiancé and we rent a house together. I work part time (my contract states 7.5 hours minimum but I always work around 8-15) in a small supermarket which is part of a big chain (like Tesco’s, aldi etc) and I started working there about 6-8 weeks ago and my fiancé works all week, 9-6, at a telecoms company and has been there since June 2019. He gets a great wage considering he came out of university in May 2019 and his wage + my university loan is our main source of income, the current part time job I have now is just extra money for the both of us really.

However, I have been off work for two weeks as me and my fiancé came down with flu symptoms- so we had to quarantine as we were showing symptoms of the coronavirus. 

We’re both just about back to normal now however we don’t know if it was coronavirus or just a really bad case of the flu, either way we were both really ill and have only just started to recover from it. 

I’m due to go back to work next week as I’m ‘out of quarantine’ on Tuesday although now under new circumstances we shouldn’t be leaving the house unless absolutely necessary anyway. My worry however, Is that I’ve had two illnesses since I started working there (I had to take a day off as I suffer from bad migraines and I couldn’t open my eyes or move etc and then the flu/covid19 that lasted two weeks) which doesn’t come across great considering I have my 6 week review soon and they could quite easily get rid of me and my fiancé has also had five illnesses since he’s been working in his current job (he’s susceptible to colds/flu and when he gets them he always gets a swollen tongue/canker sores etc so he gets it quite badly, he’s even taken holidays off when he’s ill as he’s worried about having too many incidents of sickness) and he’s on his last warning now. 

My worry is that by me going back to work I’m putting us both at risk of catching covid19 (if we didn’t already have it) which could result in not only another sickness incident for the both of us at work, but also my fiancé being thrown into an investigation at work about his illness and potentially talks of firing him, but what I am also worried about is that we’ve just fought off an illness and if that wasn’t covid19 and we ended up getting it then our immune systems could be weakened as we’ve just been ill so I’m worried for our health too. 

I don’t NEED this job, of course the extra money would be nice but we don’t need my wage to survive comfortably. However we do need my fiancé’s wage and if I ended up bringing home any form of illness, whether that be covid19 or another bout of cold/flu which resulted in him having to take time off work again then we’d be in a seriously difficult situation. I just don’t know what to do or if it’s worth the risk? Does anyone have any advice? It’d be very much appreciated :)",29Mar2020,1
669,"So I'm 24f and I have the opportunity to enter into a sugar baby relationship (something I think I want) with a man who is almost double my age. I have a list of pros and cons

(.) Pros
- I've been poor all my life, I'd really like some disposable income
- I'm in a situation I'm unhappy with living with my father and would like the opportunity to move out
- I'm not particularly picky about age, appearance, etc.
- I'm mostly untethered as I don't own any property, don't have many friends where I am, can't work due to location, and I don't really want to be where I am anyway

(.) Cons
- I have a very traditional family, my brother and father are two of my favorite people in the world, and  we're very close. I'm afraid if they found out about my sugar baby relationship they would be embarrassed to be around me or even disgusted (I also agree it's not the most appropriate or upstanding situation but you don't know my situation and it would take a very long post to explain it. It is, in a word, hopeless)

- I am asexual and find sex to be disgusting to say the least, because of this I'm a virgin. While it's pretty obvious that there's not much of a way to have this kind of a relationship without sex and I've accepted it am willing to put my revulsion aside, it's still not ideal and kind of unpleasant

That's most of my issue there, my family is the biggest issue. My brother is my best friend and the most important person to me in the world, I have two young sisters who I have raised and provide almost all daily care for as our mother isnt in the picture, and my father is a little tyrannical but he's also someone I respect and care for a lot. I'm a homebody so me starting to leave frequently to go on dates or meet up or whatever would be quite a flag and it would be very difficult to hide where I'm going and who it's with.

The client i shot for manages properties for owners around the town I live in and the property owner wasn’t happy with the initial edits and some of the shots so I re did some shots again and re edited them to what she said she wanted them to be. No problem there, I tell my clients not to pay me till the job is done and everybody is happy.After re shooting and re editing the photos, my client said “ok she is going to go with these, can you send me a Venmo request to pay you” which to me means everybody is happy, job is done. I got a text from her business partner today asking if I can come in May to re do some shots at the house and it was her understanding this still needs to be done. I text back saying it was my understanding this job was over ask I was paid for it a month ago and your partner said these were fine and you’d go with them, but that I’d be happy to re shoot the areas needed but I can’t do it free of charge. She responded saying well it was her understanding these photos need to be re done, and that they’re unusable and was a waste of the money they paid me for them, that if I’m fine with leaving an unhappy customer so be it, and this is good to know for their next 3 properties. I respond that I never want to leave a customer un happy and would love to re do the photos and can for half the initial price, if that’s not doable thank you for your business and hope the best.

We start seeing each other and quickly connect. I notice he seems older just by his mannerisms and views. I seriously ask him how old he is and he tells me honestly. I’m taken aback but we talk about it and decide to continue seeing each other. 

Now, a few things: he lives with his mom. He works as a recruiter for the Uni football team. When the former head coach left, he was unsure of his job security. On top of that his mother had  recent back surgery, so he decides to move in with her for a few months. Because of that we’ve hung out in the car or in hotel rooms.

I now have to tell my dad and I don’t know how to proceed. I am genuinely happy with this person but the anger that will come from my parents is too much to handle. Is it a bad idea to continue the relationship?

684,"I’m F16 living in rural Ireland if this helps. Being in quarantine has made me realise how much I lack passion in life. About a year ago a really traumatic event made me have to quit horseriding, which was the most important thing in my life at the time. It was my everything, my only hobby and the one thing that I spent the most of my time doing. It was my biggest dream and I always hoped that one day I’d make it to high level competition, but that all fell apart. The last year I’ve just been kind of lost, I focus on something new every month just hoping to find something that makes me happy again but I feel like nothing makes me happy anymore. It’s been a year and I still often cry because I just miss having a hobby. Being stuck at home put me almost back in the state of mind I was when everything just ended, I want a passion again atleast something to keep me busy but I have absolutely no interest in other things, other sports, music or arts. I’ve tried to go back to horseriding but that ended terribly, I feel so lost and unsure of what to do. I’ve also tried to tell a therapist about this and she just suggested I try to return to horseriding, which I attempted to no avail. I really want something to keep me busy during this quarantine, I got a PS4 to try get into gaming but I don’t find it entertaining. I also keep fit by doing exercise but nothing fun, just running and workouts at home, bare minimum to stay fit and healthy.

The other day she didn’t get any sleep found a reddit post I made on another account. It was basically me saying I think I have a crush on her friend and idk what to do. This kinda thing happens a lot where I think I get a crush on a girl I meet but it means nothing and lasts like a couple days at most.

When she saw it she messaged me but I was asleep so I only saw it when I woke up. We talked for a couple minutes about it, I explained it but she was tired so nothing was getting through to her.

We both went into a gc and we were talking for a bit normally with other people and then she brought it up. She was really angry Barbour it for some reason and while I can see why she might be angry cause I guess she thought I didn’t really have a crush on her and was playing with her feelings or something. But she got really pissed and overreacted. 

In the end, she said “your life is a fucking mess rn and I’m not talking to you till you fix it”. Idk why but this hit me different and because ik I’m not the best in situations like this, learnt from experiences, I ended it. I said I’m not gonna take this any further and closed the app. 

We haven’t talked since and idk why but this is really getting to me. I don’t feel like I was in the wrong and other people have agreed with me on that. I feel like it’s her turn to say sorry but she seems perfectly fine. She’s gone about her life as normal.

693,"tl;dr: My girlfriend and i have been arguing a lot recently. I've asked her if she thinks we'd still be together if it wasn't for our upcoming daughter, and she says 'probably not'. I'm not sure if this can be saved or if she even actually wants me. She says she wants to see how things go after the pregnancy, and was hoping it would bring us together. More info below

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I were dating a few months prior to her becoming pregnant. She seemed to be crazy over me, and was keen on getting married after her pregnancy.

She's 7 months pregnant now and things have taken a turn. We had a large argument a few months ago that affected things. Here are a list of our arguments that have affected our relationship. The first one is what set things off in a bad direction

1. I have the type of job where i may have to look out of state for a better opportunity. She gave me the option to move in a few years, or stay where we are forever.  This is because she's worried that her father wont be able to get a job in the future in our new location, and therefore she can't be near her parents. She says ""if my parent can't go, i'm not going"". I told her i can't promise to stay forever. ---- A few months back, i told her mom the same and her response was ""but \[name\] wont be able to get a job""... to me this struck me as selfish. And that her mom may  have a large influence on my gf's thoughts.
2. She wants to spoil our child. She says ""I'm going to try and get her whatever she wants, if i can"". She's never going to tell our child 'no'.. I told her that our kid may turned out spoiled if we do this. You can't always say yes to our child's heart's desire.
3. Recently she picked out a stroller and told me about it. We agreed that i'd by this. I wanted to do a little research for myself, on the cost vs safety. She blows up after i mention this and says i don't trust her.
4. During the coronavirus pandemic, she wanted very specific water. I later learned that she wanted it because it's filtered better ? I offered the solution to get more water for the least amount of money, because who knows if everyone will take all of the kind that she wants. She  blows up before I can even get the full sentence out, and says ""why can't you just get me water""
5. I work at a pretty large company. She wanted me to send out a message to all of the coworkers in my team asking if they've been overseas, after learning about coronavirus. I refused to do so, and simply said ""i'm not going to do that""... and this was a big deal.
6. I accidentally let the cat in her room (cat poop carries diseases that can transfer to the baby), and she went on a cursing rampage. ""I told him to not let the f\*\*king cat in""... ""He never f\*\*king listens"" .... f\*\*k ... f\*\*king, etc --- She also makes it a point that my clothes dont touch her vagina, because she is paranoid about not getting an infection or something, that can hurt the baby... While i was trying to get the cat out, i accidentally brushed up against her. She  then starts yelling to her my that ""i touched her vagina, and that she told me not to"" ... I feel like she was trying to frame me, but then she corrected herself.

So i'm not sure what i'm dealing with here. Am I wrong? I'm not sure if this is hormones or what. She seems to be growing further and further. Never says i love you anymore, never calls first. -- I asked her recently if she thinks we'd be together if it wasn't for the baby and she said ""no probably not, we just have different beliefs"". She says she wants to wait after the pregnancy and see if it brings us together.",29Mar2020,1

We are not being given the proper PPE to protect ourselves (one paper mask per week, which I completely understand due to the shortage of masks and Drs and Nurses at the hospital needing it more). However, I live with family and my dad is on chemo, so I do not feel comfortable returning to work since the virus was brought into the building. I do not have symptoms so far, but I am currently self quarantining in my room due to the incubation period of the virus. I was considering getting a hotel, but my family is not a fan of that idea at all since it might not be safe. Additionally, I am not getting 40hrs per week due to a small number of patients so it would be financially challenging.

I spoke to my boss about options and this is what I was told (I do not qualify for furlough because there is work that needs to be done).

\-  Take an unpaid leave of absence till everything calms down.

\- Resign and apply for unemployment.

However, I was told by someone else if I resign I might not get unemployment. I really don't know what to do.

698,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m a 20 year old female who went through a break up around the end of December 2019/Early January 2020. The relationship was short term, the guy I dated (let’s call him Alex) him and I instantly connected and we became friends back in October 2019 and by November we became romantically involved. Alex left for a family trip to the Philippines in December which is when conflict started to happen. When he came back at the end of December he seemed okay and saw me a few hours after his flight landed but a few days later Alex ended our relationship to work on himself. 

I never had any relationship experience, I should mention Alex is six years older than me and has had two serious relationships before meeting me which has left him somewhat traumatized (he was cheated on by one of his ex-girlfriends) anyways from January - Mid February I was an absolute vegetable, I was so heartbroken over a short term relationship that I even went off on him a few times because i was so hurt and angry, i was just feeling intense emotions and mood swings, I couldn’t even leave my house expect for work. 

Around mid February to early March I started to move on! I didn’t even want Alex back. I started to go out, go clubbing and I even had a rebound hookup buddy for a bit which helped me (this hook up buddy went back to Mexico due to the whole virus) 
Anyways last week Alex contacted me to see how I was doing - at first It was a civil conversation and he even told me to come visit his new workplace etc. The next day I felt super sad so I messaged Alex telling him i’m not over the pain this resulted in us arguing. By the next day I thought I could give this friendship a chance but i pulled a 180 and I got drunk and i told him how badly he hurt me. Today I decided to message Alex and tell him that him contacting me out of the blue left me feeling triggered and that we weren’t healthy to start a romantic relationship due to past traumas and his busy schedule in the new year, then I ended it off with that I need to heal and fully move on from you, then maybe we can reconnect as friends because I won’t have any romantic feelings for him. He said he understood. 

But the problem now is that I feel the same way as I did back in January to mid February. I feel myself going through this heartbreak AGAIN after what I thought I was moving on. I really need advice because I want to move on from Alex and heal from our relationship so I don’t end up in a similar situation or I don’t want to be that person who will forever be stuck on that one person they dated. 

Please help me! 

PS: clubbing, a rebound and going out did help me but due to the lockdown and being self isolated at home it’s really hard because i’m just stuck with myself.",29Mar2020,1

I never dealt with this kind of situation before. There is this girl I am in deeply in love with. We are very close friends, we spent a lot of time together and we got really used to each other presence. She doesn't love me back though, but she just can't right now. 

I basically live on another continent rn, and I met her 6 months ago. Unfortunately, I had to leave her country and go back to mine 3 months ago (my abroad semester was over), but I feel like I left her at the worst moment. She's going through a bad depression, like really bad (school, personal problems, etc...). Im so so worried for her, she deserves everything and I just wanna help her out, one way or another...Im so scared, and I feel so unpowerful and I regret that I left her country just at that moment. We still have contact and I talk to her pretty often, but I just read her last reddit post...

What should I do ? What can I do ? Should I text her ? Should I ask her if she wants to call me ? Should I just leave her ? Should I ask her best friend about it (i know her aswell) ?

705,"I work at a small family owned appliance repair business in Maryland. Since the spread of the virus has gotten more rampant in the state, our governor issued the order for only essential businesses to remain open and for no groups of 10 or more people allowed. We have not gotten a shelter in place order yet, though some think that is the next step. As it turns out, appliance repair is an essential business, which I understand. People need cold food, washers and dryers to keep clean, and ovens to prepare food. I guess when I signed on for this job 5 years ago, I never thought of myself as ""essential.""

 My problem is, I'm a very anxious and paranoid person, borderline hypochondriac. I have a wife and a 10 month old son at home, and despite the rapid number of cases growing in our area, our boss isn't showing much in the way of concern or leniency about the matter, stating that it's just the media blowing it out of proportion. I feel as though we as a business though are not really doing our part to flatten this curve. We run 6-8 calls a day all over our county. That's 6-8 homes we are entering and leaving and moving on to the next. We wear gloves during the service and purell ourselves between each job, but we still enter these homes. We are potential carriers on that basis alone. Not to mention we work on laundry products and dishwashers, appliances made to wash away dirt and filth. The nature of these machines are, that though they get your clothes and dishes clean, the appliances themselves are not. We are screening calls and asking if any residents have been displaying symptoms or if they have traveled recently. It still makes me worried though. People can be carriers of the virus without displaying symptoms, and that includes me and the other technicians.

 I am worried for my family, for my coworkers, and for the general well being of the public and our customers. I am not sleeping at night, lost my appetite, and just am not myself because of this stress and on top of that, it is effecting my work. I'm not thinking all that clearly and have been misdiagnosing some people's appliances, leading to return visits that are unnecessary. I realise I am essential and this is a time of crisis, but I'm not sure how to handle the worry and the stress. How are other essential personnel handling it? Any tips for the chronic worrier?

Edit: I don't want to make my boss out to be a monster either. It's not like he sits in an office and dictates. He is the owner of the company and the lead technician, still running service with us at 63 years old, and giving us a run for our money most months!

706,"Hi, first post on this thread, but I don't know where else to post about this so maybe someone will guide me to a better thread. Anyway, here we go. 

I have a rented apartment through April 5, I effectively moved out in the middle of February when I was able to move into my new space. On Feb. 25, sewage backed up into my until and all the other ground floor units in the building. I was at work and obviously not at the apartment, but was in the loop of everything happening. 

They eventually shut off water to the building, placed sani-huts on site, and gave a two day rent credit for the days spent without water.  That was the last I heard of it. 

I went in today to clean the unit prior to returning the keys and the unit is ripped apart. The toilet is in the bathtub, water is leaking from the toilet piping in the wall, the closet doors were removed, almost all of the molding was pulled up and left piled on the kitchen counters and in the middle of the living room. 

I obviously wasn't at the unit I'm March, but I paid full rent as my move out isn't until April 5. 

What can I do? My unit was, and is, currently unlivable and I've paid rent diligently despite not being there. I have photos to document the condition.

708,"I don't want to leave my family behind but I think it may be in my best interest. I don't know if I'm overreacting or could even make it on my own. 

X = sister (22)

Z = sister (24)

The reasons I want to do this are as followed:

1. My mothers an alcoholic. She drinks at least 10 bottles of wine every week, making it just over 1 bottle a night. I say bottle\* not glass. I think a glass a night I could deal with, but not this. She's not what people would call a ""mean drunk"", she has never physically hit me (unless you count a gentle slap on the wrist, once, when I was a lot younger and misbehaving) but she makes me feel like a piece of sh\*t. She makes ""jokes"" which may just be jokes, but, when it is something like ""Well, you didn't get an A\* (or a 9 in the UK)"" and she meant it as a joke, it has severely decreased my confidence. I cannot dye my hair or cut it too short- which is a first-world issue! And I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat for saying that, but, my hair is one of the three things I actually like about myself (followed by my nose and my waist (don't ask)) so I would like to do whatever I want to make me feel happier. But, because ""I'm a girl"" I ""can't have it that short"", which is total bullsh\*t because of 1. Hair has no gender and 2. It's my hair. I understand (kinda) the length, she was born in the 70s so she grew up like that and even though both my grandmothers have short hair, I guess it matters on age? But, going back to the alcoholic thing, because I've ranted for too long about hair- she makes ""jokes"" and has decreased my self-worth and self-esteem for about a year and a half, she only started heavily drinking then even though she got drunk more or less every night for five years before (we lived above and ran a pub solely by ourselves- so I can sorta understand it?). But, I grew up without my parents around much because they ran a pub, I saw my dad more than my mum because she was always too hungover to drive us to school and even then it was for about 30 minutes a day max. I guess that changed the way I socialise forever because that was from the ages 6-11, which is like the main bit of childhood that can really deeply affect you. So, now, when I spend all day in my room, alone, because that's the way it's always been I get comments from my mother about how I'm never downstairs and ""you must hate us!"" (as a joke) and that has made me feel guilty even though it was the way I've been for years. I even get talked to by X about how I should spend more time with everyone. 
2. My mother's homophobic and transphobic. I have struggled with gender I would say my entire life but, it has recently come out more in the last 4 years. I don't know, still. It gives me such bad anxiety, I wish I could just be seen as a person, not a female or male (or non-binary person) but I can't. So when she says sh\*t about transgender people, that hurts even though she doesn't realise it. But, what she does know is that I currently have a girlfriend! I have told them that she (goes my she/her pronouns) is genderfluid! I got a comment of my dad of ""coo-coo"" with the hand gestures and I was not happy about it, but, my mum was talking to X later saying it doesn't exist and my girlfriend needs help and she's just confused. It's transphobia and she has no right in saying what my girlfriend is, my girlfriend decides that and that is her decision. But, before I told them she's genderfluid, I walked in on X and my mother talking very quietly about how ""I'm old enough to know"", that wouldn't have been bad, but they were both drunk and it just hurt. It hurts because they are speaking about me, about who and what I am, about my identity, behind my back and my mother is acting like it means nothing. It hurts when she openly speaks out about the LGBTQ+ community when she thinks I can't hear and when I'm around she acts like she's the angel. I know she was raised that way, but, does that give her good enough reason to openly speak out against what I am?
3. I can't talk to my family about anything. They all make me feel so guilty about my own problems and I feel as if I can't talk to them. I feel detached from the family as if I don't belong there. If I do talk about my problems, it will only be minor ones like, my back hurts or school is stressing me out. And then I'll get: ""your too young to be stressed"", ""wait until you get to university"". They, not only make me feel like a piece of crap but also, scare me so much about the future. About how much I'm going to hate it and how stressed I'll be when I'm older and have my own job. 

There are so many more, my home life isn't great. But, I don't want to cut out Z and her family from my life because I love them all so much and, even though X annoys me so much because she pretends to have anxiety and thinks she's always right, I do love her, I love my brother even though he isn't the brightest and has the mind of a 10-year-old even though he's nearly 18 (he isn't mentally ill, guys, he is just not that smart), and I love my dad. My mum is the problem. But, I fear if I cut her out my life and still talk to the rest of my family, her drinking will get worse and the rest of my family will stop talking to me. I just want everything to go back before she even started drinking and I want to replay time and make sure she doesn't drink. I would be so much more confident and love myself more but, right now, I'm stuck in a limbo- should I cut her out of my life for my own mental health or am I overreacting and this is just normal?

I don't think it's normal but this is the only way I know. When I heard how much my geography teacher looks after his children, how they sit with each at dinner every night and he's always there for them, I almost burst out into tears right then and then later cried later that night because I realised, my family is nothing like that. His family seems so much more normal and here I am with an alcoholic for a mother and a non-existent self-esteem. 

Ok.

Am I overreacting or is this genuinely something I should consider?",29Mar2020,1

And we both have the same sense of humor and were always laughing, which is a huge thing to me. I get the vibe that he likes me but we’re both not moving forward. When we talk it’s MAINLY about the game we play. When it’s not about the game, it’s NEVER getting to know each other. I know his name, age, and where he’s from, and like a little of what he’s into.

I ask questions about her friends like are they funny or tell me something about them and I don’t get bored when she or other people talk 30 minutes about people in don’t know.  
I read this back and it sounds a bit mean. I love my best friend and we have a lot of fun together. 
My ex bf (16) was the same he also didn’t like to talk long. And I know other people who also don’t like to talk. 
My question is am I over interested in things or are they not interested enough ???

718,"So because of the Quarantine, everyone in my family seems to be losing it. Mom, dad, sister and me.

Mom - a school teacher with OCD and anger issues who keeps cleaning and fixing things every waking minute. 

Sister - preparing for her MBA entrance but doesn't get to study because my Punjabi mom keeps nagging her ALL THE TIME. It's not her fault, but I understand why she's on edge. 

Dad - Worried about losing his Job because he had a Shitty boss + CoronaVirus, also worried, because if he loses his job, how will he support the family? I can see his symptoms are very similar to mine when I was as 16.

Me - Diagnosed with BDD 5 years ago, better now. Failed all my University courses(Ultimate Guilt + Depression + Anxiety). No friends here. No outlet. To resolve the guilt and repay my dad for the money that I lost(education, failed courses), I have been making apps/games/websites to generate some capital so that I could ease my dad a little. But nothing worked. I'm not giving up, working on my next idea. 

Everytime I try to confront them about their behaviour, they seem to attack me back and get very very agitated. I feel like I'm gonna lose it soon as well....",29Mar2020,1

720,"I apologize in advance if I didn’t post this in the right location. Just wasn’t sure where it would fit better...

I’ll try to make this post short as possible. I (24 F) moved from California to Oregon to be with my fiancé (26 M). We’ve been together for a little over 3 years and have been living together for almost 2. Unfortunately I’ve been slapped with a  “you never really know someone until you live together” real hard (ha).

For the sake of my unborn child (due in June) I’m trying to make the relationship work but I’m emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. Now that our lease is coming to an end within the next month I’ve been contemplating on being on my own.

However, I feel like I’m financially strapped in this relationship. As a single mother I make too much in the state of Oregon so it doesn’t appear that I’d qualify for any sort of help. I don’t have family here so relying on family members for childcare or a place to stay is out of the question. I’ve looked into moving with a roommate but no one wants kids. Also if I live with anyone the state will consider their income as part of the “household” so I definitely won’t get any help. So here I am back to square one.

And I’m sure many of you are wondering, well there’s child support orders that can be put in place. Yes I know, however, I don’t want to put child support on him.. I don’t even want him on the birth certificate. I don’t want anything tied to him. 

And I’m sure you’re asking why...

So, he already has 3 kids with someone else. We have them every weekend. I’m not going to say he is a horrible father, because he’s not. He’s never been abusive towards them and shows he cares and loves them very much. However, being with him he’s been verbally abusive to me in front of his kids and I do not want my child to go through that with him and a future gf of his. He’s an alcoholic and the first ever incident that he got physical with me happened in February when he tried taking my car to drop off his kids (he was extremely drunk, has license suspended w/ 2 DUIs). I tried to get the keys back from him and he dislocated my finger when he hit my arm back. I went to the urgent care the following day but never said how I got it but it is on record. 

I don’t even know how to continue this post or end it other than I need advice on what to do. Should I stay just for the sake of being stable? I’m the bread winner in the household and since he gets child support taken out every pay check he definitely does not bring in enough income but it’s still enough to get us by. I wouldn’t have to worry about childcare expenses because he can get a swing shift job and we can alternate. He works for a temp agency so it’s not a permanent job, he’s able to adjust better than I am. My job schedule is set. 

Any advice would be appreciated. And although I shouldn’t have to put this out there I feel like I’ll need to defend myself before I get any comments about it. I got pregnant before the relationship started taking a turn for the worst. Also, doesn’t matter because I got pregnant while using contraceptives. 


P.S. I don’t have any money saved besides the money that I’m saving for maternity leave. Since I recently got hired I will not qualify for any paid maternity leave and will not qualify for short term disability pay since I will not pass the 180 day probation period by the time I give birth). I also haven’t informed him about my plans about leaving since I’m scared he will just take off and leave me with the last month expenses. Then I’ll be extremely overwhelmed. 


Thank you.",29Mar2020,2

722,"Hello, I have a very complex situation regarding the legality of actions being taken against me in my current living situation. I'll attempt to be as consistent as I can be with continuity regarding the events preceding this post.

So, I (26) stay with my older sister (30) and her boyfriend (31) in a house owned by the boyfriend's mother (50s?) in Johnson County, Kansas (more specifically-- Merriam). On the evening of Saturday, 3/21/2020 (roughly around 9PM), I went to visit a close family friend. He picked me up, we went straight to his home, then he proceeded to bring me straight back to my place of residence the following afternoon (22nd) around 3:30PM.

However, upon arriving at my place of residence, I was ordered by my two roommates (sister and boyfriend) to leave and stay away from the home under the assumptive pretenses that I may (or may not) be a carrier of COVID-19 (despite still having no symptoms at the time of writing), which could potentially harm my sister's pre-existing respiratory condition. I was forced to stay out of the home and my friend had to come back and pick me up. I was not allowed to go inside or touch anything.

During the time that I was waiting on my friend to pick me up, they verbally pitched (through the door) the idea that I could stay with the aforementioned friend for two weeks of quarantine time, then I could return to the household on Sunday, 4/5/2020. They made me wait outside as they stuffed some of my things into a backpack and left it outside the front door for me to take. My friend returns and picks me up, taking me back to his home. Later that day, by text, I agreed to their request, as did my friend (we were trying to do the right thing and not escalate the situation, since this is obviously a civil matter).

However, we still decided to contact the local police (Merriam PD) the same day to ask about the legality of this action being taken against me. The police proceeded to confirm that they can't ""kick me out"" of the home without proper eviction (assuming the landlord would be the one to write an eviction notice), since I have lived there for a considerable amount of time (3+ months) as well as having proof of residence. However, the police also stated that I cannot force myself back into the home (obviously), as that would be considered trespassing/breaking-and-entering. This puts things at a standstill, especially considering they do not handle civil matters. Considering that the civil matter's catalyst is COVID-19, the police didn't have answers for what they consider an ""unprecedented"" time in history, also admitting that my call was the first call they had regarding a situation such as this one.

I give the police my sister and her boyfriend's contact information. The officers get in touch with them as I wait for a return call. The call comes back and the police state that, again, they can't force my roommates to let me back in, but still reassure me that I, again, cannot be forcefully ""kicked out"" or removed from the household, either. They also stated that my sister said that I made violent threats (fabricated) toward her, prompting the police to ask me if I did so. I did not, and the police didn't care to question it any further, not seeming very concerned that it was something I'd even do. The police also didn't seem to have any resources for me to work with, explaining that even homeless shelters were in tight positions due to the events of COVID-19. We sit on this information in good faith that my sister and her boyfriend would keep their word per their request, despite hostility.

I call our father (50s) for help, who lives at least three-or-so hours away in Gravois Mills, Missouri. He couldn't convince my sister to allow me back into the home, as her decision was firm, nor did he consider taking me in due to the nature of the situation.

I cease to take further action, and nearly a week passes as we assume the request they made wouldn't undergo any changes.

Fast forward to last night (3/28/2020)--- I receive a text message from my sister's boyfriend stating that I'll need to stay here longer regarding the extension of the city's lockdown and quarantine time, offering to stay in contact and bring me any items that I may want or require from my bedroom. My friend refuses this, holding them to their word and attempting to abide by the original request.

This is when things start to get pretty hairy. I explicitly state that my friend refused and that I'd be home as agreed on the 5th. They do not take kindly to this. The minimal ""conversation"" (text-only) eventually escalates to the point of them texting my friend this morning and telling him that the landlord supposedly, verbally stated that she doesn't want me on the premises, and the only way I could return to the premises is to collect my things ""out of the driveway"". Photos of these texts will be attached to the post.

Unfortunately, as it's Sunday, I can't get in touch with Kansas Legal Services by phone until tomorrow, so I submitted an online application in order to potentially open a case. These are the facts and questions I currently have regarding the situation ***(specific to the state of Kansas, please)***:

**FACTS:**

*1\] None of the occupiers of the household (including myself) pay rent. None of us are currently employed or in education (NEET). Not my sister, her boyfriend, nor myself (there may or may not even be a written lease; unsure of this-- and if there is one, I haven't seen it, signed it, nor have I been made aware of it by the landlord, herself, despite the amount of time I've lived there). We are all supported by the landlord, herself. My most recent job (ending in December 2019) was at PetSmart, which registered the home as my federal address.*

*2\] My sister and her boyfriend recently claimed me on their taxes (within the last month or so) as a dependent, assuming they'd get more out of their tax return.*

*3\] The landlord (boyfriend's mother) is aware that I live in the household, and allowed it. She even bought me gifts this past Christmas, and I still have the Christmas card and gift bags in my bedroom as evidence of her supporting my stay.*

*4\] Moreover, I have plenty of other evidence to support that house is indeed my place of residence (mail, door key, all of my things, etc).*

*5\] The visitation I had with my friend lasted under 24 hours and ended before the city's lockdown procedure that took effect on Tuesday, 3/24/2020.*

*6\] I am a legal U.S. citizen with a physical social security card.*

**QUESTIONS:**

*1\] Am I considered a ""squatter"", a ""long-term guest"", or a ""legal tenant""? Considering the awareness of the landlord paired with the amount of time I've lived there, I'm not sure which category I'd fall under, especially considering the lack of lease. Moreover, how much time must pass before a squatter should/could be considered a tenant?*

*2\] Is it legal, at all, for them to do what they're doing and speak on the landlord's behalf? Does anyone have the right to handle my belongings, or throw them out?*

*3\] Do I have any rights, what so ever, regarding my situation, despite my lack of income, credit, or medical coverage? I also have no vehicle. Virtually, I have nothing to my name other than some basic belongings (some clothes, a few electronics, medical documents, etc).*

*4\] Do I have any local or statewide resources that could possibly aid me which I am unaware of?*

*5\] If any of these actions being taken against me are illegal, are they grounds to open a court case? Not that I'd personally want to, but is it a possibility?*

*6\] Am I being manipulated into legally making a mistake and figuratively hanging myself with the things they've done and are saying to me? Are they attempting to keep me at my friend's house long enough to disable me from disputing that I am a member of their household anymore?*

*7\] Are there any job-related resources that could potentially allow me to work from home using the internet?*

 *8\] Does this executive order cover me in this particular situation?:* [*https://governor.kansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EO-20-10-Executed.pdf*](https://governor.kansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EO-20-10-Executed.pdf) 

Any help would be strongly valued in such a stressful time and I greatly appreciate anyone that's willing to attempt to assist me with this situation. I've attempted my best to keep the post as objective as possible without putting forth my personal opinion(s) on the matter or anyone involved. If anyone reading this has counter-questions for me to answer, I'd be more than happy to, and will be frequently checking the post for updates as the situation develops. Thank you.

723,"Hello!  So I live in a second floor apartment.  There are four apartments total on our unit.  So when I came home 2 days ago, there were multiple cases of bottled water just sitting outside my door.  I asked my roommates and my family, but no one bought it and it wasn't me.  

It's still sitting out there as I type this and I'm not quite sure what to do with it?  My apartment office is currently closed and I don't know any of the neighbors either.

724,"(F 26 USA)

I work in a retail position. I’ve been wanting to quit for months, but haven’t found something that offers me the same pay/schedule. Then corona happened. My position has been declared non-essential. So in the meantime they’re having me do the work of a merchandiser. So here’s my dilema:

* The job is physically demanding. As someone with arthritis (even though I’m young) I don’t think the pay is worth it. 

* I will be exposing myself to a shit ton of people. The 6ft distance doesn’t exist; customers are stupid and don’t follow it. 

* My 7 year old son has asthma. I might also have it but my testing was delayed because of Corona. How high risk are we?

* I get health insurance through my job. If I quit, I lose it and can’t afford it through the marketplace.

* I have some savings, and with the stimulus check I’ll have enough to last me until the end of May. 

I’m tempted to quit without notice. This job has screwed me over many times and I have plenty of people who are willing to give me a job recommendation, so I’m not worried about giving two weeks. I’m just worried about losing my health insurance.

I (15f) have a crush on this guy from school (15m) who I'm good friends with (tech week bros @theater kids) but our school has been shut down for the past two weeks and it reopens in ... 37 days (fuck). We talk over IG dms but like  idkkkkkkkkkk  I like him but I can't see him so I still have no idea if he likes me or something. one of his friends has been encouraging me to make it more obvious that I like him but I'm just like ???????? so help plz

some background info:
he switched to my school district at the beginning of the year from a very fancy private school (we're freshmen). He claimed to be a theater kid, no one believed him bc he's basketball kid who listens exclusively to rap. We started hanging out bc we were both in the school play and he had never done a real tech week before. The other freshmen in the show hate him and lowkey disliked me so that's part of it too. Our entire grade thinks we're dating bc of how much we would hang out together after school/before rehearsal. We're not, but neither of us told anyone that we weren't. After opening night of our show we went to the cast party in the city together (we live rlly close to the city) and we had to walk together for awhile to get to the party.

729,"I learned that there's many unspoken rules about social relationships and friends, and I haven't been following them for a long time...

I grew up surrounded with dominant people, some people from my family and high school (either classmates or teachers) had that kind of personality, so I had to learn skills to become a peacekeeper, and try to help people as much as I could.

And that ended up destroying me. People tried to warn me about that fate, including old teachers, friends and family, but I didn't listen, I believed I was doing the right thing, and it let me to lose almost everything...

In a support group I am, a guy told me that I needed to learn unspoken rules about friendship and social relationships, including not giving everything to people who don't pay you back, to stop apologizing for everything and to learn that being submissive isn't the same as being a good person.

In high school people bullied me, and they still asked me for help later (lending homework, pens and pencils or other stuff, buying them food, etc.), and I still helped them... I guess that since I never fought back or tried to gain respect, people thought of me as a provider, or as a disposable person, since I always did what they wanted, no matter how bad they treated me.

And sadly I kept those customs at college... And that lead me to this future.  

When I'm in vacation almost no one texts me, and when I'm in class people ask me to help them a lot (like sending them slideshows, homework, links or other stuff), and I don't know how much I'll be able to handle that.

Because of my people pleasing tendencies, I lost almost all the friendships I had, as I drifted away from some, or had conflicts and/or misunderstandings with others, or my self-isolation drove away many people as well... There's so many people I feel I need to talk to, that I don't have any idea where to start...

I don't talk to my mom about this anymore because we always end up arguing, she tells me that she doesn't understand why I have such an obsession with friendship, and I tell her that I don't like to feel alone or feel empty...

The results are that I'm almost alone, I'm depressed because the ideal I once held about helping people ended up betraying me, I'm nothing but a tool or just a classmate/acquaintance to most people, and I don't know how I'll live like that for the rest of my days...

I'm tired of hearing the same excuses again and again (it's not your fault, everyone else is wrong and you're right), how can that be?!

If I always end up making people go away, then it must be mostly my fault, because there's no way everyone else is wrong and I'm right, isn't it?",29Mar2020,1

735,"Sorry, long and badly formatted post ahead...

So, both my parents have depression, and my Mum has extreme anxiety also. Outside of a select few very specific circumstances, she refuses to do anything beneficial for herself because she “doesn’t deserve it” and “it would be wrong”. She gets upset if someone does the washing up, because she “has no purpose” without  chores (which she hates). Earlier I lost my temper because she wouldn’t text her son back because she’s “not good enough at words”. I could list a million more absurd things. It’s a lot to deal with. 

With lockdown, her usual routine is changed and the one form of exercise/escaping the monotony she gets currently is walking to the shops every day to pick up a newspaper and any food bits we have run out of. She enjoys this, it’s good for her physically and mentally, and it doesn’t stress her out because in her mind she is just running errands. BUT her health makes her high risk and in the current world I don’t feel like this is the best thing for her to be doing... but if she doesn’t pop to the shops daily she has literally nothing else to help her anxiety. I just don’t know what to do or how to help. I’ve tried asking her to walk around the area with me, play board games, cards, etc, but she refuses because anything she does needs to have a non-selfish purpose or she can’t cope. 

She feels excluded and unloved in her own family even though we all go well out of our way to ensure that that could not be further from the truth. That said, I do enjoy spending time with my dad more and we do a lot of fun stuff together that my mum refuses to participate in. It’s just overwhelming and I can’t face giving up the healthy relationship I have with my Dad, to potentially ease some of my mums anxiety, when in all honesty I have to fight to keep my own mental health above board also! I’ve let go of so much resentment that I used to hold with regards to my childhood, but I still find dealing with my Mum overwhelming, upsetting and frustrating. 

And no, she won’t see a counsellor because she “doesn’t deserve to feel any better”. I and my Dad have tried to persuade her more times and in more ways than I can count.

Pay him the amount it takes to break the lease &amp; sell my things. Then move back home with my friends. I’m in another state with him so it makes it very difficult to leave. I have my own career &amp; income but the rent is super expensive here &amp; with my job you don’t make a ton of money. Anyways I had all this set up before quarantine &amp; now the plan still exists technically but I can’t sell my things as planned because no one can go near each other during quarantine (which I agree with) but it’s making my life miserable at the moment.

739,"Hi all, healthcare worker with a throwaway account and a bit of a lengthy problem. I am a radiology technologist at an urban hospital.

Before beginning my current work rotation last Wednesday (I work a 7 on/off 11.5 hour schedule) I had been experiencing illness. I attempted to contact my primary care physician for advice before working and was immediately referred to our company's associate health. I then contacted my boss who also referred me to associate health. I called, self-reported my symptoms, and was automatically placed on a ""quarantine"" from work pending a script for COVID-19 testing with subsequent results. 

Thankfully, 4 days later from the start of this process, I received negative results and was cleared to return to work today. 

But because I self-reported symptoms and tested negative, the time I missed work (4 days = 45 hours approx.) will be taken out of my TAP (time away pay) which is my only combined sick/personal/vacation time. I'm also a night shift worker and will automatically lose my shift differential. Anyone testing positive is paid under ""pandemic pay"". 

Do I have a case to argue that I was furloughed since I was automatically suspended from work pending associate health protocols? If so, how do I approach this? I'll be asking my manager advice via email tonight, but any other experience/suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

740,"I'm a relatively new EMT (got certified in august) but I haven't been able to practice since I have been out of state because of college, and my license is only good for my home state. Since I'm new, I was going through a process called credentialing, where a more experienced EMT rides with me on calls to supervise, give advice and help if things get out of hand (This also stopped when I left for school). I came back home over spring break, but as you all know, COVID-19 became a massive issue and I was told to stay back home. Because of a lack of qualified people in my department, an officer reached out to me and asked if I would like to become emergency credentialed (Meaning that I would ride on calls alone). I thanked him for the opportunity, but told him that I didn't think it was a good idea since I had been out of practice for so long (since I left for school). Even though I wasn't with the ambulance, I still volunteered with the engine and truck. This was good, but because of virus precautions, they wanted fewer firefighters on scene and as a result, newer members (including myself) were told to stay back unless we were specifically called for manpower (mainly in case of structure fires). Since then, I've been at home and honestly feel kind of useless. I see my friends (who have more time on) going out on the ambulance every day, putting their health and lives on the line doing the job that I trained to do. I'd be nervous to go back out there alone since I haven't practiced in such a long time, but part of me thinks that it I man up and help, that it would come back to me and I'd get back into it and be able to be effective. What do you guys think?",29Mar2020,3

His friend has also been following the order guidelines strictly and hasn't left his house. Is this friend visit okay?

744,"My boyfriend is a a senior film major, and this semester he was accepted into the thesis class (which is a very hard class to get into, over a hundred students applied and only 14 director/producer teams got in. The majority of the people in the class are seniors). Ever since things started getting shut down, his professor has told the class that the people who had yet to shoot their films would be able to finish their films at a later, safer date. College leadership even sent out an email assuring the students they'd be allowed to finish their project. However other RTF (radio television film) faculty started complaining that this deal was unfair to other RTF students, as they wouldn't get to finish their projects. Because of this, the thesis class no longer has the option to finish their films.

My boyfriend and his classmates (as well as me and some other people who were supposed to work on their projects) then reached out to the dean and RTF faculty to let them know how essential the thesis class is to their future career, and asked to be allowed to shoot at an alternative date or to be given a refund so they'd have the money to continue the project on their own. The dean just emailed my boyfriend and basically told him 'tough luck, we're not doing anything.' We've contacted the school newspaper (who have agreed to write an article about this), but I was wondering if there was anything else we could do? This whole situation is really disappointing, and feels very disrespectful to the seniors who are having their work just thrown away.",29Mar2020,1

751,"Hey Reddit!

I started a new job as an administrative assistant for a big corporation a week ago. It’s not what I expected. The amount of work is more than I thought I would be doing. Even though I’m working for a big corporation, the pay is minimum wage and the hours are long. There are so many phone calls back and forth and paperwork. My coworkers are nice but I feel like they’re going to get tired and annoyed of me for asking help all the time. One of my coworkers is training me and I can see it in her face expression that she’s annoyed of me and think that I’m stupid. I’m a worry wart and tend to overthink. I started this job a week ago and I don’t think I can see myself working at this new job for a month. I totally want to quit because I’m scared of messing up. Throughout my life I have always taken the easy way out because I hate challenges and I hate feeling stressed out. This is something that I definitely want to change about myself. My question is, what advice can you give someone like me who doesn’t like to step out of their comfort zone? And how long did it take for you to settle in at your new job?

754,"Ok so this is gonna be alot. Im 18, senior in high school, living in a whole new state. About a year ago my adoptive grandma died, and with her went my childhood home. She took my mom and us out of the will and the only thing we got was 1/5 of the house money when it sold.  After a bunch of legal stuff and family that hates us, we got about money that split between me and my older brother. Its not alot of money btw. 

Ok so, im in a new state with my mom, and were living with 5 others, 2 who are my grandparents. They all have their own problems but they all expect us out by now. The living situation is not ideal and two of the others hate us. 

We want to move, and some of the money is going to  be used to get a house. But now with the cronovirus and shutdowns there are not as many jobs, which both me and my mom need to get to even get a loan for a house, or an apartment. And since my grandparents also got money theyre remodelling and want us out. 

My mom cant get a job, she has cronic pain but doesnt qualify for state help here. She applys and then says oh well if she doesnt get it. She wont settle  for any job either, she has to have a job that fits her criteria. Ive applied to almost 30 jobs and none have gotten back to me. Plus my mom keeps spending money and thinks this situation is ok to live in. 

I hate living here, i get yelled at almost everyday, and am fearful of half of the people i live with. Ive been tempted to get my own small apartment or home, even in another state, but i also need a job to do that too. And i dont have a car to go anywhere, since i dont know how to drive. Plus i dont want to leave my mother and brother in financial ruin, which would happen if i bought my own place. 

Im just,,,, really tired of this situation. Theyre so much going on, alot that i havent even put on here. And its getting to me... plus now in the next week or two we need to leave so they can repaint their house, they all know where theyre gonna go but i have no idea what were gonna do. 

Sorry if this all makes no sense but im just so lost and feel hopeless. Im supposed to focus on graduating but i cant in this situation.",29Mar2020,0
755,"If you feel like you try so hard, and you’re never the one people get, read this. I’m quite young, and have already had two broken hearts. Two years of tears every night because my love always winds up with someone else. Here’s the hard truth: you can do everything right. You can have the right personality and be the most beautiful person in the world, absolutely perfect for that person, and they will probably still not choose you. It isn’t because you did something wrong or your skin is too dark or you’re too ugly or your hair’s too short, those things make you YOU. It’s because you just weren’t their choice. There’s nothing you could have done to change that choice, so you have to change your choice too. You have to get over that person because there will be so much pain and anger in you if you don’t that it could mentally destroy you. ”Just get over them” I know it’s not that easy. Believe me, I know you would if you could, but there’s nothing to hold on to. They might have the perfect smile or the cutest laugh, but they don’t offer you anything. Even though they might have been the air to your lungs when you have felt like drowning, but now they are the water filling your lungs until you can’t breath anymore. You just have to learn to swim. You might have no idea what you’re doing, but you have to learn. You have to learn how to swim because your life depends on it. You can do this too. If you’ve read this far, thank you.

A lot of this time alone has helped me greatly with self-reflection and getting back into old hobbies, but on the other hand, it's been awful for having too much time alone to re-open old wounds and overthink about people and problems that shouldn't be entering our minds. 

Between old fights with friends that weren't ever resolved, feeling guilty about things I once said or things I once handled poorly, wondering why relationships ended the way they did and much more, I need help finding peace from these things.

How does one find this peace? I've found myself acting out in ways I normally wouldn't (over texting for attention, wanting to start fights just to have something to resolve, feeling lonely and self-loathing), and just need to figure out a way to healthily handle these emotions and old wounds.

So, despite WHAT the wound is, I would love to hear ANY sort of advice on ways I can find peace within these ugly endings and move on once and for all from them.

758,"I want to preface this by saying that I am generally confident in the way I look and talk and am not really insecure about most things EXCEPT for my performance in bed. I mention this because it makes me believe that if I do have a insecurity, it is usually for good reason. And the reason in this case might be that I’ve never had a boyfriend or a long-term hook-up buddy and so I feel like I was never able to learn. 

I really don’t mind the whole casual sex culture because I feel like a significant other is hard to come by and I don’t want to not have fun until that happens. I still am a little picky because it takes a minute for them to grow on me and for me to be attracted enough to them to want to sleep with them. The problem is that most of the guys I have slept with have aggressively pursued me until the hookup and then vanished after we had sex a maximum of 3 times. I am a 100% sure that I never gave off the vibe that I wanted anything more than sex even on the third encounter so the fact that they don’t come back makes me think one of two things-

a) I was awful in bed. They always ‘finish’ but I know that isn’t saying much at all. And like I have stated above, given my lack of experience and learning opportunities, I have good reason to believe that this was the case. 

b) I always have to drink a little to be able to curb the anxiety that comes from hooking up with someone who I don’t know too well. This might be an irrational fear but when they don’t hit me up again, it makes me worry that I may have done something that would have made them uncomfortable or was against their wishes. It isn’t like I’m ever blackout drunk or anything but sometimes these hookups do happen after a long night out so I can’t say that I’m sober in those cases. “What if I was going down on them but ended up unintentionally hurting them and they tried to tell me, but I was not sober enough to listen? What if they didn’t want me to go down on them in the first place? What if I hurt them with my nails? What if I was being too aggressive in general and completely scarred them?” are questions I ask myself if they don’t contact me for another round/night. 

This usually makes me paranoid and I end up texting them saying something like “Hey! I just wanted to make sure that I didn’t do anything that may have made you uncomfortable the other night and wanted to apologize in case I did.” And it is only after they respond telling me that it is cool that I can breathe. 

As of now, I am paranoid again because this guy and I hooked up thrice. The second time he even suggested that we make it a constant hook up arrangement. But after the third time, he stopped hitting me up, and almost seemed like he actively avoided eye contact every time I saw him at a bar. So obviously insecurities (a) and (b) started to creep up on me pretty badly but I tried my best to brush it off instead of texting him. I was mostly alright until we matched on tinder again a couple of days ago. I was surprised that he swiped right and messaged him on there saying, “full circle huh?” but he never responded. I know for a fact that he is not having sex (esp. on a dead college campus) because he happened to match with two of my friends last week and tried to get them to come over (which they didn’t). But now I’m like “What could I have done that was so bad that he would rather not have sex at all than sleep with me again?”, “Was I THAT bad in bed?” (insecurity A) or “Did I do something scarring/awful/against his wishes?” (insecurity B). I know that a lot of times guys are probably just bored and want to chase someone new, but I feel like I am always the lowest common denominator in all these cases where no one lasts over 3 encounters and so it must be me that’s at fault. I am not sure how to address this, any help would be appreciated.",29Mar2020,1

763,"I’ve known him since we were 16 and in (separate) boarding schools. we started dating almost a year ago right before going to university (also separate). We wouldn’t get to talk too much when we were still in school because both our schools had a no private cell phones policy and once we started university, i noticed that he’d be distant and always annoyed for long periods of time, a month or so. I always ignored it and chalked it up to him having other work, stress/being tired and the significantly large time gap, and i’d forget about it or forgive him because he’d have these few days where he was insanely happy and excited about everything. Sometimes he would be extremely rude and say things that he knows i’m insecure or sensitive about though and it’s made me reconsider our relationship a few times. 
He just told me he has bipolar II disorder and he’s had it for five years, that’s the entire duration of our friendship/relationship. 
He insists that it isn’t a big deal and that’s he’s fine, but i have a lot of concerns. i need to mark out some boundaries with him now because i don’t want to ever overstep or nag him when he’s in a bad phase but at the same time i don’t know how much of his behaviour i can attribute to being part of his manic/depressive phases. Do i just forgive him for all the times he behaves rudely because he has an illness? Doesn’t this count as me pitying him- something that i absolutely don’t want to do.

764,"This has been on my mind since the quarantine started, and I’m not sure what to do.

I [19F] have been with my boyfriend [19M] for nearly a year now. We’ve been discussing the idea of me moving into his apartment, even before the virus, and I know I’d be more than welcome to live with him during quarantine. Admittedly, I had gone to see him even when the lockdown was in place, and I felt so guilty doing so. I’m worried that I could catch something and bring it home to my mom.

I still live with my mom in a condo, and I don’t know how she’d react if I told her I would like to quarantine with my boyfriend. She loves me very much and I just... feel like she gets sad when I’m not there? Like I’m her only constant source of company (besides our cat). She still continues to see her boyfriend each week, but still. I’m the last of her kids to live at home and I feel that she would be hurt if I chose to temporarily live with my bf. I feel torn. 

I don’t want it to come off like I prioritize my boyfriend and I’s relationship more than that of mine and my mom’s, but I feel like staying away from him for weeks at a time will be difficult and terribly tempting. I think our strongest love language is touch and being with each other physically, and to not have that would take a toll on both of us. He recently lost a close family member and had to suddenly move into his own apartment. He’s still going through it emotionally and mentally, and needs me right now more than ever. He’s expressed that to me. 

I don’t think I would be officially moving in with him, but at least until the quarantine is over? I could possibly visit my mom every week (while maintaining a distance), maybe FaceTime her a lot too? I just feel like I need to choose one or the other at this point.

How can I approach the situation without looking so sneaky? Is he hiding something bigger here? I would hate to know that he’s hiding something. What would you do?

774,"  I have a group of friends that I hang out with pretty often. My one close friend in the group had gotten out of a bad relationship, which we’re all really proud of him for. It went on for so long and he finally said fuck it and left her. He ended up getting into a relationship with a girl in our group. His girlfriend has also had her fair share of awful relationships. We’re all very excited for them because they both finally seem happy after so long. 

  The only issue is that when we all hang out as a group, they’re all over each other. Like holding hands and doing stuff like that is one thing, but they literally act like they’re by themselves. For example, the other day when I was driving with 5 of us in the car, they were full on making out in the back seat. Like I looked into my rear view mirror and they were just straight up making out. I was trying to not look but sometimes you need to when driving, obviously. It lasted for like 10 minutes and I’m honestly surprised that they didn’t evolve into something else. Also, when we’re all together in someone’s room, (regardless of whose room it is) they literally will get into bed together, like as if they’re going to go to sleep, and just kind of separate themselves from the rest of the us. Like it wouldn’t be any different if we were there or not, and it leaves the rest of us there feeling awkward as hell. Just recently when we were all together, the two of them were talking about their sex lives with each other will all of us around. They were trying to stay quiet, but we all heard it anyway and everyone was super uncomfortable. These are just a few examples that come to mind. At first we assumed that it was the honeymoon phase between the two, but it’s been like this for so long and it’s clear that that’s just how they prefer to show affection. 

  All of us hanging out together has never been awkward or uncomfortable until now, and my one friend and myself have both agreed that it’s beginning to become unenjoyable. We don’t know how to approach the situation. We understand that talking to them about it is a good idea, but how do we start?

775,"I work at the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician and have been working there since January and this one person, we’ll call them Z, also started working there around the same exact time.

We get along extremely well and we’re both goofy and we make fun of each other and work is just really fun because of Z. 

We hung out before outside of work and we kissed each other that night and my heart was racing so fast and I felt something I’ve never felt before. We didn’t do anything else. It was just a nice, romantic kiss. Z told me they wanted to just be friends and apologized for kissing me (which is 100% find bc it was a mutual thing we both went for it). 

Anyway, long story short, Z is happily with a beautiful person (X) and they actually look so fucking good together I don’t even want to be with Z anymore because Z just looks extremely happy. The way Zs eyes glow whenever something comes up about X or my other coworkers ask about X. 

Z has been so good to me since they’ve been in a relationship. Nothing’s changed. Z’s still the same with me (minus the flirtatious part obviously - Z’s faithful time X). It’s lovely to see.

I think this would be good since I don’t have to see Z and i can completely get them away from my head. I know nobody’s perfect but Z is. I know it’ll take me a long time to get over Z but this is me distancing myself from someone I really want but know I can’t have. I think it’s the best.  

I know i’m posting under advice but i’m just venting and i really hope no one has or is currently going through this because it fucking hearts so bad, it’s all i ever think about, but just posting here in case someone has any advice for me",29Mar2020,1

**PSA:**  I get that this is very long, but if you want to talk to me, and help  me I'd really appreciate if you read the whole thing (including the  previous post I've linked below).

If you want some background, I made a long post previously, which you can read [HERE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/egvv6b/for_the_first_time_in_my_life_ive_m22_been_dating/)

**What's happened?**

When   we started dating last November, it was clear from the start that we   both live very busy lives and probably wouldn't be able to meet that   often. On average, after the change of the year, we had time to meet   once or twice a month. You might think that you would be able to make   time if you really wanted, but with us often physically being in   different parts of the country because of school, that just wasn't   feasible. Additionally, earlier this year I was quite exhausted because   of stuff going on at work and didn't really have the energy. She also   started at a new school and that took (and still takes) a huge toll on   her. This is going to play a big part in this story.

Meeting   so rarely, and us both being quite shy, inexperienced, and awkward   meant that our ""relationship"" developed quite slowly. I was, and still   am, deadly scared of escalating. I never got the courage to kiss her,   although starting at some point I really wanted to. I usually take some   time to warm up to new people and it became very apparent here.

**Last Date**

So   our last date, which was couple of weeks ago was very spontaneous. We   both had messed up sleep schedules and were awake and bored so I   suggested we go drive somewhere. So we ended up driving for like three   hours. It was fun, we drove to places, ate at McDonalds,  walked around,   and talked a lot like we usually do. But as always, I was too   frightened to do anything except talk. I feel that was **the** chance and I blew it.

**Afterwards**

At   this point I was becoming very bothered about our thing not going   anywhere. I feared I had lost my chance. We still kept chatting daily   like we have done since November and seemingly nothing had really   changed, but I felt like something needed to happen.

Few   days ago, after we conveniently got to talk about relationships of   other people I decided to take a huge risk, and messaged her, ""I think   we should talk about our thing and where we see it going"".

After 15 minutes she responded, with a long message. I'll not write the entire thing here, but here are the main point.

* She's   not quite sure either. She knows how school has eaten up her entire   life. She's aware hasn't been able to give enough of her time to her   closest family and friends, let alone me.
* Because of this situation she is not sure if she can be in a more serious relationship.
* She feels that because we haven't been able to meet more often, we don't know each other well enough yet.
* She said she will needs to take some time and think about this more.

This   was two days ago. I responded to her right after, clearing up my own   thoughts and telling her to take all the time she needs. We haven't   talked since.

So at this point I'm   fully prepared for the worst. Some people have told me there could   still be some hope, but I'm reading her message as a soft *no.*

**My thoughts**

I   feel stupid. We never had a serious ""relationship"" but it still feels   very much like a breakup. I'm heartbroken. I guess I shouldn't feel  this  way, but she has been a part of my daily life since November so I  can't  help it. Despite not seeing often, we talked a lot daily.  Snapchat  showed us with a streak of 137 days of constant messaging and  we were  each other's nr.1 BF throughout. These five months have been  some of the  best in my life. She made me feel that at least someone  cares a little  bit about me. I have friends, of course, but it's not  the same.

Right  now I guess the  advice would be to just get back to Tinder and move on,  but I don't  think I can. I don't want to move on. She's not the type to  ghost, so I  expect that one of these days, after she's thought about  it, she'll  hit me with the final message.

There's  one more part to this story. It's not really relevant, but I want to   share it. Yesterday night I was sitting at the shore of nearby lake,   trying to calm down, clear my thoughts and, I'll admit, cry a bit. She   lives near the other side of the lake. As I was sitting there, I checked   my snapchat and saw that she had posted a story. It was just a dark   landscape from the other side of the lake. She had also come to the   lake, and was on the other shore. I know she goes there when she needs   to calm down and think (she's told me this), so I am kinda assuming she   was thinking about the same things as I was. For some reason I burst   into tears when I saw the story. What a crazy coincidence.

Anyways,   I'm now trying to stay occupied because whenever I'm alone and in   silence, my thoughts consume me. I'm constantly tearing up if I think  about her. I know this kind of overly attached behaviour can be part of   the reason why our thing ended, but I can't help it. I'm an emotional   person. I've been trying talk with my friends as much as I can, but I  find that most of the time I'm just too sad, so I end up sitting in  Discord, listening to everyone else talk while I'm silent.

Like  previously, I'm writing this partially to myself in order to help me  get a grasp on the situation, however advice is still very much  appreciated. Thanks.",29Mar2020,1
778,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. For context, everyone involved is 18 or 19 and still lives at home with their parents.

Two of my friends have the “Fuck the government, they have no right to tell me what to do” mindset, and are refusing to follow the shelter-in-place order. They keep pressuring the rest of our friend group to violate it so we can hang out. 

Nothing me, nor anything the rest of our friend group has said to them has changed their mindset. Several of us have at-risk relatives/work with at-risk people. Whenever we bring up the fact that breaking quarantine endangers those people, they just say shit like “well you’re entitled to your opinions and we’re entitled to ours”.

We’re at our wits end with these two and neither me nor my other friends have any idea what we can do to get them to cooperate with the quarantine. How can we convince them to change their mind?",29Mar2020,1
779,"A little backstory- I’m a university student and I’m part of an high profile organization on my campus. Ever since I joined a few years ago, I’ve wanted to be apart of the organization’s administration, but never had the chance until now. Unfortunately, the elections are basically a popularity contest. For the position I am hoping to get, I’m running against another person who is older than me. I know basically everyone in the organization, this person knows everybody. We have the same friends in this org, but 99% of those friends are closer to this person because they have formed an actual group that I’m not a part of. So I know that I stand no chance against this person. Technically there’s a speech we have to write, but I’ve heard it doesn’t help if the odds are already against you. I don’t want to withdraw my bid because I’m not trying to be a sore loser.
I’m just upset because I’ve always wanted this position since I’ve joined. The organization has done so much to help me and it would be an honor to help lead it and provide this experience to others, meanwhile this person is just running on a whim and the election is theirs. I’ve accepted that fact, I’m not trying to be whiny, just explaining the situation. I know that when the day comes where I lose it will make me incredibly upset at everything, and I just want to cushion the blow. Does anyone have any advice for that? It’d be much appreciated.

Tl:dr; I have a slim chance of winning a position I’ve always wanted and I would like to know the best ways to prepare for disappointment.",29Mar2020,2

It works fine in over the counter transactions in normal businesses, but as soon as I try using it online, it seizes to function.

783,"  U.S. 

I was recently involved in a motor vehicle accident with my car and another person’s motorcycle. The motorcyclist hit the back of my car after I slowed down to avoid a head on collision. The head on collision would have been the result of a vehicle in the opposite lane attempting to pass a bicyclist on a double lined road. When the car entered my lane, I slowed down to avoid the head on collision. The motorcyclist hit the back of me because he was tailgating me for over a mile. I slowed down and came to a stop. The motorcyclist told the police officer that he came around the corner and I was stopped in the road. The police officer gave me a warning and told me that I should not have been stopped in the road. 

I have footage of my accident that was not present at the scene due to me having to track it down from the bicyclist at the scene. The footage clearly shows my side of the story. I also have a witness to prove my story. My actual question is in regards to a suspicion that I may have. I need to preface the question with more backstory. The motorcyclist had a police sticker on his license plate and called a friend after the accident took place. I have reason to believe that the police officer and the motorcyclist colluded. The officer gave me a warning because he said it would not be nice if he gave me a ticket. I believe that he didn’t give me a ticket because he knew that a judge would never say that the person rear-ended was at fault. My car is going to cost $1,000 to fix so I am asking myself if it is worth the trouble of potentially being targeted by the police for petty or imaginary infractions. 

Should I just absorb the cost and let this go?",29Mar2020,1

I took up some hobbies that were helping my self worth. At my new school I was getting out of my classes quick. They told me that at the rate I was going I could graduate early. I also spent a lot of time at the gym. I started seeing great results. Was at 200 pounds now I’m at 170.

785,"(Trigger Warning &amp; NSFW) I don't know but I think that I'll be able to feel better if I talk about it. This might be a really long rant as there is no direct question, but any advice is useful. Currently I am 16f, but at the time of the story I was still 15. I apologize for all my grammar and spelling mistakes.

In November, my boyfriend (who I will call A) and I broke up due to distance and him developing a crush on a girl in class, but we are still friends. A week or two later it was December and my friend (who I will call L) in my new school kept trying to flirt with me so I decided to try a date with him. A supported this but still acted funny.

L and I were supposed to go to the movies, but he had to take his dogs out into the backyard first and then we realized we would be late so we just stayed at his place. He did try touching me and asked me to touch him but I said no. He is a very nice person and he hadn't dated someone in a while so I was like okay he is just a horny teenage boy that is normal and I just went along with this stuff.

Then we hang out again. He continues to touch me and stuff and it is a little weird and he wants me to touch him. I say that I don't really want to and I'd rather just talk because we had only known eachother for less than a month or two. He gets all upset and is like, ""I know but I just haven't dated someone in a year. I really like you a lot. I'm sorry for being weird"" and I'm like no bro you good. Then he tries doing it again and this time he is like but it will make me happy. I start feeling like I'm the bad guy and am overreacting so I'm like okay fine and I touch his thing but I was about to cry the whole time. Later that day he tried fingering me even though I told him I didn't want to either. L also kept grinding against me, trying to put his thumb in my mouth, and he held my neck unexpectedly which was really scary. Another thing was how once, when giving him a handjob, he tried pushing my head down onto his thing and it was really scary.

The next time we hung out, I decided that I wanted to break up with him. I got home and he texted me that now that we broke up, he wants to kill himself and saying be wouldn't do it again. I was worried L would because I know he self-harmed when he was younger, so we started dating again. He continued trying to grind against me and hold me but I was too uncomfortabl and I was miserable. A was helping me out the whole time and telling me to break up with him, which I did eventually do. He threatened to harm himself (which he didn't) and we just stayed friends from there. I barely talk to him now luckily.

Now after a little bit, A and I started dating again. It was kind of going on during the second time I dated L, but not really. A started to blame himself for me dating L because he encouraged it at first and kept thinking that it was his fault everything happened to me, which I assured him it was not. A and I did stuff overcalls sometimes. A eventually told me that when he sees me, he can only think about L touching me. A thought that I enjoyed what happened with L. A feels as if I cheated on him even though we were broken up and we had broken up because he wanted to date somebody else.

This whole time I had felt really disgusted with my body and barely wanted to look at myself sometimes and I still kept thinking about what had happened and when A told me this, I felt really disgusting and horrible. Eventually A talked to one of our friends and he started feeling better, but I still feel gross. I can't talk to anybody about this because my mom says she doesn't blame L because he is a teenage boy and that is what they do, my older sister only tells me to fight L which I obviously cannot do because L is twice my size, my older brother said that I was playing with L's feelings, and my friends just said you shouldn't have dated L or that they knew he was weird.

A and I broke up again, and were still friends. He still kept making sexual comments and stuff like that and now we are basically dating just without the title. Throughout this little dating not dating thing he kept saying stuff about how he liked the girl on his class still and it made me feel bad about myself, yet still expected that I wanted to send him nudes. A doesn't talk about hee anymore, but everytime he mentions a girl he talks to or doesn't say the name of the friend he is talking about I instantly get suspicious and I really don't want to be that jealous gf type of person.

I still love A and we want to move into an apartment together after highschool, but I really hate how I feel like my body isn't worth anything more than sex at this point. It makes me feel really bad. A is a little insecure and everytime I tell him I don't feel like doing stuff in call, he acts like I don't love him anymore and gets upset and doesn't want to talk. Sometimes I do want to do stuff and other times I don't and I don't know how to tell him this. I keep doing stuff in calls with him because I feel like he'll stop loving me if I don't do it.

I know all the comments are going to be like break up with A and long distance doesn't work out and stuff like that, but I'm not going to do that. I'd rather work it out with him. We started dating october 2018 and I really want to make things last with him. He is my bestfriend and I don't want to lose him. I'm just really angry and disgusted with myself. I don't blame L or A or anyone really and I honestly have forgiven L for what happened. I just wish I didn't feel so disgusted with my body.

I also realize I have some sort of trauma associated with what happened with L too. I sometimes think about it without wanting to and it makes me feel horrible. Also for a while after what happened with L, I felt scared and uncomfortable everytime someone stood behind me which was very difficult to prevent in a public highschool. A and I discussed recently if we'd ever want to try something with eachother and I'm now realizing that, due to what happened, I am now fantasizing rape and choking and it makes me feel disgusting and I don't want to do that and I don't like that I get turned on by that type of stuff and I feel like a disgusting person and I don't know what to do.

I think I just want to feel better about myself and forget everything that happened, but it is just really hard.",29Mar2020,1

787,"So, I've never posted on Reddit up until now, so I'm not entirely sure of what I'm doing. All I know is that I need some advice as to what to do. 

I'm a kid and don't have my own laptop to play Sims 4, so I borrow my dad's laptop to play it instead. Per usual, I sit down on my couch and hop onto the computer to play Sims. I boot it up, and upon powering up, an email comes up. I'm not always nosy, but the title of this piqued my curiosity. I know it isn't my business or place to go around snooping in my parent's email, but I couldn't just not click on this one.

*Please Read! (insert red lips/kiss emoji here) Thanks*

Even now I don't know what it is about the title that got me thinking. I'm looking at the screenshot now, and I feel sick to my stomach just reading it. Now, maybe it isn't considered an affair due to the contents of the message, but I'm only throwing that word around because it's all I know to describe it. This is the first I'm hearing of my dad with any other woman besides my mother, so I'm unsure if he'd talked to this woman before or personally knows her. I don't even know if he's seen women while in the company of my mom prior to this. Anyway, I'll post the quoted text here, as I can't seem to transfer the image from my phone to here. 

*""Let me see if I get this straight, I live like 10 minutes from you and you're that busy that we can't meet for lunch or dinner? Hmm listen hun I'm not really one of those girls that would just go after guys for looks or what not. So lets get that straight. Ok so I've sent you over some of the pics that you wanted and I expect some in return and get back to me. I have to get going for now!*

*Sincerely, (insert woman's name that I won't disclose).""*

Attached to the message were seven links to various photos. I already had knowledge of what was going on here at this point, so I clicked on the image. It led to some hookup site I've never heard of, and of course, the woman's nude photo. I immediately clicked off. It's impossible this woman sent the email by accident. The website was automatically signed into his account, and the email was sent to specifically him. There's no way she could've accidentally emailed this message to an email. You don't mistype an email as unique as such. 

It sickens me to know that my dad could do this to my mother. She's the only one working in the house, and she tries so hard to provide for us. It disgusts me. I understand that he has medical issues that would prevent him from working a job, but it doesn't give him the right to laze around and criticize my mom. Whenever he would complain to me about her ""nagging"" in the past, I'd just laugh. I initially took it as a joke. They've had fights before, and at the moment everything's pretty calm. While my hands do shake as I write all of this, I am still managing to keep my cool with this whole thing. I believe the only reason for that is because I anticipated this. I had joked about how my dad would probably end up cheating on my mom in the past, with the way he used to fight and nitpick my mother. 

I can't even begin to stomach the idea of telling my mom myself. I wish I had the confidence to confront him over it. Punch him in the face and tell him what he's doing is wrong. My mom is such a good person. She grew up in a bad home, and from what I've seen she hasn't committed a single wrongdoing in her life. If I can't tell them myself, what am I supposed to do? I feel like I should say something but I just can't bring it upon myself to do something. Please help, thank you.",29Mar2020,1
788,"First of all. Im sorry for bad spelling and/or gramar. Im Swedish.

So during my childhood i never really had anny friends. I moastly wonderd around and jumped in and out different groups. This was the case until around the age of 13/14. i kinda found a group of ""friends"" or atleast some people that i talked to during the brakes and hung out with somethimes after school. (Im a guy, and they all where girls, i should add.)
However, i never really truly fellt like a part of that group. (mabye becouse i was the only guy?) I didn't feel like a natruall part of the group, and a few of them i barley knew... we where simply ""in the same group"".

I then began highschool (gymnasiet in swedish. The system is a bit different) i was 16. In the beginning,  everyone where interested in etchother and i talked to a lot of people. I am not in anny way shy, and i know i have basic sociall manners. I dont think i said annything rude or wrong. 
Annyways, time went on. Groups started forming, and i was kinda left out. I heard about parties and planns, but where never asked to come. Me, and like five others where in this situation. We kinda hung out a bit, but they aren't really my type of people.
I have spent time with the other ""groups"" and i feel like im fitting in well. I get the lingo, the converations are interesting. i feel like im contributing. They laugh at my jokes e.t.c.
But i never become a part of this group. I never become someones friend. i never get asked if i want to come to that party or hang out with someone, and i don't really feel like asking. i feel like i don't really know what they think of me, and i dont whant to be to ""pushy"". I just got sick of constantly thinking about what people tought about me, or how i chould become friends with different people, so i kinda stopped trying. i talk to people if they talk to me. im nice in genneral, but i won't try to ""make a move"". After 11 years of trying, thinking, annalyzing. I have given up.

I have joined a political party, i have joined a drama class, even a facebook-group. It's allways the same. we have a good time, but never annything more. In a group of people, im never annyones ""no1"". (Main man as rainman whould have said ;)) I never become a natruall part of a group or of someones life. I have never felt secure in a friendship. Im good at bonding, but bad at making friends. 

I truly beleve, and im hoping, that im not annoying/rude/socially incompetent as an person. And a psycologist that i've talked to agrees. (And my parents if that whould ever count.)
I don't know what to do, or what i am doing wrong. 
I don't know if this feeling of not being needed, expected or wanted is just a feeling that i have, or if it's reallity.

Im tierd of the alternatives of eather being alone, or with my boring ass family. Im turning 19 soon and i really want a good social life when i go to college in about 6months. (The swedish version i mean)

If you read all this! thx! you deserve all the carma in the world. What do you think of my situation? What should i think about when i go to college and meets new people?

792,"For a while now, I had a difficult time dealing with my anxiety and depression. And whether or not my job had caused my anxiety/depression to be harder for me to deal with, I’m not sure. It came to the point that I had personally talked to my manager about my situation, and she agreed to have me off the schedule for two weeks, so long as I come back afterwards. Now, at the end of those two weeks, my personal situation hasn’t improved and I just felt that it would be necessary for me to immediately resign. Whether or not that was the right thing for me to do, I typed up a resignation letter of my immediate resignation, effective on the 16th of March. 

Now, I’m already dealing with some regret. I regret having promised the manager who I initially talked to, that I would return back to work in two weeks. I also regret that I didn’t have the confidence to turn in the letter myself. I don’t want to go into much detail, but you see, prior to the weeks leading up to this, every time I would go into work, I would be driving there and 5 minutes to my destination, I would either cry or be overwhelmed with something that I just couldn’t physically bring myself to even get out of my car and go to work. I couldn’t really figure out what it was that was causing me to have such a reaction to going to work but it would occur ever so often. Therefore, when it came time to either call or go in with my letter of resignation, I just couldn’t. So, I had someone turn it in for me.

I know I should have turned it in myself or called, but I just couldn’t. 

So, that was on the 16th of March. I’ve already put it all behind me and was wanting to move on. I didn’t get a call from my job or anything, so I figured that it was said and done. I had one of my co-worker(s) tell me that she saw the letter of my resignation on one of the manager’s desk, so then I figured, “okay, they got the message, I can move on now.” 
 
However, 3 days later is when the company decided to close for two weeks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the managers had called to inform me and went over the details... saying that I would still have my benefits and whatnot. Now, me knowing that I had resigned, and that I wasn’t really expecting any more communication from them, I was confused. But, I didn’t exactly tell my manager that I had a letter turned in for my immediate resignation because I didn’t want to talk about it, and I figured that she would have known about it. 

Well, that manager that initially called me, had also called me recently on Tuesday, but because I didn’t recognize her personal phone number, I didn’t answer, and she left me a voicemail that I had only checked a few minutes ago. 

Since they didn’t call me about my letter, should I just assume that they didn’t get the message. Or the fact that I didn’t give it to them myself... 

I’m not sure how to deal with this. I don’t want to think about it. But I know eventually I will have to. I guess my question would be, should I just text my manager at her personal number saying that I had turned in my letter of resignation?

If anything, I’d rather avoid calling anyone and speaking on the phone with them. 

I realize that it is just company policy to inform associates of the situation, and that I’m still likely on the list, but in regards to my resignation, I’m not sure if they got the message, as I figured that a letter would be sufficient enough.",29Mar2020,1
795,"So essentially to put it into context, my roommate kell has bad depression. And so she has a high tendency to mope about eveeeerything. I try to helo her but most of the day she just complains and beats herself up over everything. 

For example, she used to point out each time id eat stuff that was sugary cus she had a health business and then give me a look. or shed complain to me about my brother (they used to date). Whenever we eat she'll audibly go YUMMM MMM MM like loud enough thag u can hear it upstairs and then if u dont acknowledge her shell say ""i know im being dramatic"". One last example is shell constanyly say she wants to be cleaner, and then say how she wants it done, then get real bossy about it but not do it herself. Last year I bought a foot rest for the living room and i had my feet on it and she went ""feet off!"" when she never even bought it. And the other day she blamed the communities tap water saying it causes her depression and that shell sue. That type of thing was common. Now I've always been a super passive person but lately I've kind of felt at the end of my rope with this stuff. I feel like im just living in her house, not were both living in OUR house.

 I cant tell if ive been a jerk with my responses but like lately if she complains over and over about decisions shes making and stuff ill just straight up go ""kell its your decision, i cant make it for you"". and shell be like okay sorry i talk about it so much and shut down and ill feel really bad because i dont wanna hurt her feelings. Or like when she was making audible noises from the food and then commented because I didnt acknowledge it, i just was like ""hey so im gonna go upstairs and i made a joke about how it kinda sounded like sex noises"", I realize that joke probably was too much but I dont know what else to equate it too. When she mentioned that she wanted to contact our housing and threaten to sue them i just texted back ""lol"" and then she said more about it and i was like hey go for it. I just dont really know how to process all this and its stressing me out and I dont wanna come off like an ass but im getting drained and starting to lose my empathy towards her.",29Mar2020,1

I was asked why and I said that he was accusing me of things and he also threatened to spank me (one of the many things he told me during work). We both got pulled into the office.

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade which she starts next year, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls



This class  gives boys an easy avenue tonkeerbul and harass girls. In the water they can easily grab them and make comments about their physical attributes",29Mar2020,0
799,"Okay so I know this sounds dumb. It's quarantine and all and my friend just texted me saying she and her mom are getting into bread making. For easter my mom always makes like 20 pounds of tsoureki, or greek easter bread, bc we're greek orthodox. she can only get the ingredients at this middle eastern market like an hour away from us but the bread is amazing. Its a long standing tradition of ours (as it is with many other greeks) and the recipe is my great grandmother's yada yada yada. So yeah she normally makes like 15 loaves and gives them to friends and family and this past easter we gave some to my friend (whose not greek), and she just texted me asking for the recipe. Now, I thought it was awesome that she wanted the recipe and asked my mom if I could give it to her, and my mom, who is literally the most gracious (and mature, if that makes sense) person I know, was kinda like ""well....its kind of our family recipe..."" I was kinda shocked bc its really unlike my mom to say no to a friend who asks for something especially when its as basic as bread but idk. she also said that the ingredients are hard to find and she would be happy to give them some, but she's saving them for easter. its also a bit wack because there is a religious aspect to the bread and its not meant to be made before easter....idk my mom is making this more complicated than it needs to be.

ANYWAY sorry im rambling if youre still reading this: ok so my mom then was like ""well actually yeah they can have the recipe as long as they don't give it to other people especially greeks because greeks can be gatekeepers (like my mom ironically) and its would be weird for them to receive tsoureki from a non greek so how do I politely tell my friend over text that she can have the recipe as long as she doesn't give the bread out to others?

800,"I've slowly started to deeply dislike a friend of mine. I think he is quite arrogant, lazy, selfish, and insincere. He often offers unsolicited advice on how to live my life. He is also clingy to the point of being suffocating. 

I feel bad because he is not self-aware and lacks social skills. A lot of our classmates also do not like him but he doesn't realize it. He annoyed me in the past but I tolerated it because I thought he was a nice person. However, recently he did something that was very bothersome and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I don't want to resolve any of these issues with him, I just want to end the friendship because I dread our interactions.

801,"This question may sound quite silly to most, but for some context I've grown up around domestically abusive relationships my entire life. I am just now realizing how horrible some of the situations were, and how not everyone goes through this. For a very long time I thought seeing your mom get hit was normal, I would dissociate myself the situation and continue on with what I was doing in order to block out the things I would see and hear, and couldnt imagine a life where my parents were together and had a loving relationship. So upon hearing ""Everyone feels bad for you, no one in our family has to go through this stuff."" From my cousin sent me into a very confusing spiral. Thus my question; Is yelling in an intimidating way at a child or humiliating them in public a viable form of discipline? My mom has done this the majority of my life, she would purposefully yell at me in front of my friends or especially in public. And when I say yell I mean scream bloody murder, and of course I wouldnt do what she yelled at me about again, so I guessed it worked in a sense. She does this to my little sisters very often as well, they're toddler age and have been acting up recently because of being stuck inside, so she will scream at them as loud as possible.

I am 23, graduated in 2019, and purchased my own home in October. I work full time as an RN and have since August of 2019. My mom thinks that she should claim me as a dependent, and I lived at home for 10 months of 2019. She did not pay for my college though. I'm worried if she claims me as a dependent, I won't get my stimulus check. And I fit into the category that needs it the most since I only make roughly 50k annually and am on the front lines fighting COVID 19. Would it be worth it to not file as a dependent to get the stimulus check? Or will my mom get more of a tax break than $1200 for me?

809,"First tried posting in the prepping subreddit but for some reason was denied...

The people in my potential group would be: Me, my wife, our two sons ages 4 years and 1 year; my parents, both in their early 70s; and my best friend, along with his wife and their two daughters, ages 13 years and 8 years. My, my friend and our wives are all in our early 40s.

We've talked over time, especially in the last couple weeks, and if nothing else, are all in agreement we'd want to be together in a ""SHTF"" scenario, which frankly I think may be on the horizon, even if it's on a small scale. The issue is right now we're all totally unprepared and not sure what to do. Most of the supplies that pop into my mind are already sold out, so I’m really kicking myself for never doing something before now. My wife is the most against this whole thing out of everyone. She thinks I’m overreacting, all the “prepper” stuff is dumb, it won’t ever get worse than it is now...she now refuses to even participate in the conversation. I can’t force her to change her mind, but all of the prepping is on me as a result.

As you can imagine, I’m clueless and have some questions.

1, What do you do when your family is spread out? I'm trying to paint the picture here without giving away too much info, so I hope you can all follow. My parents live 130 miles south of me, my best friend lives 30 miles east of me. So as for how we’d all wind up together, especially in a situation where there may be panic or road congestion...I really don’t know what to do here. There’s a location for us all to go, my own property, but it doesn’t seem prudent or safe for us all to travel there separately, especially my parents.

2, Am I wrong to be concerned that my group will mainly be composed of elderly people and small children? It’s not like I’m about to boot them out of the plan or anything, I just don’t really know how to prepare for that. My parents aren’t just old, they’re stubborn, and fairly frail - my mom has pretty severe arthritis and my dad has COPD. Neither one of them is really gung-ho for all this “prepper stuff”, but has grudgingly agreed to stockpile some basics and accept anything I send to the house - so far it hasn’t been much, mostly just very basic supplies most people in the midwest have during storm season anyway - bottled water, lantern, batteries, first aid kit, etc. I don’t know what to do for them in terms of long-term preparation and supplies, same with the kids. My best friend and his wife have already been stockpiling for their kids, but they’ve got it easy with an 8 year old and 13 year old...mine are so young, small, and vulnerable, it’s a terrifying thought.

3, What are some other things to consider? I’ve thought about location, food, water, medical supplies, but I know there’s a lot more to it and my thoughts stop there.",29Mar2020,1
810,"Here is some important background information: My sister (30F) has always been very problematic in the family. She hasn’t always lived with us ( me, mom &amp; dad) but we’re literally always there to take her in when she needs it. We don’t make her pay rent, we just tell her to save up to get her own place. Literally every time she screws up, we’re there to fix her mess. My parents help her so much financially, including my dad paying for her DUI classes after she got a DUI a few summers ago, mom helping pay for the DUI ticket, driving her hours away for court appointments, dad buying her a car ( more than twice, because she’s crashed the cars multiple times from drinking and driving. ) so she wouldn’t have to take the bus, and myself recently paying for a 7 day detox program for her ($7,000 out of my savings)

Despite us doing our best to help her get on the right track, all of the decisions she continues to make in her life are the wrong ones. As much as we talk to her with love and try to make her understand how to make better choices, she is rude, dismissive, and extremely aggressive towards all of us. She has never said thank you for anything we’ve done for her. 

I recently told my parents that we are doing way too much for her and she constantly uses us as a backup because she knows that whenever she does something stupid, we’re there to fix the mess. We are all trying to help her but she makes it extremely difficult to be helped. A couple days ago she went to go “live” with a friend who has helped people going through recovery in the past. Well she only lasted 2 days before this friend ( friend of hers for 15+ years) calls me crying asking me to pick her up because she is rude, aggressive, and straight up disrespectful in the household. Again, my parents took her back in. My dad told her that she was only going to stay with us if she complied with our house rules...

So, this is where the story happens. Last night she asked my mom and I for money, she wouldn’t tell us what she needed the money for so we didn’t give it to her. Btw, Our household is social distancing right now so we told her not to go anywhere because of the corona. She straight up doesn’t care about putting us, other people, and herself in danger and brushes us off completely. After we wouldn’t give her money and kept telling her not to go anywhere, she threw a huge fit and left. She stayed over night and returned a few hours ago, without telling us where she went. My parents and I all were asking her where she went and she kept saying she was a “ grown woman and didn’t need to tell us.” We kept telling her that she CANT go anywhere because of the corona, that we are all staying inside, not just her. She screams at us and tells us to leave her alone. 

At this point, I’m completely done. I can’t stand having her here not only because of her rude attitude, but because she is now putting all of us at risk for this illness and straight up doesn’t care. Under these circumstances, is it wrong to kick her out ?? My parents have Christian values and I think they feel like this would be morally wrong but at this point, what other choice do we have ?",29Mar2020,2

I'll just get straight to it. There is a sock I ejaculated into in one of my drawers in my room and it has been there for years. I developed germophobia a few years ago and have avoided opening it because I don't want to touch anything that the sock has touched in that drawer and I don't want the dust that has touched the sock to come out. Well my germophobia has come back recently and I realised my parents had been opening and closing that drawer for years (don't worry they didn't touch the sock, they just throw socks and underwear in there and close it without putting their hands in the drawer) and now I'm afraid to go in my room, touch anything that my parents have touched around the house (because they might have put their hands in the drawer while placing clothing in there and their hand might of touched the sock), and I think the dust has exited the drawer and gone all over my room and around the house so I can't touch anything in the house without washing my hands after and keeping my hands in my pockets, I feel like the dry cum flakes and dust are everywhere basically even on my clothes and in my gaming PC where the fans take air in and there is dust under my keyboard and literally everything in this house disgusts me now.

Now I'm posting this here because I'm going insane in this house and it's destroying my life and I can't go to therapy because I need scientific answers to satisfy me. Is there any scientific answers to help me stop my fear of this? I feel trapped in my life and can't escape.

This was back in Friday, I submitted my application and like 3 hours later, I got the confirmation email. I didn't think much about the delay, but I was supposed to complete an assessment online, I got the email Saturday night around 11 pm, and I completed the assessment around 1:00 a.m., immediately I got an email saying that it was pending to be reviewed.

What set me off, is the fact that my assessment got approved at around 3:45 in the morning? Anyway, after completing my assessment and being approved, I got an email this morning with a form, I had to give em my info, like my address, and a payment of $26.49 for something on the quiz that says ""Cal-Pro Certification Membership ( $ 26.49 for each month )"". When I saw that, I got really suspicious, and started googling the company name. So far I can't find anything, so I decided to investigate a little bit more....

When I was checking the emails, I noticed that they're written kinda poorly, there's this paragraph that reads: (straight copy and paste from the email)

*  Once you take your test we assessment we manually review your submission upon further approval. If approved you are legible for Cal-Pro membership. 
* Membership grants you contractor access as a Cal-Pro member. Covers your software Login and account, and covers the Android work phone we disperse to you.

[This is a screenshot of the email, where it shows that I was approved.](https://i.imgur.com/bDIX9Wy.png) The strange wording in the email reminds me to those Tech Support Indian Scammers youtube videos, so I decided to do a reverse search on google of the picture on the email [and, voila!](https://i.imgur.com/Dx8d76T.png)

I don't know for sure tho, [this is the link of the form](https://cdn.jotfor.ms/CalPro/lb-gigs) I was supposed to fill out, and it requires a payment... I already tried to enter fake info and it declined the transaction... so I have to pay. Is a very basic form, which is hosted on jotform(dot)com which is a free online form maker, which can be used to receive payments and donations as well.. 

According to the emails, I have to pay the membership (a monthly fee btw) in order to get ""a company phone to register our calls"" and access to InterGuard Software which, googling it is a governor software to control and log employees computers.

Relatives are in town. Meaning I have to deal with some bad criticism. 

Something I’m really not used to. See when I was 12 I entered college. Everyone called me “gifted” “one of a kind” all this. And my relatives were always asking how my schooling and everything is. 

I ended up graduating college at 17. And began preparing for med school. Took the entrance exam... and horrible score. Never told anyone as I was too embarrassed. 

So I began to re study. I also got a part time job at a lab and was dedicated to study. Worked hard and took the exam a year later.... and bombed it again. Super embarrassing as this time I had to tell everyone who asked as there was no hiding it. 

My brother then adviced me to start my MPH online from a good uni as I study again. I always wanted an mph and was going to wait till after med school but I decided to just apply for it. I got in to a really fine school and so far it’s been going great. It’s opened a door for me into a passion of research. In fact I even got published which is really special. 

Now my immediate family has no problem with my attempts. They are supportive and are the best.

He said “sorry but that’s sad bro” I kinda got personal with him and made fun of him. It turned into a big argument and my brother heard. He tried to mediate things but then it just got out of control. 

Soon my cousin told all his family and they looked at me and began questioning me for it all. I told them all to mind their own business and I’m still doing great things. I told them all how I’m 20 and in a masters program and how none of them were doing that.

It started as he was telling me that I should not spread 'non-relaible News' (which I agree but didn't wrote that to him yet) he wrote like 2 paragraphs for it and ended with ""you maybe had fun pissing other people mood because depressed people do that."" That triggered me and I forget everything whatever he wrote and focused on just this statement. I pointed it out to him and to that he said it's a fact, he also had depression for a long time, he know it true and I am gonna thank him later in life. 
In reply to that I wrote a long paragraph which explains why I got hurt and why I think he was wrong. To this he got angry but refuse to reply. I said, just end it here I don't want to make this mess big.

He didn't reply for a day (he read it), I thought I maybe overreacted so I send him a voice note apologizing and again trying to explain why I got angry.

To which he came onto me with rage, pointing out that, he had said so much more then just this statement but I am sticking to it, which make his statement right. He also said something he had in his mind from months. And also that I have a selfish personality and he was just trying to help me. Ending it with ""lazy ass get your mission straight in life if you felt bad from all this prove me you are not a pathetic selfish boy and be a man do something with your life.""

I tried to clarify and justify but taht was making him more angry so i left it.

Now after reading the argument again from the beginning, and realised that at the start he was just trying to explain things to me which I took it to heart after reading that statement. Now I am feeling it was my mistake in the start.

833,"I've been trying to lose weight for around a year now, and I've only lost around 4kg in total, most of which came from the first few months. I've stagnated but I tried to not let that stop me and so I've decided to increase the amount of exercise I do and eat less (but still enough, I'm getting around 1000-1400 calories a day, mostly from whole foods). When I weighed myself last week, I was 55.5kg but when I weighed myself yesterday, I was 55.8 and 55.7kg respectively. I just don't understand - I have been eating less and exercising more (30 minutes increased to 1 hour now that I can't go to gym), but why are there no results? It's not that I just started, I've been exercising every day for well over a year and I eat cleanly most of the time, but I don't feel better or look better. The scale always spits back the same things or sometimes even a heavier weight. I don't think my gained weight is from muscle either. The only snacks I eat are fruit and I always eat vegetables every day. I don't understand why my weight loss is stagnating, I've changed my lifestyle to promote it yet nothing's happening. Is there anything I can do progress more? To actually see results? Is there something I'm not doing right?",29Mar2020,2
834,"I have a real hard time responding to messages from anyone on time. Ill see messages, and just ignore everyone for a day or two until I finally feel ready to respond. I always used to have that busy excuse, but now with that mandatory self-isolation i realized that im just kinda being an bitch.

Its not like I'm doing it out of malicious intent. I just really, really, really hate responding to calls or texts. It was worse when I was younger, when if I got too many messages/phone notifications I would kinda panic and have to physically remove myself away from the phone. Its hard to describe, theres no physical pain making me do this, I love my friends and want to talk to them, and literally nothing is making me not reply to messages. Its the stupidest issue. But one time it got so bad that I had to act upon my overwhelming urge to kinda just throw my phone against the opposite wall and leave it uncharged for a couple of days so no one could reach me. Sometimes I also get nervous and sweaty talking to new people via messages. Not because I'm nervous about what they think of me -often times I couldn't care less- but the act of texting makes me nervous. Most of all my message replies/family calls are done during a two hour motivational spurt that I'll get once every other day or so, and just bulk message everyone at once.

Yes, its the dumbest issue in the world. Its not like im popular either, I talk to a total of four people on the regular, and two of them are from a diffrent country. But it really sucks, my friends have been convinced that I hate them at one point or another because I take to long to respond. But I really, really dont. And I dont know how to make it clear that I hate all internet messages, but I also love them as a person. Or how to resolve this issue. I will admit that this has also caused issues with my mom and dad as well, as this anxiety also applies to them and I'll go days ignoring their messages even tho I really dont want to.",29Mar2020,0

Recently she has been off (I can’t confirm, but I strongly suspect bc she kept hiding her pill bottles) and she threw a fit about staying quarantined and being unable to work. She cleans an elderly mans house for money every week.

Please keep in mind this was over a series of conversations that ended with her blowing up and crying and telling us all the ways we are awful and how unhappy she is with her living here. 
The last of the conversations ended with her saying she isn’t gonna be homeless and that she has places to go and she doesn’t need us. To which my husband said that it appears she has made up her mind and asked her for her keys.

I've just always struggled to connect with people on a deeper level for some reason.

I even have two little cousins who are 9 and 6 and I wish I could even be more care-free with them because they like me a lot but I'm always afraid to like play with them and stuff even though I want to. And I never take the initiative of asking a new contact to hang out or grab something to eat because I'm too afraid of being rejected or having it be awkward; I always wait until someone asks me, if they ever do.

Hi, everyone. I hope the quarantine finds you all as well as can be expected. 

Since going to college, I’ve had a lot of realizations about myself, mostly about my childhood. It wasn’t bad or anything, but I’ve come to the realization that a lot of things that happened to me from my parents (Mom especially) just weren’t normal. Not abusive necessarily, but definitely toxic, and I feel like I developed a lot of problems with decision making and self confidence as a result. Especially, I have anxiety, and mom refuses to acknowledge it or get me help. I started seeing a counselor at school, and that was helping a lot, but now that’s done because my college shut down and I had to go home.

I’m living with Mom now, mostly because I don’t have any other option due to my status as a broke kid, and the fact that all my family sort of bows down to her. I tried talking to her about getting help here, but she went off on me about how “counselings only for people with problems” and how because she has a psych degree, she can give me all the help I need.

Anyway, that’s not working (obv) and my existing problems with anxiety are getting way worse, a little everyday. I can’t really get out for more than a couple hours, and it’s starting to feel like she’s pushing my buttons on purpose. So, I’m asking you all: what can I do? Are there websites or forums I can find help at? I’m not asking for free therapy, but just someone to listen to me who won’t side with her. I’d really appreciate any suggestions.

866,"Hi there, i'm a 21 year old guy and i've been debating in my head for weeks if i should talk to my ex best friend.

Little backstory:
3 years ago i met a girl through my group of friends back than. We started talking and it was clear that we had good chemistry from the start. She was going through a toxic relationship at the time and i helped her through it. I myself was going through a heavy depression and she lightend up my days untill we had a fight about 4 months into the friendship because a guy from her group of friends started threathening a friend of mine. Half a year later we were able to reconnect and the friendship was on again. She was again going through a toxic relationship and i still had that depression. Things were going better, we were more mature. But the talking became a bit too much we had a burn out of each other so we decided to leave each other alone for awhile. While we weren't talking she broke up with her boyfriend and started a new relationship. After a couple of months we started talking again and i was surprised to learn that she had a new boyfriend. But it looked like it was finally a decent guy. We didn't talk too much because her boyfriend didn't like it. I respected that (i'm a bit of the jealous type myself) so we kept contact minimal. After a few months it became clear that it was another asshole so i had to help her through another toxic relationship. It got to a point where she almost killed herself because of him and if i had fallen asleep before she texted me, i could have woken up to the news that my best friend died. Luckily that wasn't the case and eventually they broke up.

Now the fallout:
I always had one major problem with our friendship. That being that i almost never saw her. We texted almost every day but we never got to see each other. Given the fact that she was always in a relationship this was normal i thought. But this didn't change when she was single. She promised that we could finally see each other a lot now but in the last 6 months of our friendship (after the last boyfriend) i saw her 3 times. When it was her birthday she came to my house. When she had nothing to do one day we went to a pub. And the last time was when i had no ride home from a festival and she saved my ass. These three times happened in the space of 1 month. After this it was always the excuse of ''we have busy lives'' but she was going out friday and Saturday nights while i was home and did nothing every weekend. So it was christmas time and me being in school was home for 2 weeks. She promised to make sure we saw each other during the holidays. This never happened. At christmas eve we were chatting and she said a friend was over to celebrate christmas. This made me pissed but i didn't lash out against her. I however chose to be passive-agressive and said ''nice of you to invite a friend over for christmas''. She did not realise i was being sarcastic... Then we get to new years day. She told me she'd gotten into a fight with a friend and she went to that friend on the same day to apologise. I again got pissed because she would go to normal friend immediately but her best friend wasn't important enough, that's the feeling i had. So i confronted her about it and she eventually stopped responding after a long message of me, saying that she broke her promise that she wan't acting like a best friend, that i never saw her, that she had her priorities wrong, etc etc... So with her dropping the argument i took it as proof she didn't care about me and that wad the end of our friendship. No closure, no nothing. Just a sudden end.

Now a small part of me wants to talk to her again. Not because i miss her but to know what was going on in her head during that time and why it had to end like that. But i'm not sure maybe it's better to leave it behind and just move on. I'd be happy to get some advice.

869,"I (22F) told her that I would want her only at the big wedding and that we'd want and pay for the smaller one just for friends. She took this as I didn't want her at either. 

I'll admit I don't necessarily have the best tact and am often...blunt with how I put things. I'm my mother's daughter after all. But now she's being passive aggressive and saying ""It's your wedding, you can do what you want. You got all you want out of me."" (She paid for my dress, that's the only thing purchased at this point, a $1000 one from David's.) 

She I asked if she hated me. She didn't answer. I said I didn't want her to hate me. She said ""That's fine."" I want her at the big wedding for family. I tried explaining how much I want her there, but she won't listen or talk to me. 

I talked to my fiance (23M) about it and now he's mad at the both of us. He says that we both have too much pride and have problems not being blunt and having the intention misconstrued. He wants me to stop planning and looking at venues or plots of land for a home (literally just looking to see which areas of Oregon look the nicest with no intention of purchasing). He wants me to stop looking at the future and just pay attention to the present. I agree with him, we both are still in college, we both have hardly any money, both pretty much live under our mother's thumbs.

874,"Long story short I was browsing on a porn forum that is supposedly well known. I stumbled upon CP and reported it. After doing so and already being super horny from previous legal porn I fapped to one of the photos to try it out to see how my reaction would be (I think I suffer from pure ocd). Immediately after I regretted it. I was shaking, I almost threw up, I wanted to cry and ever since then I don’t feel the same anymore. I feel like my life is on auto pilot and I’m just waiting to be jailed some day. I feel like I betrayed myself, from being someone that is normally super kind, caring, helpful to being someone disgusting. I know I will never do this again. I know I will stick only to reputable porn sites. I know I didn’t intend to see such material. I know I will never harm anyone. I know reporting it was a good thing.

My previous porn habits were bad. This made me realize it. I used to be into loli porn. Sometimes browse legally clothed jailbait forum. I was toying with the line faaaaaar too much. I have since realized it isn’t healthy and stopped since this incident. I want nothing to do with the material, even though it is just animated or “technically legal.” The risk of seeing real illegal material is too high and it happened. 

But my mind constantly tells me that every truck I hear, every doorbell ring, every unknown number calling is the police or fbi to take me away. To expose my mistake, to take away my life, to take away my future, to take away my dreams, my job, my schooling. 

Sometimes I feel like doing my homework for college is worthless, as I will be taken away either soon or in a year or two. 

Sometimes I feel like learning a new language to go traveling is a waste of time, since I will be taken away soon.

I’ve been told by reddit to see a therapist. I have one online, but I can’t talk about this subject, afraid they will report me. 

I don’t know how I can continue living with this guilt, while trying to still be there mentally for my friends and family and my future. How can I enjoy my life looking over my back on a literal constant basis... 

I hate I made this stupid mistake. Who knew a few seconds of a wrong decision would change your life forever? 

I made frequent posts to reddit in legal advice etc most saying I’m fine from legal repercussions, I posted in sex offender support saying I messed up and need a lawyer, and one of my posts in off my chest or similar subreddit got my account perma banned. I may have either mentioned the forum or the content was too dark. I am now afraid reddit reported me. 

How do I move on with my life?!?!! Even though I don’t find young ones attractive, even though I am fully aroused by real women, I can’t help but feel like a pedo. I spend each night before bed and each morning waking up thinking about this mistake. It has been a month since it happened. I hear stories of people getting arrested years later for accidental downloading of this material.

I’m homeschooled and heading to 9th grade pretty soon, I’m not sure if I want to continue homeschooling or just go to a public high school. I’m currently leaning towards high school since my curriculum is very conservatively Christian (for example the ‘home ed’ course is labeled to be for teaching women how to serve their husbands) which doesn’t bode well for me since I’m a lesbian atheist. It’s science is very selective in what it teaches, though I take high school courses for supplements which aren’t religiously based. I don’t have any friends my age. That’s not saying it doesn’t have its perks, I travel a lot and usually finish everyday at noon, leaving me to play Xbox for the rest of the day or study if I want to (my mom leaves me to teach myself and I get good grades despite finishing early.

889,"I'm going to try and make this as short as possible, sorry if this sounds rushed!

I'm an 18F, and live in the UK, in a small house with my parents and younger brother. Because of the coronavirus situation, the UK, like many other countries around the world, is on lockdown, and so only ""essential"" travel is allowed, and you must stay at home unless your job requires you to do so.

I can't stay at home because I'm an essential worker. I work in a supermarket, which, as I'm sure you know, means that my colleagues and I are at a much higher risk of catching covid-19, and passing it onto those who are more vulnerable, like my mother.

My mum has struggled with health issues for years. She has chronic fatigue syndrome and has a weak immune system. She catches almost every cold and virus that's around, and it hits her harder than it does to us. Around the beginning of December of last year, we all caught the flu, but my mum became so so ill, I wasn't even sure she was going to make it. She was basically gasping for breath and could barely move at one point. After about 3 weeks, she began to show signs of improvement, which was a huge relief, but it took her about another month to fully regain her strength.

When someone you love dearly is so ill, near death's door, it kills you inside and I never want to see her like that again. :(

And yet I know that if I continue with my work, I'm potentially putting her life at risk. And yet, I really enjoy my job. Even though I sometimes feel vulnerable (people who don't understand social distancing rules) and it's not perfect, I enjoy working with my colleagues, we have a good boss who's really kind, supportive and appreciates the work we do.

I know that essential workers are needed now more than ever, and I'm proud to help out during this crisis, yet I won't be able to forgive myself if I catch the coronavirus and pass it onto her. Because our house is so small and we have only one bathroom, (being in the uk, houses are squished together like sardines), my family have all agreed that it's almost impossible to avoid each other in our tiny home. There's no other way that I can stay someplace else while still working, due to the lockdown.

I'm thinking of going to my boss and telling him everything I've said here, and to ask if I could have time off (I don't expect to be paid) until this is all over. Or maybe leave, but join in the future. But other than that, I'm not sure what else to do.

If anyone has any suggestions, on what to do in this situation, that would be much appreciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. xx

tldr: I'm an essential worker and I live with my mother who has underyling health conditions and is classed as highly vulnerable to the coronavirus.",29Mar2020,1

Part of my job is driving clients to and from appointments, methadone clinics, therapy, etc. However, today my supervisor told me to drive a client to the ER. 

In certain situations, I would say sure and do it, but today was different and left an awful feeling in my stomach. We currently have a client who is new to our facility and has a history of many different medical conditions, along with a substance use disorder. The night before she left the facility for an appointment but went to a different place and came back smelling of marijuana. We did a UA and it came up negative. I came into work this morning and she was nodding out like crazy. She was sitting on a bench and fell flat on her face because she was nodding out. When we tried to take her blood pressure she could barely form words and was having a hard time sitting in the chair because she continued to fall forward. It appeared as though she was on some sort of substance, but she kept on saying she just didn't feel good. I've worked with addicts for a couple years now and I can tell when one of them has recently used compared to someone just feeling sick. We ended up calling our nursing line and the client was unable to even talk to the nursing line because she was so out of it.

My supervisor was there and told me to drive her to the ER. I put my foot down and said no because I did not feel comfortable putting a client in the car not knowing if medically she was going to die any second or start having a seizure, etc. My supervisor just went and asked my other coworker who is new so said yes. 

I want to talk to my supervisor's boss about the situation and how it seemed very serious that she wanted me to drive the client, even though the client was showing serious signs of potential overdose or illness. I have a feeling my work will just chalk it up as it is ""part of my job description"" but I feel as though it has some serious liability attached to it when it comes to that sort of situation.

I took a state job just over a month ago.  A federal job that I really want called me about a week ago and said they would be offering me the position and my start date would be 4/13/2020.  This is great news for me yay! The HR professional emails me and summarizes our phone call with and mentions how I will have my official offer letter in hand by 3/27/2020 the latest.  3/27/2020 Comes and goes and I do not receive the letter, but I do get a call from the same HR professional and she tells me that yes I still have the job and I will definitely have the letter by next week but now the issue is that I cant give my current position a proper two weeks notice.  

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is that I do not want to give my two weeks notice at my current job without having the signed offer letter in my hands.  Also with the current pandemic going on in the world, I would hate to notify my current job that I am leaving and then the Federal gig rescinds the offer.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to decide what my best course of action is and here are my options

1.  Go into work tomorrow and tell my supervisor I am putting in my two weeks. - I don't like this option because I don't have the offer letter in hand, just an unsigned email from a HR person.
2.  Wait until I have the offer letter and then tell them I am leaving - I don't like this option because it is unprofessional and I already feel bad leaving after only working there for just over a month.
3. Tell my supervisor about the conversation I have with the Federal gig and mention how I am waiting for the official letter but they are expecting me to start on 4/13/20 and that I plan on taking it when the letter comes but if not I am going to be staying. - I don't like this option because it makes it sound like I don't appreciate the opportunity they gave me

Some other things to mention is I much prefer the federal gig over my state gig.  It much more aligns with my career interests and is much more financially enticing.  

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and some people might say ""well HR spoke with you on the phone and emailed a firm offer, its a definite.""  With the whole COVID-19 affecting so much around the world perhaps they could cut out my on boarding in order to focus on running their current mission.  This would leave me jobless.
