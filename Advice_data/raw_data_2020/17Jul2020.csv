1,"Hi everyone.

I'm 28 years old and I still live with my parents. My salary is in the low 70s range and I'm going into my 2nd year in my current job. I have a pretty decent amount of accessible savings (inaccessible savings would be something like retirement), and no debt besides student loans. This is important later.

I moved back home with my parents and siblings when I completed grad school in June 2018. I love my family very much, but things feel off to me (probably exacerbated since COVID started). There are 8 of us total in this house. 

I get into tiffs with my mom and sister all the time over the smallest things. I feel like they don't really respect me that much, and while I know I overreact about things at times, but they aren't the best either. For example, while I was taking a nap, my sister took my car to go to work. Not a big deal, but I wish she would have asked me to do this. If I do call her out on things like that, she'll get defensive and throw things back at me. There's nothing wrong with her car other than the fact that she might need to get tires soon. However, she has done NOTHING to work towards purchasing said tires and instead just uses other people's cars. My mom and I are too alike (we both have tempers, she's very dismissive of me and treats me like a kid at times - drives me nuts) and we clash a lot because of it.

On the other hand, my relationship with my father has improved a lot. And so as my relationship with my siblings. 

I keep to my own generally. I save money, help around the house when I can (groceries, bills), and do the chores that no one wants to do. When I delegate chores, no one cares or it only gets done a while later (like days, even weeks. I paid my sister $50 to put some screens together, after spending $200 on everything. It's been a month and only three of them have been done).  

I feel like honestly, it's time for me to move out. I have always felt like I was at my best whenever I was in college or grad school and had my own place. But I missed SEVEN years of my family and I know they aren't forever. My parents and siblings are getting older. I feel like I should spend more time with them, and my therapist even said that down the line, ""I may regret it and will miss having all these people around.""

I don't know. I was thinking of staying for another 6-12 months to save more money (and wait for COVID to pass), then put in a down payment on a condo. I don't plan on moving far, maybe 10-15 minutes away. I like the area I live in. What should I do?

**TL;DR:** Love my family very much, but there's a lot of conflict. I want to move out, but I feel guilty because my loved ones are getting older and may start doing their own thing. Should I stay home to maximize time with them or do I leave?",17Jul2020,1

3,"My mother in law is a well intentioned lady and I have a lot of respect for her. She's trying to do what's best for her family and herself as she's high risk. She heard from god knows where that gasoline is an appropriate 'disinfectant' for covid19 and has since substituted it in instead of using, you know, actual disinfectants made for cleaning. She is from a very different culture than my own and there is a language barrier between us so I tend not to think much about how different our day to day cleaning/cooking/living routines are. However, this recent habit alarms me for a few reasons. Firstly, I can't find any information anywhere on whether or not this is even accurate or relatively safe. We all walk through this house barefoot, adults, kids, babies, pets. I'm especially worried about my toddler nephew who is over several times a week, crawls in the floor, and puts most things in his mouth. I'm also concerned about my dogs and her cat, who walk on the floor and then clean themselves with their own tongues. Also I just cant stand the smell. Everytime I walk through the door it sets my teeth on edge, thinking theres a leak or someone left a burner on (something I'm very paranoid about). The smell is nauseating, I had to excuse myself outside once to throw up in the garden because of it. If she didn't love her family so much, I'd be suspicious she was getting the floorboards nice and primed for whenever she snaps and decides to take us all by fire out for the insurance. So basically, I dont know if this actually is a way to prevent the disease, but either way the cons seem to outweigh the pros as there are other alternatives. Please does anyone have information one way or the other on whether this is insane or reasonable?",17Jul2020,1
4,"i have a big friend group which i love but within the group there are 4 people who kind of make their own group. these 4 people tend to make me feel very left out in group situations and even go as far as not inviting me and the other people to social gatherings that they have themselves. these gatherings are always posted on social media for everyone to see and i get very upset and bothered about them. it upsets me because whenever i organise something to do i ALWAYS include everyone because i never want anyone to feel left out. i hate that i am soooo bothered about this because they literally would never think of me, like they are my friends who i love but i am not theres. i usually try to forget these things and carry on as normal with them but recently ive been more in tune with my thoughts and am thinking if i should distance myself from them cos i genuinely think they would not notice.",17Jul2020,1

11,"I‚Äôll make this short to avoid many details but my dad was away for the night doing his usual work. My mom was in the small kitchen we have boiling something in a pot. I was in the main room as I don‚Äôt really have a private bedroom and just doing random things like drawing and things like that. My mom came over to me and without saying a word suddenly opened her shirt to reveal her breasts. I stared in shock and my mom looked me in the eyes and said ‚Äúwant to touch?‚Äù
Without any second thought, I slowly reached out and started touching the nipples. I instantly got hard and I saw her look down at my trousers (my parents are very poor, no underwear and very weak pants so it was obvious I was getting aroused) she gets on her knees and says while looking me in the eyes, ‚Äúmy turn.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what she meant until she unattached the button and revealed my penis, as hard as ever.

16,"A few months ago I left college to move back in with my parents and finish the semester online. Now I‚Äôm done with college and about to have my advertising degree and I‚Äôve been working a retail job for about a month and a half.

It‚Äôs a normal job, the management and staff are friendly, I have no serious complaints. I just don‚Äôt like it for a lot of little reasons.

My brother pointed out that when ever I‚Äôm about to go to work I get grumpy and it‚Äôs clear I really don‚Äôt want to go. When I‚Äôm there I usually count the minutes until I can go home.

I think I might just be lazy or maybe my depression is creeping back up on me. My family thinks I should quit to stay safe from covid-19.

The reason that I‚Äôm conflicted is because I‚Äôm afraid of becoming a loser who lives with their parents at 25 and does nothing to improve themselves.

I have $2400 in my savings account. I think for my age that‚Äôs pretty good. Would it be irresponsible to quit my job and stop saving money?  I‚Äôll of course still be applying for ‚Äúreal‚Äù jobs while I work on my advertising portfolio. Or should I just keep working the job I have even though I don‚Äôt like it?

19,"This isn't a generic ""wah religion is bad"" post, I just don't know how to word my problem concisely.

I guess the best way to put it is that I'm instinctively a misotheist: I believe that a passively malicious god exists, and I hate his guts. If you took the little nagging voice in the back of your head that tells you you're an idiot no matter what and turned it into an omniscient but inactive deity, you'd have what I ultimately believe in. 

I know that this stems from a warped Christian upbringing, but it's irritating, because I don't want that idea taking up headspace. In fact, now that I type it out, it sounds like my religious issues and anxiety had a baby. But when I look up things like ""how to stop believing in god"", I get articles telling me *why* when I already have plenty of reasons why not to.

How do I unwire my brain to believe in this? The closest I've ever come to not believing is when I became an ""atheist"" at 14, but it was less unbelief and more like uncloaking the fundamentalist Christian version of God to reveal the annoying thing I've described underneath.",17Jul2020,1

22,"Title summarizes it pretty well.  I was attacked last year by an old roommate who broke down my door and tried to stab me over $100 he owed me.  I've since moved far far away, but I'm still scared every time someone knocks on my door and I shake any time there's any confrontation.  It never used to be like that for me, I've always been rather cavalier.  Never talked to my therapist about it because it feels dumb, especially since I walked away without a scratch.

Now with the mask thing I know I'm going to have to confront a lot of dumb rednecks who are almost all bigger than me (and I'm 6') and a good number of whom are armed.  I don't know how I'm going to handle it and I'm genuinely afraid one of them might kill or severely injure me over it.  I don't really know what to do.

24,"Sorry for the format since I'm on phone.    
       
For some background; Ever since I was 12(someone close to me died as well which affected me for many years) , I was bullied throughout my school life until 18. When I got into university, I was bullied again for 3 more years. After that I did an internship where my coworker kept telling me everyday that I'm useless and that I won' be able to do anything in my life.(i dropped out after 2 weeks) 
I guess that was the point where i thought that i should see a professional.               
We did therapy for almost a year which helped a little but not so much. After that we started some meds for depression and anxiety, which worked to some extent but my anxiety never went away. 
So fast forward to now, i'm 24 and going to start my masters in a month, which I feel like will be a failure like my school and previous university. 
Whenever I'm in public or in social situations, It feels like everyone is staring at me with some ill thoughts. There could be two people talking to each other and laughing and I would think that they are laughing on me. If someone points out any of my mistakes or anything related to my appearence, I take it personally and end up isolating myself even more. Even with my family, I get defensive and then later cry about it and not talk to them for a while. My only escape is playing games on pc.(i know I can't keep doing it forever) 
I'm 24, with no friends and I get depressed from every little thing people say. Everytime I try to go out and make friends, those memories of being bullied come back and I isolate myself again.                                             Although I think that my new university could be the change if I try to push myself but I just can't see myself doing that even though I want to.                                    
After a year of failed therapy and another year of failed anti depressants, I don't know how to change myself anymore but I know that I can't keep going on like this. I'm just hiding myself from everything and ruining relations with my family. I thought I might as well try reddit since I have no friends to ask. If anyone has any tips for dealing with anxiety, I'd appreciate it.",17Jul2020,1
25,"I've been dating a woman for nearly 3 years (I'm male, she's female, both late 20s) and I can't stop thinking about other women. There was never much of a spark between us. She always seemed to like me more than I liked her. I started dating her as, on paper, we are great for each other in terms of who we are and what we want and I had very little success with women beforehand. After a year we moved in together because it seemed like the natural progression of the relationship and we were both eager to reach that stage of our lives. We get on well and are generally quite happy, but I want more.

She has severe anxiety and depression, and as a result has very low motivation and sex drive. Until this month she didn't work or study, didn't drive, and doesn't keep up with her share of the house work. I'm far more motivated, work, study, drive/own a car, have a far higher libido, and generally are more ambitious. I am great for her and am helping put her life on track (recently helped get her a car, teaching her how to drive, showing her loads of affection and care, etc). I also have to do the vast majority of decision making and actions to get things done (e.g. doing 20+ hours of work to find her a car, suggesting/researching places to go, even just getting her out of bed each day). She knows many ways to improve her mental health but doesn't seem to have the motivation to adhere to any of them.

This isn't enough for me. I want other women, especially those who are more full of life. Daily I question whether or not I should break up with my girlfriend and I fantasize about other women.

What should I do? Break up with her and put her back to square 1, living with her parents and jobless at nearly age 30? Should I stay with her given how compatible we are and work on our relationship more, ignoring my desire for others? Stay with her until she can drive so she has more independence and leave then?

tldr; Never a spark in relationship, girlfriend is essentially my dependent, I want other women.",17Jul2020,1

Then she yells at me saying ‚ÄúDid you put them outside?!‚Äù and I‚Äôm like no I didn‚Äôt I just told you and why are you yelling? And she just stares at me and just said watch your mouth and like WTF!! 

And there were literally other times when I was young when she would get mad on the littlest of things and would scream ‚Äúyou know how crazy I am‚Äù if you got her upset. 

Once when I was young when she got mad she made me mad so as ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù I literally placed her keys on the second shelf from where it would normally be to get her back (I know not much of a prank but I thought it was). Then the next morning she literally bursts in my room (she works early) and hits me with a hanger and screams ‚Äúwhere is it?!‚Äù and ofc I knew what she was taking abt so I got them from the shelf and gave them to her.

39,"Hi, I'm currently 18 and sort of having a premature midlife crisis. I look like a very self confident and ambitious person, yet I'm currently in a tisy. I know it's 4 years in advance but I am a person who likes to plan things out and this has been a question I have been thinking about for atleast 6 years or so. 

I really love travel and exploring. Hiking and seightseeing is one of my favourite hobbies and I spend a lot of my free time roaming around the world. 

On the other hand I also love children and I have always invisioned having one of my own. I do not plan on getting married, but I want to have children on my own. I grew up with parents way older than me (my mom had me in her 40s). And growing up this way really showed me how hard it is to experience things with your child. My parents never went on rollarcoasters with me, never went hiking or skiing with me. They always only watched. This is one thing I DREAD with all my heart. I desperately want to be able to show my child all the amazing things in the world and be as physically fit as possible and experience wonderful things with them. And hopefully spend as much time with them as possible. 

But this is what triggers my anxiety, even tho I am still 18 and 4 years is a long time in this age. I feel like this is something I truly have to figure out soon, so I can financially and mentally prepare myself for it. 

Do you guys think I should focus on myself rather than choosing parenthood or would you say parenthood is more important and travel can be done at an older age aswell?",17Jul2020,1

I apologize to pathetically admit that when she was depressed we were closer and I liked that better because she dependent more on me. She texted and called me often. I was always there for her.

I am also aware that she might not deserve and I need to move on. Yes. But, it's easier said than done. I haven't texted her since 10 days. She pushed us to that distance with her decision.

43,"Hi, not sure if this content is allowed here, but thought I‚Äôd try.

Have been with partner for close to 4 years, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm quite sexually adventurous and would give most things a shot. When we‚Äôre just started out, it was exactly that. And there were times when I‚Äôve swallowed, sometimes I‚Äôd spit. His cum, obviously. And obviously, he prefers it when I swallow. (What‚Äôs with guys and swallowing?)

But truth be told, I‚Äôve never really liked swallowing. So as time passed, I swallowed less and less. And he asked me why a couple times. The first time, I told him that I didn‚Äôt like the texture of it in my mouth, much less swallowing it.  He didn‚Äôt say much, but did mention that he swallows when he eats me out and I cum from that (occasional squirter, sometimes I end up peeing too :/), so why couldn‚Äôt I do the same for him by swallowing. 

The last time he asked, quite a while after the first time, I threw him a stupid answer saying that I read somewhere that cum has calories and I didn‚Äôt want to be swallowing calories. He didn‚Äôt say anything, I thought that was that. But no, a few days later, he came back to me and told me that he did a search and found that there actually was very little calories, so how‚Äôs it any different from eating anyway. I was quite surprised, that it meant that much to him for him to actually have checked up on that. 

But I really don‚Äôt want to swallow anymore. I kinda gag a little thinking about it. So how do I go about telling him without hurting his feelings? Does anyone have any excuses or ideas they‚Äôve told their partner and worked?",17Jul2020,1

Hi All,

I'll  try to keep it brief. As the title states, my partner and I have been  kept awake by our absurd upstairs neighbors since they moved in a few  months ago and we'd like to know what we can possibly do to defend ourselves. We attempted to speak to them multiple times and when that  failed we  got in touch with the building management who instructed us  to record the incidents. They told us that after ten incidents they'd be  evicted. However, after weeks of patiently recording, they're now  saying that the management company is freezing all evictions due to  Covid.

We've made multiple audio  sound recordings and video recording of noise measuring devices next to  clocks to prove that they're being unreasonably loud late into the night  (as late as 2am).  Finally, we've started calling the police but due to  the fact that it's their three-year-old  running/banging/jumping/bouncing balls/etc and not something that is  literally constant like music, it's really a matter of luck if the cops  are here to witness it. I should also mention that at one point early on  the woman came down and had a sort of episode in front of our door,  screaming and yelling. When I opened the door with my camera to document  it she, of course, calmed down and left so I don't have evidence of  that. However, we are aware of what she can be like and it's worrisome.

On  top of all of this they've gotten really vindictive. They stomp and  jump on purpose to wake us. They pour water onto our patio furniture and  will blast music during the day to flaunt their freedom to be noisy.  The woman upstairs has expressed that her child has every right to run  and play as late as she wants and if we don't like it, we shouldn't be  living in an apartment. We're losing our minds and genuinely cannot  function properly because of lack of sleep. Is there anything at all  that we can do?

Thanks

Now I‚Äôm totally cool with that and don‚Äôt care, but I only talked to her sister once so I don‚Äôt really know her that well, so I‚Äôm thinking of bringing my other friend whose pretty extroverted and is good at keeping the energy going.

The only thing is it might make it awkward since what if they don‚Äôt vibe well with each other, and i feel like what if their personalities don‚Äôt match and we have a bad time or something. I also feel like him and those type of friends represent another side of my personality and I kind of act different with each friend so Im worried about how ill act.

The pros might be that he can better pick up on any awkwardness and he‚Äôs a close enough friend where it‚Äôs gonna be something good to talk about after, and he‚Äôs always invited me out with his other friend and some of the time I‚Äôve invited him he hasn‚Äôt gone, so this would be my opportunity.

It just seems like inviting him brings more unknown variables that I can stress about, but at the same time he might add to the hangout to make it better.

my best friend, (18F) who also happens to be my (18F) cousin, has been extremely controlling and possessive as long as i can remember. every time I get another friend or a boyfriend she gets extremely jealous and angry at me if I chose to spend time with them instead of her. 

I just started dating a boy about two months ago, and ever since then she‚Äôs been getting constantly upset at me if i‚Äôm with him when she asks me to hang out. the other day she asked to hang out, so I told her I could pick her up at around noon. she didn‚Äôt text me back for a few hours for some reason, until she finally texted back and said she could hang at 6, to which I explained I had plans with my boyfriend to get ice cream with his grandparents at 7: and that we had made them the night before so i didn‚Äôt want to cancel out of politeness and curtesy for his grandparents inviting me over- but that we could most definitely hang out any time the next day. 

she got furious at me, and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in days. she‚Äôs been indirecting me on all her social media accounts, telling everyone ‚ÄúI ditched her for someone else‚Äù and this isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs done this! back in 7th grade, I befriended a girl who lived down the street from me. she actually introduced us, as they were in the same class. when we started hanging out more, she would become absolutely livid to the point of attacking my other friend, saying she wished she never introduced us, being downright nasty to her, sometimes even straight up being a bully to her. all because I was spending time with someone who wasn‚Äôt her. 

she gets this way every time I get a new friend or a boyfriend and i‚Äôve had it up to here. she did this same thing when I had a fling with a boy last year, she turned all my other friends against me, said horrible things about me, just because i started spending more time with him. and when things didn‚Äôt work out she only came back to say I told you so. 

i‚Äôm tired of feeling like i‚Äôm her property, and i‚Äôm tired of having to chose between her and a new friend/boyfriend. she doesn‚Äôt even give me the option either, it‚Äôs her or them point blank. and I can‚Äôt just cut her off, she‚Äôs my cousin. i‚Äôm still going to have to have her in my life no matter what. 

the other issue being, because she basically prevented me from having any other friendships besides her, all my other friends are her friends too. so if I don‚Äôt have her, I have no one. and i‚Äôm terrible at making friends! and I don‚Äôt even really care that she‚Äôs mad, in fact, I couldn‚Äôt care less.

So I want to get to the bottom of it, learn, and solve it. I'm currently in a relationship, it has been a year too. I do love him (22m), we have a special bond because we had similar experiences in the past.

Before I went out with him, my self-esteem was doing well. Better than ever before actually. I had conquered the feeling of thinking badly about my body because of all the pressure that comes from ""friends' "" comments or SOCIAL MEDIA. All of that...

I was doing great. Then I went out with him and all of a sudden I realized he was following a lot of these sooooo perfect models. Big boobs and butt, skinny waist, beautifuuuul face. However some times vulgar on what they post. Like soft porn, I don't know if I can call it that. Look, I don't have a terrible body. I'm not far from what society expects physically of women today (skinny... you know the song). But I'm no Emily Rata (he is obsessed with her btw). I don't have big boobs, I'm not tall, not pretty as society is screaming what pretty is now. So my insecurities came back.

The fact that he followed this type of accounts and knew all their names and from where they were from made me feel hurt. At the begging, he would compare me to them but not in a ""wanting to hurt me"" way, just to bother me a little, like joking. I told him how I felt, he understood, felt bad about it, and stopped.

Today I'm trying to understand why is this really bothering me so much. I'm asking these questions because he stopped following one of the accounts of a girl that really likes. But then, he re-followed her, I suppose lately. Which is fine, it just seems like it's a necessity to watch her half-naked or fantasied with her body. I can forget about it if I just choose to ignore it. But I have not a valid reason to ignore it since it seems important to me for some reason that I'm trying to find (maybe that monogamy can't exist or that this world is just unbearably macho). I like to think that he is not mine and I'm not his. We are just accompanying each other on our lives for the moment. So I don't want to be controlling and ask him to unfollow all of the busty girls. I want him to do whatever he wants. If his reality is to follow this type of girl, that is his way of being and I don't want to change it. I want to know him, not what I want him to be. And vice versa.

Now, what bothers me is that I don't do that. I don't follow men that I dream to sleep with. I don't get aroused seeing their photos... as he probably does right?

It makes me sad because:

1- it's just the society talking. He learned that he liked that because he follows only that type of woman. And I find this stupid. I actually taught myself to find beauty in different types of people from different origins and body types. Not only white-blond blue-eyed women with big breasts and etc.

2- It seems like only men or the big majority of them do that! Seems like it is a necessity for them to have sex, get aroused...

Women follow hot muscular boys... But not as much and not as many. They actually follow more girl ""models"" than boy hot ""models"".

It lets me down/ it disillusions me because it makes me think that monogamy is practically unobtainable.

As if women are just here to be objectified. Men (at least those in my surroundings) were taught that they would be winners if they had sex with that type of girl and that they want to.

3- I'm hurt because I feel like I'm a second option (or not even that). I feel like what he thinks he really wants is to be with that type of girl. Some girls have this rule of ""you can see but not touch"". I think he can touch if he wants to. I wouldn't be against it. He is free and I am too. But after that, I wouldn't be with him because we are supposedly monogamous. The problem is if what he wants ""that"". And thinking that if he would have the chance to meet a girl like this and forget about me, is disrespectful towards me.

3.5- Makes me feel bad about my body and my face. As I'm just here because he can't be with Emily. I don't want to feel that way nor treated that way (if that is the truth).

4- And finally it would make me SO sad if the world is that superficial. I'm an intelligent, curious, kind, and pretty woman who has a lot to offer to the world. I just hope that these nonsuperficial qualities can go over if I'm hot or not or if I arouse you enough.

I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do. Are all men like this?

74,"So I‚Äôm sorry for spelling or grammar, and I‚Äôm on mobile. But basically the title, we‚Äôve been friends for a while, were really close, work together and would see each other every weekend, we‚Äôre rock solid, thought we would last forever. 

Would chat all the time and spend heaps of time together. And then a new guy started at work and we all kinda got a long, but those two did more than I did with him. He‚Äôs always felt a bit off, is very selfish and only ever thinks about himself, but they fell in love and two months ago they started dating and everything changed. 
He started giving me more and more snide and condescending comments and back handed compliments, is super possessive and doesn‚Äôt like me even walking next to her, will cut me off and walk next to her instead of just going on the other side, even if we‚Äôre talking. He‚Äôs done more and more things to make her rely on him so if I just went away nothing would change. 

I realise that she got a boyfriend so I can‚Äôt see her as much, but over the last two months she‚Äôs started messaging me less and less and never sees an issue with the way he treats me even when I point it out. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am always the one to text first, and she really only  replies to the messages, doesn‚Äôt carry on a conversation. 

She is never alone, and the last two times we were supposed to hang out just us we went shopping and he messaged her sooking becuase he wanted her to go home and when we were done he came to hers and made me feel super unwanted to the point where I just left. And the other time she was going to come with me to get a tattoo, and we had it planned for a month and we took the day off work and were going to go out for lunch after and he got really upset he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see her and so care and picked her up when my tattoo wasn‚Äôt even done and they just left.  

I confronted her about it on Tuesday and she doesn‚Äôt see anything wrong with what‚Äôs going on, thinks I‚Äôve overreacted and that I‚Äôm completely at fault for saying he‚Äôs an asshole. She wants us to have a clean slate and just put it all behind us because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs trying‚Äù and ‚Äúhe‚Äôs really not that horrible‚Äù.

79," First of all, I'm (19F) utterly shocked and furious and need advice from you guys. I feel like I'm suffocating and I am not in the right state of mind to know what is the right thing to do. I thought about texting the group chat saying this is not a joking matter etc, emailing their parents and even thought about going to the police (which, might be overreacting...). \[FYI, my mother isn't fluent in English and honestly can't help as much with this.\]

Today, during lunchtime, my sister got invited to an Instagram group chat with several other people (including her twin brother). A guy ""A"" sent a message saying ""sub or I will rape you"" with a link to his ""Fortnite TikTok Clan"" YouTube Channel. A guy ""B"" (who is a close friend of my brother, they've been friends since they were little) said ""Me too"" then the guy ""A"" replied, ""With blood"". A is apparently a friend of B. They are both around the same age as my siblings (11 years old).

I was furious when I saw this and immediately told my siblings to cut off contact with them. I advised my brother to leave the group chat and I kept my sisters account in the chat as evidence. I was planning to email B's parents tomorrow (I don't know who A is exactly) after my midterm but they kept it up so I've decided to ask for help here.

What made me post here was after, I checked the group chat again and it said that A and B changed the group chat name several times with variation of this: ""sub to \_\_\_ or A and B will rape you with blood"" / ""sub to \_\_\_ or ur gay full homo"". A also said, ""Sub rn or your gay"" in the chat. I'm just shocked and disappointed with how kids are these days. I don't know if these kids even understand the concept of ""rape"" or the consequences of it. I don't know if they were ""joking"" but this definitely shouldn't even be a joke. In fact, I highly doubt that they would actually do the action... or at least, I REALLY HOPE NOT. Also, the fact that they are using the word ""gay"" as a derogatory term is unacceptable. I don't know what to even tell their parents if I do email them and don't know what to tell them in the group chat if I were to message them on my sister's account to the group chat. I also don't want my sister to be targeted or made fun of. 

Please, I beg you, help me with what to do and what to say to them. I feel like going to the police is too extreme since they are around 11 years old... Do I just pretend nothing happened and make my siblings stay away from them? Also, I'm not sure what their parents would say if I were to tell them. I feel unsafe and I don't want to risk my siblings and others to this kind of threat, even if it was a ""joke"".

87,"I've been reflecting on social interaction in general with other people. When you talk to a stranger, you withhold parts of who you are for fear of judgement. When you talk to friends you still don't say exactly what you want to because different situations call for different levels of transparency. The worst is talking to someone who you'd like to be involved with romantically, since the level of hidden intentions, intentional behaviour to elicit certain responses, and withholding certain aspects of who you are is at it's peak in this situation.

Recently this has really freaked me out, possibly because of the lack of frequent interaction I am (and all of us are) experiencing because of COVID-19. The idea that I can never truly act freely with another person and must constantly restrict what I say and how I act based on the person and the response I want to elicit feels inherently deceitful and disingenuous. When interacting with people I'm able to judge what actions are appropriate or not, but looking further into how to be charismatic and how to be someone others will want to speak to makes me feel like the whole thing is just a huge farce.

90,"Over the past month I've come to notice that my Dad has been sneaking into my brother's (35 yo) room at night. 

My house is small and the walls are thin so I can pretty much hear everything thats going on in the house, my room is in between my parents and brother's room. My brother works nightshifts and at around 1:30AM each night I'll hear my Dad sneaking into his room (the light stays off) and then he'll sneak his way back out about 10 minutes later. 

Last week he even did it whilst my brother was home. My brother was downstairs and my Dad snuck into his room for about 5 minutes before my brother started making his way up the stairs, my Dad hurried out of the room and my bro asked him what he was doing, to which my Dad replied that he thought the dog was in there (as far as I'm concerned, this was complete BS because the room is tiny, he'd have been able to tell within a second if the dog was in the room if he'd just turned the light on -but he didn't, he was in there for about 5 minutes with the lights off). 

I'm now writing this post because he just did it again. I heard him sneak into the room and so a few minutes later I came out of my room and headed downstairs and spoke to my Mum - as I was speaking to her I could hear my Dad making his way back to his room. My Mum is either asleep or downstairs in the living room whilst my Dad does this. 

I can't bring myself to ask my Dad what he's doing as its seems like it's something he's trying to keep secret. I just find it all kinda suspicious and weird, why would a grown man be sneaking into another grown mans room at night? How do I go about getting to the bottom of this?

93,"A little backstory: I (22f) am almost done with college, I should be graduating in December. I love my college town, I‚Äôve really made a life there for myself except for the fact that I moved home after lockdown, (due to shitty roommates and covid) with plans to return next month for classes. I am very fortunate and grateful that my mom has helped me with rent thus far, as she worries about my mental health and wants me to do well in school. As the summer has progressed though, we get more and more emails about how classes MIGHT be only online again, and my mom says if classes don‚Äôt resume face to face, she would break my lease (as I don‚Äôt have enough credit built up to sign a lease for myself) and make me move home again until god knows when. I have a job lined up for when I get back to my college town, and this will be mentioned later.

At this point, I‚Äôm ready to leave my state because I‚Äôve been here my whole life and want something else... and our governor really sucks, especially with the virus. I‚Äôve been planning to move for a while, but my plans were to move next year when my lease for my apartment is up and I‚Äôve saved a years worth of paychecks and get some post-college experience. When my mom threatened to break my lease, it really broke my heart. I miss my friends and my town, even though I‚Äôm in my hometown, I don‚Äôt really have any friends here and really only interact with my sister. I just really want to distance myself from the woman that makes me feel like.... doo doo. But now that the opportunity to move sooner is in front of me, I don‚Äôt know how to start the process. 

With this job I have, I told my mom about it and she said ‚Äúyou are taking too many credit hours to work.‚Äù and when I told her I wanted to stay in my college town, she said, ‚Äúwith what money?‚Äù I feel like I can‚Äôt win here, I feel so stuck and complacent, and it‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world knowing I‚Äôm probably never going to leave my hometown and get to live my life the way I want to because my mom puts me down and criticizes everything I do. It feels like she has no faith in me. I still feel like i‚Äôm 17 because I‚Äôm still being pushed around by my ‚Äòmommy‚Äô, almost like i‚Äôm not allowed to be an adult. 

So with classes potentially moving only online and being nearly done with school, what‚Äôs stopping me from moving to a different state (where I have friends, a place to live and a job practically in front of me)? Does anyone have advice for moving across the country, even if it hurts their family? How long do I have to build credit to rent my own place without a co-signer? There‚Äôs so many things that I am just so unsure about, and it‚Äôs driving me a little mad. 

tldr: Possibly stuck in my hometown with my mom who treats me like a child, despite being 22. She threatened to break my lease on my apartment. Doesn‚Äôt want me getting a job, therefore cannot pay for my apartment. I want to move out of the state and not be here anymore and finally be independent.",17Jul2020,1

I don't have any particular interests throughout my childhood, and I want to make friends now.  
Some background info:  
Ever since I remember, my mom and my siblings have done everything for me, to the point where I'm annoyingly indecisive. I'm a spoiled brat, I admit. My older sibling has tried to help me by asking my questions like, ""What do you want to eat, is there anything you want to do after quarantine?"" But I always get uncomfortable because I don't know and I feel like I have to give an answer otherwise I'm being annoying or a disappointment. I'm not good with instructions but I've always figured things out by myself in desperate situations yet I still can't decide what's my favorite food is. I have dislikes and preferences but not a STRONG opinion, y'know? My mom used to control basically every aspect with my life, from my weight, the amount of calories I intake, my friends, my education and even the way I talk or how I act. But last year, she completely just set me free in way. She doesn't care if I go out, what I eat or what music I listen to. It feels like a lot of unknown pressure was lifted but also put onto me. I'm not sure if this is normal, because every time I read a story, the protagonist is happy relieve and immediately finds hobbies and passions. I can't. I've been searching for hobbies and can't seem to find any relevant ones.  


I started high school a few months ago and while everyone has something they like, for example:  
There's a girl in my class who plays the saxophone, she loves music and wants to become a song writer or part of a band.  
There's a boy in my class who loves philosophy and experimenting, he wants to become a scientist.  
Everyone in my class has something in common or have something they can talk about, meanwhile I'm here still struggling on what my favorite color. I think I like orange(?) that's what I wore the most as a kid.   
I have been getting better though, it took me basically two years but I found a few things I like.  
I like stardew valley, I got it recently due to my sister's friend's recommendation and minecraft too. Though most of my classmates don't really seem to be into that stuff. I can't approach people but I pretend to like socialising because I'm afraid of being alone, and I like being the last one to message in a chat because I feel better being left on read than leaving someone on read. I can't stand blood and I like extroverted people but I can't be near them often. I want to try something fun but it's quarantine for me. Any suggestions?

102,"Thanks in advance if you make it through this novel. Any advice is appreciated!

My (33F) condo is on the top floor of a 3 floor building. I bought the place about 5 years ago, and the unit below me is rented out so I've had several downstairs neighbors over the years. I'm a single mom to a 7 year old with ADHD, and I also have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, so shit can get a little hectic.

We met the new downstairs neighbor as he was moving in, just before lockdown began. He's a younger guy and seemed nice enough. I jokingly apologized in advance for any running around he might hear and promised I'd try to keep things calm (the building is older so the walls and floors don't do much to muffle sounds). I've always been very self-conscious about any noise we make, and I'm constantly reminding kiddo to ""fairy walk"" instead of stomping around like an elephant, but ADHD is a bitch and she's barely 7 years old, so stomping happens sometimes.

Since COVID hit, I've been working remotely from home, and kiddo spends most of her days with my mom so that I can work in peace. I've also started smoking again within the last few months, and while I know it's an awful habit, I buy into the whole stress-relief thing. I smoke out on my balcony, the floor of which is wooden planks with some gaps between them as big as a 1/2"". When I first bought the condo, the downstairs unit's balcony had a ""roof"" that caught all the debris that slipped through the cracks, but sometime before new guy moved in, the unit owners removed this ""roof"" so I can see directly below to the new guy's balcony through the gaps in the floor boards, and debris can now fall freely from my balcony to his. Because of this, and because it bothered me that he could be down there and look up at me through the gaps, I bought a rug that mostly covers the floor of my balcony, minus about a foot or so along the edges.

I haven't seen or spoken to my neighbor since the day he moved in, until today. 

I was on my balcony reading, not even smoking, and I hear him angrily mumbling from below about cigarette ash and butts and then I hear him say, and I quote, ""I'm going to make your and your kid's life fucking miserable."" He then went back inside, and I heard him banging things and slamming things around. I didn't know if he knew I was outside and had heard him since I had been quietly reading and the rug obscures most of the view through the gaps, so I wasn't sure if he was speaking directly to me or just venting at my direction. I glanced around and saw that there was, indeed, some stray ash that had blown up towards the balcony door, so to be safe, I went and grabbed the broom and dustpan and started sweeping up. 

Well, that's where all hell broke loose. He came back out on his balcony and he started yelling at me from below to stop sweeping shit onto his balcony, saying that he has to clean up ash and butts every day (I'm not sure how, since I use a closed-top ashtray that snuffs out the butts). The area I was sweeping has a gap that's always been filled with dust and who knows what, so I always assumed there was a beam below that caused the dust and whatever to pile in there. Apparently I was mistaken, since sweeping that area dislodged some of the crap that was packed in there and sent it down below, right on top of him. I apologized, saying I was trying to sweep and didn't know stuff had been falling through the cracks since the rug was there, but he yelled even louder, saying that I knew exactly what I was doing and implying I was doing it on purpose. I was shocked for a second until I got sassy and said, ""Excuse me?"" and trying to explain about the rug and not knowing things were falling through since he never said a word until now. He then went off on me, saying he was sick of cleaning up after me and he went back inside, slamming the door shut, open, and shut again. He started pounding on the walls again and (I'm assuming) slamming things around to the point that I could feel the floor shake beneath me. This probably went on for a few minutes, and then on and off again for maybe another 10 minutes or so. He's been quiet since, and I'm still shaking. 

I feel awful because I didn't know that stuff was still finding its way through the cracks and that my trying to sweep things made it worse, but I'm also very shaken up at how aggressive he got about it, and his threat to make our lives miserable keeps bouncing in my head. it sounded like he was punching his walls and throwing things against them. I'm now scared that he'll come up and confront me face-to-face. I'm a single mom, I have depression and anxiety, my kiddo also has bad anxiety, and I try to be as non-confrontational as possible. It's all especially upsetting since I've done what I can to be mindful of being quiet and walking lightly since I know that it can't be fun to have a hyperactive child in isolation running around overhead, even if she's at my mom's during the work days.

I'm not sure what to do at this point--I'm scared of running into him or having my kiddo run into him (the stairs down go right in front of his door), and I'm scared of him coming up to be aggressive in person. I'll be very careful with how I clean the balcony going forward, but I also wish he'd said something sooner.

Should I be legitimately worried about his threat? Should I ignore it?  Should I try to smooth things over with him? How can I get over my increased fear of making any noises or having more dirt and debris fall through the balcony cracks now? This is seriously messing with me and giving me so much anxiety, so thanks in advance if you'd made it this far and have any nuggets of wisdom to share!",17Jul2020,1

115,"I originally posted this in r/relationship_advice but figured I should see the opinions of people here at well. Throwaway account.

My girlfriend and I are both singers. We met last summer while doing Mary Poppins in a community theatre. I had one of the lead roles (I played both Mrs. Andrews and Mrs. Correy). I'm known in that theatre for playing the comedic roles in all of the shows. I have been apart of that theatre for 8 years, and I'm very lucky to have such success there.

My girlfriend started working there 2 years ago and was cast as ensemble both times. She is a good singer. That's it. A *good singer.* She isn't bad, AT ALL, but she isn't spectacular.

I feel so bad saying that because she is my fucking everything. I love her with everything I have, but it's just the truth. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I have been told that I am an amazing singer. I started singing lessons when I was 5 years old, started community theatre at seven, and professional theatre at nine.

I'm 16 now and my girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years. But I've always, especially lately, sensed some jealousy from her. Like whenever I mention a role I got, an upcoming performance, or a completion I'm doing, she gets really tense and quiet.

Which brings us to today. My mom is the queen of telling me about auditions super fucking last minute. Well, today she walks into my room and tells me that SHE SIGNED ME UP TO VIRTUALLY AUDITION FOR THE VOICE! I was like WTF?????

I didn't want to do it at first because HELLO! THE VOICE! But my mom convinced me to sing ""A Million Years Ago"", by adele (one of her favorite songs). I told my girlfriend I had to go for a second because I had to record something, she seemed fine. I rehearsed, and rehearsed, and rehearsed, and rehearsed some more until my mom was FINALLY like ""voice rest!""

I know that it's bad luck to tell someone about an audition before you do it, but I tell my girlfriend everything so why would I keep THIS a secret right? I texted her and told her about my audition (which is literally tomorrow by the way \*rolls eyes at my mom's last-minute tactics\*)

She acted EXTREMELY weird and completely thrown off guard. I called her and asked her if anything was up. She started questioning me about how I could do this so last minute (THANKS MOM), how i could learn a song so fast, how I could i could even sing that song, why I was even considering doing it, it seemed like she was frantically interrogating me!

Eventually, she just hung up the phone and texted me that she needed some space. I was really worried. She came back an hour later and sent me a LONG paragraph explaining how I'll always be the girl she wants to be. Everything I've achieved, everything I do, everything I say, and everything I am is what she's always wanted. But I'm also the girl she fell so in love with. She loves me and aspires to be me at the same time, and it's killing her.

I don't know what to do Reddit! I'm in love with her too! But she is convinced that I'm better than her when that's not the case at all. She's actually an extremely artistic, smart, fashionable, goofy, fun, and beautiful girl. I love her so fucking much and I think she is so perfect. But she wishes she was me.

117,"Help, I need some advice on a trickly situation.

Basically my grandma is dying and only has weeks to live before her heart gives up. I'm conflicted over whether to visit her to make amends or not given what's happened in the past. 

My grandma used to live with my family but after a divorce, my mother met someone new (5 years after the divorce) who is now my incredible step dad. My grandma didn't give my stepdad a chance and has never spoke to him in the 7 years my parents have been married and didn't go to their wedding despite being invited.

Because of not liking my step dad, my grandma cut all contact with my mother, stopped paying for things that she always bought like school uniforms (but continued to buy my cousin's uniforms) and moved out. 

I have tried to maintain contact with her over the years but nothing has ever been good enough. When I was a school, I only visited once a month due to studying and working which she complained about and said I should be visiting at least twice a week. Once I finished school I moved nearly 3 hours away to get my degree so I was only home once every few weeks, if not only at holidays.

She said that this was not good enough and that I only visited for money as I often visited at holidays (again, only time I was home). Anytime I visited her in the hospital, she only talked about my cousins and never asked about me and always took every opportunity to bad mouth my step dad, who is the kindest man ever. 

The final straw came Christmas last year when I went to visit her. I didn't care about presents but she rejected what I bought her, didn't give me anything but had spent hundreds on my baby cousin (1y0). She didn't speak to me once the entire time I was there (over an hour) and didn't acknowledge my presence. After that I said I wouldn't visit her again as I was so upset.

Which brings me to now. She has weeks to live and my head says to make ammends but my heart feels I will get hurt again. Has anyone any advice on what I should do? Should I try to repair the relationship or just leave it? Thanks",17Jul2020,1

So backstory, I live with an older couple in a house in a larger city, it‚Äôs cheaper that way. It‚Äôs a great relationship, I live upstairs and have my own whole kitchen, living space, bedrooms, laundry room, etc. I did not know them until moving. 

My best friend is moving into my place and we‚Äôre splitting rent, utilities, etc. that way hopefully we can both get better paying jobs and move out on our own. Also, we‚Äôre both trying to finish school. 

Originally, the older couple agreed let us stay until we were both done, but now they are talking about moving out of the city into a more rural area. Recently, things have been flipping back and forth between moving/not moving several times. They‚Äôve gone as far as putting bids on a couple of houses and having several realtors visit. One week, they‚Äôre moving and the next week they‚Äôre staying for another year. 

It‚Äôs time to sign the lease agreement again, but this time they want to do a 6-mo lease and then we can resign again IF they choose to stay in the city. The only problem with that is neither one of us will be done with school. 

The house is too big for both of us to keep up with rent (it‚Äôs a 6 bedroom house) and utilities for the whole place, but since they‚Äôre being wishy washy about the whole thing, part of me wants to move out into a place that will offer a year-long lease, that way we aren‚Äôt scrambling looking for an apartment near the holidays. 

We both have an excellent relationship with the couple, and we‚Äôd hate to move out (especially if they have no plans to leave within a year) but things are just so up in the air.

I can't relate to the youth around me - I Google things like ""how to have fun"" because the things I find fun are slightly different from the crowd. I don't think any of it makes me special, I just don't want to miss out on being ""young and free"".
This is weird because I used to perform stand up comedy and perform in front of people I had no idea how to interact with, yet I did fairly well. 
I recently ended a 4-year relationship with a lovely woman because I wanted to experiment with dating; only I cannot... Because I cannot emotionally or intellectually connect with anyone except her (tried and tested, failed). So dating is clearly not my thing.

My only motivation lies within Art and Design. I'm a design graduate and most of my work revolves around creativity.

The only friends I have exist virtually - I never meet any of them. I have no mentor(s) to guide me through my career, except for the few professionals I've met through internships.

Hello reddit! first post sorry if it's a bit unorganised

So im starting school in September and i'll be going into my 10th year which means ill be doing my gcse's. well i chose music for one of my classes and i was really excited to get to play in a band with my friend since we were gonna be a duo group, however after about a few months of us talking it over during quarentine i feel like i dont want to be in the same group as him.

i'll refer to my friend as AA in this post

so we both wanted to be in the same group but from what has been happening in the past months and what other friends have told me, I dont think AA will be able to pull his own weight. for the past months he has not done homework, choosing instead to beg me and my other friends for our homeworks last minute which already gives me a bad feeling as to what he will do when we actually have to practice and get on.
just 2 days ago we were coming up with a group name and by ""we"" i mean i was just giving him suggestions while he wasn't even bothering, instead just blaming me for not thinking of good ones.
AA's personality is one where he won't do any work then will beg others for help and personally i feel like that will also happen during our practice's since he isn't really showing any interests in our music group. 

Honestly writing this i feel like i havn't done a good job explaining why i just dont want to be in a group with him but i'm going to get to the point.
I want to kick him out of the group, i have tried countless times to ask him to take it more seriously but he isn't and im at the end of my rope. i want to kick him out but i dont know how to without ruining our friendship or making him feel bad, i have been thinking about this for many nights and i just dont know.

(i think im the right person since i was on a worse path with drugs and alcohol at 14 but i turned around)

he has now been fired from a program that gets sick/uneducated/less fortunate kids in to the workforce. they bended their backs for him to get him a job that works for him and the hours. 2hr a day for 3 days a week. he did the first week and then just ghoasted his boss. she tried to get him back for 3 weeks but i learned today that she just called our parents and said that he should bring by his workclothes and leave them by the door.
this caused a huge fight in our house when it ended i said to my brother ""you do realise you have majorly fuck up your life now? what are you going to do? you think mom and dad is just going to baby you for the rest of your life? you stay inside all day and eat shit while you play wow, no wonder you feel like shit. you need a plan or one day mom is going to have enough and just kick you out...

She refuses to brush her teeth, embarrasses us in public with stuff she says, always too loud, doesn't do what she is asked to do and you'd think my mom was killing her when she does her hair. She is addicted to her phone and barely does anything. She is always negative and says she hates almost everything that anyone wants her to like.

However, it is not necessarily my place, as I only see her for a week or two every chance I get away from school. Also, I don't want her to not like me even if it is for a greater good.

149,"Hey guys,

So I've been having a really hard time sleeping lately because I am so stressed out due to college. I recently transferred from a university to a smaller private college and am wondering if I made the right decision.

So, to start out, the university that I went to I was a commuter student majoring in Computer Science. I commuted about 45 minutes back and forth everyday and was starting to feel the effects of it by being really exhausted whenever I got home. Also, I wasn't really happy there. I made one friend out of my two years there, and just felt really alone on campus. Otherwise, I loved my professors and thought everyone was really nice there. Just didn't really feel like I belonged.

Since I was unhappy, I decided to transfer to another college, one that my best friend goes to. It's way out of state, so I will be dorming there and living the normal college life. However, I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth it. My college courses didn't transfer over very well, even though I earned credit for all of them, I am going to have to retake a class I already took (data structures class which was VERY hard for me). Also, since it's a smaller campus, most of the classes are offered in small portions, and my hopes of graduating early are basically out the window because I cannot get into classes I need to take to graduate due to them being already full. 

It's beginning to really stress me out and I'm wondering if this is really the right decision for me. I've already thought about dropping that college and wanting to see if my old university would take me back or if I could apply at another university near I live (they have rolling admissions). I really don't know what to do. I'm not happy living at home and commuting but I'm also not happy with how my experience with this new college is going so far. I would really love some advice because these thoughts have been keeping me up at night and I'm not sure what I should do.

Thank you.",17Jul2020,1

171,"Hi, it is me again. I got a lot of help last time on my post about my family and all of the crap that happens at my house. Welp. My family has now gotten on my last nerve and I need advice on how to effectively survive living with them for another 2 weeks. I move back on campus in 2 weeks. 

For reference, I also have a job, but they also make comments like ""yay, we get to get rid of her and sister for a whole 2 hours"". They have also taken to sexualizing clothes that I wear. Saying things like, ""Isn't that top showing a little too much? Or ""Why are you wearing 2 pairs of panties to bed?"" Whilst talking about my pajama shorts. 

They have also made comments about the friends I made at work. As the previous post suggests, they are extremely racist and homophobic. I teach exchange students the English language whilst at university and work at home with two woman who are bisexual. Recently they have brought up that the exchange students need to ""go back where they came from"" and that being friends with the women I work with is ""disgusting and we raised you better"". 

I am at my wits end with my family, but I do not have the resources to move out. Quoting Bible verses or just telling them general common sense ways to be good people only angers them. I feel like they will never be truly satisfied until I am at their level of hatred. But this makes me feel awful. I love them, but I also have a love for others and believe that everyone deserves the chance to be known before they are judged. And even then we should not judge, but give a helping hand. 

What is your advice on surviving the next 2 weeks without starting a war with my family?

Thank you in advance.",17Jul2020,1

176,"I'm a 30 year old, frustrated, man and I don't understand why I am a loser. Looking at what I have, what I have achived, and where I'm heading I should not be a loser in my view of the world. But that does not stop the fact that I at the very least feel like a loser if I'm not one. I'm typing all this on my phone in the middle of the night while not being able to sleep because I'm thinking about all this so bare with the invetable typos. But now I'm probably about tell a life story, I don't know yet how far I will go with this.

I have alsways been in to sports my whole life, I have always been very dedicated to the sports I play. I'm not the most atlletic guy, never have been, but by being fairly singleminded and very competetive I was always fairly good at which ever sport I wanted to be my main focus, I have usually moved on to try new thing after sticking with something f√∂r 8ish years, and offten achived my goals along the way. When i sas 18 I was on the national youth team in a olympic sport that my contry at the time was one the best at. I had achived my goal with that and feelt happy about it. Now it was time to move on to focus more on studies anyway.

So I moved across the country when I was 18 to go to a specific universety I had in mind. I sas never that greate in school. In highschool I had √§n atendance problem as I often rather slept in my bed then class, I was very under stimulated as I would still breeze through highschool mostly showing up for tests. I thought it was great at the time, being smart and having an easy life things could not be better. In hindsight it was really bad, I'm now 18, about to start living on my own, actually start getting education that challange me, and I'm about as good as a 6 year old at studing. It hit me like a brick wall when I started univeriaty. But I'm also really stuborn, so with some strugles and a year an a half delay I did get through it and got myself an engineering degree. After that it sas actually pretty smoth sailing again. I got a jobb at a famous company located in my home town. I even like the steady working life way more than I could have imagined, I thought I would be all bored again but everything have been great in that department and I think i have been making a pretty good carer for myslef so far in the last 5ish years.

So where is the loser part comming in? Probably here. I have for al my life wanted to have a gilfriend but somehow it have always felt like I'm just not good enough or attractive enough or whatever other reason I don't know. I have spent a night here and there with a girl i met at a bar, or an evening in my tent at a music festival, or the worst one, ""comforting"" women that have boyfriends already. I really hate the last one when it comes to my past and what man be the worst is that I hade more than one phase of doing that after telling myself to never do it again. but that is about the extent of my intemacy with women, and never what I even really wanted from it. I just want someone to be close to and be romantic with, god that sounds so cheesy not that I writh it. It is not like there is noone close to me in my life, I have several friends that I trust completely and have talked about this whole thing with before, but it is just not the same. Or atleast that is what my romanticize picture in my head is telling me.

This thing is really going all over the place now. Anyway, I'm a man with an education, a good jobb, a nice place to live, I like going out to bars with my friends and talking to new people, I guess I'm in the shorter side being 1,71m tall but otherwise I should be atleast good enough looking as I work out a lot and care about my aparence. How come I'm so completely unatractive to women though? Why do I look like a loser in the eyes of women? I used dating apps like tinder every day for years, what I got from that was maybe 10 people I had a real conversation with and one date. From years of using several apps, now I don't have them anymore as it sas just a sorce for me to feel bad about myself.

I have been rambeling for quite a while now. Anyway, I just don't get what I'm doing wrong. Why am I a loser?",17Jul2020,1

178,"Okay guys, I‚Äôm going to try to condense all of this in a way that makes sense. I met a girl in 2018, we became great friends and I have feelings for her.. yeah, she has a boyfriend, so I just put myself through the emotional purgatory that situation brings because I care about her and I enjoy our conversations.

Fast forward, she does some things like ask me to hang out at school but then ignore me to go on her phone, she also went on a discord server with our mutual friend and started exploiting my feelings despite me not telling her, and then she did the same ignore-me-for-the-phone trick as well as always making excuses for us not to hang out despite her telling me that I am her best friend. 

When I would confront her about these issues, she would do a lot of things that irked me. For example, the discord server thing she told me ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not going to get into an argument with you over something I said ages ago‚Äù. Then she would call me ONLY when she‚Äôd have problems with her boyfriend and then hang up as soon as our counselling session was over.

All I really wanted from her ultimately was us not to be a friendship of online convenience. To me, I loathe internet connection and she never made an effort to see me unless we crossed paths in college.. but then she‚Äôd be exclaiming how I mean so much to her and I‚Äôm the only one that matters, etc.. just things that essentially make anyone feel a certain way.

Anyway, now she runs this online shop and is making a shit ton of money. I‚Äôm at home, worrying about so many things financially.. her relationship has patched up and now they‚Äôre doing great.. I am thinking about how I am not a part of her life.. she has all these friends and stuff, I‚Äôm questioning whether if I even like mine.. 

I don‚Äôt know. Basically how I feel is that despite her consistently hurting me and me finally pulling the plug, things are going great for her and I‚Äôll never catch up. Like she has seriously hurt me in so many ways. Granted, I wasn‚Äôt the greatest friend as I had this hot and cold behaviour but I really let my guard down the past year before we had a huge falling out. We are civil now and message occasionally but it‚Äôs clear that we are at very different places.

I don‚Äôt know why I even feel anything about her successes. I should be happy for her, but I am seriously not. I feel like everything runs in her favour and I‚Äôm stuck in a rut with my own life. I‚Äôm aware I shouldn‚Äôt make comparisons but it‚Äôs hard not to. How can I let go of her and my negative feelings?

181,"     I was recently hired at an American Eagle. Previous to my hiring I was working as a busser at Olive Garden which I hated very much. The hours were long and the work was terrible. I figured American Eagle would be a good place to work because I shop there a lot and they were looking for sales associates which is something I‚Äôd be interested in. Today was my first day and I was extremely nervous that I was not gonna be taking part in sales despite the fact that I was hired to be in sales.
     During my interview my manager asked if I would be interested in cross training because I‚Äôd get more hours. I‚Äôd be a sales associate and a stocker which I didn‚Äôt mind. My main thing was I wanted to be able to work with people and be at the store front because I‚Äôm very social. However today they had me start as a stocker. I‚Äôd like to point out that I was the only guy hired out of all new sales associates so I expected to do some sort of harder work. Of course I knew that I was gonna need training for stocking but since it was my first day I expected to be trained in sales first because that‚Äôs what my job offer was. 
     However I was kept in the back and taught all about stocking. At the end of my shift I brought it up to my manager because I wanted to make sure I‚Äôd be cross training because I am very eager to interact with guest. He told me that I would indeed be experiencing some cross training and he complimented me about being extroverted and his my style was.
     I‚Äôm afraid that my manager is giving me false hope by telling me that I‚Äôm being cross trained while having plans for me to stick to one job. I‚Äôm extremely hesitant to stir up anything or discuss all of this since I was barely hired. But the reason I left my last job was because the work was very hard and I didn‚Äôt get enough interaction time with guest.

Throwaway because person in question knows my main + uses Reddit a lot.

A close friend of mine was sexually assaulted several weeks ago. I‚Äôm not going into details about it because and violating her privacy like that would be a horrible thing to do to her.

I‚Äôm scared for her safety and I‚Äôm terrified that it could happen again. I don‚Äôt want her to get hurt, but the problem is that I don‚Äôt know where she lives. We mostly talk through messages (though we know each other irl), and she‚Äôs mentioned once or twice the general area, but nothing more specific than that

I know nothing about the person who did it except that they live near her. I don‚Äôt want to traumatise her further by making her do anything she doesn‚Äôt want to do, and I don‚Äôt think I can report it myself because I don‚Äôt know enough about the situation and don‚Äôt want to hurt her by asking.

183,"Here is the situation: my friends have left town for a week or two and have asked that I take care of their pets. They have a dog, two cats and some fish. They only ask that I take the dog out to pee a couple times a day and to feed the animals. 

Here is the thing.. I think it's terrible to just leave a dog inside and alone for anywhere from 5-10 days, even with being let out for the bathroom. I told them this before they left and they told me not to worry about it. That the dog is fine with it. I encouraged them to put him in a boarding facility (they can afford it), or have it live with someone and they didnt think it was necessary. 

Their poor cats live in one little bedroom and it stinks to high hell. There is cat vomit all over the room and the cats seem miserable. They were desperate for attention when I went in there. They keep the cats in the little room so that they dont scratch the dog (which they do when he gets in their face. Its pretty normal, as the dog has no boundaries). They are sweet cats though. 

The fish tanks are so dirty I can barely see the fish. Some of them look barely alive. They have schooling fish in a tiny cube aquarium in which the fish can barely move. I myself have aquariums that are well kept and I desperately want to rescue the fish and put them in my spare tank. I just dont know how that would go over. 

What would you do? How do you bring this up with friends. I think they would be embarrassed or even angry, or defensive. They are really fantastic folks but they just shouldn't have animals, in my opinion. They think they are novel for a bit and then seem to forget to care for them properly but claim that the animals are ""doing great"" when you ask about them.  They never ever walk their dog and it's young and a high energy breed. 

I feel like I should go in and clean these poor animals living spaces. And walk the dog as much as possible. The thing is I have little kids, a business and animals to care for myself. I barely have time for my own life. But at the same time I am so anxious about the lives of these animals. I left their place today with such a heavy heart.

Like having double standards about a lot of stuff for example like shes the most insecure one but she thinks its still okay to tease me like say that shes cheating on me with someone else, and it just ends up being a joke. When i try to confront her about things i feel that she is doing wrong she just runs away from me or finds some really non-nonsensical way to get mad at me. Sometimes on call she makes whining noises and i get really anxious cause i think that i made her angry or sad and it just that she wants attention i can understand that but there surely must be other ways to tell me that u want my attention that emotionally and mentally stressing me each time.

I had a crush on someone who already has a boyfriend. I knew her for already 9 years and I had crush on her for 2 years already.

Normally I could discard these feelings easily enough, but her recent actions really made me fell for her more than I should.

One of them being she goes out of her way to teach me on a cold night and convinced me not to give up on one of my hardest incoming examinations. I had already given up for the exams but after I met her that night I felt guilty if I cant do the exam, thus I studied hard just the day before the exam and it was a breeze.

Also the fact that she came 45 mins to my room before the exam starts because I said I did not understand something and she taught me right away until I understand those lessons.

After those happened, was where I realised my feelings for her peaked and I need to take action quick before I do something stupid.

This may sound childish but I really needed help. I asked my close friends for help but they said they cant advice me anything as this is kind of hard situation.

Among of those hardships, are the fact that I am in a foreign university where I cant release this feeling easily to other person, and the main fact that I LITERALLY see her almost everyday, as we study in the same course but different semester.

196,"Hi!

So for some background: I am 22 years old, just graduated undergrad, and I have a job at a tech company. In these circumstances, I am extremely grateful to have a job that I can work at remotely.

However, I have been feeling burned out. If I have 3-5 hours of good energy in a day, then that's a win. I have been quarantining with my family (mom, dad and brother) since March. We haven't even gone into a grocery store... we pickup our groceries.

I know I am incredibly privileged to be in my position. I have a family that loves me, we are all safe and healthy, and economically secure even in a pandemic! but... I have been really down... I don't know if it's the lack of connection or the monotony or my diet... I feel surprised if I get out of bed looking forward to my day.

So onto the problem! My mom is a work horse. When I was young this was something I admired about her. As I got older though, I began to realize she can't quit work often to the detriment of her health and her relationships. To this day, she will wake up at 5 am, to get to start (remote) work early. She is now 59. She has numerous health problems, and an autoimmune condition... She doesn't have a social life, and even during quarantine says she is ""too busy"" to call any remaining contacts/acquaintances she has left. It is sad to me. 

So. Since I have started working my mom has been expressing concerns that I haven't been working enough. I have been dutifully logging in every work day 9am-5pm. She says I should start work at 8am, and work 10 hours. This is something that I not only don't want to do, but I frankly would not have the energy to do. I understand making a good first impression, but as it is I'm barely holding it together. It is extremely frustrating to me that she would offer opinions on how much I should work even though she acknowledges she works an unhealthy amount. It also really pisses me off because I am 22, and I think I should be allowed to control my career. 

Essentially the advice I am seeking is... how do I tell her that I need her to not make me be like her... 

How do I tell her... that I am too tired at 22 to work like she is at 59? 

How do I tell her that I never want to be like her and I want work to be an incredibly small aspect of my life???

198,"My (17F) mom (45) has been trying to start an online business for quite awhile now (at least a year). But things are not going well... as in nothing's really getting done. At first, she said that it's because she doesn't have time since she's the only one who cooks, cleans, does the laundry, etc. So I started cooking more (most of the time) and started helping my mom around the house.

So now her evenings are free (she works a 9 to 5 job). But when she gets home she's really tired and basically just either watches Netflix or plays games on her iPad until it's time to go sleep. I know she's really tired but she needs to focus on her online business because she's not actually earning enough money at her current job. I honestly don't know what to do. I've tried things like ""hey mom, you need to go work"" or ""stop playing games"".

Hi Reddit, 

Looking for advice on how to talk with my overbearing mother. Not sure this is the best forum, so I‚Äôm happy to take suggestions on where to put this. 

My mother (50ish, F) and I (23, M) have always been close, and I appreciate that relationship. In true WASP fashion, we don‚Äôt talk about our problems and that seems to work fine for both of us. I am a very independent person, and since moving to a new city to attend University, I have enjoyed living and travelling on my own. I enjoy my privacy and solitude, and these things are very important to me. I‚Äôve also started developing meaningful friendships, something I lacked in my childhood for a number of reasons (feminine gay kid, not well adjusted, etc.)  

My mother, on the other hand, wants to spend as much time with me as possible. She has frequently spent periods of time (usually about a week) with me uninvited since I moved out. This included staying in my dorm room for a few periods while I went to school, as well as inviting herself on travel I have booked. She‚Äôs been single for most of my life, and after I moved away to University, my brother chose to live with my father. I think she is lonely but she would never discuss this with me. 

When the quarantine started, I was in hospital (non-covid related) and she moved into my bachelor apartment to be closer. After I was released, she took incredible care of me as I needed help with basically everything. Space was still very tight, and after a few weeks I had recovered somewhat and basically kicked her out. She cried and told me how ungrateful I have been, that I need her. I still have a lot of guilt around this. She did help a lot, but I also had no privacy whatsoever during this time. I lived with friends for a couple weeks who were able to give me some help but also some privacy, as they have their own lives. 

A few months later, I moved into a larger apartment. Working from home, I found I wanted more space including a separate office area. She has taken this as a signal that she should spend more time here. A week ago she told me she was coming to see me. She flew here against public health advice, and basically told me when to pick her up from the airport. I love her, but I am trying to work full time from home and have not been able to entertain her. I have let her sleep in my new bed (which I purchased 6 days before she arrived), and I haven‚Äôt slept well since I‚Äôve been on an air mattress in my office. Since she‚Äôs been here, she‚Äôs completely reorganized the apartment to her liking. I‚Äôve had no privacy, and no time and space to breathe. I rented a car and told her I would be driving her home this weekend. Today, she told me she plans to fly back next month. 

How do I tell her that although I love her and value our relationship, I don‚Äôt want her to live with me? What do I do if she begins bawling and tells me I am breaking her heart? Am I being an unreasonable asshole? How do I help her develop meaningful relationships to get her off my back?  

Happy to provide more details if requested. Thanks in advance. AGV.",17Jul2020,1
204,"Alright, backstory time here.

My brother's mom has two cats. They... Did things.. Resulting in two male kittens. About a year ago she went on a trip and got our dad to take care of two cats, and in the end we would keep one of them. But.. She didn't take the other cat back. So, now we have two inbred kittens. Now, I got *attached* to these things. The one is yellow-orange and white, and more open towards humans. The other's black, gray and white, and he's a lot more skiddish. 

There's six people in my family (3 siblings, my dad, his girlfriend, and I), and everyone always gave more attention to the yellow guy. The other kitten only got attention from me. I love both of these cats. While my dad buys the (cheapest) cat food and litter, I'm the only person in our household who cleans up after them. I've been doing it for a year now, and I would continue doing it for the rest of their lifetimes.

They didn't misbehave as much as kittens, but as they got older, they started to get a lot more on everyone's nerves. The yellow cat, which everyone liked, always wanted to run off outside and screw other cats. And the other kitty, was still super skiddish, but had gotten a habit of pooping outside his litter bin. Still, I continued to clean up after them, and not lose my patience. I loved them.

My dad is really cheap, if you haven't noticed. Or, at least, cheap for things he doesn't care about. He just bought a BMW, but it's such a financial burden for him to feed two cats. Anyways, the cats *really* started sucking because they hadn't been neutered yet. In fact, they didn't get neutered or even the bare *minimum* of vaccinations and shots until they were around 9 months old. (just a few months ago). And they didn't even pay for them to be neutered. My dad had his girlfriend lie about still being a single-parent mother living in an apartment in the ghetto to get them neutered and vaccinated for free, just so he could save $100 on a one-time payment.

Fast forward to the past couple of weeks, and he's planning on getting rid of one of the cats Saturday. He's tried to do the same thing before, but everyone wanted them, and it was right around the start of COVID-19 in the United States. But this time, he's dead serious. I've tried reasoning with him. It's no use. I've argued with him probably 4 or 5 times about it this week, but he doesn't care. But guess which cat he wants to get rid of? It's the orange on they all were obsessed with. Why? Well, in the most recent (actually only) vet appointment for them, one of the veterinarians noticed there might be some dominance between him and the other cat. I guess they thought this because he was so skiddish and the other cat was a lot more open to people. 

For the longest time the yellow cat was his favorite, and now he's done a complete 180. He believes that by getting rid of the cat, the skiddish kitty will be more friendly to people, but that's just not true. He runs from my dad because they never actually spent time with him. They never cleaned up after him, or fed him, or cuddled with him. While there may still be a dominance thing going on, getting rid of the cat isn't going to make the other one any better. He wants the cat to be the same as the orange one. That's just not going to happen.

My last (and final, probably) argument with my dad ended in ""I don't give a shit. We're getting rid of him."" What the hell do I do?

P.S. - Sorry if it's a bit confusing to read. I just realized after grammar-checking it that I didn't do a very good job of differentiating between the two cats lol

Here's some photos of my kitties

210,"I'm 27 and my dad is very controlling but in a very illogical way. When he gets upset or has a disagreement he blows up. He can get quite insulting. I'm not going into much detail, but it's really unpleasant and toxic when he is. If you have concerns, he will belittle you or laugh at you, to make them seem less serious. He has gotten way better since my brother cut contact completely (probably bc he has regrets), but he can still get triggered some times. I suspect he might be bipolar or something but he scorns mental health. We rarely argue as much anymore because I started being way more verbal in response.

At this time it's convenient for me to stay with my parents because I don't have to pay rent. Yes, I could move out, but I want to know that I really tried to have a good relationship. I don't want to have regrets (he's like 67 rn).

I want to have a really serious talk to him about how I am an adult who will make her own decisions no matter what he says. I was staying over at my closest family members house and suddenly he wanted me to come home because the 'adults' were working and I would be with her dog and kids. I'm working from home atm. Apparently, he acted this way because he was concerned someone could break in and assault me or something. He started the argument by saying not to mix business and pleasure by working from my aunt's house, then said that as a older woman I shouldn't stay there for too long.

Once again.. I'm 27. He blew up and decided I should come home asap (and he would come today). I felt really trapped because I didn't want him to come and make a scene with my family members and I put my car insurance on hold, so I didn't drive my car there. I felt helpless and suffocated.

The disagreement escalated and I said we would talk at home and ended up going back early because my mood was kind of affected. I have been talking to him since then, and he is saying I'm illogical.. I don't feel that I am and instead think he's very illogical. Does anyone have any ideas I can do? I'm literally at a loss.. it's like talking to a brick wall. See the conversation below...

 Me: If all you want to do is accuse and argue instead of acknowledge that there's a problem, it's fine.

If I have to move out I will. If I have to cut ties, I will. I don't want to, but I'm not going to live in a toxic environment where I am subject to someones moods. It's never had a good effect on me, and I've realized that I don't have to put up with this as an adult. I don't think you've realized how your attitude has affected the people around you. Everytime there's a disagreement, this happens, and I don't want to have to deal with this. Why should I? What is a possible reason is there?

Using force in a relationship to get your way and trying to belittle someone isn't a way to keep them close

Him: When the sea is rough, we have to forget the differences and tolerate each other and stick together. Sea is always rough for minorities. But they stick together. We have to learn from them.

Me: Within reason. If I'm feeling unhappy or repressed in a relationship I'm not going to remain just for the sake of it. My emotional wellbeing takes priority over anything. That's why I'm talking to you.. because I care and want to try to work things out. But if pride and how you think things should be, is going to get in the way.. then I'm not sure what we can do. 

I came home early, before Friday, because we need to talk. You didn't win. It wasn't a competition or me giving into pressure because you were upset. There's nothing that restricts me from making my own choices.

Him: It is intolerance made us to leave our homes to immigrate. It is tolerance made us to stay in this country. We have to learn from matured cultures. Pride is evil. Evil should not stand between us. You and your loving dad.
Peter 5:5 ""God opposes the proud but shows favors to the humble""

Me: What are you even trying to say. This isn't a philosophical argument. Everything should be within reason. If someone crashes into my car, I'm not going to tolerate it, I'm mb going to take appropriate action by asking for insurance. 

 If I wanted to I could look something up and quote it to you too. I am having problems with how controlling you are and the way you act when you get upset.  Acting that way to other people is not good.. it makes them more distant, no matter how you justify it.

The key to communication is to listen without defending and speak without offending.

At this point it's not about winning an argument, it's about how I feel about this. Having a discussion about why. Why do I think I think you're to controlling?

Him: You have to calm down. Do not mix emotions with logic. Think. Write down in a sheet of paper and read tomorrow. Then we can talk. Decision and emotions should not be mixed.

Fin.

SO IM AT A LOSS. I'm in no way upset because I really cooled down but more incredulous that hes calling me illogical. Like what. I feel like I laid everything out so rationally. I don't even understand his thought process.

211," Hi everyone! I wonder if someone can help me with this:

I'm grieving (I guess) saying goodbye to an important person in my life who I care about. (Maybe I should clarify that is someone that is not good for me right now)

I really want to move on, and to not be revolving wounds and feeling pain and sadness. Let's just say that this person isn't giving me the company and careless that I seeking (kind of a one-sided relationship). And I want to move on and start investing in someone that does have time for mean values my company.  
So I don't wanna 'keep wasting my time thinking about it'.  
But the thing is that feelings of sadness and pain still surprise me (especially at night) and most of the time I just wanna distract and think about something else. But I worry that I might just be suppressing them ? Or block them instead of just letting them express themself and get out.

I'm conflicted because both needs seem valid: expressing my sadness and pain and wanting to move one and not think about the past anymore.

Has anyone felt the same way?  
Any advice on this?¬ø

219,"Hello, I will do my best to sum up everything as coherently and quickly as possible.


Basically, my mum immigrated from India to U.K. due to arranged marriage and her in-laws (my dads side Aunty‚Äôs) they were hurting her beating her whilst pregnant, pushed her down the stairs whilst pregnant (my sister is alive so it didn‚Äôt work but still) and when my dad died my mum got some insurance but they told the court and council and it was taken away from her.

My dad died when I was 3 so it was tough on her raising 3 kids by herself, plus they including my grandad blamed her for his death (he had a heart attack due to diet and overweight) they forced her to look at his dead body whilst pregnant and continued to hit her. I still remember some stuff when I was young.

Fast forward a couple of years when me my sis and bro are like 10 years old to late teens my Aunty she bullied hit us and her children (my cousins) also hit us and nothing was done about it. They smoked weed and ciggerates in our faces we'd go home smelling like that and sometimes they did not want to drop us home because it was inconvenient. Stuff like this and taking us out and then calling up my mum saying we took your kids out (a way to brag and push down my mum who at the time couldn‚Äôt afford that) they made fun of our financial situation and treated us like shit.


They‚Äôve also said to me and my siblings when we were young your dad wouldn‚Äôt be proud of you and stuff like this to kill us mentally. Which for the longest time I can‚Äôt lie it did. 


We were scared plus whenever we were going home they would act really nice and make us watch movies so we would forget sometimes they would just say don‚Äôt tell your mum. We were scared and some stuff we told to our mum but she couldn‚Äôt really do anything. 

We cut them off after coming to realisation the type of people they are and we had a massive argument through text and they left some threatening messages on our voicemail.

They have tried to reach out and I went to their house when late teen and they just yelled at us again. Now about 7 years later I spoke to one of them on the phone and thought let me try be nice and see what happens. They say they miss us and shit like that and my mum developed a brain tumour due to stress because of the stuff above and we just found out about it 2 years ago. 

I have been angry at them and fantasised about doing bad things towards them just to calm myself or just when I was still angry and immature. 

I‚Äôve learned the lesson that who am I to judge and if my dad was here he would say just forgive and move on but this stuff wouldn‚Äôt of happened if he was here. In my heart I have forgiven them because it‚Äôs too heavy to hold and I‚Äôd regather be happy. 



What I have done when speaking to them on the phone, I said to my Aunty you know I had a dream I was coming to your house (real dream) so she softened up but I could tell talk is cheap so she just played along and said the things She thought I wanted to hear. She said come to my house and I said yh but we need to talk then she put one if my cousins on the phone who was a bit frisky with me and my brother you know like not sexually but borderline sexually. She says to me you know there are two options we don‚Äôt talk about it and move on or e we talk about it and then we move one but they way she said implied the latter was stupid (because they know they‚Äôre in the wrong) I set it straight by saying look we‚Äôre going to talk about it and sometimes you have to go backwards to go forwards. 


I don‚Äôt want to let them back into my life nor do I think it‚Äôs a good Idea but I do want to get this stuff off my chest because I spoke with another Aunty who called us some very rude words and denied it and we patched things up but still I don‚Äôt trust her because I might not be able to reason all that well but I see well, I see just fine. I can tell who and what she is, a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing. 

My question is how should I approach this, what can I do maintain peace, I don‚Äôt think they can do anything that could repay or compensate for what they have done. I told them I wouldn‚Äôt talk until I finished my exams. They kept saying come over to our house which I think is a trap because it‚Äôs their home. 

I was thinking to speak at my grandads house email because I made up with him because he‚Äôs old and yh I was close with him but I have said my peace to him as well. 

My mum said stay away from them but I know what she means like don‚Äôt let them in your life which I won‚Äôt but I want to say to their face the stuff they did.

224,"So, I (20F) have decided to get a cat to live with me. I have recently moved out of student housing into a spacious, pet-friendly apartment. I‚Äôve owned cats my entire life with my family (5 to be exact) and also am a cat sitter for 5+ multi-cat households. I am very cat-experiences and have raised feral and adopted kittens on multiple occasion. 

Since I am moving to my new apartment very soon, I applied to get a cat from the local Humane Society. I have the financial means and time to take care of a cat. I am someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, and cats are typically very therapeutic and helpful. After waiting days to hear back from the Human Society, they called me to tell me that I was not responsible enough for an animal (based off of a 20 question application) and that I could apply again in a couple of years. 

There aren‚Äôt very many options for pet adoption where I am. So, I started researching certified breeders. There is a couple that breeds the type of cat I really wanted (Siamese and Ragdoll mix) and are certified in the US and Canada as breeders. I visited their house (masked of course) and saw all of their mom and dad cats. They interviewed me, made me sign a binding contract that set high care standards for the animal. They are reputable people and not a cat mill. 

I put down a deposit on an upcoming litter, and I feel ashamed. I‚Äôve been preached to about ‚Äúadopt don‚Äôt shop‚Äù my whole life by people, and I have adopted all of my other cats. This time, I tried. I tried and they would not let me. I feel like I can‚Äôt even tell my friends out of fear they will judge me and tell me i‚Äôm awful (anxiety issues at play here). What can I do to stop feeling this guilt? Did I make the right choice?

TLDR; The Humane Society turned me down for an adoption without meeting me, so I bought from a local, reputable breeder and I still feel guilty.",17Jul2020,1
225,"I am getting older and feel that any new hobby that I commit to will take up a lot of time at the opportunity cost of doing something else. So I want to make a wise choice. As I am getting older, I am concerned about cognitive decline so I want a cerebral aspect to the hobby. I have 4 ideas 1. a new language, 2. chess, 3. creative writing, 4. writing music. 

Both my parents come from cultures that have languages I can learn. One of them I have 0 interest in learning. The other I am confused about. I am not close with that side of the family, and have strong reasons to not like some of them. I have 0 other cultural ties to this language. So, even though half my ancestral blood line has a connection to this language, I do not have any feelings toward it. Would I be better off learning a language that more people speak where I live, or choosing a language from an area of the world I might want to travel to?

Chess, I enjoy strategy and very much enjoy the reading and study of it. But even though chess would be great for a brain exercise, it does not seem very useful. Computers are already better than the best players. Maybe attending competitions are very rewarding, I don't know much about this world.

Creative writing would seem like a dream. I have studied this a little, but have always thought my personality type is not well suited to being creative. I am analytical in nature but I could see great rewards in creating art and at the very least learning more to better appreciate art. 

Writing music. I have no experience in this at all. I have heard some people say it can be analytical in nature as many mathematicians make good musicians. This goal seems like a monumental task, but a good fit and rewarding.

I am open to other ideas. Are there any thoughts or suggestions?",17Jul2020,1
226,"So as a preface, it‚Äôs important to note that my family SUCKS at communication. It‚Äôs always been an issue. My family is small (about 6 of us), and I‚Äôm the only one that regularly stays in contact with my aunt. 

So my sister‚Äôs wedding was supposed to take place in France this August, but of course with COVID that isn‚Äôt happening. A large group was invited, including my aunt. So everyone received the email saying these plans had been cancelled. Shortly after, my sister and her fianc√© (who live in NY) decided they still want to get married this August, but in my family‚Äôs hometown. It will be a small group (10 of us) and I guess I didn‚Äôt think beforehand that if my sister invited our aunt, it would likely mean her fianc√© would invite his aunts and uncles and the small group would no longer be small. 

So anyways, I‚Äôm talking to my aunt on the phone and she asks me how my sister is. I basically said ‚Äúwell you probably know that the wedding is still happening in [our hometown] (where my aunt lives as well) so it‚Äôll be great for all of us to be together.‚Äù I realized after a long pause that my aunt was not invited. 

I became super upset, because I felt if she was invited to the pre-COVID France wedding, my sister should have at least let her know the plans and that she wouldn‚Äôt be invited (since the group needs to be small). I also feel like my sister could‚Äôve planned another day where just she, my aunt, and I I could tell my aunt was disappointed in the news...I asked if she wanted me to be the mediator between my sister or my dad (her brother) and mention that she now knows. She said no and we kind of dropped it. 

So here I am: sad that I had to be the one to break the news; angry that my family already sucks at communicating and now their relationship to my aunt will likely be severed even more; and anxious that I have this ‚Äúsecret‚Äù now. 

Should I talk to my sister? To my dad? Do I just let the wedding happen and then tell them? 

TLDR: broke the news to my aunt that she‚Äôs not invited to my sister‚Äôs small wedding. My family already sucks at communicating, so while I‚Äôm not surprised, I‚Äôm still pissed. My aunt said I don‚Äôt need to talk to anyone else in my family about her knowing, but I want to. Do I tell my sister or my dad (aunt‚Äôs brother), or just let the awkward family drama unravel itself?

227,"Backstory: wife and I are separated and divorcing. 

Two months ago, while we were together, we sold our house and moved in with the in-laws while we searched for a new home. Since then, we‚Äôve separated and I‚Äôve moved in with a buddy. Because the future is murky, we decided not to enter into another mortgage but rent a home instead. 

My wife was laid off due to Covid and remains unemployed. I agreed to find a house in the suburbs for us to in-home separate while she finds a job and can pay her share of the rent. Since then, things have imploded and we‚Äôve decided to divorce. She has the expectation, still, of living there with our three little kids and I‚Äôll be floating around from place to place, visiting on a set schedule til god knows when, all while paying $2630/mo for this house. 

Do I have the right to tell her I will be living there with the kids and she will need to continue staying with her parents until she finds a job and can pay for rent, or her own place? 

We really want this divorce to be friendly and amicable, but I don‚Äôt want to keep putting my friends out, and she has a place to live (her parents‚Äô place). I have a good income, but not enough to afford a second place.

230,"I have a deep passion for skincare! Seriously, I love it! Everything from learning new ingredients, to reverse engineering products, to sharing my knowledge and doing more research to help friends/family with their own skincare needs! 

I‚Äôve been wanting to start a YouTube channel to share my own skincare knowledge with the world, help others struggling with skin issues, and develop a community of others who also share a passion for ethical and sustainable skincare! 
I want to help other people feel confident in their own beautiful skin because not that many years ago I felt trapped behind my own skin issues! 

The only thing holding me back from starting a YouTube channel is that I‚Äôm scared of getting bullied. I see so many comments on YouTube criticizing everything from the way a YouTuber speaks down to the way they look. So many comments are so awful, and sometimes, beyond cruel. 
I got bullied the majority of my childhood and although I‚Äôm an adult now, bullying still hurts, you know? And I definitely don‚Äôt want to be bullied now. 

I‚Äôm also scared to start a channel because I feel like I constantly see this ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù going around where people get cancelled about almost anything they do. But what truly scares me about cancel culture is how when these influencers/youtuber‚Äôs get ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù, their families and them receive bullying, harassment, and death threat messages. I don‚Äôt want myself, and certainly not my family to ever have to be involved with something as terrible as death threats. 
Now that being said I know I am an honest, respectful, and ethical person. I do not believe anything I would say or do would be even near the realm of ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù. 
But once you go on the internet you can never truly go back. What you put on the internet basically stays there forever, and it‚Äôs pretty dang hard to erase.

234,"So this issue has only really been pressing in the last few days. Let me say again in more detail, that my brother isn't a bad guy. He has some issues, including anger issues, that he's struggling to figure out. However, this doesn't excuse his behavior today; firstly, he flat-out told me 'you're making burgers tonight'. It really annoyed me that he assumed to such a degree that I'd be willing to do whatever, just because he said so. The crowning moment of today, however, is that when supper was ready, my sister, who is about 10, was in a bad mood, and didn't want to eat just yet. He got mad, and yelled, that if she didn't want to eat, she could go to bed hungry. My sister ran off, and he stormed down to his room.

Honestly, I'm scared to confront him. I know he doesn't mean it, but he gets caught up in these moments and does whatever he thinks should happen without thinking. Talking about it just makes it worse, especially when he's still mad. While he's never hit us in anger, I'm always scared that if I try to stop him from doing these things, that he'll snap. I know I'm being irrational at thinking my own brother would hit any of us, even when he's angry, but it just makes it so hard to talk to him. I want him to open up to us so badly, but he's never in the mood to talk about this sort of thing. He's a teenager, and I know from personal experience that it's hard to express your emotions and concerns at that age, but I just wish he'd trust us with his vulnerabilities and just get past this tough-guy persona he always puts up.

I might be just being insensitive, so I apologize to you folk, and him, but I can only put up with so much of this. What can I do here that doesn't set him off? He's definitely the type, and admitted on one occasion that he'd rather die than see a doctor/therapist. What does this leave me? I don't know if even I can do anything to let him know what I feel, because he never seems to want to know what I feel.",17Jul2020,1
235,"I (16F) live with my mom, stepdad, grandmother and stepbrother. 

Little background, when I was 3, my mom and dad separated (they were married) over a fight about their savings (I understand my dad's reasoning). My dad left me with my mom, so I live with her.

Few years later, they both have new partners, and are having a baby. Basically, I have two stepbrothers, but that's not really important. My father rarely gets in touch with me now. 

Since the past few months, being in here drains me so much. I have no problem with them giving more attention to my brother, since I know that comes in naturally. But my grandma once called me just a burden in this house and it all just dawns on me that yeah.. I don't do chores or anything (I just feel very unmotivated).

I get nagged about getting up at 2PM. The reason is that I always sleep and wake up late because I have this friend from the other side of the world to whom I talk to everyday. He cheers me up and just makes my mood better. He's someone I can talk to always. 

They also complain about how I wasn't doing well the last quarter of my school year (my average was 96 and I though it was fine..) but I don't think they know how much they make me feel so pressured.

My classes were from 7AM - 6:30PM since I'm part of a special curriculum with extra sciences and math. When I come home I'm always on my phone chatting with previously mentioned friend. They'd nag me about not doing my assignments (I tried to explain I do it before I come home during my breaks but they're not buying it) and always being lazy. 

There was also an event I still felt really sad about. It was when they got my brother (He's 8, by the way) a new phone around 2019. Ever since 2017 or 18 I've been asking them for a laptop since my previous laptop was a second-hand HP that is really slow (We have research and it's really difficult to work with a slow laptop). I always tell myself that it's not a big deal since they did get me a laptop this year, and I'm grateful. 

Sometimes, when they nag me, I can't help but to answer back. I feel upset, and at the end I'm labeled disrespectful. I want to move out, but I have nowhere to go, and i'll feel guilty for being ungrateful.

They always tell me that ""You have to fund us when you have a job."" and when they receive no reaction from me they'll follow up with ""You're ungrateful. We sent you to a private school, housed you, fed you 3 times a day and we won't even get a response from you"".

I don't know if the problem is them, or I just don't know how to handle things. Now that I'm always at home in quarantine with them, I just feel like more of a burden. I can't open up to anyone here, since I'm not close with them. They just don't feel like family.. and I hate that I feel that because I'm not supposed to, right? They did so much for me..

So I'm (hopefully) off to college in August but the process surrounding taxes and forms and paperwork was probably the most obnoxious thing I've ever done so, naturally, it took me longer to get all my applications in check. I applied for and got accepted to the dorm hall that I wanted but I applied for a room that technically fits 6 but only one other guy was in it so I thought ""hey its pretty near the end of the application process maybe it'll just be me and this guy. 

Spoiler: its not just that guy.

The problem lies in that I NEED to have my own space, I've been sharing a space with my brother for 15 years and I hate it. I love my brother to death but the fact that he can't keep his dirty socks off my bed makes me wanna explode. 

I realize I'm not perfect either and there are undoubtedly things my brother can't stand about me, and that's fine. If I get MY space dirty then it's no problem, I'm responsible and there's no one else to blame and I have to keep it organized and how I want it etc. K, 5 other teenage boys are not going to be able to keep our dorm clean.

243,"Earlier this week I had my first appointment with a counselor through my EAP program over the phone.

He mostly seemed to be following a script. I understand that as it's his first appointment, and he told me straight up at the start is the goal of this first call is to just build up a clinical file, so of course it's going to be rather formulaic.

He was asking me questions and wanting a specific answer, but would cut off as I started to expand on it. Like I would offer me more details about the nuance of my sitaution, and he would just straight up cut me off.

Despite this, I still felt he gave me some good advice and first steps. He told me four specefic things to try before our next appointment in 2 weeks. We would then discuss if I did them or not without judgement and how I felt about it. He also wanted me to answer 3 questions:Who am I, why am I here, and will I engage. He did not provide further clarification on those.

244,"First of all, my uncle is a Gay man in his 60's. Why is that relevent? I will tell you later.

Maybe I am taking this the wrong way. I need someones opinion on the situation because I'm pretty upset about it. 

My uncle kind of has a reputation of being a Con man. But it's been years since those days, however, he's the kind of person that starts to plot and strategize on the people around him. Something I think he has grown custom to in his upbringing. 

He has a history of renting properties, and then subleasing all of the rooms so he doesn't pay any rent. 

He kept offering me to move in with him. I have been reluctant on trusting him because he tends to be manipulative and has alterior motives. Anyway, we have had a family issue going on and he repeatedly has been inviting me over to stay with him. 

He told me ""We are family, we need to trust each other."" etc. 

Anyway, I finally sort of felt inclined to come around. THe thing is, I used to live with him before but we had a big blow out. He began to disrespect my girlfriend a LOT; making inappropriate sexual jokes around her, saying rude comments, until finally I moved out. I didn't really talk to him for a year and didn't trust him after that.

So I finally got a little bit of trust built up with him. I decided I would give it a try and move in with him. Everything seemed to be cool. He had moved in a young, 21 year old, immigrant who doesn't have legal citizenship mainly because he was handsome. 

I'm not going to lie. I'm not gay, but he is a good looking guy. And he comes from an impoverished country (Mexico). So my 60 year old uncle, obviously uses the advantageous living situation he has to lure this young male into his home and live with him. He had already sexually assaulted him 6 months prior. (Long story, they had a physical altercation and the kid fled back to Mexico.)

I figured that was their business. The kid moved back in since then, and I figured I would take my uncle on his continual offer to move back in. After a few talks, he welcomes me back to the place where I had my old room.

When I came into town, the first thing he told me was ""Fill your car up with gas to the brim, because ""______"" is going to take it tomorrow to work."" 

I said ""What?""

And after that, we sort of got into an argument about me not wanting him to take my car, because he doesn't have a drivers license and he's not a legal citizen. So in other words, he seemed to have only invite me over because he needed to give his roomate friend a car to drive. 

I told him I will not do that and he got mad at me, and said ""He"" can't let the immigrant roomate use his car because his insurance doesn't cover it. I told him My insurance won't cover it either. 

We got into a little argument, I got pissed off at him and I eventually just drove back home to my original place.

I hope I don't sound too harsh or anything, but when I see a lot of posts concerning depression/anxiety, I tend to see a lot of people that will relate to the experience. While I definitely understand that, as well as feel for you, I'm really looking to move past this permanently. I'd want the same for the other person.

Here's a good amount of backstory:

I'm at the point in my life where I'm absolutely tired of feeling terrible every day. I started seeing my depression peak in late high school, then it would go away. It wasn't around until late college that I realized that something was wrong with me. I started going to therapy, which I would say helped immensely. Once I graduated, things were on the upswing, but of course, stuff like that doesn't last. 

As I got older, I started losing more of my friends. There was one friend group that I lost through my screw up 3 years ago. Basically, I was kind of talking to his ex. She started having feelings for me, for which I respectfully ended it knowing I was his friend first. I felt guilty, so I tried to confront said friend. He was mad at first but was alright after the first time we talked. A week later, he was beyond pissed and told me he wanted me out of his life permanently. I tried to mend things a couple of weeks later, but he told me to never speak to him again, by which I immediately lashed out and called him an emotional abuser and a narcissist. I tried to message him and mend things over the course of 3 years, but I never got a response. This is where things started to get tricky.

I essentially became absolutely obsessed with wanting to fix this friendship. I started memorizing contact information (which is creepy and idk why I'm like this, but my brain is always telling me I should contact X hoping things will be mended at this point, even though they've 100% moved on), and would basically spend months lamenting over this entire thing. Although I'm undiagnosed, I'm pretty sure I developed a type of OCD over this, where I feel like I have to know how these peoples' lives are without me. I essentially make myself feel terrible about this. Even now, I don't really snoop around anymore, but the thought of it makes me feel like I either 1) have to or I'll die, or 2) I don't and I get super depressed all the time.

Fast forward to now.

It wasn't always this bad, but with COVID isolation, everything kind of got worse. I lost my job, I already had mental health issues, and the nail in the coffin was when I actually got diagnosed with COVID and thought I was going to die (Which it was a rough 2 weeks, but I'm recovering now. I'm just waiting for my results to say I'm negative and I can probably start socializing again), and it made me kind of go through the entire bout all over again. What it was like to be yelled at, for someone that I cared about to cut me out of their life (and possibly made a song about it, but that's neither here nor there), and essentially brought back all the trauma. I have a bunch of filters in place so I don't start spiraling down towards snooping again, but it sometimes feels like I'm insane for having all of these things. I don't even have a normal relationship with the internet or my phone anymore. I'm always afraid one of those contact numbers might pop in my head, and I'll end up in a state of mania and calling it and end up being known as some kind of stalker or something with a restraining order. I can't even google things nowadays without wondering if I should look up these people, hoping that I find something. The worst part of all of this is, every time I do snoop/pseudo-snoop, I feel absolutely AWFUL afterward. Like 100% without fail. It feels like I have no self-discipline at times. I'll go about telling myself: ""Why are you so stupid?"", ""Why can't you just get a control on your emotions?"", ""Am I always going to be like this?""

I ended up having another mental breakdown yesterday. I essentially *tried* snooping yesterday, but with all the filters I have in place, I couldn't find anything that 1) I haven't already seen, and 2) anything that was new. I pretty much spent most of today just wallowing, reading more depressed people posts on Reddit hoping something might click and I'd be able to get out of this funk. I ended up changing my search to ""how do people get out of depression"". Some of the posts were motivational, but I realized I kind of wanted to tailor the experience for myself if that makes any sense.

**The gist of it is**: I want to change. I don't want to be like this anymore. I'm tired of knowing information that isn't helping me (though I don't know how to live with useless information since I ruminate/shame myself over it 99% of my day, or anytime I start feeling a little better). I'm tired of being depressed all the time. I don't want to go into my 30s, let alone 29, being like this forever. It feels like post-college, I've been dealing with nothing but my mental health issues while everyone around me is progressing in their careers, getting married, buying houses, having kids, etc. while I still live at home, single, no real direction in life, and having suicidal ideations while watching Hulu all day.

**tl;dr:** I want to live. I realized I don't want to die. I realize there is a lot more to live for. I don't want to be like this anymore. I guess what I'm asking is, if any of you have had similar experiences, how did you deal with it? How did you learn to live with your past? How do you learn to live with your depression? How do you stay motivated enough to keep going? How do you stay self-disciplined? How do you have a strong will? How do you move past all of this?

Note: I will mention that I am in therapy, and although it helps, 1) a lot of my change has to be invoked from within, and sometimes it feels like I'm not 100% utilizing the advice my therapist gives me, which idk why cuz it's usually great advice, and 2) 1 hour a week never feels like enough time. I always feel bad when I text her during my manic episodes anyway. I haven't been to a psychiatrist because I have no insurance, which I want to start looking for hopefully sometime this week if not early next week.",17Jul2020,1

Why does he just disappear without any explanation when it‚Äôs time to meet? I got dressed up and looked so cute for him but for him to go MIA really hurts me and confuses me. 
Why tell me you want to see me but then disappear ? The next day he gives a weird excuse that he fell asleep then double texts me to hang again. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of it maybe he gets lazy? Do you have any ideas ? ://

254,"In the small group of friends I hang out with, we all get along except for me and this other guy. I think he‚Äôs got some sort of superiority complex or gets jealous or something, and I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable being around him.

A few years back I was working at a food place when I referred him to work there. He got hired and I was there for a few more weeks. I was starting to get more of a leadership role, but I wasn‚Äôt getting paid nearly enough so I quit for a better paying job. Shortly after, he became a manager and told my our friends that I quit because I didn‚Äôt want to work under him.

At a Halloween party we were playing some game with a ball and he threw the ball at my face hard (on accident). It hurt pretty bad so I went to sit down and was quiet for a while. However, he wasted no time to make fun of me to our friends about it.

A couple nights ago I got together with a couple of our friends but he said he couldn‚Äôt go because he had to babysit his 11 year old brother. While we were heading to our hangout spot, he said he didn‚Äôt have to babysit anymore, so I turned around and picked him up.

Later, I was driving around with him and our friends when he kept bothering me to drop him off at home. He said his phone was low on battery and he wanted to text his girlfriend (which he had been doing while we were hanging out). I dropped him off but it was pretty shitty of him to do that.

He got all awkward when our friends mentioned I was taller than him (we‚Äôre both pretty tall). Whenever we talk or hang out with other friends, it‚Äôs just awkward so I kind of avoid him.

261,"Hello all. I'm 24 M, and have had issues with self-confidence my whole adult life. My lack of self-confidence leaks into nearly all spheres of my life, including my career, dating, and (non-existent) social life, and I've seen many therapists in the past to talk about these issues.

Well I just came back from my (final) session with my therapist. I decided to end all further sessions with her. I've seen many therapists in the past, but today proved that she was a very different one from the rest. Today, we touched on the topic of dating and I explained to her that one of my main woes was being pretty short and unattractive as a guy, and being raised in a cultural background that discourages dating altogether. I want to date, but negative thinking has been holding me back.

After explaining this to my therapist, she mentioned how she wouldn't be able to help me if all I did was ruminate in these negative thoughts; I had to take action. She said girls will never like me if I'm always anxious and unconfident around them. Now, her language was a little blunt, and I understood where she was coming from - She may have been pissed at how I kept repeating the same self-defeating thoughts, after 6 months. By being blunt, she was forcing me to look at the reality, but I think her attitude was very unkind and discouraging.

When I brought up how women's physical preferences in men is holding me back from dating, she bounced this back on me by saying how men are just as shallow, caring only about looks. The whole session became a battle of the sexes. Feeling attacked by her attitude, I said this would be our last session (I have always wanted to leave tbh, but today made it very clear), and after exchanging final words, she smiled and waived goodbye. (Which to me, felt very fake, and manufactured)

I always felt a snake-like, insidious vibe from her, as if she never cared about me. Whenever I brought up a personal problem, she would dismiss it and tell me how I would never grow as a person if I kept ruminating. She never really approached the problems in a nurturing way, which I believe is how therapy should be done.

Despite all this, I was still attached to her. And after today's session, I can't help but feel a little heartbroken. The way I'm feeling right now, it's like finding out your longtime partner cheated on you. I understand that the relationship between the therapist and client has to stay professional, but I can't help but feel this way after spilling all my personal issues to one person for 6 months.

Am I wrong for leaving the therapy session so suddenly? Am I wrong for feeling this way?

TLDR - Therapist kept dismissing my problems; kept saying how she can't help me since I keep ruminating on the same negative thoughts. After getting some unkind and unhelpful 'advice' , I decided to leave therapy.",17Jul2020,1
262,"Hi! My family is meeting a puppy and their foster mom on Saturday. This is really important to me as we recently had to put down our dog and we agree (well, my sister (21) is kind of uncertain, but she's open to it) that the best course of action is to adopt another. As I said, we have an opportunity to meet a dog and interview with the woman fostering her. 

When I say puppy, I mean puppy. Like, 7 weeks, still needs to stay with the foster for 2 more weeks. We adopted our previous dog as a senior, so a puppy is new to us. She is said to be very laid-back. She's good with other dogs (we have none, but would be open to getting another in the future), cats (we have one boy and one girl, presumably from the same litter, both about 12 although neither act like it), and small children (not applicable, my sister and I are 21 and 18 respectively, have no plans to have kids, and my parents are 53 and 55). 

We are also applying to adopt a dog in the same litter, but we only have an appointment to meet this one (they have different foster homes). We would only get one or the other. We're worried that adopting two puppies would be too much for us or that it would result in sibling aggression. Furthermore, the rescue has a policy against families adopting littermates.

I'm very excited. I've been looking up dog toys to provide stimulation, some chew toys, basic things like balls, training guides, etc. This puppy runs just like my cat. Imagine a cat or a puppy running like a bunny. (My cat had surgery that left a flap under her stomach, and the puppy is still growing into its feet). She's very snuggly, which is my number one favorite trait in a dog. 

Another party is interested in the dog. They will have the first impression. I know nothing about them. The woman fostering the dog will have the final decision. 

What are some things we can do to impress the woman fostering this puppy? 

Please tell me if this violates Rule 3 (Avoid topics requiring specific expertise). Personally, I thought that having dogs was common enough to justify not posting in a more specific forum, but I might be  wrong. Thank you for any advice you can offer!",17Jul2020,1

Now he's taken over the practice for his dad for the duration of the pandemic, and vision therapy sessions are one-on-one; facebook says he doesn't have a girlfriend anymore. He made a lot of small-talk the first time I met him &amp; was his dad's patient, but now he seems a bit nervous?

292,"I need help with something because I am confused and have absolutely no clue on what to do..Let me start from the beginning. I was in this gaming clan. It was like a little group of people who played online games with everyone and they did events for me prizes and stuff like that. At the beginning I was dating a guy and I‚Äômma call him R. R was a male and he was 21 years old. I had just turned 18 when me and started dating. We played the game together and ect. Me and R‚Äôs relationship started to go downhill (I won‚Äôt get into details bc it‚Äôs personal and has no correlation to what I need advice on). After being together for a year with R, I started to talk to another guy in this gaming clan... I started talking to him about how I felt about the way I was being treated by R, and how I felt that R wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough to better himself or for our relationship.. the guy I was talking to I‚Äôm going to call him B. B told me that I deserved better than R and that I didn‚Äôt deserve to be treated the way R had been treating me. After getting more and more comfortable with B, him and the clan leader was there for me during the time I finally decided that I had enough and was breaking up with R. 

Okay so now at this point me and R are broken up, and I‚Äôm talking to B. Me and B (Also a male) where really good friends And at first when I met B and started to play online games with him, I didn‚Äôt think much about it other than we was really good friends. but Towards the middle of mine and R‚Äôs relationship I started to feel feelings for B, but I never really came to terms with it... right before me and R broke up... B told me he had feelings for me... at first I didn‚Äôt want to tell him I had feelings for him too bc I was still in a relationship and also the age difference between me and B. After me and R broke up me and B got together a few weeks after. 

This is where it gets difficult. When me and B got together I was 19 (I‚Äôm a female) and B had just turned 16 ( he‚Äôs a male). 

We got a lot of hate from the clan members that we played the game with bc of all the drama that R was starting also we us telling them  we(me and B) had got together. 
I understand that you can‚Äôt help it if feelings form between you and another person. 


This is where I need advice..

I had just turned 20 this month (July). B is still 16, and won‚Äôt turn 17 until next year. 
Our relationship is also long distance and technically an online relationship too. 
My parents approve of us dating and B‚Äôs parents approve too. 
B wants me to move in with him and his mom. Me and B is both excited to finally get to meet but I think I am more excited to get out of my own parents house bc of the way that they treat me (even tho I am 20). His mom is okay with it but there‚Äôs only one concern about me moving in. This brings us back to the age gap. 
(PSA before anyone comes at me, I have NOT persuade B to do anything at all. B is his own person and has his own mind set and is an actually very dominant person. Even his own mom will say he will do what he wants to do and no one will change his mind). 

Me, B, and his mom worried about the age gap and how people will react and how differently they would treat his mom and B if they found out how old I am.  Idk what to do about this and even I am worried about it. I need some advice on what to do. Please help me bc I‚Äôm also very stressed too.",17Jul2020,1
293," Hi, I‚Äôm (F,23) very new here. So I apologize if anything here is irrelevant. (I have Aspergers)

Almost a year ago, I met a boy (M,21) at the new school I was going to. At the time, I was already in a relationship. However, I broke up with the (Now ex) boyfriend (M, 28) as he was emotionally abusive. I won‚Äôt go into that, that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing this.

After I broke up with him, the ex continued to harass me. This gem of a guy helped me through it. Listening to my ramblings, telling me he would scare my ex off, giving me something to laugh at, and a LOT of reassurance that I never deserved this abuse. He even continues to keep an eye on my Ex‚Äôs social media in case he writes something bad about me. If the ex does, he‚Äôll let me know and will give me advice on how to go forward. Unfortunately, the ex keeps harassing me to this day.

At the same time, he‚Äôs been helping me to curb some of my impulsivity and give me advice and insights on socialization. He usually will ask me a lot of questions about my Asperger‚Äôs. He‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôm close to normal, but it‚Äôs up to me where I go. He‚Äôs also told me that he‚Äôs never met anyone as loyal as me. My friends seem to think he likes me, as he usually smiles at me in the halls or when I walk in the classroom. One friend even pointed out that she figured there was something between us and that he treats me differently.

OK, here‚Äôs the juicier stuff, he definitely seems to trust me, as we used to hang out at school at a place he really liked (Pre-Covid of course). He‚Äôs opened up to me about things. Sorry, these are things he told me in confidence, so no details. We usually take nightly walks from class to the parking lot, he once had an umbrella over me, and on the last day of school, he spent like, the whole day with me. We split off twice and he came right back to the spot he found me. A couple of times I caught him staring, and I can recall a couple time where he was doing the good kind of stalking. I once tried to ask him to a party but he had work. And after the last time I saw him in person, he sent me a message asking if I was OK. Because he saw that I was sad and he knew how much I like school.

So, I‚Äôve heard that Aspie girls tend to have a ‚ÄúMother Hen‚Äù Friend who looks out for them and gives them advice on social situations. But‚Ä¶no one‚Äôs ever told me what to do if I fall in love with them.

I wouldn‚Äôt know flirting unless it‚Äôs obvious. (He did say I was cute one time.) Not to mention, Covid definitely changed the dating game. I feel like it‚Äôs staring me in the face that he likes me, and I might be second-guessing myself. But, I‚Äôm REALLY afraid of rejection and losing this person as a friend.

There's also a 75% chance that we will not have classes together this semester. I hope this doesn't make him lose interest. How can I prevent that?

TL;DR: I think this guy likes me, and it's probably obvious.",17Jul2020,1
294,"This might be a bit long but hear me out. 

My parents especially my dad retired a few years ago. He‚Äôs always been the nicest guy, honest and hardworking persons I‚Äôve ever known. He does right by others and has always tried to inculcate values of honesty, being truthful and all in all tried to raise us to be better persons.

He sets up a high bar which is hard to match.


Here comes the kicker - He retired about 4 years ago with decent savings so he‚Äôd never have to work again. Turns out retirement is overrated- You have 24 hours in a day and you can only sleep/read newspapers/ watch tv so much. 
If you‚Äôre not either mentally or physically challenged(and/or exhausted) during the day you‚Äôll not be able to sleep.

As we‚Äôre all currently locked at home for almost 4-5 months now, with me on wfh and my brother continuing his college online we‚Äôre fairly busy most days.
Mum takes care of everything - Food, cooking, cleaning and other daily tasks(I‚Äôve lived alone for 5 years so I know the tasks are never ending) - We try to help her as much as we can from our end.

I moved back in a few years ago as I was paying a lot of rent in comparison to my measly income which I got from my firm.
Tried, worked hard, got a better job and a decent company with great colleagues. I couldn‚Äôt be happier.

What I‚Äôve noticed is that dad does not help mum at all, has a habit of snapping into anger and essentially becomes inflamed as soon as something he does wrong is pointed out.

Where I come from, we‚Äôve always been taught to respect elders and we (try) to do that. We have tried over the course of last 4 years to try to get him engaged into something- Maybe reading, teaching(he‚Äôs always been a great teacher- has taught professionally for years before he got a corporate job)

This hasn‚Äôt worked - Society has ingrained in us an idea that there‚Äôs all you do is relax after retirement which is absolutely bullshit. Spending all the time on your phone, not having a routine, not sleeping properly and being essentially addicted to a 5 inch piece of metal is fucking stupid. 
Fake news has not made it easy- He did not allow us to get our own AC fixed yet due to coronavirus. Does not switch on the AC in his room. Mum, after working so much the entire day cannot even sleep because it‚Äôs fucking 100+F here.

Whenever we try to educate him ill-effects of fake news he either shuts down and refuses to listen or becomes verbally abusive. 

Eg- He hasn‚Äôt allowed us to get a guy to fix our own AC and I‚Äôve been working essentially in a sauna bath for last 3 months. What I‚Äôve noticed in the newest messages is that they‚Äôll put in 3 things that are correct- like wear a mask/ don‚Äôt go out/ maintain distance and then Ac‚Äôs cause corona. Logically if the first 3 statements are correct the 4th one might also be correct is something which our brain will finally realize. Inundation of the same shit from various sources tends to re-confirm our opinions.


 I personally write a bit, about tech, social media and the effects it has on people. What I see in my own home(laughs in irony) that they are deeply entrenched into the cycle of believing whatever WhatsApp news cycle is showing them that day.

We had a huge fight last night as I asked him to sleep by 12-12:10 and not keep playing chess/ reading whatsapp on his phone till 1-2 am like he usually does. There was a huge blowout and he said something and I took his phone(hopefully permanently)

After the fight calmed down he tried to tell his own stories, pointed out my shortcomings (of which there are many btw) but at the end whenever we tried to tell him not to get defensive/aggressive when someone says something which is incorrect he says to leave him alone(generic response- No need to talk to me Forever, I‚Äôm not your father, and other things like that)

Now, I hope I‚Äôve provided reasonable context- I‚Äôd like your advice on how to make our parents listen. 
There‚Äôs a generation gap, educational gap(with reference to social media and internet in general) and an unwillingness to listen.

How do I tackle it.?
I‚Äôm looking for practical options, please note I‚Äôm from India so reporting to CPS is not an option- leaving my parents in their old age is not an option.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to make my parents(especially dad) listen and change.

296,"Throwaway account, and I'll try to put this as coherently as I can.  

I'm an international grad student, and over the summer I've been living with my aunt to save up money. Over the course of the summer, I made a bunch of purchases to set myself up for the future (vision/dental insurance, prepaying for my phone bill, etc.), and I also had medical expenses. All in all, I'm more or less broke now (like $0 broke).  

Over the past few weeks, my aunt has been pressuring me to find a place elsewhere, even though she told me in the beginning that I was welcome to stay for as long as I wanted (which later changed to till December and now became 2 weeks). Part of her reasoning was that I get to be with roommates and socialize more, but I don't like having roommates at all. So I spent all day searching for apartments, but they were either super far from uni (I don't have a car), had absurd deposits, or were stupidly small. As an absolute last resort, I turned to university housing, since they provide housing for emergency cases (but you do pay rent).  

The trouble is it's near impossible for me to afford it. On a month-by-month basis, it fits well into my budget, but the university charges by the semester, so I'd have to pay about $6400 (including other unrelated university fees that I had to pay anyway). The only possibility I saw was their monthly payment plan, which meant I pay 40% now, and 20% in the next two months. This meant I paid $2700 today (on a credit card), and I pay about $1300 on Aug 1 and Sep 1. This stretches me super thin. I spent hours figuring out a way to pay this over time, and I eventually did (it's not ideal, it meant not eating for a few days), but it's still tricky.  

At night, my aunt says I can stay longer if I want, and I tell her I paid a deposit and got university housing. She tells me she only said 2 weeks in a manner of saying, but she meant in the near future, and that the whole point of telling me to leave was so I live with roommates, not to kick me out. She tells me to stay with her instead. I have trouble believing her because she's done this thing twice now, so I have no reason to believe she won't do it again. She guilt trips me saying my parents (who are in a different country) are dying to see me and that I should move there for a while (yes, in the middle of a pandemic), and that I should be helping *them* financially and sending them money rather than the other way around (on my grad student stipend).  

She told me to ask to cancel housing quoting a family emergency. I'm reluctant to do it because (a) I feel bad asking for emergency housing (for a second time) and then canceling (b) my monthly payment plan (through afford.com) contract says that my payment cannot be revoked.  

I'm a little lost and need some advice.",17Jul2020,1
297,"Sorry in advance for spelling, grammar, etc. This is also long but please read it all if you can.

I‚Äôve been feeling really good recently, getting up at a normal time, eating at a normal time and having good conversations with my family and friends. 

A few hours ago I saw a video where a girl talked about her bipolar, and some stories about it. I was relating to a lot of what she was talking about, so I did some research on bipolar and realized that I had A LOT of the symptoms (like having a week or two of talking fast, having more confidence than usual, racing thoughts, lack of concentration, hyper activity, impulsivity and delusion followed by a few weeks of sadness, anger, anxiety, loss of interest in fun activities, risk taking behaviors, slowness, paranoia, suicidal thoughts and difficulty falling asleep). Some examples of these symptoms are that i stole 4 baby aloe plants off of a bigger aloe plant at Lowes, but I don‚Äôt usually like to steal. I get really anxious when standing by my window when a car drives by because I think the drivers are watching me, I think my neighbors are watching me as well and I am terrified that I am going to get kidnapped and murdered when I walk my dog. I will love how i look one week and hate myself the next. I will start arguments with my parents over dumb shit. I believe that every time I think about something embarrassing that happened in the past, the other person involved is thinking about it as well and judging me for it. I‚Äôve struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but never self harmed. Last but not least I learned about Wicca (a pagan religion) about a week ago and immediately started writing a grimoire (or a book of info about it), but I‚Äôve believed religion is fake my whole life (no hate if you practice a religion though). 

This would be a lot less worrying if I wasnt terrified about going to my parents about mental illnessess. In September my grandpa and a friend of mine (13 years old) passed away, and I sunk into a deep depression that lasted for a month or two. When I told my mom that I thought I was depressed, she told me that I wasn‚Äôt and that it would go away. eventually it did, but it was only temporary as I sunk into another one about a month later, then back up, then back down, then up to now. My mom only believed that I might have depression when I took the depression test at my doctors and I got a 6 (i think), which is a little higher than normal.

I‚Äôm 14, turning 15 in a month and I don‚Äôt want to be sad anymore, I love how I feel when I have motivation and energy, but when I get sad I lash out at my family and regret it, but cant seem to control it. I dont know who to turn too, the only people that know about my suicidal thoughts are two of my cousins that I told when one of them made a depression joke that pissed me off. But I also feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to them because they are both 13, and deal with their own problems like bullying and parental issues. I also cant go to a therapist because I live in NY, in a county that was an epicenter a few weeks ago. Plus, my mom told me to find a therapist to go to if i wanted but I get really stressed when I try and just end up not doing it.

I feel like im sinking into another depression and I dont know why, I need to figure this out soon, for my mental healths sake.",17Jul2020,1

She tried to control the amount of time I spend with my friends and when I go against her wishes she would get really upset, pouting childish shit. And it‚Äôs not like I would go days with out seeing her we spent time together almost every day. And if she‚Äôs had a bad day she‚Äôll take it out on me. And I call her out for it (in the nicest way I can while still being assertive) she will just make it an argument.

313,"Hey, I (18/f) recently got kicked out of my dads place, which is also where I grew up. I‚Äôm not a bad kid, i just don‚Äôt get along with my stepmom, and he‚Äôs kinda been losing his mind lately. Lots of complicated issues there. I can‚Äôt fathom living with them any longer. Even if my dad let me go back, I wouldn‚Äôt want to.  
I moved in with my mom, but I just can‚Äôt imagine living here very long. It‚Äôs also a rather unhealthy environment here. It‚Äôs 30 min away from my town as well. Away from my school, friends, and work. I don‚Äôt drive either. I don‚Äôt have a room nor bed here, I‚Äôve been here about 3 months, but I hate it. It‚Äôs depressing, in a bad area, I have no family on my moms side either, so it gets lonely. 
I‚Äôve told my boyfriend (18/m) about all this as well and he says that if we both got jobs, he would want to move in with me into a small studio if I really feel like I can‚Äôt live like this any longer. He was really serious when he was saying all that, and now that‚Äôs all I think about. It would be my escape. But I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good idea. 
For starters where I live and go to college, I can‚Äôt find a studio under $1000. We could make it work if we really wanted to, but we‚Äôd have to work a lot to cover all of our expenses, and I don‚Äôt want us to do poorly in school. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I could stay at my moms, but I‚Äôll be depressed and can‚Äôt see my friends or anyone often since I don‚Äôt drive and I‚Äôm so far. And I can‚Äôt work towards my license either since the dmvs aren‚Äôt taking appointments due to COVID.

I dont know what I need right now. Im dissociating. My bfs mom is going through round three of breast cancer, and its moved to her lungs. My aunt passed away from the exact same thing a year ago. A seperate aunt of mine passed away on sunday from long time health issues. 

My manager took me aside and I got written up for the second time about time issues (1-3 minutes late where I am there and present but putting my things up or washing my hands, or to my everlasting anger, communication issues where I am not told the schedule has been changed and get blamed for not being there at the scheduled time). 

The day after I slept for 17 hours had 6 alarms but somehow missed every one of them and was late. After my shift I got the call about my Aunt.

Within the next year, my great grandma and my grandma will both be passing away to cancer as well. One is reoccurring breast, and the other is small cell lung cancer, respectively. 

I got the news today that my bfs brother is covid positive. He was coming out to visit everyone about three weeks ago when someone near him started to have symptoms and he decided he better not risk it with bfs moms health the way it is. 

My car is dying and Im shopping for a new (to me) one. No matter how increased the budget is theres always something wrong or some issue or the price is too high and theres no negotiation. 

Tldr: Im overwhelmed. I feel like I am desperately trying to catch the pieces of my life as they tumble to the ground and every single piece drops throigh my fingers. People are dying. And I go in phases of eating to cope, and actively hating myself for being fat and eating.

318,"Sorry for the length! Thanks in advance to all who make it to the end! üòÖ

Ok to give some background:  I was bullied horrendously in school from 2nd grade through high school. My parents meant well but my mother had her own serious mental health issues and my father was a passive enabler. My mom was verbally and emotionally abusive, manipulative, emotionally checked out, incredibly depressed, and she constantly tried to bring me down to her level to make herself feel better. My father would force me to accept her twisted apologies because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt her fault‚Äù and ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt help it‚Äù. Because of all that, I never confided in my parents about my struggles. I attempted several times with my mom but it was clear that she was more focused and concerned about herself. My issues were an interruption and a burden to her own self pity. Anyway, I dealt with self injury from roughly 6th grade up until my senior year of college and I still struggle with horrible self esteem. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm currently in therapy! I‚Äôm 32 and finally realizing that my perception of what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is skewed. 

Anyway, to my main question! I‚Äôve discussed all these things with my therapist. The bullying, the cutting, my parents, my depression, etc. BUT there‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt discussed and I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs actually an issue for me or not. Or if it is worthy to even mention to her. 

When I was a kid, my family was sorta ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with another family down the street. My parents had two daughters (me and my sister who‚Äôs 6 years older than me). Their family had 4 daughters. One girl was my sister‚Äôs age so they were good friends. Their youngest daughter was 3-4 years older than me so we kinda hung out but I wouldn‚Äôt say we were close. Anyway, I recall many times being at her house when I was maybe 9 or 10. She was 13, maybe 14?  Anyway, she used to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù kissing on me and practice having sex on me. I can vividly remember her weight on top of me and the taste of her tongue in my mouth. She would show me what sex was by demonstrating on stuffed animals and then proceed to hump me (always with clothes on) while French kissing me. A few times her hands would explore my body but never under the clothes. I also recall her taking me across the street to where her boyfriend lived and she would have me watch them make out and ‚Äúfondle‚Äù each other. I honestly don‚Äôt remember any more than that. I can‚Äôt recall how many times all this happened but it was more than once. I never told a soul because, who world I tell? My parents didn‚Äôt care and I had zero friends. 

Fast forward to high school and I was admitted to a mental hospital at age 16 for my cutting and being suicidal. At the end of my stay, we would be having a meeting with my then-therapist and both my parents. I remember the hospital people telling me I had to show progress in order to be released and that opening up was good progress. So in the meeting I disclosed this ‚Äúabuse‚Äù to everyone and it just fell flat. It was bizarre. No one seemed to care so I thought it must not be a big deal. I mean, we were both kids, both females, etc. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt abuse and I‚Äôm still not sure. I don‚Äôt know that it affected me because I had so much other shit to deal with. I kinda just pushed the thoughts away and that was that. 

Now tho, as an adult, and now that I‚Äôve finally found a therapist I really click with, I‚Äôm wondering if this is pertinent or not? Do I bring it up? Or is it just going to seem like I‚Äôm trying to make things up? Was what happened a big deal? And does it matter if it affected me or not?? I‚Äôve never mentioned it to anyone again, not even my husband. Thoughts??? Thank you so much in advance!!",17Jul2020,1
319,"Someone I thought I trusted recommended this guy to do work around my house. Turns out he's a violent offender who does questionable work, never shows up when he says he's going to, and is definitely a professional liar. I didn't find out that he was a violent offender until I was alone with him in his car, when he proceeded to spill the beans of his violent past. Aggravated assault, more than once. He's served years in prison for it and was recently released. So that was fun to hear while I had no means of escape.

Anyway, he said the job would take a few days and it's been WEEKS. Finally he admitted to me that he actually doesn't have much experience doing what I hired him to do, but he promises it will look good in the end. I can't begin to tell you all the trouble he's been in since I hired him, but it's pretty much unbelievable. I had an argument with him the other day for lying, and I'm really scared to piss him off in case he decides to take it out on me in some terrible way later down the road. He'll say inappropriate things to me that I really don't know how to respond to. He doesn't respect me or my time and I'm so stressed and depressed over this whole thing. I finally googled his name today and there are articles describing what he did, and it's worse than I thought.

So earlier today my dad was involved in a small verbal altercation with another driver. My dad claims the other driver was driving too close (tailgating?), his best guess was that the car was 3ft from our rear bumper. My dad braked to let a car in front turn into the plaza (not 100% sure but when I looked up I did see a car turning into the plaza), and all I heard was a horn blaring from behind us.

I was looking something up, so I didn‚Äôt see anything up until that point. Looking out my dad‚Äôs side window and this guy just starts yelling ‚Äúdid you just brake check me?!‚Äù over and over. My dad just said ‚Äúyou were too close!‚Äù to which the other driver said ‚ÄúI have you all on camera, I‚Äôll see you at the police station‚Äù and sped up ahead.

I see him drive slowly the next lane over but still remaining ahead of us and next thing I know he‚Äôs got his phone extended outside of his passenger window and I‚Äôm pretty sure a picture is taken (all while this dude is still driving). But rather than turning left to where the police station was he continued on.

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with what happened today. I hate having my picture taken because of some insecurities/bullying as a kid that never really went away.

I also know my dad can have his own road rage moments so I don‚Äôt fully believe he‚Äôs innocent but I didn‚Äôt see anything until the driver pulled up beside us. That stretch of road is very known for road rage accidents or tailgaters....I‚Äôm not sure if that matters though...",17Jul2020,1
328,"So basically, I have a coworker who is pretty irrational, we will call him mike. This coworker who I've been working with for about a year has some type of disorder, and has a potential mental illness. He's gotten in trouble with the law for assaulting his mom, and he's mentioned numerous other concerning things. He's on a bit of meds based on what he's told me.

Recently he told me this lady who works at the front desk got him extremely pissed off. He stated I quote ""She got me so pissed, I was this close (ü§èüèª) to stabbing her with my pocket knife. Shortly after he mentioned he would have another time but he didn't have it on him. He is very easy to get upset over small things, he's told me stories of him getting mad at people all the time at work, every time its over something small.

I was startled when he told me this so I told my main manager out of concern for the lady and Mike. They talked with him in the back and he came out around 25-35 minutes later. Right after he came out and walked down the isle he immediately became buddy buddy. He told me ""Most would have called it snitching but I think it shows you're a good friend"". 

I don't mean to sound overly suspicious about my coworker, but knowing he mentioned wanting to stab the customer service lady because he was upset, and he has gotten in trouble numerous times for being irrational, in my mind makes it a plausible scenario to happen. I could all be wrong and its the exact opposite, but in this scenario its reasonable to see either side playing out with the evidence given.",17Jul2020,1

333,"I live in student housing. I‚Äôm 23 and my lease isn‚Äôt over till this time next year and they don‚Äôt let anybody out of their lease even for COVID. One of the rules laid out in our lease is that we are a quiet complex, basically stfu or get a lease violation. We do allow pets but only if you pay the pet deposit and register your pet. No big dogs, pitties, rotties, etc. No guests longer than 3 days due to the fact that many people don‚Äôt lease the entire apartment, they lease a room in an apartment. I live with my partner in our 2 bd. We‚Äôve lived here for almost 2 years. She lived here a year before I moved in because I had a lease elsewhere. Also I know info about their lease and registered pets because my friend works for the complex. That‚Äôs the backstory. Let‚Äôs get to the issue. 

In April our complex allowed residents to put their lease on hold and move out. Our upstairs neighbors, who were great till they got a dog in January, which they didn‚Äôt register, left thanks to the lease hold. We were like wow! Great! No more barking all day and all night. We can finally get our sleep in as I work overnight and she works days and the dog barked night and day. WRONG! They left but didn‚Äôt put all 3 of their leases on hold. Only put 2 on hold so they wouldn‚Äôt change the locks on the apartment so that their friends could come stay there. Surprise! Guess what they have? Three different dogs! 2 are forbidden breeds but I don‚Äôt care about that because I‚Äôve met some sweet pitties and rotties. We are only allowed 2 pets per apartment. The dogs are barking more than before because there are 3. They run around up and down the whole apartment all day and night, probably because they only get taken out once a day and only at night and for a short walk around the complex. The two people living there right now are not on the lease and jump around/are heavy footed like ogres. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd try to stay under the radar right? Nope.

I‚Äôve attempted to talk to them about it, they don‚Äôt care. I played dumb and asked when they moved in and they claim they‚Äôve always lived upstairs. Got their names and found out that is not the case, which I knew. I‚Äôve tried being nice for the past few months. But our sleep is lacking so bad we have permanent dark circles under our eyes and live off caffeine and Advil for the headaches from lack of sleep.

I used to be a bright student when I was in 9th and 10th grade... And the reason was absolutely clear, I had only one option to become A Doctor in future... I studied very hard always topped in the Exams and tests...  My physics and Biology was too Good... I had an interest in Biology too... But then everything changed. When I passed 10th Examinations... I went to another city to do a specific course in physics which helped in 1st-year grade but at that Time I have Introduced to not a New Concept for me but that's when I took interest in it, ENTREPRENEURSHIP...... Yeah, that's right... And then I took significance interest in it... Researched about it ., Learned about the concepts of business and all that and once I messaged someone basically he was a forex trader I asked him to teach me about trading he said okay... But when I showed him my Business side he said why not if we start a Startup he said I have the money you got skills and need to polish you ... I was very happy I mean What else I wanted... I was getting the biggest opportunity so I said Yes and then Worked on our startup idea for months... I read so many books enrolled in courses etc... At that time I took admission in 1st grade where initially I performed very well then as I said I changed my path so I didn't pay much attention to the studies as I did in Our Startup... Time passes...cleared 11th grade 3 months ago... Results weren't that good my parents said where is your focus form many months... Not studying properly talking garbage all day about business ...

350,"(Uncomfortable sharing age, im in high school)

I am diagnosed with depression and have been since 5th grade. In 6th grade, my mental health went so far down the drain I was pulled out of normal school to do online school at home. I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, I could barely eat, and at the time it was the logical solution. Except it just made things worse. It encouraged me to stay in bed and not do the basic human functions I needed to do. The selling point for online school is ‚Äúflexible scheduling‚Äù which basically meant you don‚Äôt have a deadline for when you have to turn your work in, it just has to be turned in by the end of the quarter.

I ended up passing by 3 points that year.

Fast forward to a couple months ago (March, I think?) They put the entire county on online. Even though my mental health was decent at the time, my same habits resurfaced. The thought of going onto my school site made my heart race and doing the work has sent me into full blown anxiety attacks multiple times. I ended last year with straight D‚Äôs because I physically could not do the work. 

I‚Äôve attempted to tell my therapist, my school counsellor, my doctor, pretty much anyone and everyone who could help me with this, but none of them believed me. I got the same ‚Äújust don‚Äôt worry about it, just get it done‚Äù response every single time. Luckily my mom believes me, but she‚Äôs the only one on my side.

I don‚Äôt know what to do next year, though. It‚Äôs one thing ending the year with online school, I had the credits I needed to pass by the second quarter. I was doing amazing in physical school. But starting with online school? That means I have to be reliant on my mental health staying stable long enough for me to complete an assignment. I don‚Äôt know if I could handle that or if that‚Äôs even possible.

What can I do?",17Jul2020,1
351,"So I‚Äôm kinda in the talking phase with 2 girls and obviously I‚Äôm not a asshole so if I were to ever get serious or offical I would cut or tell the other one what would happen, the issue is I don‚Äôt know which one to peruse?

The other one I‚Äôve only properly talked to for a month but known about her for a year, she‚Äôs funny much more like me, we can easily hold a convo and laugh so much, BUT I‚Äôve heard some sketchy things about her past she also has a bit of that can get very jealous and toxic type vibes, and I‚Äôve already questioned if she‚Äôs been lying about certain things.

352,"So my mom is ill, and can‚Äôt do a lot of electronic work, and didn‚Äôt want to pay out of pocket. So today she brought over my ex-stepfather without warning to have him come fix the stuff. The man has emotionally and verbally abused me for years, to the point where my self esteem is destroyed and I can‚Äôt say his name/ or call him stepfather because it triggers me. I‚Äôve gotten therapy about this, and after distancing myself for awhile, I came during quarantine from college to help my mom. My mother knows all of this, yet she still calls him, laughs with them etc. so she brought him over and he was there for 10+ hours to repair our mailbox, and I hid in my room because I can‚Äôt even look at him. I know this was wrong and childish,  but I wrote on the fridge, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not welcome here‚Äù before going back into my room. What I‚Äôm really mad about is that my mother never told me, and is upset with me because I refused to talk to her for the day. About an hour ago, 12am, I hear the inflatable bed in the garage blowing up. My mother and my stepfather have a  very on and off relationship, and she‚Äôs lied about being finally done with him. So I went into her room and told her if he‚Äôs staying for another day I‚Äôm moving out, and back in with my host family. She said I was acting like a bitch to her all day, and that‚Äôs my decision.

353,"Purchased a Saint Bernard puppy in March 2020 at 8 weeks old. Very good dog, potty trained, mouthy playful and loves to be with people.

354,"Hi, I am feeling very lost and lonely at the moment. If anyone could give me advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Here is my situation: (there are a lot of different areas, sorry haha my life is a mess currently)

I am 19 years old and a college student (although classes are online next semester due to corona). I know I am young, but I really feel like my life is stuck at the moment and I don't know what to do, where to go, who to turn to, etc. I don't even know if I want to stay in college, and if I do, I don't know what to major in. All my life, I've dreamed about being a model or actress or singer and I've always had a feeling in my gut that that is what I'm supposed to pursue? I don't know, maybe I'm just being delusional, but I've always dreamed of doing something in the entertainment industry. However, my family always tells me it is unrealistic and I've always been to nervous to give it a shot. Am I too old now to start? I wouldn't even know where to start, since I don't live anywhere near LA or NY. I am also intrigued by maybe becoming a cosmetic nurse, that is something I think I would like as well. However, if I just pursue nursing than I feel that I will always wonder what would happen if I maybe gave acting for example a shot. I keep asking God for a sign but I haven't yet and I don't know.. I'm just worried about my future career wise.

I also feel EXTREMELY lonely right now and I hate it. Recently, I cut off my toxic friends (which was 99% of my friends) and while I am glad I did it as I feel that they were holding me back,  I feel super lonely and I literally have no one (I have always felt lonely in my life though, I feel like I just get taken advantage of my kindness and get used in all my friendships). Since corona and quarantine started in March, I have not seen one person outside of my family whom I live with, and even them I am not super close with and I can't really tell them things. I was fine with it at first, because 1) I genuinely like being alone, just not LONELY and 2) everyone was stuck in the house so I didn't feel like I was the only one. But now I see on social media people are starting to go out again and go on with their lives, and I'm not. I have no one to hang out with, no one to talk to, just no one at all. Everyday I spend my time alone in my room, and everyday is the exact same as the one before. My life is so boring and it makes me so depressed. I try to be somewhat productive and workout or read but even that isn't working anymore. I don't know how I am going to make friends, since classes are online and once again I am going to be stuck in the house alone. While I was in college before corona, I didn't make any real friends either, and maybe that's my fault because I didn't try hard enough, I don't know. With my old toxic friends, I felt that I could never be myself around them and I always scared of being judged and they overall just made me feel horrible about myself. Cutting them off was like weight lifted off my shoulders, and I don't regret it one bit. I am proud of myself for that, because my whole life I've always been a doormat for people and was always too timid and afraid to stand up for myself. But now what? Am I just going to be alone forever? I don't know how to make friends now. I know everyone in my area as it is pretty small, and I don't feel like I belong. I never did in high school either. I want to move but again, how? What if it is just the same thing? Plus, I am still living with my parents and I'm just a college student. Someday I dream of moving to France or Italy though, and making real true friends along the way but I just don't know how to get to point A to point B if that makes sense. 

I want to have a fun life. I want to have friends, have a boyfriend, be happy, all of it. But I feel like my whole life is just a big nothing. I haven't really traveled, I haven't made any true friends, I've never had a boyfriend, I do good in school but I often lose motivation and my grades suffer from that. I dream about being a mother, and being in love and getting married, and I am even scared that I won't find anyone. I've been depressed my entire life, and while I know my life could be MUCH worse, and I am very grateful for all that I DO have, I've just never been happy and never feel like I am loved, or worthy. Nothing scares me more than having my life stay the way that it is now, forever. Yes, I know I'm young, not even in my 20's yet, and yes I know that many feel lost at this stage in their life, but I don't have anyone to turn to or anyone tell me what I should do. Every time I tell my mom, who I do not have the best relationship with, about everything I've mentioned, she tells me I'm ungrateful and to get over it and it just turns into an argument. 

All in all, I just want to be happy and be loved in life. Sorry this was long and all over the place, I hope I made sense lol. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it, especially if you were at all in the same position as me at some point in your life. Thank you so much!!",17Jul2020,1

359,"I (f14) have an 11 month old baby sister. It‚Äôs a bit tiring to take care of her because she seems to get in trouble a lot more than most babies. Something my mom loves to do is just leave her around the house and blame it on me and my 3 younger brothers because ""it‚Äôs *OUR* job to take care of Val"". My mom is and has always been a stay at home mom, so it‚Äôs not like she has work to do or anything. She also hired not one, not two, but *THREE* maids to help take care of me and my siblings, and more importantly; Val, and to help clean the house. They still come to my house even if corona is pretty bad in my country. All three of them mostly come in at different days. I don‚Äôt agree with it because it seems very irresponsible to me. I find it really unfair that my mom makes US take care of Val while she has three maids, and plenty of free time. I have to fill out a bunch of high school applications, and I have to attend a lot of online meetings, she knows that, my mom just doesn‚Äôt care. Even if we are busy, she‚Äôll make us take care of Val while she gets to play on her phone or whatever. Also, when Val starts asking for food, or when she gets tired, she refuses to take her. Even if she starts crying, my mom will refuse to take her, and she will say it‚Äôs ""my job"" to take care of her, and that she ""deserves a break"". Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she does take care of Val and all, but idk. Even if she is in the same room as us, she will make us stop what we are doing to take care of her, while she just chats with friends on her phone, because it‚Äôs ""not her job to take care of Val"". 
She will also get mad at us us if we don‚Äôt take care of her, even if she didn‚Äôt mention anything about taking care of her. She also expects us to multitask, like cleaning our rooms while taking care of Val and stuff like that.

360,"I have 13 yo family dog named Chip who is some type of Shepherd mix, but a large dog approximately hundred pounds. He was diagnosed with hip dysplagia when he was 7 and underwent a surgery at that time to help him walk. He has been on heavy pain medication since. For the past three-four months, he has been suffering worsening mobility most likely due to his hip dysplagia with significant muscle loss in his hind legs. At this point, he is unable to get up by himself and unable to walk more than five to ten minutes unassisted. He is also incontinent but will go #2 outside if we walk him at the right times. 

The thing is, Chip still has an appetite and seems to want to go outside. We started using a make-shift harness in order to lift his hind legs so that he can walk longer than five to ten minutes. As of now, we are basically monitoring him constantly so that we can hear him whine when he wants to get up. My sister offered to basically provide palliative care 18 hours/day by making sure he is a few feet away and holding him up when he needs to go #2 because he will fall without someone holding him up. He fell about about six times earlier in the week, but has not had any falls in the past couple days.

She also bought him a doggy wheelchair which we tried today. He did not walk very far, had a relatively faster walk about ten feet out the door. But understandably it is something that he isn't used to so he did not walk much after that. He was also pretty tired from trying it so that is probably why he did not go very far. Decided that we should try again in the evening when it's cooler

Later on today, my sister got him a bone to give him something to do during the day other than sleep. The problem is that his elbows are sprawled outwards and he can't position his front paws forward/center enough to hold the bone when chewing. We would have to hold the bone for him if he wants to chew it. We then realized that his upper arms are weakening because his chest is mostly supporting his upper body up rather than than his elbows. We later had to adjust his front legs while sitting, and he growled and barked at us when both of us attempted to touch his shoulders. Keep in mind, he has never barked at us in all thirteen years, but there was a clear sign of pain. I adjusted his front legs the night prior, and it was fine so we are considering that the wheelchair test today could have injured him, but we can't know for sure.

As for vet consultation, our local vet last saw him about 5 months ago when he was still able to walk and get up on his own at home. During the visit, Chip was slipping and had a lot of difficulty on the tile floors. The vet recommended he should be put down then from what she saw, but at home his mobility was fine. I had a phone consult with two more vets recently, one who did not give a recommendation but gave valid reasoning for both sides. The other told me that she would have put Chip down if it was her dog even if she was able to give the palliative care that my sister is providing. We have an in-person pet appointment in three days. I wanted it earlier, but we are waiting because my sister may want to try out the wheelchair more.

I applaud my sister for doing all the work to make him happy because most people would not go through the efforts that she has done. But she is considering trying out the wheelchair again because there is a chance that it can significantly improve his quality of life if it works. Albeit, it can also injure him more

Sorry for the long post, but this has been an extremely stressful week for me and the rest of my family. Considering his limited mobility and who knows how much pain he is in, we have been back and forth considering putting him down. However, this is our first dog, so we don't really know when it's time. I was hoping to get feedback from this community about your thoughts or experiences with dogs with similar situation. Any help is appreciated, thanks!",17Jul2020,1

Hi, I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I've posted this on r/autism and r/aspergers but for some reason it is not showing up, and I'm just needing some second opinions. 

I am a 19F NT lesbian who has been working at a craft store for about three months now. I met my coworker (Let's call her T) on my first day. T is a 25F lesbian. She didn't introduce herself like my other coworkers did, and we didn't talk too much. She seemed shy and very reserved. I caught her staring at me often, and later checking me out once when she gave me a ride home. A month into working here, I realized that I liked her, and so for the last two months I have been slowly getting to know her, I'll make little jokes, ask her about her life etc. She's picked up on some jokes, but a lot of my jokes have been taken in a literal sense by her. She speaks in a monotone voice, and she is a very straight to the point person. When I speak to her, it seems that sometimes she doesn't pick up social cues. 

Anyways, we had began to talk a lot more. We were both looking for new jobs. I picked up a second job and she is now in the process of leaving this one. I bought her a journal, and decorated it. We had been texting a bit more at this point, and I tried to make hints that I liked her, and she would seem to be in a very good mood the next day at work after texting back and forth. She'd always answer my messages immediately, she talked to me on the phone for 15 minutes on our days off when I wanted to vent about something to her, and she was giggling a bit on the phone when I asked if she'd miss me when she left, saying ""maaaaaaaybe"". I asked her that same question weeks earlier in person, and she told me she would miss me because I'm silly. And then said if I ever had problems with math I could call her. 

I found out she was leaving earlier than expected, and she gave me a ride home Monday. I asked her if she was excited to see her gift, and she said she was. I gave it to her, and she looked at it with genuine happiness it seemed. She said she really liked it and thanked me. On the last page, I taped a photo of myself smiling and wrote ""just so you don't forget who gave this to you."" She sort of stroked the page with the photo and laughed at the halloween decorations I was posing with. I told her I needed to tell her something, and I said ""I don't know how to tell you this, and I know you're leaving, but I like you. I know there's probably no point in telling you, but I just wanted to be honest with you and share my feelings."" She was silent, told me she had suspected for some time, then said she didn't feel the same. She then proceeded to laugh really hard (at me/my feelings it seemed), and I said goodbye awkwardly and kind of just walked back into my house in shock as she drove off.

I have had passing thoughts of wondering if she was on the spectrum, but never thought any more about it. I spoke to my therapist today who said she thought so too‚Äî even before I mentioned my passing thoughts. 

I know no one is able to diagnose her, but I would love some second opinions and thoughts about the whole situation. I felt like there were a lot of mixed signals from her. I didn't understand why she would seemingly flirt back and forth with me, check me out and  text me back and forth saying she really liked and smiled at the corny pick-up lines I'd send her. 

After speaking with my therapist today, I realized that she may have not been laughing *at me* in the car, and that maybe me expressing my emotions was uncomfortable for her. I am surprised she said she didn't like me, and have just been more confused than anything. How can I better understand people around me as someone not on the spectrum? I feel that I have a pretty clear indication of when someone likes me / is just a friend but after this I am questioning everything. Thank you so much!!",17Jul2020,1

367,"Hello, sorry for the weird title. I'm on mobile so formatting may not be great. Also, this may not be as interesting as the other stories. 

I (13f) is the middle cousin in my family. Basically, I have 4 other cousins I see multiple times a month. The younger two are siblings and the older two are also siblings. Being the middle cousin I've always been left out and no one wants to hang out with me. My cousins are Alayna (10f) , Malakai (11m), Dylan (14m), and Kaylynn (16f). 

 To get started, this week my younger cousins (Alayna and Malakai) went toy older cousins house. We all prefer to go over there because they have the biggest house and a pool. I already knew of this and didn't really mind as we all go over there on our own or together. 

Today, my mom told me that they all went on a boat trip. I was a bit upset that they didn't invite and I knew they would be telling me all about it. I knew this because they went on a boat trip a few years ago without me. They talked about it for a year or two and I didn't like feeling left out. I've only been on a boat once or twice. 

I wanted to make sure it was true so I texted Alayna and Kaylynn. Alayna didn't reply at first so I texted Kaylynn. She replied that yeah, they did. I just replied with cool. With that, she asked if I was jealous. I didn't feel like replying so I left her on seen. My younger cousin than replied and said yeah. She asked if I wanted to come. I told her yes, because I felt left out the last time. It sort of hurt when my older cousin asked of I was jealous. 

Now, Malakai is turning 12 in a day or so. So everyone is coming down and staying at his house. I was planning on going over tomorrow to stay the night. (At first I didn't want to stay but then realized I would be left out. They talked about how much fun they had the last time I didn't stay) After I heard the whole boat trip I want sure if I wanted to go because I know they'll keep telling me about it. 

So, I'm not sure if I should stay or not.

368,"Hi. I (21) have just started a part time job at a local coffee chain. So far I haven‚Äôt been a fan. Several times my boss has already gotten mad at me for small things I am still learning.

Talking with the counselors are absolutely useless because they don't care about the students at all. Recently I have been thinking about a transfer to a better school but I am just so scared that it might affect my college applications and my admission chances. I really don't know what to do anymore... 

This part will be about college. I have no dream schools or any dream major or dream career. Don't get me wrong I am very dedicated to my academics and I have good grades. But I have no idea what I want to do in the future. When I tell people this, they usually ask me, ""well, what do you like to do?"" I would love to answer that question but I literally can't because I DONT KNOW. I have hobbies and stuff but none of them can be seen as a career. At this point I am just giving up. I have gotten this terrible mentality of just thinking anything is fine. I will just go into a random major and get a random job and live a random life. But I really hate that part of myself, I really hate myself for thinking that. I don't want to become what I just describe. I am so lost.

Now the education part is over... Life.... I live alone with my grandpa while the rest of my entire family is in China. When I say entire, I mean ENTIRE. Both my parents, my younger brother, my other grandparents, all my aunts, uncles, cousins, and etc... My family sent me here to America because they wanted me to study aboard. It's been 8 years since... I mean I have gotten used to being independent and stuff but time to time I just feel so alone. Even though my parents are very much alive physically, I feel as if I have lost them completely. It's been 9 months since I last saw my mom and maybe 2-3 years since I last saw my dad... I can't even remember the numbers anymore... A lot of times I sit and just think to myself why tf am I here alone in this foreign country with close to zero family. I want my parents back, I want my family back. I love my parents so much and it's so damn awful to see the distance between me and them grow every single day. I know they secretly cry sometimes because of their decision to send me here, I know they feel the pain of ""losing"" their daughter. But there is no turning back, I can't just return back to China and go to school there, that would literally be detrimental. The only way I could go back to China is if I go to college there.

I dont have any thoughts of suicide or self harm, but thinking the way i do does more harm than anything else to me. There are so many things i can nitpick about myself that i hate, but to sum it up, i have no self control. 

The person i want to be, and the person controlling my body are polar opposites. I want to be quiet, mature, and gentle, but when i get excited, all of my morals fall into a ditch. For example, i‚Äôm a leader of a section in my school‚Äôs marching band, and while most of the time i would stick with my desired persona, when i would become frustrated with them, it was often i would yell or something uncontrollably and regret it right after. Additionally, even outside of marching band, sometimes i may dictate instructions rudely to my peers, as my only thought is to get my point across. I become way too forceful when things aren‚Äôt going as planned. However im always aware of my actions whilst i perform them. Yet i still execute. This is why i hate myself.

Advice like just bulldoze through it, or youll grow it out, or just keep looking forward, or love yourself wont mean anything to me. Ive tried to speak of my feelings once before, and those are the only responses. But words like those are just common speech.

I have been friends with Samantha for years and I make it my mission to support my friends‚Äô businesses so she is the only lash technician I use. 

June 10 I had gone to Sam to get my lashes done and about 5 or 6 days later I observed that there was a complete difference in the amount of shedding and twisting I would normally experience at that point in time when she does my lashes. Now normally when you‚Äôve gotten lash extensions done you‚Äôre not supposed to sleep on your face as it contributes to shedding. I sleep on my sides habitually, which means that at any given time while I am asleep either the left side of my face or the right side is in direct contact with the pillow. Rightfully we have always recognised this as the reason for my constant and early shedding.

When I noticed I immediately got on the phone with her to express how I am so in love with how well they are holding up and that whatever she is doing differently is working great as I am experiencing little to no shedding. She began to tell me the different products she is using, most importantly that she‚Äôs using a completely different adhesive along with some new things such as a primer and a sealant. On the phone she was so glad and grateful to hear my comments and that I made her day and that I should type the message to her so that she could be able to post it as a review on her page. So I did exactly what she asked for, sent her what I communicated on the phone that I feel there is a difference and I‚Äôm in love with it. She responded with gratitude. 

Hours later I saw that she sent me some more messages saying how she is not going to use my review and how normally I‚Äôd say the shedding and twisting is as a result of my sleeping habits and she would normally take my word for it as such then she went on a whole spiral saying that if I felt she was doing something wrong before I should have communicated that. She also went on to say that she feels as if I have always been withholding how I really feel about her job with my lashes as there was another instance when she had made them a bit long and I didn‚Äôt really say anything until she asked (they were still beautiful just a bit out of my comfort zone - I didn‚Äôt feel the need to criticise).

My thing is I don‚Äôt see where I have in anyway offended her or her technique as I genuinely wanted to congratulate her that she is doing great as I am sleeping the same way and doing the same things and I am experiencing hardly any negatives that I already would have been. How I see it also is that for her to be using a new adhesive which is the main determinant in how well the lashes come out, explains the positive difference in my current experience.

She is upset at me and is making it seem as if I am a bad friend and that I have been lying to her. Any advice?",17Jul2020,1
386,"Hi there, 35F here. I do quite a bit of hiking and outdoor activities, sometimes in more remote areas, almost always with friends.

389,"Hi everyone, before I begin I would like to apologize as I am new to the reddit platform and if I miss some key rules about reddit posts just know that this is actually my first post.

Now I guess I just jump right in, I'm a 17 year boy who is a rising senior in highschool. I mostly spend my days drawing and doing homework and I have a couple of friends I speak to occasionally (on good days really). During the whole quarantine thing I have had a lot of time to think about my situation though, as many of us have. With all of this thinking I start to fear for my future (and if I come off as a little selfish I truly apologize). I have never had luck socially, especially with people I don't know. I think this comes from the fact that I have a genetic disorder called epidermolytic hyperkeratosis which makes my skin really flaky. I feel that I may be self conscious of my condition as when I was younger I was verbally and sometimes physically bullied because of it. lately though (the past year) I have been working on trying to speak with people to help myself with getting to know people as I fear in college I will be surrounded with people I don't know. The first question I pose is simply, how do other people get over the way they see themselves? everyone has issues and no one is perfect but it seems like some people can put it together and I just don't know how they manage. Is it a good routine? a job?lots of friends? someone who supports them even with their flaws?

secondly, and I guess this would naturally follow. How does someone find confidence in failure? over the past couple of years I have certainly had a few crushes and this is only natural (at least I hope it is). And when I used to talk about it with the few friends I have (who all have their own romantic partners) they always tell me to make a move before it's too late. This never seemed to work though and I have been rejected 16 times. I know the right person is out there for me somewhere and I don't hold any grudges, but I feel that my confidence (if there was any) is waning and people always say the most attractive thing is confidence. I fear that it is my failures that cloud my self image and I don't know how other people deal with the same kinds of things.

Anyways I apologize if I've offended anyone and I want to thank those who have taken the time to read my post.",17Jul2020,1
390,"tldr: I‚Äôm sucking at my job because of adhd, transgender spouse, anxiety, sadness; do I disclose this to my boss? 

Boy - 2020, am I right? Early this year, my spouse began their transition to the opposite gender. That on its own has been a large weight on our marriage as we navigate family, friends, sex, and love. They began taking hormones a month ago. 

COVID itself has been hard on me. I was diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of the quarantine because it has been a serious struggle to focus and get shit done like never before.

I can‚Äôt get work done, I forget everything. I procrastinate and forget to respond to emails and I miss meetings. It‚Äôs a nightmare.

He lied about his age, but only by two years.

There is a guy at work I kind of talk to. He asked me how old I was. I told him I'm 30, then came the usual ""you don't look 30... Blah blah blah"". 
Next he asked me to guess his age. I already know he's 28 because it's on his Facebook, but I didn't want to be weird so I guess 26, then 28. But he said ""Nope I'm 30"".
Later I double checked Facebook and it still says he was born 1991. Then I did some ""research"" and all the people finder pages says he's 28.

Two years is not a big deal at all, so I'm really confused about what his intentions were with that lie. I found myself in a thought trap, trying to figure out what's going on lol.

Is this a red flag? To lie about something so pointless?

399,"I know this might sound a bit dumb, especially for someone who‚Äôs 19yrs old, but I‚Äôve always had a rough time making friends all my life. I‚Äôm not here to give you my life‚Äôs sob story, but there‚Äôs some insecurities that make me hesitate, so here‚Äôs a bit of a backstory.

Pretty much in school, I‚Äôve always been that shy kid that didn‚Äôt speak that much and tend to go do other things on my own terms rather than staying with the group, the ‚Äúweird‚Äù kid as you will. I‚Äôve grown up with a condition that causes hearing loss at random, practically born with it but wasn‚Äôt officially diagnosed until I was 10. With my hearing loss at a young age, I developed a speech impediment, which causes me to repeat myself a lot. As I‚Äôve grown up, I‚Äôve had the realization that I don‚Äôt really have any friends, sure I knew some people but they were all acquaintances more or less, just kids that were at my table. At this time I‚Äôve been playing games on Xbox360 and made quite a few friends, but over time, they disappear. That‚Äôs understandable with internet friends, but this made me realize even more how bad my speech impediment is. I‚Äôve gotten confused for a guy countless times that there‚Äôs still people on my friends list that think I‚Äôm a guy to this day, but it‚Äôs sad that my voice is mistaken for that of a guy‚Äôs. It makes me second guess my voice, I remember the first time I heard my own voice, I couldn‚Äôt understand what I said -let alone, it didn‚Äôt even sound like me. This added to my insecurity and has halted my dream of streaming  and making videos on YouTube to a hard stop, hearing my voice for hours trimming down footage made me go into an absolute breakdown. 

Fast forward to my last two years of high school, my two friends that I had known since 7th grade dropped out of marching band, leaving me in a group of 30 acquaintances who don‚Äôt even talk to me, one friend was bullied out of school by my own ‚Äúfriend‚Äù group, and my bf at the time caused me to fight my other friend because they‚Äôre related and since I was in the middle of the two and I yet to realize my bf was manipulative and emotionally abusive, I was pressured into breaking ties with my only other friend. With all of this going on, I felt alone, this is when every little thing that was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me really got to my head. I started avoiding people overall for fear of them judging the way I talk or avoiding people who I can‚Äôt understand with my half hearing just to not waste their time on me, I started severely distrusting everyone‚Äôs opinion, I was borderline mute. This went on for about 2yrs, the last year of high school, and a year after. I got VR on the whim and there I met some more people who I‚Äôd see once and never again. A year ago from now, I met two very patient people who broke my long streak of being a mute to everyone that wasn‚Äôt my parents or siblings. I‚Äôm really glad that I met these two amazing people -and later on, one more of their mutual friend- but I feel that my group is falling apart. One of these three people I‚Äôm dating, one of them had feelings for me but I had to deny, and one of them knows everything in between. Wednesday was our 1yr anniversary and I realize that our group is falling apart and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. My bf helps me out when I‚Äôm down and I explain my feeling about how we spent the day, one of the friends just disappeared without a trace, which makes us all worried. My bf told me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find your people‚Äù, after I told him that him and the other two friends are all I have anymore. I want to make friends, especially on VRChat since I can‚Äôt go outside, but I don‚Äôt know how to even interact with people anymore. I don‚Äôt want to rely on 3 friends, they have other friends outside of the group, but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm that one person who sits alone all day until one of them gets home. How do I make friends and keep/ maintain a engaging friendship?

I didn‚Äôt think anything of us interacting because it didn‚Äôt seem out of the ordinary at first but as time went on and we started talking, he started being creepy. Calling me pet names like ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù, ‚Äúbaby‚Äù, etc. and making flirtatious comments. I‚Äôm not sure where the laws stand on this or whether he‚Äôs just yet another standardcreepy guy. In my eyes, I view it as a bit p*dophilic for him to do so but I don‚Äôt want to make allegations especially because I‚Äôm in the gray area between legal and illegal.

I am aware that I‚Äôm not the only young girl he talks to. He seems to have a preference for specifically 16 year old girls as a disproportionate amount of his friends fit this demographic (including me). I know the age of consent where he lives is 16, so it‚Äôs not exactly illegal. What I‚Äôm wondering is if this is something I can report to the server owners and hopefully get him off the staff team and not be in a position of power anymore. I‚Äôm not sure about the legalities of this, but as far as I was aware until recently, someone over the age of 18 making moves on someone under the age of 18 was considered not only creepy, but illegal.

I‚Äôm confused about this. I don‚Äôt know whether I should report him to some of the higher ups or just block him and leave it alone. Not sure where this stands in terms of adult dating a minor as again I‚Äôm 16 and the line is blurry. What does online etiquette say about a 20 year old making advances towards a 16 year old? Should I report him to the server owners? I have a feeling he‚Äôll be using his staff position to meet more young girls like me and the thought of it makes me sick.",17Jul2020,1

So given the advice of Reddit and all of my friends I‚Äôm stepping towards taking the matter to the police BUT... I‚Äôm only hesitant because I wasn‚Äôt screaming for my life.. I wasn‚Äôt exactly scared at that moment in time I was just scared for what could happen.. I‚Äôve made a report to the police and what‚Äôs happened is on record but I haven‚Äôt actually opened the case for investigation or anything, they just know about it for if I do want to take it further. 

He called me and literally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a boy what do you expect‚Äù and was really just like ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and ‚Äúalright‚Äù and seemingly didn‚Äôt care, so after I gave him that chance to explain himself I texted him and said basically right I‚Äôm reporting him to his superiors at the army and the police since I can‚Äôt even get a genuine sorry kind of thing and then that was followed with multiple phone calls which I answered and said ‚Äúyou blocked me so you can‚Äôt want to talk to me‚Äù (as he did block me ok social media) and hung up and on the 3rd or 4th call I answered and it lasted about half an hour and this time he properly explained himself and apologised and said to him it was just that ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want to have sex but you offered to suck me off‚Äù but yet... it‚Äôs not that simple? I felt threatened to? What could he have done if I completely rejected him which I was trying to do but he wasn‚Äôt having any of it?

I just feel as if if I was dragged kicking and screaming into a bush i could very evidently call that rape and sexual assault but because it happened how it did and I didn‚Äôt feel threatened in that moment just about what could happen after I just don‚Äôt know... he said to me ‚Äúif you would of said no and told me to take you home I would of‚Äù and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of that. No should of meant no from the start I shouldn‚Äôt of had to get angry and demanded he dropped me home. Him trying to put his penis in me when I kept saying no is literal attempted rape and I recognise that but it just happened so calmly... he wanted me to just sit back and take it and enjoy it it wasn‚Äôt like I was crying or shaking but no still wasn‚Äôt the answer he wanted. I feel as if he wanted it to be consensual.

414,"So after a messy divorce my mother and I got an apartment together. We don‚Äôt have a lot and we live in California so the best we have is a two bedroom where she, my sisters, and I live in. I love my mom and sister and have no complaints even though we live in close quarters. I never really thought about moving out unless my mother decides to remarry or move in with someone. 


Well she has a boyfriend she was seeing until out of no where it stopped. It‚Äôs not that I dislike him-I don‚Äôt really know him- I‚Äôm just not a fan of him being at the apartment all the time. But even that I could tolerate. 


What I can‚Äôt is the fact that she has him sleeping in her bed...in the room we share. Now idk if I‚Äôm being overly sensitive or what but I‚Äôm not a fan of sleeping in the same room as both of them. Our room is small and the space between our beds is three feet at most. It‚Äôs creepy. I‚Äôve sleep downstairs on the couch when that happens. 

But it seems to be happening more. He‚Äôs been at our home for three days this week already and I hate the couch. I want to sleep in my room on my bed. They normally don‚Äôt bother if I‚Äôm already in the room but when I was laying down she made him come in and lay down with her so I just left. It made me pretty angry but I let it go.

My mother and I generally get along- we have our disagreements, but we have a great relationship. However it‚Äôs not secret that I‚Äôm not a fan of the fact that her bf stays over so much.

418,"When I was a child around 5, I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. What I mean by that is I didn‚Äôt understand that touching myself was such a taboo thing to do and would often just do it with the door open, in front of my parents or grandparents etc. I just knew that it felt good and helped me fall asleep. There was a few time where I fell asleep in that position and when I woke up my dad would show me a photo or video he took because he ‚Äúthought it was funny‚Äù. I know for a fact he sent some of them to relatives to ‚Äúbe funny‚Äù as well. My clearest memory of one of these situations was at a small party my parents had with some family friends. There was 10+ adults over 30 and most were men. I remember my dad telling them about falling asleep with my hand down my pants etc and being super embarrassed especially when he showed them photos. 

They all laughed at me and my dad told me to lay on the floor in front of them and show them. He asked his six year old daughter to sexually touch herself in front of 30+ year olds men? 

Another memory I have is when I woke up and didn‚Äôt have my pj bottoms on. They were hanging, folded, on the end of my bed. Someone put them there. I asked my mom why I didn‚Äôt have my pants on (I know for a fact that I fell asleep with them on, they were my absolute favorite pjs) and she said ‚Äúoh you must have taken them off in your sleep‚Äù or something along the lines of that they must‚Äôve fallen off. I didn‚Äôt see anything weird about that at the time but I felt squeamish the rest of the day and felt something was wrong. That was when I was around 7. 

I do not know if my dad still has these photos and videos of me or if the incident with my pajamas being off when I woke up even means anything.

428,"TLDR at the bottom 

For those of you not aware, in simple terms Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat is a simple experimental theory in that if you place a cat in a box with something that could kill it, you wouldn‚Äôt know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box. So in a sense, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time. 

Hence where the phrase ‚Äúcuriosity killed the cat‚Äù came from. 

So here is my dilemma:

I‚Äôve recently split with an ex. It‚Äôs tough. Not my choice but it was amicable and for the best. I think I‚Äôm taking it worse than she is but that‚Äôs another story. 

I needed to contact her about some stuff to get from her flat and asked if I could call in the evening. She said she was busy. 

Now here‚Äôs some key points:

1. Who is too busy for a 5 minute phone call? 
2. She never says she is ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù she would normally tell me what she is doing (e.g going for a run with a friend) 
3. She has been logging on to Facebook messenger more often than normal. 

Now in my stupid, overthinking and somewhat fragile mind, I have added those facts together and deduced she must be with another a guy (a broken heart makes you think illogically at times). 

The fact is, even if she is, she has every right to do so. And it‚Äôs none of my business, even if it is only a couple of weeks after. (Bit of a side note on why we split; she couldn‚Äôt see herself settling down and didn‚Äôt want kids and marriage, where as I did. So the thought of her starting another relationship with someone else makes me think she was lying to me...). 

Anyway, here‚Äôs where Schr√∂dinger comes in: 

The ‚Äúcat‚Äù if you like, is her. The ‚Äúbox‚Äù is her Facebook messenger details still logged on to my iPad. (Can you see where this is going?) 

Now I haven‚Äôt looked. But the temptation is there. A click of a button would allow me to see if she has been talking with someone else and arranging to meet etc, which would confirm my theory, but hurt me. Alternatively, it could put my mind at ease. 

Or, I don‚Äôt look; because it‚Äôs not my business. It‚Äôs not my right and that‚Äôs a breach of her privacy. However, I then have to live with this theory eating away at me. 

What should I do?

Oh and please try to empathise somewhat with me and don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúyou have no right to do that‚Äù- at least give me some philosophical justification!

TLDR: ex gf log in details still on my iPad. I suspect she is seeing someone else so soon after we split, do I invade her privacy to find out or not?",17Jul2020,1

433,"My eldest brother Adam (35) has been strange for all of my life. He would always refuse family vacationing and other family activities. He was physically abusive toward my other brothers and myself, myself receiving it the harshest and the most frequent.

Anyhow, Adam recently married a girl who was formerly involved with a relative of ours. She's a known habitual liar and manipulator. She has conjured up the most bizarre scenarios that I have ever heard of. No one in my family was pleased about this relationship and completely shocked that they married. I'll get back to her.

My family just caught wind that Adam and his wife are in the midst of breaking up. Recently and suddenly though, Adam accused one of our brothers, Travis, of sleeping with his ex girlfriend. Adam then sent Travis AND OUR MOTHER a text message of these accusations. This prompted a heated discussion between Adam and my mother. Adam proceeded to tell our mother that she was a terrible mother and that his father was right about ""everything""  (his father left him as an infant and our (Travis and I) dad stepped in to care for him at that point). Adam told mom that she knows nothing about marriage and therefore is lonely and bitter. He also claimed that she loved our dad more than his, although our father eventually abandoned us as well. 

My family thinks that his wife is behind this whole thing! This sounds crazy but here are just a few things she said that have been proven false: (1) she's a licensed healthcare professional (2) she has a master's degree (3) Adam's ex girlfriend auditioned to be in an open relationship with her and Adam's neighbors (4) she was adopted (5) Adam's ex girlfriend called Child Services on her from another city, despite having no address for the report. It gets so much deeper. She is obsessed with Adam's ex girlfriend and whatever she says about her, Adam believes. She wasn't even around for their relationship! 

I just don't know what to make of this. Travis and my mom have ceased all communication with Adam and I'm torn. Adam has done not-so-loving things to me in the past and this has caused me to distance myself from him over the years. I'm afraid to cut him off because I think he possibly suffers from a mental illness, especially considering how he believes the Hollywood lies that his wife tells.

436,"I think I‚Äôm going to need a large loan for this INSANE tax problem I‚Äôm facing 

**Loooooong story short:** I inherited an IRA, and I needed to pay inheritance tax out of the IRA, but since I‚Äôm under 70 anything I pull out is taxed as income. Meaning if I pull out this money to pay tax, it will set off a tax-spiral, effectively draining the whole account. The only way out is to take out a loan to pay these taxes, and then repay it from the IRA in small amounts on an annual basis to not fuck me tax wise. So basically, I need a loan, for assets I actually have on hand, but retirement assets don‚Äôt count as something you can use as collateral for a loan. It‚Äôs a WEIRD situation, but just trust me this is the situation I‚Äôm in. 

**long story even shorter** So, I need a loan for a large amount of money, but for the duration of the loan I will actually have the assets to pay it off at any time, it‚Äôs just smart for tax reasons for me to pay it off bit by bit annually. 

I can‚Äôt get a loan for this amount on my own, I‚Äôm 25 with no assets outside of this IRA. I would need someone to co-sign, the only person I know with money is my dad and he has a whole new family and is really bitter about having to pay child support for me and my brother while we were growing up bc he didn‚Äôt want us. 

Is it weird to ask a parent to co-sign a loan? There‚Äôs effectively no risk in this loan, because I‚Äôll have the assets to pay it off on-hand, but I don‚Äôt know if this is something people ask their parents for help with",17Jul2020,1
437," I am **R** (23F) and I have one brother, **A** (24M).

**BACKSTORY**: When I was about 5 years old, my parents hired a babysitter, **H** (then, 20M) to watch us for 3 hrs every day. My parents trusted **H** as he was helpful and respectful of them. (**H** is currently married with kids)

He arrived before my mom left for work and tricked us into closing our eyes, during which he used to peep into the bathroom while mom showered. Once she left, **H** used to make us ""play games"" where I was away from **A**, and **H** sexually abused me. This happened very often, and even in instances when our cousins visited, who were almost the same ages as us. My cousin (**S**, 25F) was also abused by **H** whenever she was here.

Although neither of us spoke up at the time of the abuse, being kids and unaware of Good Touch/Bad Touch. Years later, when we confided in each other and shared our stories, we realized what had been done to us.

**NOW**: **S** and I were discussing the trauma we have been through and we decided to tell our respective parents about it. Our reasons-

* **H** is still welcomed dearly as a guest to our home whenever he is in the country.
* Being more aware today of the stigma around speaking up against sexual abuse (Note: I live in India and talking about this is considered a taboo) I would like to prevent any further abuse because of him.
* Living with this trauma has scarred and affected both, **S** and I. I have been suffering from anxiety and breakdowns since the pandemic and have been taking therapy for the same. For our mental peace, we decided to tell the parents about it finally.

I told my brother (**A**) about my intentions of telling our parents about the abuse, expecting his support. (**A** having been made aware of the abuse a few years ago). **A** said that telling them now would achieve nothing and would simply make them feel guilty and experience regret, self-loathing, and sorrow at my ordeal. Since the incident was so long ago it will just make them horribly regret their past actions.

My intention was never to speak up for taking revenge or to hurt anyone, and especially my parents, but only to feel heard and understood. When I mentioned about preventing abuse to other kids, he told us it would only be useful if we reached out to **H**'s circle and the kids and their parents who he might be interacting with.

When I insisted I would share my experience with them nevertheless, he couldn't understand how I could cause such pain to the people I love. **A** believes my intention is just to watch them in pain and depression and that they have failed at parenting and to save me from **H**. He finds it unfair on my part to unload the burden of my abuse on them and that I am doing this only to humiliate them, which is obviously not the case.

The conclusion of our conversation was that I only have 2 options here, either to tell them and they feel horrible about it or I don't tell them and spare them the pain all the while stating that if I loved my parents, I would choose the 2nd option.

What should I do? Should I tell my parents?",17Jul2020,1

440,"A few years ago, my dad worked in a charity shop (aka thrift store) where an SS ceremonial knife and commando knife were donated. I \[26M\] reckon it may have been someone handing in the belongings of a WW2 veteran who had passed away. The charity shop didn't want to sell them so my dad asked if he could take them and he gave them to me because I'd previously collected a few ceremonial knives when we lived abroad (a Sikh kirpan, a Nepali kukri, and a Rajasthani dagger).

&amp;#x200B;

I used to keep the knives on display, excluding the SS knife, but then realised it was probably a massive red flag when lady friends came to visit for the first time (the most compelling evidence for this was a particular lady saying, ""well that's a massive red flag""). So they're now all hidden away in a cupboard and I sometimes get them out to show friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always treat the knives respectfully as cultural/historical artefacts rather than messing around with them but the appeal of the SS knife is definitely more to do with the shock value than objective historical interest. It's only recently that I've put any thought into the acceptability of owning a relic from one of the most evil chapters of European history, especially one that is still being evoked by white supremacists today. And I'm also starting to feel a bit uncertain about the acceptability of owning a knife collection generally. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, where would you place owning an SS knife and/or a knife collection on the following spectrum: cool -&gt; acceptable -&gt; bit of a red flag -&gt; screams ""incel"".

&amp;#x200B;

And if you opt for red flag/incel, what would you do with it/them? I wouldn't want to sell an SS knife to the type of person who would want to buy one. It's also not a particularly fancy one so it's unlikely to be of interest to a museum.

442,"I‚Äôve been really creeped out by this. 

Several months ago my old chemistry teacher got my phone number and messaged me saying: ‚Äúlet me know if you have an interest in our addvertising, marketing and online accounts‚Äù. 

I had no idea what he was talking about. So I politely asked him to clarify what he meant. He than said ‚ÄúThat is a very good question. The goal would be to promote our renewable energy services and products. Pellet stoves, solar lights, fireplace doors. But i think we would have great success with solar. I have a catalog for one of our product lines. If you are interested. We would also be able to offer paid training through...‚Äú. 

I don‚Äôt know why he asked me,because the last time I had talked to him was 6 YEARS ago. In high school. 

I felt weird but my parents encouraged me to have a sit down chat with him to discuss the possibility of working for him on this ‚Äúproject‚Äù. 

So I had a sit down conversation with him and this is how it went: he showed up looking like he just woke up after being stuck in a Well for three days. I asked him a few questions and immediately I could tell he had no set plan for this project and it was just an idea he‚Äôs had in his head for a very long time. He said he had some people he talked to about it that he thought would be a good crew. I asked him if they had agreed to his proposal and found out they had not. I also asked him why did he consider me, to which he said that he thought we connected well in high school (we did not. He was a chaperone for a club I conducted but we did not connect that much at all). So I told him I would think about it. He then asked me if I wanted to see this solar panel in his car. I said okay without thinking. But we were in a public area so that was good. He then he showed me how to put it together (in the parking lot). I felt really awkward because it didn‚Äôt look complicated. He then said I could take it home with me and I told him that was okay. Then he left. 

I didn‚Äôt reach out to him for a long time and then he texted me, and instead of asking what my thoughts were, he acted as though I was already on board with his project. I then asked for clarification (again) about what he meant in his text training and other things. He replied, not answering my question, and said that he thought it would be best if we visited the company he texted me about.

443,"I am getting rejected at my tests I need to properly execute my funciton

I am getting rejected at my job interviews I need for my tests

I am getting rejected by the women I'm interested in

I am getting rejected by home-owners I want to rent a flat in

I am getting rejected even by the god-damned cashier who is paid to be nice to me.

Nah the latter one was a joke.

Still though, I am getting told all the time how I should not take this personally. This is a good sentence. Sounds great, doesn't it. It is though *very* personal, is it not. It is me and my doings. It is me and my looks. It is me and my mind. 

I am working on myself like crazy all the time, but it is for nothing. I work seven days a week, I work out five of them, I So I am sore at the expense I put in. I could have just done nothing and fared even better ‚Äì because then, I wouldn't have tried and failed, would I.

Like this I am a constant failure, attracting more failures. I am nearly puking blood from all the frustration and anger.

I keep wanting to 'show them', but because I seem to be good for nothing, I fail even harder in the end. 

To be honest, I believe, that I am getting rejected because of my earlier failures. It is an endless cycle of pain and anger.

If I ever truly show them and myself, if I ever truly destroy all those mocking characters out of my life, I then won't be able to have any friends anymore. Because if I do not fail anymore, there is no reason, not to encourage me, is there? If the house is already built, there is no reason, not to live in it?

I couldn't trust anybody from that point onwards. They're just there to profit from the accomplishments after all. Probably the same or same kind of people, who made fun of me and rejected me earlier.

TL:DR

If I continue to fail, I will continue getting rejected. If I continue getting rejected, I will continue to fail. If I - by some miracle - ever happen to break the cycle, I won't be able to trust anyone on the other side, ever.

444,"So I just saw a video about a person doing a point of view video, it was about one child getting treated differently from the other. When I saw that video I immediately started tearing up, because of how much I relate (?) to that video. My older sibling; my sister who has struggled with depression, bullying, and social anxiety caused by elementary bullies and more. 
With that in mind my mom treats me differently from her, I understand why she does that. What I don‚Äôt understand, is how my mom treats me as the older sibling. Such as, I have to be more grown and responsible. Keep in mind I am still a child barely a teen.
One reoccurring event, is when I get picked up from school I always tell my mom about my day.

She‚Äôs mostly in a bad mood, because of school. And to not make it worse since she had a rough day, we don‚Äôt talk on the ride back to not anger her. 
Another event is when I told her one day about how a boy was making me feel uncomfortable on how he ~touched me~ she wasn‚Äôt...idk worried, or like mad at the guy. I don‚Äôt know what reaction I wanted from her but I just wanted her to at least ask if I was okay or something , but she didn‚Äôt. I then said that I thought she was going to give a different reaction but she just said,if it were my older sister she would worry on how she was going to help her recover from that, but not about me?.. her reason was because I‚Äôm strong, but I‚Äôm only strong for my mom, to not add to her worries.

448,"Tdlr at bottom

Background:
I work closing shift in the customer service industry. We were slow so my 3 coworkers (all M) and I (F) were just chilling in the back and tidying up. Were all about the same age so it's not a generational thing.

Cast
Me: ""I""(duh)
Problem guy: PG (oh the irony)
Cool guy: CG
Annoying guy: AG

My coworkers and I were talking about drinking and I said I wasn't really into it and probably won't do it because I'm not really into the whole alchohol scene. Then PG asked me 
""Not even for your bachelorette party""
I looked at him for a second and said,
""No, as I dont really plan on getting married at the moment"" 
In return he looked shocked 
""REALLY!?! You look like one of those people who is like I want kids ASAP""
I found this hilarious for..... reasons....
He looked confused so I said ""
wait until CG comes back from the bathroom because he'll get a kick out of this""

So CG comes back and I'm chilling with him AG and PG in the office and I recount that to CG. He laughs and says that he understands but also reminds me that PG doesnt know yet. I turn to PG who is looking curiously at me and say ""I'm asexual"".
If anything he looked confused. 
CG, elaborating for me says ""It means she doesn't want to fuck""
Looking at me PG blurts ""Really? Cause like I want to all the time and I would tonight.""
So he, AG,and CG joke about their escapeds in the world of sex and I'm just chilling on my phone. 

After a while PG turns to me and asks ""so why dont you want to have sex""
At this point I'm internally going (eXcUsE mE that isnt really any of your business) 
Meanwhile CG goes ""It's just a feelings thing for her man"" 
""Yeah,"" I chime in, ""I'm not attracted to people""
""Or relationships"" CG so helpfully added(not quite my dude). 
After a brief pause PG asked ""Okay, then do you play with yourself?"" 
At this point I'm just kinda of shocked into silence while AG is also going ""Yeah, do you?""
....I wish it stopped there

After a brief recovery period CG was like not cool man. And instead of shutting his mouth PG then proceeds to try and justify his question with crude gesture and saying ""She could be a freak in the sheets, those church girl types ya know""
It goes on and on between him and AG just getting more and more crude. Asking if I do this do that making graphic gestures and the like. I'm just sitting there silently completley red and crying a tad either from laughing at the absurdity or just generally upset, idk. 

I wish that was where it ended but then when I was getting ready to leave they (all of them) started making jokes about slipping roofies into a rootbeer for me and drinks for girls in general and well that just made me really freaking uncomfortable. 

I have shifts with PG and AG this week and next week and I'm not sure what I should do now. Do I pretend it never happened? Like am I overreacting? Or is this something I should bring up to my manager? Any advice would be welcome.

449,"So long story short. I posted something very similar a while ago so to summarize it, my family is very against gays and anything a man does that is feminine is gay. I‚Äôm terrified of what would happen if they find out I want to try makeup even though I am straight, because that could mean I could get kicked out or something worse and I‚Äôm not in a good spot with money to be out on my own yet. Because of this I start panicking when I want to ask a girl to do my makeup out of fear of what will happen, all because of how my family raised me. For example, I once joked about owning a purse right before I left my grandparents, because my grandpa always asks if we have all our chargers, phones, and he looks at my mom and sister and asks if they have their purses so I thought I‚Äôd be funny and say I forgot my purse, and my dad said if I owned a purse I‚Äôd be left there and my grandpa said if I owned a purse I would not be welcomed and couldn‚Äôt stay with them, they said it in a kind of joking tone but they are serious people so I am not sure if they were joking or not, and yes there was other stuff they said on different days to make sure I knew gays are bad, but I‚Äôm not getting into everything my family has said just know what they said is bad. I know what they say is wrong but I don‚Äôt have the guts to tell them they are wrong when they go on their rants out of fear how they would react. 

I‚Äôm in college on summer break now and waiting to move back into the dorm in August. I know college is the time to experiment and find out who you are, so my first semester there I barely managed to ask a girl to paint my toe nails by typing it on my phone and she took it out of my hand to read it when she realized I was panicking so much I couldn‚Äôt show her or say it out loud, I then proceeded to almost pass out when she started painting (all I remember was that she had me sit down with my knees up so she could get to my toes easier, everything went black for a second and I felt myself fall, but I was still awake and that‚Äôs the best I can describe it from memory). I loved the nail polish and luckily the people who noticed either liked my nails too or didn‚Äôt care, though my friend who did care made sure I knew that they didn‚Äôt like my nails because it wasn‚Äôt right for a man to have painted nails. So I know I should avoid this person if I ever wore makeup. But most friends not caring has helped me calm down a little, but painted nails isn‚Äôt face makeup and they might have a different opinion on that.

Now I want to try to take a step up and actually try a full face of makeup; but I know I will panic if I try to ask. I thought about trying to go to Sephora or someplace but when I looked it up, it‚Äôs either the stores near me or my entire state or something, but I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment to meet with them, because of COVID I assume, so they could show me what to do. So I‚Äôm stuck with asking a girl I know at college. I am thinking about writing a note and try to find a way to get it to her stating how I admire how she does her makeup and how I would like to know how to do it, and if she could show me. I just know I will panic again, so how can I stay calm long enough to ask?
Also the only times (3 times by the way) I‚Äôve done my own makeup was when I was home alone and I would watch makeup tutorials and follow along with the makeup I found around the house (so my sisters and mothers makeup, they share makeup without asking each other so they just assumed the other used it if they ever noticed), then I would see how I did and realize that I am bad at makeup and wash it off in the shower, so watching tutorials don‚Äôt really work for me, I need someone there with me to make sure I do it right. 
My goal after this is to fully dress like a girl as well so I assume I can do this for Halloween and claim it‚Äôs just a costume if people have a problem with it, but I want to know how the makeup goes first so I know if it‚Äôs ok to go on to this next step. And for those wondering no I‚Äôm not a transgender person, I am just someone who wants to try something new to see if I like it and probably continue if I do.

I had tried to ask them to let me leave for a bit and think about it or at least arrange my place/food/care (I live alone and just moved so have setting up to do) doctors pushed me for surgery saying it was an emergency and as the procedure is short and urgent I should be out of here in a day or so. I tried making a formal request but no one listened.

Now, firstly I‚Äôm not allowed any visitors plus don‚Äôt know many people around. Moreover I don‚Äôt have my phone and hence absolutely no contacts.

I‚Äôve been told I should have surgery ASAP, (within a couple hours when I came here)

I had asked them if I could schedule the surgery later in the day when I came to the er. Just a couple hours to get things sorted when it was pushed as an emergency. I wasn‚Äôt given any options. I haven‚Äôt been seen by any doctors in hours, and still in pain. I‚Äôm considering a hospital transfer but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I do have good savings and credit limits clearly but as a freelancer during Covid crisis I‚Äôm not expecting income soon, I‚Äôd anyone has any advice would be great.

In this post I will be including all of my concerns, all of my thoughts and all of my actions (it will also include information that no one else besides me and my family is supposed to know, so please don't hold it against me). There was no previous planning for this and I apologize if it gets nowhere, but I really feel the need to let my thoughts out.

I was the product of an affair. My dad was forced to marry a women he didn't like, then he ""married"" my current mother, his true love. The first woman my dad married gave birth to my brother. He is an excellent person, he is athletic, smart and goes to a great university ready to serve his country. But on the otherside, I see myself as a rather useless, arrogant, narcissistic and overall very shitty person. I've never been close to my brother, because I didn't know him until I was seven years old. But at that time I did not know he is a brother from another mother, my mom finally decided to tell me the truth about two years ago. Though the whole ""being the child of an affair thing"" didn't matter to me at all.  


But that isn't the main part of my struggles. Since the start of year five for me I started to notice I was picking the skin off of the two sides of my nails due to being sent outside of class frequently because I was too silly. The pure thought of being seen and maybe humiliated struck me very hard. So I started to pick my fingers as some sort of relieving process, I think.

Since then I hadn't been motivated to do anything, I was constantly forced to study mathl, which is a subject that just seems impossible for me and that I have wanted to give up on. My mom would always yell at me to study Chinese history, but I always refused to because it was simply too boring (Yes. A Chinese man refusing to learn about his own country and culture). Part of the reason for this was probably because of my bias towards my own country. I was taught in an international school, which is why I was able to speak fluent English. This also meant I was exposed to a lot of foreign information. Friends from Hong Kong told me not-so-good-things about China, Youtube talks shit about China a lot and so does my Westerner friends. So I've always been stuck between this middle ground of China good/China bad but it doesn't bother me that much because I still got fed, had a roof on top of me and had a life. But what really bothers me is my parents thoughts of China. (The continuation of this topic will now include my thoughts and their original words). They think China is a great country, which I also think is true. But they seem to be very arrogant and over the top about it. Arrogance is something I hate because I just can't imagine the unprecedented consequences that binds to this sort of attitude.

(At this point there really isn't any order to things, I'm just typing down whatever concern that comes to my mind. I'm starting to question why I''m writing this post and if it really is necessary, because it's getting harder to continue typing).

My family is pretty wealthy before, since I am educated in an international school. But things really started going downhill when my dad's business went wrong. My dad would come home drunk and I hate seeing him drunk, because he is a near fifty year old man that probably has a rotten liver compared to the liveliness and tolerance of him I've heard from my mother about my dad during his youth. My parents would get into very heated arguments many many times. Sometimes it leads to my dad slamming the doors, ramming his head into the wall, punching the glass, hitting himself to my mom crying after he leaves. My mom would also constantly yell at my sister for not being able to understand her homework. Once my sister forgot her math sheet right before an end of year test and I came home seeing my sister's legs filled with marks from beatings and her teary eyes. Me and my sister have very weak hearts, we can't deal with lots of pressure but we are good at hiding it. We are very weak mentally though we seem strong and towering on the outside.

My next issue is being unable to concentrate or giving shits about school work (Probably due to my horrible phone. computer and gaming addiction). I would come home from school, lock myself up in my room and start researching about romance/fighting manga (Which I fantasize and picture myself as the main protagonist to feel good) and watching videos on gaming. Luckily I barely pass on my school work even though not taking it seriously. I also love to stay up at night and and just wonder about the world. It's the darkest, most quiet and alone feeling that I get addicted to when I go to sleep at 3-4AM. 

Somehow people at my school still sees me as a good student who does well in his studies (despite my extremely average/bad grades) and a person to look up to though I do nothing except for simply existing. I worry about how I act extremely differently at school than at home. 

To simply summarize this. I feel like I am wasting my life away. I never feel the motivation to do anything at all, be it change my self so I get ready to face the cruel and gory society that my parents tell me about, find a hobby (Which I don't know how and I never stuck to anything) , not be so fake as a person and to stop being too narcissistic and finding excuses for all of my actions even though I know it clearly is wrong. My only redeeming quality is that I am rather strong and athletic for my age. Sports is probably the only thing that keeps my going now.

I'm sorry if you read this post finding that you haven't understood anything and wasted time. But I seek advice on how to destroy this mentality and generally finally look forwards to tomorrow.

458,"A bit of background:

In Year 9 in my school (In England), we select GCSE subjects. We normally select 9 but I was offered a 10th GCSE in Spanish. I took the offer and started the work a few weeks back. But I feel it‚Äôs super excessive.

The teacher (as we are in lockdown) sends through a Module of work to do every 2 weeks AND a test AND extra work on top of that. With my other studies, this piles up and is stressing me out. I really don‚Äôt know how long I can do this.

462,"I'm 27M Sri Lankan. I have never been in a relationship as I had many issues since my childhood, issues like no confidence and and low self esteem due to an event happened in my childhood. But now I am in a really good position in my life where I'm more confident than I ever was and a I have an above average looking body that I got from going to the gym regularly.

The problem is that I have periods of depression about not having a girlfriend like every month. I used to think I will never be able to get a girlfriend but I now understand that I can. I even went on a date last February but she didn't want to go on a second date. My close friends inspired me to go on that date. But now not having a girlfriend and never having sex and having the thought of that makes me feel like a big loser. Almost all my friends are in relationships or had and it kills me not to have one and never having sex and living with that thought, it's even difficult to hang around with my friends because I feel like the lonely one when they are with their partners, and I'm not jealousy person either it just about my personal issue of being single. I tried so many things like having a lot of hobbies but I can't get over the feeling of not having a girlfriend which I want the most. It's so difficult to meet any new women these days since I'm working from home now and the lockdown season made me more depressed. I do believe that the people I know may think I'm a loser as well because of this sometimes. I'm person with a positive mood and only when I'm depressed I think like this. What can I do about being depressed from time to time like this? Suggestions are welcome",17Jul2020,1
463,"Back story for reference - last year I was seeing a girl (19F, I was 21M) for 2 months. However she had lied about several guys, was sleeping around and essentially I ended things. She was toxic, started making claims that I sexually assaulted her to people who might have known me (but thankfully no one bought it). I developed anxiety and my depression escalated as I received further distressing messages post ending things with her (this was January this year).

I decided to download tinder a few days ago just to see how it was (terrible as always) and I received a message today... the message read (and I quote) ‚Äú[Girl I used to sees name] said you were a terrible root with a small penis, oh and you should stop skipping leg day you twig legged fuck‚Äù. Seeing the girl I used to sees name immediately triggered PTSD and I had an anxiety attack and felt terrible. I screenshotted the messages and the girls profile because 1) She used to go to my college 2) She goes to my gym and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs aware of it and 3) She used to bully my younger sister last year.

Now with respect to my job, I work for a gym which is one of New Zealand‚Äôs top companies... the branch which this girl attends is my local gym, however I work at a different location.
I‚Äôm friends with most managers across the company, and especially the one which she attends as I used to work there (and I still attend there on my off days and before/after my shifts).

I‚Äôm unsure on how to approach this situation because the whole event with the girl I used to see almost lead to me doing dumb things to myself as well as seeing a psychologist that‚Äôs how severe it was. And to now have this girl have the decency and put in the effort to message me such a toxic message really triggered me. 

Would it be worth presenting the screenshot of this message to the manager of the branch she attends (and who is my mate) for bullying? Or should I just leave it?

469,"i usually do not like to post personal stuff somewhere online, but I really feel like getting all of this off my chest without (fully) getting judged by friends, so here I am. And no, its not that my friends are judgemental.. i just don't want to give away tooo much of my problems (if that makes sense).

I (23,M) have been doing photography for the past 4 years now.. started in Summer of 2016 when I first bought my DSLR and slowly built myself up in fashion photography. Since the oppurtunities here are limited, I always felt like that I had to move out to fully make it, since the fashion industry is not as big as in other countries. I wanted to move to Germany when I was 19 (also going through a lot of personal and mental issues). A last minute change of heart kept me here and made me graduate highschool before I wanted to move out. Ofc my parents dont know a thing about it, since they were not supportive...

a couple of years passed, i am working full time as an engineer, have a big social circle, a girlfriend while also saving time to do photography part time, but it always has been part time. I never had the full focus on my real passion, where I can wholeheartedly say that I tried and it didn't work out. and I feel like all of the things I've mentioned are slowly becoming burdens that keep me here. in a place where I feel like i dont belong.

and all of this came out, because I saw someone I know (also a photographer), who has also been doing photography like me and in a similar aesthetic, move to London a year ago. Yesterday I found out, that he got featured in one of the biggest fashion magazines. And yes, I was SO incredibly happy for him and proud. Was I jealous ? No. Was I sad because I literally saw him achieve that what I've been trying to do? Yes.

and thats the thing, it gutted me and kinda put things into perspective for me.. I feel like Im never going to be on that level when I dont focus on my art 1000%, so why even bother ? Maybe its just a low phase for me rn, but I really consider just giving up and not actively trying to make it happen I guess. I also started second guessing my art (which always happen), my relationship and basically everything.",17Jul2020,1

(I've already reached out to my old CC to get more solid insight, I'm just impatient!!)

I'm transferring to a 4-year after 3 years of CC/community college. One of my old courses has a limitation: it's transferable, but only if I took it under non-dual enrolled circumstances. I did take the class while in high school--and while I can appeal the credit (which I'm absolutely going to)--I ran into a new problem. 

The course, though I passed with an A, has no credit displayed on my CC transcript. It's on my unofficial transcript with a ""0.00"" and A grade. My 4-year says that it doesn't come up at all on my official transcript.  I have no idea why it is like this. I can't register for the right classes if I have to RE-take a freshman course this semester that I completed 4+ years ago. I'm hoping it's an old payment fluke, but there are also no outstanding payments on my CC account. 

It **is** a transferrable course; with my old essays and current record the appeal shouldn't be a big problem, but this credit discrepancy definitely is. I'm looking for advice/insights into why this might be showing the course's grade but not the credit.

My best friend is a kind of person who'll get excited over anything so when I first told her that I got into a relationship she got really very excited and then my boyfriend asked me if he could add her as a friend on snapchat and I just said why not.

So after he added my best friend she started joking around and told him that I would believe her more than I believed him and for some reason he took it seriously and he wrote this paragraph to her saying how her opinion might mean a lot to me but if she does anything to make things wrong between me and him, they'd have a problem. Then she told him to Chill and she was just kidding and she wouldn't do anything bad. 

this happened around 3 days ago and she sent me a copy of the messages that he sent her and I found this one particular statement he made very funny so I sent that copy to him with some laughing emojis are the end. His response was ""huh?"" Then I asked him whether he sent that to my best friend. He said he didnt. I asked my bestfriend and she sent me screenshots. So I messaged him asking what the f*** was going on and he I think was annoyed and said stuff like all he wanted to do was eat breakfast and watch youtube and me and my best friend are trying to see if we can take this all in and which he can't. it all started as a joke that was a text that I found funny and I don't know why he lied about not sending that to her. And then I told him that is her opinion did mean a lot to me but at the end of the day it was my decision and I would never leave him. And then he started saying stuff like ""I'm not gonna talk"" and then he went offline, I tried calling him but he didn't pick up. I don't know what's happening and what hes thinking atm. But I do really like him and I don't want this all to go down the drain just for a joke

493,"Hello all,

I have been recently thinking about a relationship with someone I‚Äôve known since hs (first year uni now), and I feel as if they‚Äôre not really respecting me as a person. So I want to cut it off with him, but this is the first friendship I‚Äôve ever had to end like this so I‚Äôm unsure.

Now to get into why I think our friendship is failing. Btw we are both guys if that adds anything.

1.	All he does when he calls me is vent about his life, other friends and whatever plan he is thinking of doing. The thing is though, he never takes any of my advice. Nor does he show that much attention over my own issues. In all my years of knowing him I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs given me good advice on a problem unless I‚Äôm forgetting.

2.	He talks a lot of shit about his friends and reveals stuff about them that he shouldn‚Äôt too me. Naturally this makes me wary of him because who knows what he says about me.

3.	He is insanely clingy, like it‚Äôs actually making me a bit nervous. I missed some calls of his over a span of 2 days (5/6 calls were when I was sleeping and 1 was when I was busy doing chores). He then proceeded to txt msg me some passive aggressive msg about why I was ‚Äòignoring‚Äô him and ‚Äúlmk it‚Äôs fine‚Äù. Like if it‚Äôs fine then why message me about it? So I explain to him the situation and he leaves it on read, doesn‚Äôt even reply or try to resolve it. Then he calls me at 12am that night to try and get me to play games with him when he already knows I would be going to sleep (I told him in the aforementioned text). A few times after that he would always ask if I was sleeping when I answered his calls. Seemed like attitude to me.

4.	He interrogated me over my own finances. This happened because he was talking to me about getting a bike and riding it around the city together, I said it sounds fun but I don‚Äôt have the money for it. He then proceeded to list of items I had bought, like a speaker etc (things I‚Äôd mentioned offhand) And tried to guess my money and basically implied I was lying. Now for many reasons this is fucking insane, one being that I‚Äôm not obligated to tell him anything about my bank account so I changed the subject. He also tried to gaslight me on the prices of one of the items when I attempted to correct him, so that was cool.

5.	This one is a little minor but still weird. After not meeting up for a while like two weeks, we decided to go to the barber together because we both happened to need a haircut. When he came to my house he just ran up the stairs like a kid and didn‚Äôt give me any time to react, felt very strange as he‚Äôs never been upstairs in my house before and felt like he was overstepping boundaries too much.

6.	He tries to make me do things im not comfortable with, and he also tries to lie/mislead me to do things like he‚Äôll act like we‚Äôre playing basketball but then at the end of the session, he will want to exercise and won‚Äôt tell me until the last moment. This is the most annoying trait of his, and it has led to me getting mad at him before because he doesn‚Äôt listen. He also does not like to take blame, like ever! It‚Äôs shocking I‚Äôve never met a more stubborn person.",17Jul2020,1

She had been increasingly rude to me and my siblings. Also I currently live with 9 other people and I cannot take it anymore. My mom has been blaming me for my sister‚Äôs shortcomings(them not cleaning their rooms etc) just because I‚Äôm the oldest. She said I should be the one to tell/remind them when to clean. Their ages are 14,11,10, and 4. Many times me and my mom have argued over this. Also when one person does something in this house EVERYONE gets in trouble. We clean the kitchen every night by ourselves and they complain if something is not done the way they (my mom and stepdad) want it to be. My mom has fibromyalgia so she is a stay at home mom which is stressful for me too because I don‚Äôt really have time away from her other than my room. She won‚Äôt let me got outside by myself or even to go a friends house without her knowing them and their parents. She constantly calls me and my siblings lazy even though we ask her not to, she says ‚Äúy‚Äôall are lazy‚Äù and leaves it at that. Yesterday she got upset with me because I told my dad about what‚Äôs going on and she heard what I was saying. She said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with y‚Äôall cleaning the kitchen every night?‚Äù And I kept telling her that‚Äôs not what I said. But she continued to call me lazy and say I think just because i didn‚Äôt mess something up I think I don‚Äôt have to clean it. She also wants us to clean the living room when we aren‚Äôt even allowed down there often. Everyday she‚Äôs down there watching YouTube on the TV.

I've pretty much hated being a chef since the moment I started taking hours, I realized too late that it was the people I enjoyed, not the work, but I kept procrastinating, denying I could do anything else and stuck with it. The work environment inside kitchens suck, you are paid fuck all but go through so much stress, and treated like shit, I am fairly certain i am about to lose my job, as me and my head chef have never gotten along, pretty much uses me as a punching bag whenever anything goes wrong, can't handle the emotional abuse any longer.  


The main problem is I have absolutely no skill in anything so I seriously have no idea how to choose a new career path, and am to scared to move forward with anything, I rent a house with my brother and have savings, but they wont last forever if I do lose my job, he has just gone back into education and has a job. I spend most of my times playing games instead of being able to be social because being a chef you never get weekends off, so I no longer have a social life, or any real friends for that matter, other then the people I know online.

501,"I was dating this person on Tinder.  Over the course of a few months, I put tens of thousands of dollars into it. This person was very keen to meet my family, and said that it was the first thing he wanted to do after COVID19 restrictions lifted. From the very first day, he always talked about wanting to settle down, and hoped that I was not the kind of person who dated too long without considering marriage. I'm fact, he said that he wanted to marry me by the end of this year, which we both agreed to work towards. He pretended to have a really clean social circle, and apparently spent the weekends at his parents'. He was supposedly a ""good cook"", and had a realistic looking social media profile, and had several months of posts to back it up. He said that he is the CEO of a construction company, and even showed me small video snippets of construction ""progress shots"" to prove what he was saying. He felt like a godsend to me; at the time, everything we did felt so real. I never would have thought that a scammer would counterintuitively argue with me to deepen our relationship.

He eventually introduced me to this online ""investment"" website. We were gonna use the profit we got to buy a wedding house. This is a website that changes it's address every month, and the only way to know where the new website is is by being linked to its customer service through a WhatsApp number, with a Chinese country code. Since i was depositing money through US dollars, he had me transferring to the ""platform's"" bank account in the US. This happened several times over the course of 2 months, and had me give official ID information to verify that the bank transfers came from me. Then, one day, something happened.

We apparently ""violated"" some platform rules, which made it so that I had to send more money to the platform just to bail out my original capital and prove my ""innocence"". Within 48 hours, I had to come up with an enormous sum of money, convert it to Ethereum (ETH), and send it to the ""platform's"" wallet address (via it's blockchain network). Then, immediately the next day, I lost contact with both him and the WhatsApp customer service. After several days of not being able to get in contact with him, it finally dawned on me that I was scammed.

I'm 16f now and i had only one brother then 3 years older than me . (I still have him , i just have one more now). So i remember he always wanted to sleep together and i was agreeing bit i never really wanted to cause i like sleeping alone ( not with my family members anyways). I don't remember how old i was unfortunately but i remember my pijamas and him so i should be about 7 so he is fucking 10 ( now he is 19) . 

I don't remember many things but we were in bis room with the lights closed and he asked me to do something and i said what and he told me to touch him and i didn't know many things then so i  did and then he said I'll do something for you too. I didn't know he liked it or i liked it ( which i didn't, i didn't dislike it , but i didn't know how to feel) then he did something ""for me "" and told me to pit my mouth on it and i fucking did it... I didn't realize i was doing something wrong . So i honestly don't remember if we had sex or anything, i don't think so , i remember being on him when our mother came in but we were covered with blanket . And i realized she might had understood something cause she came rushing....  Then i don't know if we continued... 


He wanted to do this many times I could feel it after i grew up a little , i didn't want to sleep with him anymore , but i didn't know it was because of that , like i didn't say oh this is going to happen again so no , i just didn't want at all and he would beg. 


He would want to show me his dick and actually force me to see it and i didn't want to ofc. He wouldn't touch me tho probably cause I'd tell my parents ( which i wouldn't unfortunately) 
I honestly was so stupid cause he'd do all this things and then he would ask to bath together with swimsuits and i would fucking say yes again without suspecting anything... And then he would be naked and I'm out , i was grossed and embarrassed when he should be...

I'm freaking out tho cause he was at high school first Grade i think and he would show it to me again .   He has a gf now( 2 years) thank God and he was an immature boy , but not crazy immature ,now he still is a little (but you can't see it , you think he's super serious and everything and so he thinks but he actually isn't so much) ( but he's really ok)  he's serious about his gf and this is a reason why I don't freack out too much . He's just horny and actually not that much , I find it disgusting so i never touch him untill now.. i try to turn him off all these years , i know how it sounds but I'm just making sure...


I just fee lightlyl grossed to him all the time it's always there taht feeling ,but i don't always think about when talking to him , i never think about what happened when talking to him, he was really good looking and i was good looking too , but I'd never she him attractive cause he's my fuckingbrotherwhatthefuck and he was older so he remembers everything . 
He helps me and stuff he's an okay bro we're not best friends but we're cool and he's protective , no other problems . 

I just, I'm so disgusted amd uncomfortable cause he obviously remembers everything and i feel it would be better if he forgot... 

Also i won't say it to my parents cause most boys are horny and do worse things than these and i hope it was just me and not any other girl , which i know they wouldn't have problem cause they'd cry about how attractive he was , so that was a boost of confidence but turn off to him . 

I don't hate my brother but I'm disgusted that he did this to me and would go as far as I would .... 
Not holding anything against him , he's just a stupid horny boy and tbh i wouldn't want to be his gf ( if we weren't fam) but he's not my type anyways so maybe that's why I'm always disgusted . ( I don't know if you get that honestly )


 I'm ok tho , I'm not afraid that my brother will do anything like that since he's a person who really loves someone and he's actually loyal and everything but i never say never ,he has god everything's good. Wish him the best i just wanted to let this out and if someone had an experience like that 

TR;DL  did sexual stuff with brother when i 7f and he 10m and he would want to continue when older but i probably had some more brain. Justify him cause his a boy and I'm not sffraid he'd do it or force me or anything since his not that immature and i know many boys do it ( even if it's disgusting)
I Don't hold anything against him but it's gross i still don't touch him atall . He has a gf of 2years  loyal af everything's ok . Just realized it a year ago √†nd I've never told anyone prob won't anytime soon.",17Jul2020,1

520,"I [21M] wish I could do more to help my friend [19M] (also trans FtM if it's any useful info) who's grieving in his own way. His grandpa died of a sickness less than a week ago (I'm not sure if it was covid but it was probably that or similar). 

He's pretty much introverted and doesn't do well in large groups, and one of his relatives invited him to spend time with the rest of the family for lunch but it's very hard for him to be around people right now because he needs to process these feelings and watching his grandpa pass away in front of him. He already feels terrible for staying at home this long away from people (and work I assume). I also heard that his work place had an employee test positive for the virus and that everyone there had to get tested.

I messaged him saying I'm sorry about his grandpa and that he must be going through alot right now and that I heard from someone about the outbreak at his work and that I was so worried about him. He pressed like on both the messages but couldn't respond because I know it's very hard for him to respond to so many people talking to him at a time like this. He's posted saying he's not gonna be active much on social media because of this.

In the past I've sent him care packages in the mail including stuff like chocolates, cleaning wipes, a written halmark letter, a stress ball, a lavendar scented stuffed animal to put in the microwave for smelling (a bday gift) during his worst days like switching to homeschool or undergoing surgery.

I want to support him with words of affirmation and all but talking is hard for him and most of our relationship has been me coming to him for support and he rarely if ever vents to me. And I don't wanna send stuff which would put pressure on him to respond. At the most I thought one of those heartfelt printout comics/cartoons of someone expressing their support for their loved one and sending it in the mail in a letter. Or maybe just nothing at all.

Since today is pay day, I looked at my paycheck and realized that the last week of the pay increase was over. Everyone is mad because the pay increase was nice, and the floor workers are mad because they just started making real money to live off of. 

So as an intern, is it acceptable for me to ask for the pay raise to be permanent? Without going into too much detail about the issues, there are lots of people planning on leaving in September anyways. Thanks in advance for any response!",17Jul2020,1

I didn't realize about this dream on time. Now I'm father of two and approaching fast to my 30's. The thing is I'll not give up ond this, even if it takes me 5, 10 or 15 years.

I have some time making small prototypes and projects with some friends, Nothing serious. I have a pretty good base knowledge in a few aspects of the game deveolpment process but I don't excel in any, like: Programming, art and sound/music.

For what I know (correct me if I'm wrong) the ""game designer"" is a developer with experience, is not like one prepare for that job and get's it at first. 

SO.. I don't have too much time between kids and work (retail) and I'm not getting younger neither. So I concluded that I need to specialize on one of this aspects so I can get a job in the future to insert myself on the industry.

In which knowledge should I deepen? (I like all more-or-less the same) 

Do you gave any tip? Anything I'm not thinking of?

I'm enclined for programming, beacuse programmers are needed, generaly. If tou agree.. What language, course, career shoul I approach?

526,"My husband and I (M&amp;F/28) just moved into a new house in an older neighborhood. Our next door neighbor is a really friendly 95 year old man who is understandably pretty lonely and invites us over for wine, dinner, etc. pretty often. I have an incredible soft spot for elderly people and I do like our neighbor so we do go over. 

But how can we be a better neighbor to him? We are first time homeowners and I‚Äôm not that great with social queues, so I guess I need advice on like regular neighborly things I should be doing for this guy. He clearly loved the man we bought the house from. We did bring our neighbor a pie the other day since he told us he liked pie and cake. When we do go over for wine or dinner, he seems happy telling us old stories about himself so I usually just ask him questions that allow him to do that? Is that good enough?

He lives alone and doesn‚Äôt drive, but he does have a woman come twice a day to help him with groceries, etc. 

Anyway, maybe we‚Äôre doing all the right things but I know if my 95 year old dad was living next to two new younger people I‚Äôd want them to make an effort to get to know him or to help him out. If there‚Äôs anything else we can be doing, please let me know!",17Jul2020,1
527,"My brothers in 8th grade and he has been failing school for as long as I can remember, in this country a pass is 40% and in many subjects he‚Äôs been getting in the 30‚Äôs and 20‚Äôs a few of his better exams in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs

I am his older brother and I have tried to tutor him but he either purposely doesn‚Äôt listen or makes jokes the whole time, let me clarify that I am happy to explain something a hundred times over but not when I am dealing with grunts and sighs and eye rolls and just generally not being appreciated 

I decided to take the hint that yknow maybe he doesn‚Äôt want my help but I wasn‚Äôt gonna just quit so I told him what hours I was free at and that he was free to tell me to tutor him at those hours, this way he knows that I still want to help but it is up to him to take the help and use some initiative 

Lo and behold he never called me or texted or anything and just kept at his gaming, a pretty clear hint that he has no interest whatsoever in getting help

My mother has friends who are teachers and they have told her that often times he simply will not attempt half the questions and say he is done even when my mother has tested him on those same questions mercilessly until he got them perfect at home, and so even tests that came with very specific criteria‚Äôs he simply isn‚Äôt trying

This isn‚Äôt just a phase or the transition to middle school/ secondary school/ GCSE‚Äôs and I know this because he was failing even in elementary/primary school and even if it were that he‚Äôs had two years to get acclimated now

It‚Äôs also not a problem of us reading the results wrong because even in elementary school when the results were given as a fraction they were severely lacking 

My parents aren‚Äôt great with punishments, they will shout and scream a lot the first day or two and they will say no gaming or no phones but they never follow through on that, they have asked me for advice but I am reluctant to give any because what business do I have punishing my younger brother

Recently they‚Äôve decided to use guilt, when he gets punished the whole family gets punished including my younger sisters ages between 5 and 10, the logic behind that is that when we get older when one family member is unsuccessful the whole family is as it is their responsibility to keep that unsuccessful family member from falling under
To be honest I have no complaints to make with that, partially because it is true but also because knowing my parents at most this will last a day or two 

If you said we were enabling him I can honestly see where you are coming from but how can we stop the enabling or reverse the past or anything before it‚Äôs too late

One more thing to clarify, my parents would be proud of him if he got even a C at this point so this isn‚Äôt just strict parents not being happy unless it‚Äôs a 90%+ they just want grades good enough that they will actually get him somewhere in life 

We have been unable to find a tutor although we did put him in extra classes with no results

That‚Äôs basically all the background information 
I guess the advice I need is from any parents or caretakers in general who might have dealt with something similar
What are we supposed to do about this how can we get him to care more about his studies",17Jul2020,1
528,"Sorry in advance for a wall of text, TL;DR in the bottom.

Reddit, I need your help. 

I wanted to be a doctor since I was 10ish years old. I didn't want to study nor live in country where I was born (Estonia), so I moved to Czech republic to go to university there. After completing language courses and passing med school entrance exams, I got admitted into school. After two years of studies I had huge mental breakdown right before my exams, and I made decision of leaving med school. I still went to these exams and I successfully passed them with quite high grade. After that I 'paused' my school, made decision of never coming back (partially it was based on how exhausted I was, and partially there was completely different reason with its roots in a very unhealthy relationship I was in back then). 

After that being made I prepared for entrance exams for technical university, passed them, and got admitted there. Year later I started working as programmer, and 6 months later I left this school too, because I was going through hard divorce (from mentioned above relationship). 

So here I am, 3 years after leaving med school, 1.5 years after leaving tech school, completely lost and not knowing what on earth should I do with my life, with huge will of going back to med school, because, well, I miss medicine. I was quite good in it (am not so in programming because I don't self study much), was liking it (but so I also feel towards programming). 

What stops me?

 First, my age. I just turned 26, and by the time I finish school I will be 31. Then I still will have to go through residency (4-5 years), so I will be full-blown independent doctor only when I will be almost reaching 40. 

Secondly, residency.

 In Czech republic residency for my specialization includes 1.5 years in departments where I don't want to be - surgery, ER, ICU. I have literally *zero interest* in it, and I feel a bit guilty, because it makes me feel like I should not be a doctor, if such a small thing stops me. But on the same time, I compare it with this idea - if I don't want to have kids, should I feel guilty for not being interested in them?  (And yeah, I don't want them, so at least that variable is out of this equation)

My other option for going through residency is in the Netherlands. Here is another problem - very little amount of spots, need to work on some kind of research for being able to apply to residency where I want to go (and research won't be anyhow related to what I want to do), and having some kind of connections is also a huge bonus - and I don't have them. Therefore, before me applying for residency many years can pass, and for all these years I won't be any close to work I want to do.

Last option, residency in my home country, Estonia. I am not sure about actual process of applying, getting there, etc, but there I also see an advantage - my mom's friend is a doctor in exact specialization where I want to be (it was her who inspired me), and it could be an amazing opportunity to learn from her, because she is one of the best in our country in this field. 

I was also thinking about (and that could be I my goal) finding a way of going into some kind of medical research as a programmer. But I am pretty sure, that in this case having technical school finished would be a requirement, and I would not say that I am very eager to go back there. 

What the hell should I do? Forget about medicine, stay programmer, educate myself in this field? Go back to med school? Should I feel an asshole for searching an easier way of getting my specialization?  Do I want to go back because I am going through some kind of life crisis with feeling 'am 26yo but still accomplished nothing' and it was the only thing I ever was good at? Or may be I was good at it because it is *my thing*?

TL;DR: Don't know if I should go back to med school (my first ever career choice which I dropped after mental breakdown) or continue with programming (where I got into after leaving medschool). Doubting about age (will be almost 40 when I will be independent doctor) and different ways of going through residency.",17Jul2020,1

531,"I recently tried reconnecting with a girl I knew in school, both 22 now. We had some great conversation about memories and stuff, she seemed engaged for the hour+ we were texting. At the end of the conversation, I asked if she would be interested in a catchup. She disappeared after I sent that message and didn't reply for 5 hours, later telling me she's really sorry and doesn't want to go out due to COVID and being an introvert.

I get the impression she was spooked out, and hesitant due to being introverted. But as she's a friendly acquaintance from the past I didn't want it to end on a bad cliffhanger like this. So I sent a ""sorry if I left the wrong impression, was nice talking to you"" type apology so I can get out of there without any ill will.

She replied and said I didn't need to apologise, I apologised herself if she was rude, and wished me good luck.

**My questions are:**

I'm wondering if I should go back in and get to know her more? 

Or is it just too awkward now after her disappearing act? It feels awkward but as she's shy (and I'm kinda shy too) we could talk a little more and get more comfortable with one another?

532,"Genuinely can't tell if this is my issue or the group in question just aren't good communicators. The largest group of friends I hung out with at once was like 3 other girls, in high school. I remember our discussions always being civil and we always listened to each other and didn't try to one-up or drown out someone else. I've been in situations where I was the ""louder"" one but that was rare. 

Most of my big talks or debates on subjects happen between me and another person only. I can hold my points fairly well in those situations and I am able to properly communicate what I want to say. I do get lost sometimes in these one-on-one talks too tho, especially with someone who tends to be very loud or isn't a very good listener. My boyfriend for example has the tendency to play devil's advocate for no reason or push on subjects that are controversial just for the sake of ""the discussion"". 

Going from there, my boyfriend's friend group is a place i find myself just being quiet and rarely chiming in with anything. His close friend is a girl and she's the only girl in the group, the rest are all guys. They're all loud, and it is impossible to make myself heard. I also have a very hard time constructing a proper argument in my head while listening to 4 people talk over each other and jumping from one thing to another. The other girl in the group is VERY loud so that's the only reason they hear her when she tries to talk, but even she gets drowned out by their weird testosterone bath they call a discussion. Often myself and her just end up talking separately or something cause it's pointless trying to participate as they don't seem to care what we have to say. Honestly I started to completely avoid hanging out with them because I feel like it's a waste of my time.

Now, clearly, this group is dysfunctional in itself, but I absolutely always find myself having a very hard time being heard or talking in group situations. This one is just the one I get exposed to most.   I just get so lost - I don't know when to chime in, it takes me too long to construct a thought and by the time I have, the conversation has moved on... It's really frustrating and I've tried my whole life to be better at it but I just don't know how. I'm generally that person who says something but no one hears it and the conversation just moves on. I don't speak softly either, I speak in a normal voice. I don't wanna have to scream to be heard.

541,"Throwaway account in case you guys think my account age is suspicious.

I don't know but my mom has always been a bit off to me. I honestly don't know if it's a normal mom thing, but here we go. Also i'm still a teenager, which is also why I need advice how to cope.

My mom's mood would always change. She's actually talking right now while I type this in a room and I realized that her intonation shifts suddenly a lot. She's irritable, and whenever I get something wrong she would go from ""Give me that"" to ""GIVE ME THAT YOU FUCK"" and start to ramble about unnecessary shit. She also tends to get defensive. Actually, she's always defensive. She has problems admitting her mistakes. Which is also why her and dad aren't really able to settle their bullshit properly. She makes up things just to make the other person look bad. She did that to me, actually. I was around 11 at the time and she still does it today. She would also say that I always lie which at the time I didn't, but as years went by I became such a good liar and a master of excuse just to save myself. It's not a good thing of course, I now find myself lying at things I shouldn't lie about.
I remember her treating me like shit since I was 9, at one point she actually got upset with me when I refused to use my penny savings to buy a new fan. Over the years she would also be involved in dramas in my elementary school with parents and teachers. Which also made me a tad bit controversial, I was known at school since I was the top student. I also didn't have lots of friends because of that. To be clear, I don't wanna put the blame on my mom because I know there were actually shitty people in my school, and just like my mom, i'm terrible at coping with people. But it makes me suspicious because knowing her, she doesn't know how to settle even the tiniest problems.
Worst thing that ever happened to me is that she got caught up on a fight with our neighbor that got authorities involved (which I won't emphasize on but honestly it all started with one, VERY small misunderstanding that definitely could have been settled). Me and my brother also got involved (neighbor's fault, we were innocent, she just wanted to involve us because she's a fuckhead) and I got traumatized because of it. Amidst of all the shit happening she also managed to fight with then 6th grader me everyday when I got home from school because everything I do is wrong. Years later and she has never failed to remind me that she regretted having me, she wished that I got raped, and that I was stupid and stubborn as fuck.
 She's also one of the main reasons why i'm depressed, I tried to tell her but she only told me that ""I shouldn't think like that"". I find it hard to tell them about finding a psychologist because of this so now I gotta live with this for a while until I finally have the courage to do so. Maybe next year, after quarantine.
I also tend to be so in my head most of the time which is also why I tend to be really inattentive and not mentally present everytime she tries to tell me to do something which leads to her calling me deaf and an idiot for the 1000th time.

I have NEVER heard her admit her mistakes. Everyone is wrong, except her, of course.

She did once apologize and said that she tried to understand me and kissed me in the forehead ‚Äî after slapping me and grabbing my hair. It didn't feel genuine to me, in fact she started scolding me like she usually does right after.

I have two brothers, I actually remember my eldest brother tell me that ""It's gonna be okay, I was once like you""
Looking back, it makes sense. Growing up I remember my mom always fucking up with him until he got into college and started earning money. She's nicer to him now.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. I just thought of finally asking here because she's so irritable that even when I try to do something she scolds at me while telling me what to do. Sometimes she's screaming and I don't even think she meant it to come across that way. It's almost like she knows she shouldn't really scream at her kid but it just happens.

I'm also working with myself now and promised that I will do EVERYTHING to not end up like her. Sometimes I think that I actually know how she feels/thinks because I once acted like her to kids in school. Now everytime I catch myself doing her shit, I stop. Like now, i'm working to not hold grudges unlike her.

Also you guys don't have to ask about my dad, he was once on my side but soon enough he decided that his marriage is more important than his kid's mental health.

Thanks in advance!

543,"Hi, this is a throwaway account because I‚Äôm really lost and don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been dating my long distant boyfriend for around 2 years now and we‚Äôre about 200 miles apart. We‚Äôve visited each other multiple times and really care for each other. Recently, things haven‚Äôt been so well in his household. While not physically abusive, my boyfriend‚Äôs parents are often verbally abusing almost everyday now.

This all happened since things have been getting really bad since he came out a few weeks ago. His parents say they support and love him when he came out, but they made him watch anti-gay videos for 3 hours and made him read anti-gay books just in the past week. They also think this is all just a fad and bad-decision making on his part. Of course, this is all due to their deeply-rooted Christian background but of course this doesn‚Äôt sit well with the either of us.

His parents always blame him for situations he has no control of. His mother‚Äôs computer broke down because of a virus, and they‚Äôve been arguing for hours saying how it was his fault when he has never touched the device ever. She also forgot the password to the device and blamed him even though he shouldn‚Äôt know that information. They keep calling him an awful son and I often recoil whenever I hear him shamefully call himself a bad person in front of his own parents over the microphone when we chat each other.

While his parents are paying off for his cost of living (shelter, food, etc) and not to mention his college tuition, we really don‚Äôt know what to do. All of these events have really taken a toll on him, and we‚Äôve both come to the conclusion that this household isn‚Äôt very good for his mental health. This is especially amplified by the fact that he‚Äôs stuck with them during COVID and doesn‚Äôt have much of a life beyond living there now. He barely has any privacy and is caught in either an argument with his parents about his sexuality or about some other trivial matter he has nothing to do with almost every hour.

I‚Äôve offered him to live with me next semester (since college is online now), but we really don‚Äôt have a solidified plan. Is there perhaps a safe way to compromise with his parents to let him stay over? Given their possessive and anti-gay attitudes it seems rough, and we would really appreciate any advice. 

There‚Äôs also the other option of not telling his parents and running away, but this seems risky and we‚Äôd need lots of input on it. I could pick him up and shelter him, but there are many things to think about. We don‚Äôt want to particularly sever his familial relationship by doing something so drastic.. 

I currently live with my parents as well, who are open to having my boyfriend stay over. We just worry about if his parents cut off his college tuition (he still has 2 more years to go), and how we‚Äôll handle his cost of living. My boyfriend and I could get jobs or internships to cover that, but it‚Äôs just an extra precaution to think about.

What do you guys think? I of course try my best to comfort him and tell him things aren‚Äôt his fault, but his family constantly gaslights the situation against him. Any advice would be appreciated.",17Jul2020,1
544,"Hello Reddit, I'm a long time lurker who has finally worked up the courage to post something.  I need some advice.

Some back story.  I'm a 40 year old man with a 17 year old daughter.  About eight months ago my girlfriend of six years left me and tore my world apart.  We had just gotten engaged and she left me for my friend.  This threw me into a deep depression and even the hospital.  It took me months to get close to being back to ""me"".   
Now that I'm bouncing back I am finding it difficult to afford my life my bills are about 90 percent of my monthly income.  I love my new job and it and the people I work with have helped pull me out of my funk.  It just doesn't pay enough to cover everything and for me to have a life.

What should I do?  

I have a three bedroom condo and I was thinking about taking on a roommate.   They would have to be a female imo because of my daughter.   A rented room in my area can add $500 to $600 a month to my income.   I live in a beach town.   

Or should I ditch my job and the people I have come to love to try to find a better paying job?  My prospects in the area aren't great but I know I could make about 10 to 20 percent more a month.

546," 

I went to high school with her and first 2 years we didn't even talk. In the 3rd year of high school we started helping each other by studying together(over texts and voice calls) and sharing notes. We also used to chat a lot during that period. After we finished high school we didn't chat at all. I didn't want to bother her because she was preparing for college and I did as well, so I didn't want to distract her and myself. After we joined college we exchanged a couple of texts about joining college went and for the next 3-4 months we didn't hear from each other(to make things clear, we were not that close, so it is not big surprise). When we started college I contacted her to see how she is doing and until New Year we didn't talk/text. At New Year's eve I wished her all the best and she appreciated it. Then next 2 months we texted a little. I was not the one who needed to reach out first all the time. She did it as well. I was planing to invite her to see each other and catch up, but we went into quarantine. She invited me to play some video games with her and her friends during quarantine and it was fun. Then one day she randomly texts me and says that she had an situation which reminded her of me. 1 month forward and we are here. We texted about our finals and I mentioned when mine final exam is. Night after exam day she randomly texted me with wishing me good luck. I was shocked. She remembered that date (which I told her 15 days before). After that my birthday came. All of my friend wished me all the best vie text, but she knew that I like programming and made effort to code custom birthday wish for me. I said that I am sorry we can't go out because of the quarantine and she said that there will be time for it.

P.S. She laughs at all my jokes (to be honest some of them are really good, but others not so much).

My question is: Is she just being extra extra friendly or she is giving me some hints. I can't really tell. No one else before was this thoughtful about me and I am really confused. What would you do if you were me?",17Jul2020,1
547,"During the lockdown, it became abundantly clear that my fiance and I had more than outgrown living with my parents, and on Monday we signed for a lovely little flat with rent that was well within the recommended 35% of our household income. We've been excited since, planning trips to IKEA and starting to pack up what little we actually have.

Also on Monday, I received a phone call from HR at work. Like most other people in the UK, I've been furloughed from my office job for the past 3-4 months and receiving 80% of my weekly wage (that would have been more than enough to cover rent, too. Honestly, this place is amazing and surprisingly cheap). Anyway, HR told me they were ""happy to formally tell [me] [I] was returning to work on Friday"" (today). I received another phone call yesterday, and again was just told I'd be returning to work.

When I get to work, I go into the HR office where I was told I'd go to have my temperature checked. I sat down and the woman in HR (Joan) gave me a presentation about the new policies and processes in place at work, such as the new one way system, the occupied signs in place to ensure that only 1 person was in the kitchen or bathroom at a time, and the card system to prevent people breaking social distancing measures.

After Joan finishes, she tells me that she's going to get our department manager (Bella) to come down and let me know some more information about what I needed to do. Bella comes down, and she seems awkward. She starts explaining how there's hardly any work to do, how some responsibilities have been absorbed by other people, and that it'll take years to get back to normal. Joan takes over again and tells me that for this reason they have to let me go. 

She kept talking for a bit, but I wasn't sure if I heard her right. Then she explained that there just wasn't enough work for me, and how when the company is back to normal in a few years they may give me a call. I'm getting a week's pay (I've been working there just under 2 years), and my manager gave me a box full of my stuff as I was unable to go up there and get it my self.

So now I don't know what to do. This was completely out of nowhere, the last I heard from my manager in regards to work was that we were busier than they thought they'd be. As far as I know, I'm the only member of the sales office to be let go.

We move into our flat in 3 weeks, starting a 6 month tenancy. Our income together has just dropped ~50%. We live in England. I don't know what I can do to keep on top of the rent other than keep applying for jobs and hoping something comes along before we move.",17Jul2020,1
548,"Hey there! I am 15 years old and I‚Äôm trying to gain some weight. I‚Äôve been going at it for more or less a year now and I managed to gain 10 kg from my initial weight and I am healthy now based on my BMI! (I was underweight prior)

However, my weight has been stagnant recently and it‚Äôs been bothering me a bit like a day after my workout I would be 56 kg and then the day after I would be 55 kg again. I know that weight fluctuates on a weekly basis but I can‚Äôt help it because at the end of the week I get the same results at times.

I do admit however that there was a time where I was stuck at 50 kg for a long time and then after another week of working out I suddenly just skyrocketed to 55 kg so this might not even be a problem at all!

Though I‚Äôm still curious as to why this happens. What is this process going on? 

Thanks in advance guys! 

-If it helps my workout consists of 42 minutes of calisthenics then afterwards I lift weights for 33 minutes. 
-I have a calorie goal of 2,840 per workout day and at the end of the day, I typically get around 3825-3900 calories. However, I don‚Äôt always eat 3825 cals on rest days I eat a lot less.
- I take 2-day breaks after every workout day

TLDR- My weight is stuck at 55 kg despite my consistent workout routine but sometimes after a long while of stagnancy, I randomly start gaining again. Why is this so?",17Jul2020,1
549,"The context: My(26f) BIL(18m) is supposed to have a full year to graduate highschool due to Rona. He's been at my and my boyfriends(26m) (his brother) apartment for the last month and a week. He wanted to stay another month, but im pretty sure he would have asked to stay longer. We treat him like a capable adult and dont ask anything from him. We supply his survival. His mother, from what i understand, needs a break. Cool. 

The issue: I have supplied his drug habbit. I have bought it for him in amounts i am not even sure im comfortable with. But i do it. Hes getting greedy. His mother promised us money for his demands as i started voicing my concerns. But she is as reliable as a bag of lays potato chips, a whole lot of nothing and disappointment. So he has resorted to lieing(telling me he is already out), manipulating(telling me he is running low can he please get some more), im missing 20$, and im pretty sure he struts through the house at all hours of the night because he knows it wakes me up and i have work in the morning. 

I need the words from people: i refuse to buy any more for him. Ive left to his brother. I cant get away from the kid, hes followed me into the bathroom, every time i sit down hell ask, any time i get home from somewhere hes in my face. He mopes around like he isnt included in absolutely everything we do. He convinces his brother to spend as much as he can on junk food and other useless crap that doesnt service us any good. I make food for everyone and he devours it and it prompts his brother to go into hyperdrive and they become vultures and ive kind of been starving for a month.

I dont know how to say no. I dont know how to tell him to back off or if i should. I dont want to upset him or make him feel like hes in the way. I want to make his experience a good one. I want him to come back and want to come back. This is family and i dont have much so i want to preserve what i do have.

I even went as far as memorizing a weird contact phone number, and in states of mania, I have to beg myself to not try to contact it.

557,"I'm 25, the job is at training centre in practical skills in my field of work. I joined 1st of July.  I did their course a few months back and the trainers were so nice, I loved them all and it's the main reason I wanted to work there. I even used to chat with one of the trainers on WhatsApp and we used to talk a lot about everything, her personal life, how all the trainers hate the boss because he's very authoritative, stuff like that. She even used to tell me how it will be nice if I join them and work as we would all make a good team.   

So I joined them and they are still friendly but they stick to themselves. There are a total of 3 other trainers and the one I used to talk to sometimes comes and talks to me but they live on campus and I don't. So during lunch time, the three of them go to their place on campus and eat. They haven't invited me over despite it being a 1.5 hour lunch break.  So I just eat lunch alone in my room.    

What makes matters worse is that the boss doesn't seem to get angry with me and they have heard him laughing and being in a good mood when I am in his room so now whenever the boss calls me in, the trainer I used to talk to says ""your best friend is calling you"" she says it in a joking manner but it just makes me feel even more isolated. I know they hate him because one of them swears silently and gives the boss the middle finger when he's not listening...it's such a complicated position where they think the boss is going easy on me.  They have been friends for 3 years and I feel like a sore thumb even though I really like them all otherwise.  I don't want to go and make them invite me through any overt act...

564,"For context, I'm a 22 yr old male, recent college graduate, that regularly struggles with depression and anxiety. For about the last 8 years I've had 2 very different (yet both equally as prevelent) personalities in my head fighting for control. I have done a fair amount of research on dissociative identify disorder (DID) which is more commonly known as multiple personality disorder and I don't believe I have that since both personalities are constantly present and aware of each other. 

The first is my 'social' personality that experiences relatively strong emotions, relies on humor to interact with people, and changes itself constantly to fit whoever im with. It is definitely what I consider to be my ""main"" personality, since it's how I experience day-to-day life and interact with people. This personality, is impulsive, charismatic, and a bit nihilistic, but has some serious self esteem issues and regularly changes itself to seem more likeable.

The second personality is what I call the ""observer."" It's an exceptionally critical perspective that is constantly watching my social personality and making notes. This personality typically holds many strong ideals that it tries to enforce on my social personality through means of self-manipulation and 'cold' logic. This part of me feels no empathy and no emotion; it has trouble understanding people so it let's the social personality do the interacting. Even though I feel that my social personality is closer to feeling like my actual self, the observer personality has always had a strong grip on me and quite frankly has been around the longest (I used to actually be like this at face value. I would manipulate my friends, couldn't understand people at all, and regularly felt no emotions and had to engineer false personalities to fit in. It was only after a battle with severe depression that the social personality really developed).

I'm not sure if I legitimately have two personalities, or if one of them is a product of severe anxiety/other internalized issues that I've been ignoring. All I know is I can hear both of them think at the same time and they suggest different things and have different motives that regularly conflict, and it's all driving me insane.

I know I should probably see a therapist about this (and I am leaning on going), but I just feel like I'd do such a bad job of explaining it that I wouldn't get anything useful out of it, or that it would make me even more conflicted than I already am.",17Jul2020,1

And as such if we have a quieter week it's usually me and other shop staff (only shop staff, we can't help out back outside of terrible, menial jobs) who suffer for it hours wise. One day of the week is reserved for cleaning, and now it's the same 2 people every week because it's absolutely awful work. I can't even complain because it's 7 of my current paltry 18 hours. :/  

When lockdown first went round the rumour mill in the UK business was BOOMING. People panic buying and stuff. I wound up working 60 hours one week, and was slated to work my holiday week as well (which was shit but couldn't actually go anywhere so may as well make money, right?) but then I got sick with the 'vid, and had to be off for 2 weeks.  Come back, and it's still busy enough but calmed down a lot.  

Now, with places reopening, things have quietened off, and I've been thrown to the sharks again. As stated, I'm under 20 hours this week and if things continue I wouldn't be surprised to only have the 7 from the cleaning day in the future. I can't live with this, as my partner is furloughed and will be going back to work soon - but we know he'll be worse off for it, hours-wise. He's also searching for another job, but with the same luck as me.  I'm on a 0 hour contract, and he's on a 4.

We privately rent, and have tried to find council housing but we're a low band and therefore low priority. Currently he pays rent and council tax, and has very little left over afterwards, and I take care of all other bills and shopping. We have a small amount of savings but nothing that could help for more than a month or so.  

I've applied for \*so\* many jobs recently. Even ones I hate the idea of. Nothing. I scored an interview for one a short while ago, but nerves and lack of interview experience whiffed it. It's really wearing me down to even look, because I can see the failure before I even hit apply. I've tried to sign up to things like Fiverr with no success (because it's SO overwhelming to set up gigs, and even then why would you go to someone with no reviews and exp?), I'm not good looking enough to be a cam girl or have an onlyfans page. I don't have any talents or anything to make cash on Etsy, or whatever.  I really don't know what to do.   

If it keeps up like this I'm going to have to try and rehome my 2 cats, which is the thing I'm dreading the most. Going to try Citizens Advice next week, but I just did a benefits calculator thing online and at most it thinks that we'd be entitled to ¬£10/week if I did it correctly.  

I just need advice. I need money. Interview advice, websites I can go to to fill in endless surveys for PayPal cash, anything is appreciated.",17Jul2020,1

587," I have had previous interactions with a majority of the individuals there, not the best in my opinion. 

Me and my bf have had on and off in our relationship so my presence at most of the parties have been a 3/10. However, he has used me as an excuse to refuse participation in events he isn't interested in.

The hosts after our initial meeting appear rude however, this could be due to my open dislike towards them in private discussions between me and my bf. I'm unaware about how much of this he has disclosed to them in general and more so during our breaks. 

The parties are basically separated by the guys talking with the guys while the girlfriends engage with each other. 

I am awkward by nature and never was always distant at family parties. I avoid forcing conversations which can make me appear disinterested.

However, the lack of engagement of the other females makes me feel unnaccepted. (Mostly the original hosts gf and sister)

I don't know how to make amends or repair my relationship with these individuals without completely faking enthusiasm. I rather completely ignore the awkwardness of it all or confront head on. 

It feels like they already have their dynamic set up, 4 out of the six interact with me at least if I make a comment. For the most part the true distance is felt from the host and sister. 

I could also use tips on how to be more open and interactive to defuse tension that may arise.

Most if not all Internet advice is rather about doing the opposite: Making cheap stuff look fancier and more expensive than it is. Looks like most humans have a strong need to boast; def not on that league.

As someone living at a Latino country -yet still working hard to make it to the First World-, find critical for both personal safety and property preservation to acquire a daily use, enough-performing motorcycle able to look cheap or broken or poorly fixed without compromising its real performance / safety.

I would like to take all advice about how to make a motorcycle look it cheaper and utterly boring than it actually is, without damaging it, severely affecting its performance /safety, or making it unhygienic.

As for now, have considered: Black coating choice. Cover all branding with duct tape.LCD plastic scissor-cut cover.

593,"So I've never had a girlfriend, and a couple of weeks ago I almost ODed on tramadol, and this is how it all started. The most beautiful girl at my school hit me up asking if I was okay, and we talked for a bit over text. I've hung out with her like 3 times before this, over a year ago, but we like to mess around with each other in school. Let's call her Rose. Now, Rose recently got out of a 3-year relationship. Fast forward only 2 days, and I ask if she wants to hang out, she accepts. I went to her house, watched some stuff when to my house, she met my parents, and we went to a grocery store because she wanted to buy condoms for fun I guess. Now, Rose has always been a little sexual with every guy, usually through conversation. I also have another friend that likes talking to this girl, and they have been friends for a while, probably 4 years, although I'm sure they didn't talk too much when she started dating. He even told me a story of them making out but said that it didn't go past that. When Rose was at my house, we watched Netflix in the blankets and ate ice cream, she even randomly spoonfed me some ice cream. She said that both my parents were hot. We have the same favorite color and number. After that, we went on top of this tall building (her request) and talked.  I remember saying that I never make the first move with a girl because I'm shy, and her saying something along the lines of ""why not, like, you can just ask to kiss a girl, and if she says no it's not that big of a deal"". I'm not sure if this was a hint or her just being nice, but nothing happened. We also were playing smash or pass with our grade level and we both ""smashed"" each other, but that doesn't mean too much. Also, we agreed on hanging out the next day with two of my close guy friends and her, one of them being the guy that made out with her. Let's call him Bob to make things easy, and the other guy Paul. Anyways, we part, and that same night she texts me ""today was fun thanks for hanging out"" I said ""Yeah it was really fun I should be thanking you"" Then she says, ""see you tomorrow !"" ""goodnight"" In which I reply with ""See you!"" and ""Gn"". My mom said that she liked her a lot. The next day I pull up to her house around 5 minutes early and I see Bob in her backyard, not thinking too much of it. I go knock, and she opens the door, with Bob to her side. I find it kind of weird that only he is there and Paul isn't, but we go downstairs and hang out for around 5 minutes until she gets a text from the other friend telling her to pick him up. I'm sure she doesn't like Paul because she talks down on him and he is pretty weird but funny. Bob insists to ride his bike next to her moped, but she says it's okay. He keeps trying and she keeps declining. Alright, I'm going to fast forward because not much happens here, but keep in mind my other friend, Paul, speaks his mind and has no filter. We begin watching Scary Movie 3, as Paul suggested. Bob fell asleep because he didn't get any sleep, keep in mind she is laying next to Bob, they aren't doing anything though. Bob wakes up, and around 10 minutes later they started to get closer together. My friend Paul says something like ""Kiss! You guys are basically dating anyways!"" She said, ""We aren't dating!"". He tried to make them kiss for a while. A bit later Paul asks ""Is he hard?"" and she feels it and says ""Not really."" At this point, I excuse myself to the bathroom at an appropriate time. Of course, I start crying. But I had to maintain composure because I don't want to look like a bitch. It was around 6 pm and we've been hanging out for around 3 hours. In the last 20 minutes, I made no eye contact with Rose, and I usually do. I also wasn't talking at all. If I were to look at her, I would probably start sobbing because I'm emotional. Paul was hugging them awkwardly and jokingly, and I was just over there trying to act cool, on my phone. Anyways, I dismiss myself with no excuse, because she didn't ask, and I kind of wanted her to know I was uncomfortable. She said, ""See you later."" I think everyone knew something was up, but maybe not because it was around dinner time. I went to the compounds park and almost broke my phone out of anger. I was sobbing very hard, and was saying things in my head like ""I'm going to invite her to that tall building again, and jump off."" I meant it only for a second. After around 2 hours of driving around on my moped and thinking, I go home. I thought about inviting her to my house again, and because I would probably start crying when I start crying she would most definitely ask what's wrong. Then I would say ""No, It'll make you feel uncomfortable"". Then, if she insists, I tell her something like this: I thought that you liked me and didn't know that you were seeing someone. You're the first girl I brought to my house etc. etc. Is that wrong? Because there isn't much she can do. Should I text her my feelings and hope for the best? Should I play the waiting game?

Do I deserve Friends?

I am a 13 yr boy, and I am what people categorize as an introvert.

I have never talked to anyone in my school if not necessarily. I have always the quiet kid at school who doesn‚Äôt have any friends.

I have never had a real friend before. Every friend I have ever had seems so fake, so insincere. There‚Äôs one ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that I had who bullies me on a daily basis with other bullies and calls it a joke. 

It‚Äôs hard to communicate with different people. I always think before I talk so I won‚Äôt accidentally offend someone and hurt someone. I have troubles chatting with someone and talking with someone. It‚Äôs very hard for me to find something to talk about with my classmates. I don‚Äôt want to waste their time and talk about something that they don‚Äôt like. And even if someone tries to talk with me, I always have trouble replying them. I am always thinking like, How am I supposed to answer him/her? So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm treated like the ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô kid at school.

Because of these difficulties that I have, I don‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs fault but mine.

And group projects are very hard to do as well. It‚Äôs almost impossible for me to suggest an idea, so I just sat there, doing nothing.

596,"tl;dr I've been emotionally abused and lied to on a constant basis - I don't know how to accept it and move on.

I (22M) was in a short but serious relationship with a colleague (21F) for a month. It was my first ever relationship and it took a serious turn real quick. We worked together for two months prior to this and we're still working in the same office.

At first, the relationship was perfect. Really, exactly what you'd picture when you say the word 'perfect'. The problem was that - as I later found out - it was just heavy emotional abuse. I've never looked into it, never had to deal with anything like this so I had no clue. I also thought that emotional stuff can't get to me on that level, but oh, well... I don't like to admit it and I don't talk about it because whenever I bring it up, everyone says that men can't be (emotionally) abused but I'll spill it out here. I also want to point out that none of what I'll write was obvious to me at the time, as I later noticed it / found out.

I've always been there for her. Gave her all of my time, attention and love. Treated her the best, took care of her to the best of my abilities, been my best for her. I am not perfect, I have *maaany* faults but really, I don't think that anyone, her included, can complain about single thing regarding my involvement in our relationship. I never let her down, never lied to her, never disregarded her or insulted her, nothing negative or malicious. The problem, as it turned out, was that she was the exact opposite. If I had stopped giving, she would've done that too.

She had MANY personal issues (work, family, her past and present and future etc.) and I've always been there for her, helped her, listened to her, comforted her and gave my advice, if asked for. I'm saying this because one month in our relationship, I went through some rough times with my family. My one and only personal issue. To point it out, it wasn't anything serious. It was fixable (and was fixed within a week, just some normal arguments). After everything, instead of being there for me or even just acting normal, her decision was to take a break - basically telling me to go fix my issues and if she's still interested when I'm done, we'll go back to 'normal'. I was destroyed and fell into a deep depression, had suicidal thoughts. I've since been way better.

It's been three months and I've slowly started to realize that **everything that** she ever told me was a lie. And I can't stress this enough and you guys have no idea but... I'm talking about *everything*. From basic things about herself and her past, her relationships, her family, her preferences and likings, her ethics and morals, her personality. From serious things about future plans and life goals to little things like what she's doing at the moment or how her day went. Everything, every single small or big thing, was a lie. And I fail to see why. She wasn't cheating and she wasn't trying to hide anything. *I know that for a fact.* For example, she'd say that she has to do some presentation for our quarterly reports and actually go grocery shopping or cook. Or say that she's watching TV when in fact she's eating lunch.  And it was all on purpose. It wasn't her changing her mind on the spot. She would straight-up lie to my face. There's thousands of lies but I'm not going to go through them. Again, I have no idea why. I've never looked into it because I had no reasons to not trust her and because what she's doing is not my business but I did find out eventually and it's really bothering me. **Everything** was a lie.

I have three issues right now.

1. The first one is that, although a ton of time has passed, I still can't get over the fact that I fell for the most perfect girl who turned out to be the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I can't get over the fact that I've been lied to by someone who had my utmost trust and respect - especially by doing something like this.
2. The second issue is that I find it really hard to trust anyone and I can't imagine myself with her, but neither with anyone else. I can't accept the idea of having this happen again, with someone else.
3. The third issue is that I can say that I don't have feelings for her anymore, but I'd be lying. I can't get over it and it being my first relationship, it's really hard for me. I can't accept the fact that she will eventually see someone else and I'm really jealous, I'll admit it. I don't know why, though, because I don't want to be with her anymore but at the same time, I do. Sorry, I'm really bad at the emotional side of things.

Another important thing to mention is that we work in the same office 12 hours a day, just the two of us, and constant communication is vital in our field of work. I can't cut ties with her, I can't move offices, I **have** to be in constant contact with her. I don't know if you guys have any solutions but if you do, please... This is destroying me...",17Jul2020,1

600,"Hello everyone :)

This is my very first post on reddit. The situation I'm gonna talk about has been stressing me a lot - I have talked about it to some close friends but I came here to get more opinions and advice.

So here it goes ‚Ä¶

About 8 years ago my family and I went to Istanbul for a family holiday. One of the first nights we were having dinner in a restaurant and one of the waiters started hitting on my sister. By the end of the night they had swapped numbers and saw each other basically every other day of the holiday, and I‚Äôm sure they had sex at some point. The holiday comes to an end, he says his soppy goodbyes to her and we returned home.  

Once back home, they started talking online a lot, he asked her to be his girlfriend (which .. come on‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt even know each other then) and she said yes.  

Since then, she went over to see him loads of times. She wasn‚Äôt spending that much on flights (I work for an airline and got her staff tickets), but while there she always paid a shitload of money for fancy dinners, hotels ecc.  

One time while they were together she found his driving licence and saw he was much younger than he said he was. When she confronted him, he just sweet talked her saying he hadn‚Äôt said his real age because he was worried she would have rejected him (he is 6 years younger than her). My sister wasn‚Äôt having any of it, she was determined not to see him ever again but somehow he managed to convinve her otherwise.  

He also came over a few times ‚Äì my sister always paid for his flights, his visas and anything they did together.  

He once joined us for a holiday in Morocco, when he got there he started complaining about the accommodation which my dad booked and paid for.

This has been going on for so long, I am going to write down some points I think are very important:

&amp;#x200B;

* Shortly after 	their ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù began, he complained about his phone not 	being good enough to keep up with all the messaging and calls they 	were having. My sister bought him a brand new iphone 8. Couple of 	years down the line, the new phone started to have issues with the battery (he says), and he hinted at liking the iphone 11. My sister bought it for him. After the iphone 11, ear pods were on his wish list. My sister bought him some amazon fake ones: he wasn‚Äôt 	happy, and she ended up buying the real ones.  	  
 
* Every time he comes over or she goes there, she literally gives him few hundreds in cash. My sister says that he is struggling a lot and she wants to help him.  
 
* When his brother had twin girls, my sister bought toys and a pushchair for him.  
 
* The last time he was over, my sister wanted to take him to Genoa (we live about 90 	mins from there), but he insisted on going to Switzerland (a very 	expensive country). It goes without saying that my sister paid for 	every single thing. He even got fined for speeding driving her car 	while they were there and my sister paid for it.   
 Another time, 	before my sister had a car, he was here and they rented a car. He had an accident while trying to reverse out of a toll station on the motorway (yes...I know‚Ä¶). The car was badly damaged and they were charged about 2K euros. My sister paid.  
 Few weeks ago, he was driving in his hometown and crashed the car. The cost of fixing it was around 1K, which my sister gave him.  
 
* My sister‚Äôs 	plan is to marry him and live together in our country, so she has 	been asking him to learn Italian for years. She even paid for a 	course for him in Istanbul. Well, as you can imagine to this day he 	doesn‚Äôt speak a word.  
 

I have tried bringing this up with my sister, but she doesn‚Äôt want to hear it. She is like blind. She gets really upset and tells me I‚Äôm jealous or bullshit like that. Her argument is that he is struggling a lot, that she can help him (she has a really well paid job), and that I shouldn‚Äôt dare to say anything about him, that I don‚Äôt know what it means to be poor. It is worth saying that the rest of the family also agree with me. She also says that he never asks for money ‚Äì he doesn‚Äôt, but he manipulate the conversation into her feeling sorry for him and then sending the money.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I even tried setting up a fake Instagram account hoping to catch him out doing this to other girls, but for some reason he deleted all his social media a while ago.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what else to say or do. The other day, I talked to my sister about this again and she ended up in tears and isn‚Äôt talking to me.

Obviously I cannot say for sure that he is using her for her money, but this is what my gut is telling me and of course I would like my sister to be loved in a genuine relationship.  

What would you do guys? :(

601,"Hey everyone! I don‚Äôt want to say anything too personal on here because I‚Äôm referring to some friends and family of mine, but basically I feel peer-pressured by some of these people to go out when I‚Äôm not comfortable with it. I always wear a mask whenever I‚Äôve gone to stores or restaurants in the past few months, and I also limit how often I do those things. Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that some of my friends and family aren‚Äôt exactly taking the virus seriously, and I essentially feel like they‚Äôre calling me a wuss for not wanting to do certain things right now (ex. going to the beach). I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing that yet and was told was told in no uncertain terms that ‚Äúif you‚Äôre out in the sun it kills the virus if you have it‚Äù, which I‚Äôm pretty sure is bs... It‚Äôs kinda made me lose a bit of respect for some people because I don‚Äôt want to get sick, I especially don‚Äôt want to get anyone around me sick if I were asymptomatic, and I feel like certain people just don‚Äôt care at all.

603,"So I am 19F, living at home while getting my undergraduate degree.  I'm planning on moving out in two years to go to graduate school. 

I'd say I have a decent enough relationship with my parents on the surface, but recently it feels strained.  They expect me to be near perfect, and while I do my best, of course I fall short.  Because I'm older now, I can see what they do to me (and to each other, might I add).  Even though I'm turning 20 in a few days, they still act as though I cannot make my own educated decisions and cannot do anything right by myself.  Essentially, a lot of what I do or tell them is met with negativity.  Just yesterday, dad was mad at me for idk what reason.  Only thing I could think of was that I didn't get a joke he made (at my expense).  Mom can also be hyper-critical of my academics, such as getting a B on an exam for a 3000 level science course. 

My mental health has gone down the drain these last few months, and my parents have not helped.  They still constantly push me about my schoolwork and ask why I'm ""not acting like myself"".  I have tried talking to them about my issues and have shared some pretty upsetting things (ie self harm), all to no avail.  They both blew up at me back in May and were asking ""why do you hate us"" and saying ""we did all this for you and you don't care"", ""you're lazy/selfish/ungrateful"" and some other nasty stuff.  They think I'm ""being this way"" to spite them, and that I've ""been against them"" since I was 8.  What?? I know my parents have done a lot for me to give me a good life, but I just don't think they understand I'm not in a good place right now and I need their support.

There's a whole lot more I could write about, but this is an advice sub not a vent/therapy sub lol.  I figure talking to them directly would be the best route, but I know that if I do, they'll get upset with me.  Essentially I'm asking how can I talk to them without being met with negativity?  I want to like being around my parents, cuz they're my parents, but I just always feel anxious when I'm around them.",17Jul2020,1

I want a pair without a wire because the ones I've had with wires always break prematurely. I want this primarily for running and such.

606,"So hey again. I've posted a couple of times here about my problems. U can find them in my posts. 
But long story short here's a summary of my issues:
1. I found out my dad is still cheating on my mum with the same 2 ppl and it's been 4 years.
2. My mum is sick.
3. My mum isn't the same anymore. She has mood swings,she is in pain and she is tired a lot.
4. I feel stupid as I'm not as good as I used to be in school.
5. Everyone understands math but I dont.
6. I purge meaning I vomit things I eat to give me confidence.
7. My dad has friends who are perverts and they have rubbed my body parts a few timed and the stuff they share online is disgusting.

So since I've been behaving differently the teachers are concerned. I broke down that day to my friend and she ended up telling my English sir that I have issues. He is married to my chemistry teacher. She has noticed that I'm not my usual self. I don't look sad for attention, I just feel sad and stressed coz of the things running in mind and I can't focus in class. My English sir asked his wife( my chemistry teacher) about my attitude and they both agree I'm troubled. Yesterday during Chemistry my teacher came up to me and asked continuously what was wrong. She asked if I fought with my dad,my mum , if I feel stressed because of school and just every reason she could think of. I just smile and said that I have issues but I'm okay. I didn't tell her. 

Today I met my English Sir and he said he was hoping to see me. He asked if I was okay and I just kept smiling the whole time. I don't why I wanted to look sad but I don't want to show others that I'm weak. So I just smile and told him I wanted to talk. He said we could talk tomorrow at 10am. He told me to bring the friend that I broke down to the other day. She has her own issues and has been talking to him a lot since last year.

I feel that I want to tell an adult but out of all the teachers in my boarding school I only trust both of them ( my English and chemistry teacher). Last year when I was stressed about exams and my roommate I told my chemistry teacher and she advised me. My English teacher on the other hand is good ,understanding and has helped me in my studies a lot too. 
Now I'm not sure if I should talk to my  English sir or my chemistry teacher. Both of them are married an surely they'll tell each other about everything I confess to them. It's complicated but I'm looking for advice. 

I haven't spoken to an adult in real life about my problems before. If you have please do give me some tips. Should I tell everything at once or just the important ones?",17Jul2020,1
607,"I (17) am non binary, and I've wanted to begin simply painting my nails black because I've found that sorta helps me feel more comfortable with myself, I personally didn't think it'd be a problem, but it turned out to be

roughly a month ago I finally decided to buy some nail polish, so I went out and got some and painted my nails black, and to be entirely honest I loved it, it made me very very happy and I was in a great mood because of it. Then I just go about my normal day and walk downstairs, my mom happens to be there so she starts talking to me, just about things going on in her life and whatnot, just normal things. Then I go on for a bit in the conversation and Mid sentence she cuts me off and says ""what the fuck is on your fingers"", so I told her it was nail polish, and she responds with ""take that shit off, it looks horrible, boys aren't supposed to paint their nails"" (she does not know I'm NB), so I naturally fought back a little bit asking her what the harm was and she tells me I can't do it because she thinks it's stupid and it looks bad, and that it doesn't matter if I like it because I still have to take it off

so I took it off because she was threatening to ground me if I didn't

now fast forward to now, we have dinner as a family for the first time in about two weeks, and conversation drifts to my mom's spray tan. I don't remember exactly what was said but I do remember she ended up saying ""well I like it, so that's all that matters, and I'm gonna keep doing it because I like it"", so I bring up the nail polish "" incident"" as she likes to call it, and she gets PISSED. she goes off on a tangent about how she's 50 years old and how she has a job so she can do what she wants, and I responded with talking about how I can't work due to COVID-19 (she won't let me), and she keeps circling back to ""I'm an adult, I have more life experience than you, and I have a job, so if I tell you that you can't do it, you better not do it, or you will be punished"".

Now let me clarify, nothing more was said after that because of how aggressively she spoke to me, I shut right up after she said that. But a little bit later she decides to suddenly barge into my room, swinging the door open so it slams into the wall, and yells at me saying that I will never paint my nails, and because I have such a smart mouth I am now grounded, I can't go see my two best friends, and I can't drive anywhere (within reason due to COVID of course). 

maybe I deserved this? I have no idea, but this isn't the first time she lashed out at me like that, like half a year ago I came out to her as bisexual and she ended up yelling at me and outing me to everyone (even though I told her I wasn't ready to tell everyone, she kept on saying ""well if your comfortable telling me you should be comfortable telling everyone"")

any advice is appreciated, I genuinely have no idea what to do about this, I'm so unimaginably pissed off yet sad at the same time, am I even reacting the right way? am I overreacting?",17Jul2020,1

617,"I started a new job at the end of March, now this company has a reputation of being hard to get into. There‚Äôs 3-5 interviews before being given a decision, I did 2 interviews and was hired.

Due to covid, everything was work from home (training, meetings, modules, etc). This was the first time in the company‚Äôs 98 years of service to ever do virtual training. There were lots of issues, but we were on a tight schedule. 10 weeks training, 2 weeks of onboarding, then off by ourselves. Training was simple, quick, and we got the gist of what to do. My job is basically a ‚Äúglorified call center job‚Äù. Jump into after training, my first day of live calls was a nightmare, especially because the only resource I had was a live Skype chat. My 2nd day I had an anxiety attack that lasted well over 2 hours. It‚Äôs not been over 2 months since taking live calls and while I‚Äôm now more knowledgeable on what to do, my anxiety is still there if not worse. I have a mental breakdown way more frequently, I cannot enjoy my days off without being depressed about going into work the next day. I‚Äôve lost joy in things I used to do. I cannot eat breakfast because of how nauseous I feel every day.

I‚Äôve relayed to my manager and at first, they were understanding of it and seemed supportive of it, NOW, it seems as if they are just worried about their own stats that are reported to the higher managers. (Stats that show our compliance errors)


I‚Äôve been applying for new jobs with no luck until a couple of days ago. I got called and it went really well, it will be at a new opening restaurant/coffee/bar. I also have a interview for a hostess at a popular brunch restaurant.

I‚Äôve worked retail mall jobs for 5 years. There is something about taking calls 8 hours/day for 5 days/week that creates anxiety for me. Sitting down for hours on end at home makes me fee claustrophobic.

Engaged two years. 27 and 30

We have a good relationship. When we go out to eat sometimes I pay sometimes he does etc. No big deal. He earns a couple hundred more than me but tbh he helps out a lot more at home for his mA than me 
We‚Äôve purchased a flat and we went completely 50/50 on that with our deposits and solicitor fees. 
My parents have gifted us a bed which is on its way and ¬£400+ or so more on other bits for the flat. He has brought stuff in gifted from his family too such as many kitchen utensils. 
Alas my side has put in a lot more which is fine I don‚Äôt expect anything from anyone. When I said to him that it‚Äôs fair if he gets the table and chairs so that it‚Äôs more fair he basically said that the stuff my family got were gifts so it‚Äôs not from my own money hence doesn‚Äôt impact me.

Now, this is all great, and we have a really good strong connection. I'm feeling things towards him that I haven't I felt in a while. HOWEVER, when it comes to the time in between the dates, he takes hours upon hours to reply, and he never initiates a conversation. I've been keeping in mind that he's not a texting person, but it's been really affecting me mentally. It's this big split between feeling like he isn't interested at all due to the fact that we talked an average of like two texts a day and he never initiates and the way he is in real life which reflects the exact opposite. 

The last time we talked was two days ago (4 texts or so) and this morning at around 12 pm I asked him out on a third date. It's 5:20 pm now, and still no reply. And I know I shouldn't do this, but I've seen him online (we talk on Whatsapp) multiple times today. Which has really made me feel shitty.

I changed into my shorts from my jeans and I was wearing underwear.

That building has a HUGE roof and the guys were playing cricket or something on the other side of their roof before, but after I arrived, they gathered around the side of their roof from where they could see me. I could tell they were talking about me because some of them kept looking at me. I felt very uncomfortable and so I went home. They started hanging around the place from where they could see my room at like 10 or 11 at night ( they didn't do that before). I started keeping my windows closed after they did the same thing for 3 days straight. I kept my windows closed at night and and as well as in the day because I was afraid. I think they stopped coming after I kept my windows closed for 2 weeks. I became incredibly paranoid, to the extent that I refused to open our apartment's door, afraid that they would show up. I've started opening my windows now but I keep my curtains drawn.

A few days ago though, I was watering my plants and I looked up to look at the building just to make sure no one was looking at me. But there was one guy standing and he called over another dude and they started talking, all while looking at me.

Bit of a long shot but I‚Äôm stuck in the ER for the past 3 nights. I was supposed to have emergency appendectomy the very night I came in and now it‚Äôs been 3rd night of me being there. I‚Äôm still in pain and have been asking for a doctor for a day to ask about my medical treatment plan. Every time I bring this up, I‚Äôm just ‚Äòreadied for surgery‚Äô and moved to a different room. It‚Äôs been 3 nights of not being able to charge my phone, not having eaten food. 

I did try asking for my blood reports for a second opinion from a friend‚Äôs dad (who‚Äôs a doctor) and according to him the surgery should have been done within 24 hours. After raising that question all I got was 2 surgeons convincing me how urgent it is and how risky would a transfer be to another hospital 2km away. They didn‚Äôt answer any questions of mine saying that a doctor will visit me to answer them. That was a day ago.

I know medical professionals are working hard but I don‚Äôt have any explanation of what‚Äôs gonna be done. I live alone and have no idea how much care would the surgery even need or when it‚Äôs gonna happen. 

I have said that I won‚Äôt be signing consent until I see a doctor who can give me concrete info about the procedure. They had sent a nurse to get it signed.

I had a transfer request processed by my insurance and they were told I had consented for the surgery which I didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs why they have been holding me up for all this time. Upon a lot of struggle to let me see my medical file, it has a consent form saying that I ‚Äòverbally consented‚Äô

I would prefer to adopt a puppy, so I was looking around and there‚Äôs a pitbull puppy that I think is pretty adorable and my partner loves. However, I‚Äôm nervous about having a pitbull in the house. I know we would be responsible for providing/nurturing him, and I would do anything to make sure he‚Äôs extremely well trained, and kind. But still, there‚Äôs always a risk he could harm someone. I don‚Äôt want to be afraid in my own house of my own dog. But I also don‚Äôt want to adopt a dog only to have put him through the traumatic experience of finding a new home. 

My question is, am I being too cautious? Should I get over it and take this puppy into our house and train him and love him and hope for the best? Or should I keep looking for a dog I‚Äôm 100% comfortable with (French Bulldog, Victorian Bulldog, etc). Some other things to consider: we would adopt the Pitbull so the price is just the rehoming fee; any other dog would be purchased and they pretty much all start at around $1,600, which I think is objectively ridiculous since I‚Äôve always gotten dogs from farms pretty much for free, although we can afford it. Also, having a Pitbull can be a little limiting since there‚Äôs some restrictions on them if we ever choose to move. Also if we go to visit my family, which we usually do for holidays, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring the Pitbull since I know my parents wouldn‚Äôt want a dog like that in the house. Anyway, please let me know if I‚Äôm just being too cautious, thanks!",17Jul2020,1

Specialists (people who have honed one set of skill far more than others) are often more highly regarded in society, e.g. professional sports players, musicians etc., and the idea of being 'a jack of all trades, but master of none' is seen as a bad thing. However, I can also see the benefits of being well-rounded and perhaps there is a survivor's bias of those who specialise and make it to the top. Also, what about people who have specialised in something and then had a life event that made them not be able to specialise (e.g. pro-sports player getting injured)?

I work for a semi big company and they recently fired the old supervisor, ive only been on the job for about 6 months but there are others who have been here longer ( &gt; 1 Year)

Im pretty happy with my wage now and i work 5 days a week. I was offered the position and was told it‚Äôs because of my attitude and work ethic, which kind of surprised me. 

Now im second guessing if taking the promotion will be a good idea for me. 

Here are my reasons:

- I‚Äôll inevitably work more hours and on my days off, leaving me not much time to do the things i care about most.

- Others at work who have been eyeing that position and have been there longer than me might get jealous and sour, and i hate conflict with co workers.

- I already feel that management doesn‚Äôt really care about us that much and if i step into the supervisor role, i may just be setting myself up to be used and abused.

- Supervisors are on Salary so they come in to work a lot plus they are always on call.

- The pay is $4 more per hour what I get now.

So a few years ago, I (15M) was sexually assaulted by a close family friend. This really traumatised me and I had no one to talk to so it just built up.

So, a couple of days ago I told my mum pretty much exactly what I said above and that I would like to be able to experiment again with pull ups. Of course she wanted to talk about the assault, which I am very grateful for but I would likely rather talk to someone else as I more just wanted to have it off of my chest.

My (22F) ex-best friend (28F) cried to me two months ago about finding emails to his (27M) computer while he was away on vacation and asked for his hotel info. He has already cheated once a year ago. She asked me to go through his computer because I‚Äôm really good at digging into things. I found multiple occasions where he cheated. Proof and all, nudes, talks about cheating occasions. While he was on vacation she asked me to make a fake dating account we found his active profile on (my other friend said I could use her pictures) He messaged me instantly and we set up a time, told me when he was coming back where he lives, and details of him no one would know. I helped her move all her thing out of his house and moved them into mine (our homes are about 30 miles away from each other) we did this multiple times until everything was gone of hers. 

When he came back she confronted him and asked me to be there if anything happened. He lied initially, sweared on his family he never cheated. And then finally they walked away because he was getting aggressive with me because I was backing her up and showing him evidence we had. They talked without me there and he finally confessed and he buttered her up said it was only once and when he cheated this time he finally knew she was the one and she ate it up. She came back to tell me this and I told her she‚Äôs making a mistake because she was going back to him and I helped her move all her things and he‚Äôs never going to stop. She didn‚Äôt care she said it was none of my business and told me I‚Äôm a bad friend if I don‚Äôt support her with what she does. I found out the next day she was getting her stuff from my house to move in with another friend, her cheating boyfriend went to the girls house he cheated with after we confronted him that my best friend and his best friend (my boyfriend 25M) slept together and that‚Äôs why he was upset. But in reality it was because we caught him and he knew he fucked up once again. I told her this and she didn‚Äôt care and I told him he‚Äôs not allowed over my home anymore. 

I talked to my best friend and told her what I found and I spoke with the girl he cheated with. And all she had to say ‚ÄúWell girls lie too.‚Äù and that ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just saying that because she wants him.‚Äù But she had no idea he was in a relationship.

And this is what she said. ‚Äú Oh honey wake up, you guys have been the ones going around running your mouths about my life/situation to other people, keeping it going, not me.  So if anyone should be saying, keep me out of your life, it should be me saying that to you and everyone else that thinks this situation should be still going on when it's been a month already. The fact that I haven't said shit to anyone just shows how more mature I am than the rest. And don't you ever bring my family up again! Not your life, problem or situation, so get over it! True friends stay by your side no matter what, even if they don't want to ""take your advice"" on whatever the situation is. They would still love you and support you. But whatever I've said my peace, so Peace out then I guess!‚Äù She has no proof I said anything she admitted she was saying ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù because she didn‚Äôt know who out of 50 friends she told said something. This is what she said ‚ÄúCan you read, I didn‚Äôt say you specifically, I said all you guys, as in don‚Äôt know who is but someone is fucken running their mouths‚Äù


  Again I never said anything to anyone, and I was by her side helping her from being depressed for two years. She threw our friendship away instantly and never reached out to me for two months. I can‚Äôt be with a friend who accepts a relationship like that and with someone who lies constantly. She‚Äôs just as bad as him at this point. Am I a bad friend? Please tell me your honest thoughts.

677,"This is gonna be long but bear with me, I'll try my best. 

  
I graduated a few months ago and was soon called to work in a COVID unit as an RN. Being the daughter of a single mother who is struggling financially, I immediately accepted and left my home town for this new, foreign place, with enough money for a month of rent and some groceries. 

  
Honestly, I did struggle at first. At some point I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror anymore, I felt alone and not felling enough but I like my job and kept going, finding my way to cope: started visiting the city by myself, took some free plants and developed a true obsession with cleaning all over the place. 

  
The first month they paid me around 300$ (I'm  European), saying that I didn't start working from the first of the month and that the first weeks were of training. Moreover, they took something like 35% of takes. It was just enough to pay my rent and I did struggle but still made it. This month they did something similar again, adding more taxes and ""donating"" a percentual to a union association(?) that I've never heard of. They told me that I was the one asking for the higher taxes and the donation when I signed the contract. I found a free financial advisor who sent them a letter to stop them from doing this again next month. Will see how it goes... 

  
During those times, I developed extreme hunger to the point that food seems like is never enough to fill me and constant cravings for junk foods and sweet, without being able to afford all of this. I thought that stress made my bulimia have a spike but I didn't go through purging or exercising, as usual, instead, I'm ashamed to say this, but I got to the point were I stole food (and still do, occasionally). 

  
I didn't take food from markets or private food but would take some of the leftovers from the common lunch break or the stuff that the hospital leaves us, as some biscuits and crackers. One day another RN took a chocolate cake, but when our shift was over there was still 60% of it, so I warped a piece a took it home... I'm thinking of asking to my local church for some food...

  
Adding that I started to feel sick often, I took a pregnancy test which was later confirmed through a gyno appointment (free healthcare). Apparently, sometimes the pill is not ""strong"" enough.

  
Before getting engaged, my SO told me that he doesn't want babies but that the choice is completely mine, but his parents are still completely supporting him financially cause he is struggling with college a lot. He is currently 8 years into a 3-year college degree, plus he wants to get a master's and I can't ruin his life with this.

  
I can't sleep, I can't see a way this could work. Abortion seems like the only choice I have but a part of me doesn't agree. I would not be able to provide for him all by myself, nor I can ask for help from anyone. I didn't tell anyone about all of this. I know what is the only logical thing I could do but I'm struggling to accept it...

  
The only thing I did was getting tested again for COVID, I'm waiting for the results.  
Reddit, what would you do if you were me? Do you see a way  I could make it work by myself? How could I look after him when I'm at work with no one with me? How could I pay for the stuff he'll need? How can I make it work without being a weight for my fianc√© or my family?",17Jul2020,1

679,"We have had a new washer, one I purchased but she chose in January. 

And every little damn thing is an issue with it - mind you that no one else has trouble washing.

Her clothes stain and no one else's. 

We've had a repairman over and he explained that front load washers use less water. That we have to dilute our fabric softener and other liquids. 

But my mom keeps having the same issue and I know she's lying when she says she does it right because the repairman has mentioned that if the liquids stay in the washer at the end of the cycle that the liquid was obviously not diluted enough. 

Since it's a top load washer it also makes sounds when it's changing cycles and she thinks it's somehow up to him whether it makes sounds or not or whether she'll like it or not. She just wants to make it obvious that she doesn't like it and for some reason wants the company to do something. 

Now she's complaining that the company should have mentioned the sounds. 

And she doesn't understand that it's up to us as buyers to know what we're buying. As I mentioned she could easily find a video review the repairman says that the company also has videos on the machines doing their cycles. The repairman also inspected the machine completely and said there's nothing wrong mechanically and that the sound is something that is part of the design. 

I know I have a Karen on my hands but is there some way to make her understand? She acts as if it's by law or something that she needs to be satisfied with the product and that the company has to oblige. 

I purchased the damn thing and no one else has issues with stains because we use the machine the right way. 

I always calmly tell her and she just gets louder and louder and she doesn't even understand calm language.

She seriously would listen to the words of some uneducated dummy from work over my educated ass.",17Jul2020,1

2.

Afterwards I was grabbing some of my clothes and phone which were on her table and while doing so I think a notification went off? Or a camera ping, I'm not sure, if it was the latter it was because I mightve accidentally scrolled to the right on the iPhone screen and hit the red thing. Either way she immediately came for my phone. I legit didn't know why at the time or care to ask cuz I was on cloud nine and so I let her take it. I'm not sure if I gave her access inside (hope I did so she could see) or whatever, but Idk, she started fidgetting with it and I wasn't entirely sure why but at the time I didn't care to ask why. And she gave it back to me a few minutes later and we talked a bit and I left.

Haven't seen her since or talked to her since. But I was just reflecting on the moment with a clearly state of mind and now part of me realizes that maybe she thought I recorded us or even worse maybe she thinks I shared it or posted it somewhere. I'm wracking up with guilt cause if she thinks I did and is worried that I'm sharing it or posting it. Like that makes me feel bad. It makes me feel terrible if shes worried about smth like that, cuz I could kinda understand with all the horror stories we hear that someone could worry bout this. And to make matters worse, once something like that is shared, it belongs to the internet now. Idk I'm worried she might be going down that rabbit hole of thoughts. And obviously the reason I think she's doing that is cause I'm doing the same.

So should I go hash this out with her? Is that weird? Cuz now part of me is like, she'd be EVEN MORE suspicious if I did. Like she'd be like ""Why would he say smth like that 5 years later?"" Or should I just let this go, and say hey, look I didn't do anything, and if she was worrying thats on her.",17Jul2020,1

700,"Hi guys! I hope everyone is doing well during this crazy time. My loved ones are all doing well and staying healthy, which is all you can really ask for right now.  
I am in a complicated situation with a friend/coworker. She is getting married in the fall and is currently planning a bachelorette party near where we live that is in an area that COVID cases have significantly decreased. She had one planned somewhere else originally, but canceled because the original trip was in a hotspot for COVID.  
I've known her for a little over a year now, and we have gotten rather close and I am invited to the wedding. Although I am not in the wedding party, she extended an invitation to this new trip, and again due to the decrease in COVID cases in our area I said yes.

The issue now is that I found out that some people on this trip are traveling from hotspots, and we are the only two people ""local"". Also, I still live at home, my mother (58) is a diabetic and my father (59) has had lung issues in the past, so either of them getting COVID could certainly be deadly. On top of this, I would most likely have to quarantine when I got back which would seriously affect my job.

To me, there is no doubt I should cancel, but how should I go about it? She has made shirts and masks for this trip, as well as booked the hotel and some experiences throughout. I did the math and each person would probably be out another $100 in my absence (which is not super expensive but also not cheap, but I know everyone on this trip could afford it) I thought about offering to pay my portion if anything that's nonrefundable, but I am still worried she will never forgive me or be pissed. We are in a field that understands the current situation due to COVID, but I feel like with this it will be potentially really uncomfortable for some time.

Knowing the huge list of things that needed to change in this shop to become IOS certified. Anyway. Long story short :  2 years into the company and my manager up and quits. My bosses next move is to place me into that position do you to the fact I was the only one on the floor that was knowledgeable enough to build and test the systems I understood the quality and I understood the importance of the deadlines. My boss never gave me a title for a supervisor and never gave me a raise for the extra work and hassle. From September of last year up until April 2020 periodically I would go in and speak with my boss about not being able to get my coworkers to follow my instructions because to them I‚Äôm just another employee but to my boss I have the expectation and responsibility of supervisor but it was in adverted. My boss had a meeting with everyone saying that any problems or questions to come to me but still did not give me a title or a raise. I asked why in April and he told me that he was fearful of potential drama that could arise by placing me in charge. Yet in so many ways I already was I was then told I just didn‚Äôt have the face that company was looking forward to lead the crew in the direction they wanted. The following month my bosses buddy got the position I sought after. I have a high performance engineering degree I also have 9+ years of shop experience. The gentleman who got the management position came from lawn care service background. We make lifesaving equipment for the military for FEMA and a bunch of different contracts. 

Ended up loosing my job after engaging in an argument that I could‚Äôve walked away from but I wasn‚Äôt willing to admit fault to something that had nothing to do with me. That lawn service guy who became my manager told me to run and test the unit. The following day I came in and did so. At which time a part failed due to being installed incorrectly. one of the ways we can narrow down the technician who installed the part is the paint dots which we put on after it‚Äôs torqued down to specification. My paint color is pink the paint color on the governor plate was orange. 

1. This unit was built to the engineers drawing (needs to be changed so this doesn‚Äôt continue)

2. My manager gave me the go ahead to test and run the unit

3. The quality guy also gave the green light to running this unit.

4. The paint marks are clearly NOT mine

5. I understood that the part was installed incorrectly it would take me less then 15 minutes to swap it out (which I did) 

But my boss was very insistent that I admit that I have no clue what I am doing. As if he was baiting me into a fight.


He got so loud that the front office ladies came out into the shop to try and calm the situation. 

My boss goes to lunch, I swap out the part.

When I go to test this unit my boss comes out screaming at me..

You quit! You need to get your things and leave! I never quit. People started to gather at this point. Where i kept repeating to him that I didn‚Äôt quit, and asked him if I was fired. 

He accused me again that I had quit and this is just some sick game to get unemployment. Then goes on to try and break me down any way he can by saying never send a woman to do a mans job.. how many units are in the field that could potentially fuck up because I was the one who built it. Said I always go around crying for gold stars and shotty work.



Smh. I did a lot for this company.

713,"Hi redditors,

Today I'm not ok and I need you your advice.

First of all, I'm 18 years old female and I matched with 16 year old female, in february (it's been a month since my birthday) 

I know It's my fault, I saw that in her bio was written 16 (like this *16). 

Even so, I decided to match with her  because I thought it wasn't big of deal. Now, I see that is a problem. 

I should reported her as an adult and I regret it everytime I think about it.

We started to talk on the app x and moved to whatsapp. We get along petty well. She told me her name, I told her mine. We were about to meet one day then the next day she said she couldn't for a justified reason.

I feel relieved I didn't meet her. I thought we could be friends so I tried to push conversation about common interests. I stopped a few months ago. It was wrong what I was doing.

Seriously, everyday that I think I about that, I think there's no room for improvement and I shouldn't be forgiven.

I made a promise to myself to never use a dating app again, I will never know if the person behind the phone is 18+. 

Should I be forgiven? Can I improve?

Thank you for reading üåπ",17Jul2020,1
714,"I'll preface this with the fact that I began the process of hiring an attorney. I haven't signed his retainer agreement yet but we did agree on a flat fee amount over the phone. I'm hiring him to settle a 25k debt with a collection agency. 

I told him the amount I have total which would include his fees is 20k, which is true. That is what I have. Obviously he told me he has my interests in mind, but my family seems to think I should've told him I only have as much as I would ideally like to settle for which would've been 10k.

716,"I‚Äôve been thinking harder on my childhood recently. Mostly single mother.  3 siblings. Poor-ish upbringing. My mother did her best. As a strong, independent, and nearly frighteningly confident person, she got things done and made things happen.

 But she had her moments. Being ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù or rather- beat with a belt is seemingly normal in the black community. Nothing ever noted on unless as a punchline. All cool, right? So why is it that- as of recently- I can‚Äôt get those memories out of my head. This morning, I woke up in a cold sweat, shaking, crying, and threw up over the side of my bed after a nightmare of her screaming at me to the point where I begged for her to just kill me.

719,"So a few months ago, after my therapist pointed out I have several traits relating to autism, I got tested and yeah, I'm autistic.

I can hide it well enough so people think I'm ""normal"", maybe kind of odd but well within normal limits. The policy I've got is if someone asks, they can know. I don't want to make a big deal of it because I don't want to be treated differently, whether it's getting special treatment or treated like an invalid.

That being said, I feel that my parents should know, since they raised me after all. They're pretty typical parents and raised me okay. I love them and they love me.

But when I try to bring up the diagnosis, they shut down entirely and completely dismiss me, citing they would have noticed the ""red flags"" sooner or it's just me being a quirky person. I think it might be because my brother has aspergers that they want one ""normal"" son.

I don't hide my autistic traits around them, if it's stimming or covering my ears around loud sounds or getting far too passionate about certain topics, I just let it happen and they seem to be okay with it. 

I really don't want to force them into an uncomfortable position by dragging them to a doctor and having him explain it to them but I also hate how they're ignoring a vital part of my personality.

Is there any way I can make them accept I'm autistic while causing as little discomfort as possible?",17Jul2020,1

721,"So... I'm at a bit of a crossroads here and I'm stressing out a tiny bit. I need you're help on what I should do.

So for the longest time I've just been kind of coasting through life. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do and was afraid to really put my foot forward into anything for fear of it being a waste. Recently however, I had buckled down and decided on what I wanted and how to move forward and I applied for both a trades course and a firefighter course. I know firefighting is highly competitive but I feel like that's the career for me. Trades could work out for me too but firefighter is the ultimate goal.

Then COVID happened and both those courses got suspended...

No problem, I figured. I had though this might occur so I applied for the trades course in the winter. I should get into that no problem and then try for the firefighting course next year.

Oh... The firefighting course for next year has additional requirements I don't have.

Ok well I can do some Academic upgrading and get the credits I need and still apply to the firefighting course while getting into the trades course in the meantime.

Oh... Getting one of the credits I need may extend into January when the trades course is supposed to begin.

And that's where I'm at now. If I do the trades course I'll effectively be forfeiting doing the firefighting course OR I do the academic upgrading to get the credits I need for firefighting bit that means I most likely wouldn't be able to attend the trades course in January and there's no guarantee I'll even get into the firefighting course because it's so competitive.

I know that I WANT to be a firefighter. I know it's not easy either but I feel like I would be happier doing that than a trade (even though I would probably be fine with a trade). I'm 25 and still living at home because I can't afford anywhere else. I just don't know if I should forfeit what I want in order to get out on my own sooner or take the longer road that isn't guaranteed but would probably make me happier with the reward.

Hi all, I got laid off from my airline industry job in April, and as of mid June my company cut our insurance as well. Currently I am on unemployment,  and have no health insurance. 

Since the extra $600 a week congress passed is about to expire on July 25th, I‚Äôll only be bringing home roughly $1,100 every two weeks on unemployment. I know that‚Äôs still better than what many people have been given, and I‚Äôm thankful. The only reason it‚Äôs so ‚Äúhigh‚Äù is because I was making decent money at my airline job before I was laid off, so I qualified for the ‚Äúhighest bracket‚Äù of unemployment income. 

I do have about $9k in savings, for emergencies and because my boyfriend and I are about to move across the country at the end of August- and moving cross country isn‚Äôt cheap. 

So, I got my COBRA notice in the mail, and my monthly cost would be $526 a month for health insurance. To me, that‚Äôs disgustingly high considering I‚Äôll only be able to take home $1,100 every two weeks starting July 25th. Cause, ya know, I still have to pay for rent and feed myself too. And to be honest I‚Äôm not even entirely sure if it‚Äôs good coverage. 

I‚Äôve definitely been applying to jobs every day, it‚Äôs just been difficult as a lot of companies understandably are not hiring right now. That‚Äôs not to say I won‚Äôt give up, but I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm not actively trying to get a job. I apply to multiple every day. 

It scares the piss out of me not having insurance in times like these. God forbid if I needed to go to the doctor sometime soon, it could easily wipe out all of my savings. And I don‚Äôt even want to think about the fact of what could happen if I got Corona and needed inpatient care. 

So, I guess my question is‚Äî should I suck it up and pay the ridiculously expensive COBRA premium? Or should I just risk it until I can get another job?",17Jul2020,1
724,"My bf and I are both 22. I‚Äôm getting really tired of feeling like his mom/life coach but I‚Äôm afraid I may be overreacting. I‚Äôm just to going to make a list of all his man child behavior. 

1. When we started dating at 19 he did not have a drivers license or a job. He had never had a job either. He did not get a license until he was 20 and did not get a job until 21. He only got them because I asked him too. There was no reason why he shouldn‚Äôt have had either of them especially since we live in the Midwest where you need a car to get places and his parents have to pay for all of his stuff including school because he has no money. I have paid for practically every date we have ever gone on and drive him everywhere. If we want to visit each other I‚Äôm expected to drive. Keep in mind when we are not in school we live 2 1/2 hours away from each other and even if he comes to visit me I am expected to drive to come pick him up because his parents will only drive half way. He still doesn‚Äôt have a car. 
2. Cannot cook. Can‚Äôt even boil pasta. Every time he has come over to my apartment during school and we‚Äôve decided to cook together, I‚Äôve ended up doing all the work because he doesn‚Äôt know how and is afraid to mess something up. Even though we use recipes with instructions. 
3. Doesn‚Äôt know how to do personal care. I manscape his privates for him. I pluck his eyebrows. He washes his face with shampoo. I had to teach him how to floss his teeth because he didn‚Äôt know how and when he couldn‚Äôt figure it out he threw a fit. 
4. I‚Äôve had to help him clean his dorm on move in day because he doesn‚Äôt know how to clean. I asked him to clean the sink. He responded with ‚Äúmaybe you should do it. I don‚Äôt want to do something wrong, I don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù 
5. Complains about being fat. I told him to start eating healthier maybe. He says he doesn‚Äôt know how to do that. Idk... eat some vegetables. Do some research on how to have a balanced diet. But he wouldn‚Äôt do research because every time he doesn‚Äôt know how to do something, he just says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how‚Äù and never tries to learn how to do it. Even though most of these things are just a google search away. 
6. Is in major debt but has no money. Doesn‚Äôt know what his credit score is, doesn‚Äôt understand how credit even works. Has never paid taxes. 
7. Is 1 1/2 behind in school because he has failed so many classes just from lack of effort. A year ago, he waited until the last day of the semester to start working on the two biggest projects he had in one of his classes. He‚Äôs a bad student in general despite being pretty smart. I had to show him how to use a database to find sources for a research paper our sophomore year of college. 
8. Spends most of his time playing video games. 

How do I handle this? Should I break up with him?",17Jul2020,1
725,"A year ago, one of the hinges on my laptop broke so I took it to a well-reviewed local place to get it fixed. They fixed it for $60 and said if I had the same problem again, the $60 would be credited toward another repair.

In February, it broke again, but slightly worse and they said they'd have to order a new part. They said it would be $160 minus my $60 credit and that I could pay over the phone and bring my laptop in when the part was shipped to them. I ended up paying in March because I didn't have the money earlier. They told me they'd call me when the part came in. Unfortunately, it was shipping from China so I understand that they haven't been able to get it with everything going on. Around April or May I called them again and asked if I could get a refund of my $100 and just pay again when I get my laptop fixed and they told me they can't refund special orders since the $100 was to pay for the part. They also said that I should've paid more because it didn't include labor costs. Which I'm pretty sure is what the $60 credit was for.

I have not called them again since then since they seemed pretty annoyed at me for asking for my money back. Now I'm worried if they do ever get the part in, they'll try to charge me more than what they originally quoted me (I have a note in my notes app with the costs from the day I first called them,dated way back in Feb.) Is there anything I can do to get my money back or am I just screwed now? Should I try to call them again or leave a bad review or what?

I paid half of it before they installed it and was told I‚Äôd pay the other half after the job was done. During the installation, I had to get in touch with the sales rep at the flooring company I talked to and paid the first half to, multiple times because they had made a lot of mistakes when putting it in, like tearing up my transition boards and missed grout spots etc. I think I called him around 5 different times because of new mistakes I would find that they made every time they tried to fix it. Even now after the last time they came to fix stuff I have found more mistakes but at this point I‚Äôm tired of calling them. 

My problem is this, now that it‚Äôs been a month since the installation has been finished, I haven‚Äôt got a call from the rep at the flooring company to pay the rest of the tile cost. Should I take this as a blessing that he isn‚Äôt going to make me pay because of all the installation mistakes, or can I get in any legal problems over this? Can my credit score be hurt if I don‚Äôt call him to pay for it? I haven‚Äôt missed a call from them either, so I know they haven‚Äôt tried to get me to pay. What should I do, call them or not? 

TL;DR: Paid half my tile installation costs before installation, had lots of problems during installation including having them come back many times to fix mistakes, and now haven‚Äôt got a call to pay the rest of the cost a whole month later. Should I call to pay or not?",17Jul2020,1
742,"I've got a pretty bad lung condition that is likely a death sentence if I catch COVID. Of course, I live in a town of people that don't care. As a matter of fact over half the town wrote a petition saying they would forcefully oust the city council if they voted to make masks mandatory. So I'm pretty much the only one wearing a mask, but the paper masks don't really do a lot to keep me from catching the disease. I've been considering getting a respirator, maybe a gas mask if I can't find one, to reduce/eliminate my chances of getting sick.

I'm in need of advise in regards to employment, I was diagnosed with anxiety based depression just before lockdown and now am currently working from home.

756,"So I (24F) was talking to my boyfriend recently about a mutual friend, and basically came to realize through this conversation that I‚Äôm not a very good friend to them, despite being the ‚Äúadvice friend‚Äù people often come to with struggles. I always thought I was good at HELPING people, but what I‚Äôve realized is I‚Äôm just good at UNDERSTANDING people, and often my understanding for why they‚Äôre behaving or thinking a certain way comes out as coddling them; I prioritize ‚Äúcomforting‚Äù them over telling them what I really think/feel. For example, say friend says to me ‚ÄúI just want to quit my job and have my boyfriend support me‚Äù (none of my friends have said this, I think I‚Äôm actually thinking of a recent reddit post lmao, but it works). My internal reaction to this is ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs pretty selfish‚Äù BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY ‚ÄúI understand why someone would feel that way‚Äù. I always lean way too heavy on the ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù part, and try to sort of get the ‚Äú..but you‚Äôre being selfish‚Äù part across without actually saying those words. I‚Äôll try to ask questions about the boyfriends‚Äô perspective, for example, to sort of gently guide my friend into considering it. But often, the part with my ‚Äúcritical‚Äù opinion just doesn‚Äôt come across to them at all; furthermore, the mutual friend I‚Äôm specifically thinking of will often say things like ‚ÄúI feel x way about this...is that totally fucked up of me??‚Äù And I never know how to react if I do indeed think her assessment of a given situation is..a bit fucked up. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her, (which could definitely selfishly motivated on my part). This particular friend also reacts veryyy intensely to perceived criticism (like she‚Äôll start crying instantly and questioning herself as a person/will see something as a personal criticism that‚Äôs literally not in any way shape or form)  I usually jump to reassuring her, like ‚Äúno, no that‚Äôs not super fucked up, it‚Äôs normal to feel that way, but maybe consider..‚Äù and I feel like the rest of it gets lost. Idk, I guess I‚Äôm sort of questioning myself in my own way lol; I want to be honest with my friends, I don‚Äôt want to enable ‚Äúbad‚Äù stuff. I just don‚Äôt know how to to ‚Äúbe blunt‚Äù, it feels super unnatural for me unless I‚Äôm talking to someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúblunt‚Äù themselves (for instance its easier for me to criticize my boyfriend, because he‚Äôs extremely honest with people. I always thought his communication style was too harsh, but our friends end up being grateful for the honestly and ‚Äútough love‚Äù down the road.)

But it‚Äôs absolutely necessary that he also takes the medicine and cleans his room (changes the sheets etc) &amp; toilets. It‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs already got the pinworms as well. 
 
At first I thought I could just give him the medicine through a drink and not tell him. And just change his bed sheets as if nothing was up. Then I realized that it‚Äôs stupid and probably wouldn‚Äôt work 100% as he has to pay special attention to his hygiene during the treatment. I would also have to clean the toilets and that‚Äôd be a bit weird to do without telling him what‚Äôs up. No doubt would he think my behaviour is weird. 

What should I do? How do I phrase something that is so humiliating to me? I feel embarassed that I, a grown ass woman, got pinworms like a freaking kid. (I probably got them from my goddaughter who I‚Äôve been hanging out with a lot).

759,"Our ages

I'm 20 and asthmatic
My friend is 19
My brother is 17 and asthmatic)

I don't know where to go to talk about this.
Ever since my friend needed help and got a woman pregnant we allowed him to live with us.
The first bad conversation we've had was about having sex and that was 2 days into his stay with us. In that conversation he was calling me a bitch for wanting to have sex after marriage.

My friend would constanly try to get me to use sazon while I'm by calling me a bad cook, He also leaves the house without a mask for hours on end. I've tried talking to him about it but it goes in one ear and out the other even my pleas to at least wash your hands when you come back inside. I'm tired of waking up at 2 am because he's finally home. The only thing that stopped him from coming home that late was by saying next time you show up at this time I wake up for you. (My mother gave me an earful for that one because it was rude)

Other than that everything was okay and chill but as time went on I've been cleaning up after him, from the garbage he leaves on the floor or the dishes that he uses and never cleans. So at first I was asking him to clean some of his mess while I'd clean the rest. I'd ask him late at night almost every night to lower his music, the TV and the news. This happens usually at night where at first he'd keep the TV volume at 50. Eventually he started ignoring my daily noise complaints so I'd get up out of bed and lower it for him.

 When he cooks he uses half the kitchen and uses the wrong pots and pans to make them like when he used our small pot for eggs instead of tea. I've told him the same things back to back and it's just been annoying me making my next approach more aggressive. I don't hit him it's just my tone, and being that my younger brother complained about the same thing I know that part of the problem is me, and it's not helping that the more I ask for the same things the more sass that I get in return from my friend. Including the time when I had an argument with my mother and when everything was over he came into my room to tell me that my problems aren't shit and he's been through worse so he doesn't understand why I'm feeling the way I am. I've tried to talk things over but he'll act like a kid about it rolling his eyes ignoring me, walking out of the house to sleep with a girl or one of his friends or saying yeah but you didn't do that yet. (Note: I cook for four people my mother, brother, him and me and clean up after everyone that isn't my mom since she's so clean most of the time) or he'll tell me that mom told me to stop bullying him. These are his first responses to anything that I say that isn't praise. 

I've talked to my mother about it and she said that my little brother would give me the same complaints before covid of being too aggressive in how I ask so I'm not fully trusted. During our monitored conversation he was allowed to interrupt me but I wasn't allowed to interrupt him, along with his remarks of your too emotional, you can't handle it so man up, if I was in your position I could do better or just calling me a bitch in an indirect way. Now my mother is just being more aggressive with me and now it feels like I'm not allowed to mention anything bad that my friend does. Honestly I'm just really lost on what to do next.",17Jul2020,1

I‚Äôm not doing well financially, but at this time I had to stop and help my brother in any way I could. He was a victim of domestic violence and acted in self-defense, so he wasn‚Äôt at fault for anything, plus he‚Äôs immunocompromised and all I could think of how he was in the worst place to be in during this pandemic. No one asked to help me pay, not even my brother. I just said I‚Äôll do it, just let him know I need it back soon so I can pay my bills.

We moved in in November 2019 to an already infested apartment. A little background info about how crappy the management is and what we're dealing with..
They promised to help us set up Xcel energy accounts and never did. They said "" a wrong account number was provided upon move in. "" Which is a lie, Resulting in us getting charged $80 a month extra in ""vacant service fees"" because there is no one registered for energy.(It's up to about $500 we can't afford)
They never came to fix or check in on us after move in - every tenant is given a check in list to record breaks/flaws etc. We called 5 times a day 6 days a week and never ONCE did the phone get picked up. Never once have our voicemails been answered and if they don't take 2 weeks to reply to an email, you can't even understand what the hell they're saying in it. (Again: fucking morons.)
Anyways we didn't report the infestation for a long time because of work, bullshit and general human error. We've had 3 treatments and the cockroaches are worse. Our neighbors got FUMIGATED a few months ago. At least 7 other units in my quad needed to be treated. This whole apartment complex is pretty crap. Anyways it's so bad, there are 2 different species or maybe it's male and female, idk.There are stains on the walls. I found a small nest underneath some of my subwoofers. There are cracks in the walls they come in and out of (big cracks). We can't use the oven because when it gets hot they come pouring out from behind it ü§Æ There is not a spot in the house we haven't found them on save the bed. We've had to throw our food out save sealed food. I even found some dead baby ones in the fridge.
Here's the catch though.. my roommate is a big reason we've been late on rent every month since we moved in. Cuz Covid now we're $2000 behind so we're not good tenants at this place. I say it doesn't matter, in Colorado there is a law entitling us to a pest free and fit home. We don't think we can take it longer, we also face eviction in August. 
I'm wondering if anyone has legal advice or if you think we should contact a lawyer to break the lease but without paying the giant fee.
But how can we prove it was infested before, and why didn't we report? Is what looks bad. 
We feel we can't stay here but we have nowhere else to go. Advice?

I never ever post on reddit but I need advice im shaking. 

So a few days ago, i got a notification that someone logged into my VSCO account late at night from a different phone. I thought this was kind of strange but I didnt think too much of it. Weird but not that bad. However, yesterday late at night, this guy I havent talked to in MONTHS (since last fall?) texted me drunk. He was saying how he liked me and stuff and asked really weird personal questions about my ex boyfriends. He also kept asking to hangout but then it got worse. Out of no where he started to say things like ‚Äúidk why but girls always call me daddy‚Äù or ‚Äúu look like the type of girl to do that‚Äù. Literally the conversation wasnt THAT weird until that point. (Until then i was giving him short answers but then once he said that weird stuff i didnt respond). This conversation happened around maybe 2-3 am?? 

Background on this guy: he is a compulsive liar. He lied about so many random things that he didnt need to lie about?? It was so bad that everyone made it a joke and mocked him because he was trying to be dead serious but clearly the things he was saying was not true!!!! 

So that only was weird but this morning i woke up to my car having sticks spelling out my name on the hood. My heart dropped. I double checked w everyone like friends and family and no one would have done that. Also someone who came home at 12 am said they didnt see it but my mom who woke up at 7 said it was there then. That means someone would have had to come from 12-7 am and do that??? There were also no sticks around really so the person would have had to go searching for some just to do that. Also about around 11 am this morning after i saw the car, he texted me saying how i slept and gave me a nickname even though i stopoed responding last night.

771,"This is my first Reddit post (I had originally posted this in a subreddit for Reddit helpü§¶) and I barely know what I'm doing but I know I need help.. I got with my partner 5 years ago, and when we got together he took my virginity and it was like he couldn't get enough of me. Multiple times a day, every time we saw each other. Well years passed and we were off and on due to him cheating. He's currently 21 and I'm 19, and we've moved on from our past. My issue now is that I crave sex. I crave the intimacy of a makeout session. For him to acknowledge my nude pictures I send him or at least even my selfies. I crave how he used to look at me and how kinky he was with me. I crave the attention i used to get before other girls were brought into the picture.. now I have to beg for sex and usually to be told ""I'll think about it"". And I don't ask for sex a lot, just every few days or so, but he's always ""not in the mood"" and I get not being in the mood, but for him he's never. He'll watch porn before he actually decides to have sex with me, which I don't fully understand because I will watch porn with him and do anything at all he wants. I'm completely his and will do just about everything. What can I possibly do to get him to want me again? How can I get him to love me like he used to love me? I've lost weight, I've worked on getting a bigger ass, I've changed so much to fit what it seems he wants, but nothing has worked.. can anyone give me any tips on what I need to do?

772,"So, I'm a pretty open, non-judgmental person whose group of friends has always been diverse (different races, ethnicity and trans/cis; if you are cool with me, I'm cool with you). That has put me in situations where I was taken advantage of by dirtbags, but I try not to let that affect me going forward; I don't want to slide into bigotry.


So, it's difficult for me on how to approach my friend and their family, especially because there's certain stereotypes that they live up to, and even if I approach them in the most respectful manner, they're not going to change at all, which will just make things awkward.



To get to the heart of the matter, I found clear evidence of a break-in when I got home after midnight. I was exhausted and didn't want to call the cops or anything.

What makes me so sure it's my new friend is that he's not even tried to hide his interest in some of my property, even when I was clearly getting uncomfortable with his behavior, and when his mom came by with their younger siblings, the whole family was acting weird.


Again, I don't want to be come across as bigoted or anything, but their behavior when they were (very) briefly at my house only seemed to align with  widely held stereotypes.


So, what would you do if you were in my shoes, confront him, or should I leave more catfood outside so he and the other raccoons quit breaking into my house?",17Jul2020,1

Pros:

-I love my life when when I'm living with just my girlfriend (as I have at school for the last two years). Living at home with my parents, not so much.

-My father is immunocomprimised (plus my mom is an older adult), so for the last five months I've had to wear a mask in the house if I leave my room. I'm constantly anxious of getting them sick.

-I would (probably) be able to go back to my on-campus job that I love.

-In my opinion, being on campus would be safer, because in a month both my parents will be going back to work, and they work in jobs that are quite exposed to COVID in. If I lived on campus I would only have contact with my coworkers and my girlfriend.

-I could take advantage of the on-campus amenities.

-I would get more ""practice"" of living with my girlfriend on our own


Cons:

-The cost of living on campus. Thats it, but it's a big one. I'm not too worried about my future student loans due because I receive large scholarships, but still, it's around 11,000 for 8 months of living. Not a great rate.

797,"Me(20) and my boyfriend(21) go to the same university. We are two years away from graduation. We love each other a lot and we always solve any problems we face in this relationship. However, from the start of the relationship, my boyfriend‚Äôs strict parents has been a problem that we cannot solve. 

&amp;#x200B;

We go to school in a city that is very far away from my boyfriend‚Äôs home, but his parents use life 360 to monitor where he is. Since the start of our relationship, I have been thinking going for a trip many times, but my boyfriend‚Äôs parents never agree even before Covid-19. I can understand that we don‚Äôt have the right to go for a trip as my boyfriend‚Äôs using his parents money, but anything we want to do depends on his parents.His parents are just controlling in every aspect (My bf never had sleepover until his 18) (My bf got his credit card suspended for a month after he forgot to text his parents good morning for two days). As we go to an expensive university and the heavy coursework, it's impossible for my boyfriend to get a job and pay for his tuition on his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example is that me and my boyfriend went to a road trip with his mom, as his mom doesn‚Äôt agree my boyfriend to drive longer than one and half hour. In the hotel his mom asks him to stay in the same room with her, (for me it‚Äôs hard to accept as my boyfriend is already 21, but I respected her decision), but we took a nap and when we woke up it‚Äôs next day‚Äôs morning. We apologized many times, but the next day when we back to his home, his mom started to yell ""I have to talk to her!"" and ‚Äúyou think her parents will allow her to stay in the same room w you?!‚Äù She also said that we can‚Äôt stay in the same room even when we go to school, or she will pull my bf out of college as she pays the tuition. As I said before they track my boyfriend‚Äôs location, so it was a stressful time for me until they finally somehow agree us to stay in the same room and we didn't know why they suddenly agree.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like that, anything I do with my boyfriend has to wait for his parents to agree, especially his mom. And the waiting is always long, like 1 week to 1 month, and there is nothing we can rely on to predict if his parents will agree. It is just really stressful. Most of the times the answer is no, except for one time we wanted to go for a trip for 3 days. My bf's dad said yes after he said 2 times no before. Even that, we went for a trip to somewhere I didn't want to go at all, but we have to go there as that's the only place his parents would agree. And we drove there as it was 4 hrs away, and we had to lie to his parents that we took a bus and went there with our friends but not alone (we even plan to make strangers pretend as our friends if his parents ask). After the trip, I was thinking does the happiness from going to that trip really outweighs the 2 weeks of stress we went through before that trip and all the stress we have from lying?

&amp;#x200B;

My bf‚Äôs brother and his dad also all listen to his mom. My bf‚Äôs brother said they tried to not listen, but the outcome is just worse. I always thought it will be better after we graduate, until my bf‚Äôs mom uses inheritance to threaten my bf ‚Äúif you get married after college you won‚Äôt get any inheritance‚Äù. My bf said he will give up inheritance if his mom keeps using that as a threat, but my boyfriend hates conflict with his parents, so I doubt if anything would change after we graduate. However, I can only put hope on after graduating it will be better although I'm also afraid I will get depressed if I got the big disappointment after graduating. 

&amp;#x200B;

His parents are not all bad. It was kind of them to let me stay in their for summer as I couldn't go to my home for certain reasons. I moved out a month ago tho, because his parents wish me and bf to behave like what they think we should be and to do things that they think we should do. It ended up I cannot do anything and me and my bf got super stressed that we had been depressed for weeks, and I moved out to my friend's home in another city. In the process we also tried to communicate with my bf's dad that we get really stressed as whenever we do some of our own things my bf's mom always tries to intervene, and bf's dad that we have to listen to bf's mom. I wish my bf can go to our school city 2 weeks before his original plan, so we can at least have 2 weeks as our summer break before the school start. But this is also all dependent on his parents and till now they said no. TBH I moved out because my bf wished me to go, so going to university 2 weeks early is like a way to make me feel that I worth something in this relationship. A lot of things that we kind of have to do in this relationship, like some things we have to do to make us forgive the past or solve a problem we are facing, we can't do them because of his parents.

&amp;#x200B;

My bf doesn't want to listen to his parents, but conflicts with his parents get him extremely stressed. Plus his parents will take away his money if he doesn't behave good. He says it will be better after we graduate cuz he doens't have to conflict wiht his parents face to face.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to say is that his parents are not all bad, but they got extremely mad when things don't go the way they think, and they always use money as a threat. Whenever I have a little expectation in this relationship, they always turn out to be disappointment. I'm getting really depressed as all my hopes just die continuously.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish to get some suggestions on how do I not get depressed from the situation. Like how should I think about this situation and still feel positive. My friends think I should leave this relationship because I'm stressed and depressed, but me and boyfriend love each other a lot and the things happened are not his fault.",17Jul2020,1

So a few years ago, I (15M) was sexually assaulted by a close family friend. This really traumatised me and I had no one to talk to so it just built up. Soon after this I started to wet the bed again, my mum and I discussed this and decided that I should just wear pull ups for the near future until it got resolved. Whilst this was going on, I realised how safe I felt when I was wearing them, it kind of transported me back to my childhood and it was like I had nothing to worry about.
So, a couple of days ago I told my mum pretty much exactly what I said above and that I would like to be able to experiment again with pull ups. Of course she wanted to talk about the assault, which I am very grateful for but I would likely rather talk to someone else as I more just wanted to have it off of my chest. 

Was what I asked wrong? She said that it would be a step back but I think that it could be crucial to fully recover as it is a coping mechanism as well as something I find comforting. What should I say to her? Have I done the wrong thing by asking? 

Any responses are greatly appreciated!",17Jul2020,1

806,"I got offered a ""job"" as a secretary at an immigration law firm that pays me next to nothing for 40 hrs a week in exchange for ""experience"". The thing is, my first year in college starts in a month and I'm majoring in Computer Science which has nothing to do with law. And even worse I am only expected to hold this job for a month because they're not guaranteed to hire me part-time after classes start (but they want to me to come for a month and get ""experience""). I also really need to make money to pay rent, tuition, etc. So I was thinking of getting a regular minimum wage job as a cashier or waitress or something of the sort. The lawyer who's offering me this job is trying to guilt trip me into accepting by saying that a job at a restaurant or grocery store will add nothing to my resume. But if really had to work for so little or even for free, wouldn't I be better off with an unpaid (or paid if possible) internship that's actually related to my major? Sure, ""a month of working as a secretary at a law firm"" might look somewhat good on my resume, but is it worth it not being able to pay for rent and food just to squeeze a few months of experience out of this job? I don't plan on holding a min-wage job throughout college by the way as I will be trying to land an internship as soon as I can; so I have nothing against unpaid internships it's just that this particular job has nothing to do with my future career.",17Jul2020,1

809,"I need some opinions on what to do. To start off with I am pretty new on Reddit (this is a throwaway account though) and also English isn‚Äôt my first language, so sorry in advance if I sound a bit all over the place.

I live in Europe and I am a 20 years old male. I may suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, but my doctor agreed that I should come back for a complete diagnosis if I felt the need to or anything changed. My dad suffered from BPD too so my doctor told me it‚Äôs very likely what I have too through my genetics and certain things which has happened to me. I have done private therapy for social anxiety (which most likely comes from BDP), but I can mask my anxiety pretty well and therefore it hasn‚Äôt caused too much trouble besides me skipping out on certain things throughout life.

I can‚Äôt get myself to be diagnosed by the doctor or go through therapy for BDP or any other major illnesses it could be, due to the career path I want to choose. I won‚Äôt disclose the career (sorry). The career requires you to be healthy, which I am, but they will also look at mental and physical notes from both past and present. If I got diagnosed with any illness, I will not even get through the application phase. Even if I fully got treated and recovered.

It‚Äôs the job I have strived for since I was a kid. It‚Äôs making me extremely anxious and scared for my future to think about and I just can‚Äôt risk getting it into the system. I feel like I have to continue living as I already have for myself and my future, but at the same time I feel the honesty in getting it done.

As an end note I want to thank you for reading what I had on my mind and what I‚Äôm feeling/struggling with. I know it‚Äôs not the best explanation, but it‚Äôs something I wanted to get out to someone. It means a lot that you‚Äôve taken the time.

810,We were hanging out regularly for about a year then I moved away. I recently moved back. When I was gone we kept in touch regularly but we didn‚Äôt see each other. Shortly before I came back she kept checking on me and telling me if I needed anything I could call her. She also called me a few days before I returned and said that we needed to hang out. When I got back I tried messaging her and she was responding but she was very slow. I tried to call her instead and she didn‚Äôt pick up but she sent me a message telling me she had training with work and that she would love to call me in a few days once she was done with training. I gave her the benefit of the doubt but she was posting constantly on Facebook so I had trouble believing her. Finally after a week I asked her if she was still willing to talk on the phone. I told her to admit she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me she insisted she did that she was just busy so I told her to stop lying to me and she gave in and called me. A few weeks later I asked her if she wanted to hang out because she was moving soon. She told me she would love to hang out before she moved and we made plans to hang out the following week. She cancelled twice the first time she said she had a therapy appointment and the second time she told me she had a miscarriage and that she was in a lot of pain and would stay at home until she is better. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but two days later she was at a campground. She told me she didn‚Äôt mind her family seeing her bleed but as her guy friend she was uncomfortable with me seeing it. I called her a liar and she cut me off after that. Even though she cut me off I still think she‚Äôs lying. Do I make sense or am I being paranoid?,17Jul2020,1

814,"My husband and I are both alcoholics and drug addicts. I have been clean and sober for 7 years. He was sober for the 2 years we dated before we married. He has been a chronic relapser ever since we married with the exception of 1 year of sobriety in 2018. We have two very young children, a baby and a 2 year old. 

When he is sober he is a fantastic husband and father and very successful with his work as an engineer. When he drinks and/or uses, he yells, punches holes in walls and doors, says horrible things to me, talks about how he should kill himself, or drinks until he is unconscious. He often leaves to go stay in a hotel and just drinks until he passes out, then when he wakes up he drinks more. He typically stays sober for a month or up to seven months, then relapses. He's had seizures from withdrawals.

He's been to detox and/or inpatient treatment four times in the last three years. He takes antidepressants and at times has taken antabuse. He's done AA, NA, and a weekly therapy group sometimes consistently, sometimes not. 

He's relapsed again and after a week of drinking in a hotel, he was arrested for public intoxication. He called and asked me to pick him up. When I picked him up he had sobered up and told me after thinking about it for a long time with a clear mind, he thinks I should divorce him so that he can't hurt me and the kids anymore. I don't to divorce him because I want my kids to have married parents and when he's sober we have a very happy family life. But if he can't be sober I want to leave for my children's mental and physical health and safety. I'm afraid of divorce because if he gets half time with the kids I will be truly afraid for the kid's lives and safety. Do I have a shot at full custody? Is it worth the risk of giving him another shot at sobriety?

822,"So my daughter is an only child. During this whole pandemic, she has been bored and lonely. Recently she had been begging for a pet. My mom almost convinced me to get a prairie dog. I told my daughter she would have to save her money so that she could purchase one. I figured it would take months. I told my boyfriend about it and he didn‚Äôt seem to care. 

I have been thinking about how much responsibility goes into having a prairie dog and decided that it‚Äôs not a good choice. Last night I was hanging out with my child and looking up better alternatives. I started looking into guinea pigs and got really excited. While in the moment, I told her that we would go get one the next day. 

When I told my boyfriend (living with me for two years and not my daughters dad) about it that night, he got furious. He said that I didn‚Äôt discuss it with him first. He said that she didn‚Äôt deserve it because of her attitude. He keeps his xbox and chair in her room because I don‚Äôt like it in my room (loud when he‚Äôs up late playing with friends). He said he doesn‚Äôt want to play in my daughters room with a stinky guinea pig in there.

The reason why I didn‚Äôt talk to him about it first: I told my daughter yesterday when I was all excited. I did not think it would be such a big deal because when I told him about the prairie dog, he didn‚Äôt seem to mind so I didn‚Äôt think he would care about a Guinea pig either. I understand that that was a misconception and I told him that that was a mistake and that I was sorry.

Reasons why I think getting a guinea pig is a good idea: I want to get her a guinea pig because it can be her companion, I can use it for positive reinforcement, and it can help her build responsibility. 

He gave me the silent treatment all night last night and today. He told me that if I get that guinea pig, he will not talk to me and give me a hard time until I get rid of it. I called him controlling and now he is making that into a big deal because I am calling him names. 

I also told him it would be best for him to move his xbox and chair into our room because he‚Äôs always complaining about her making messes in her room anyways and he‚Äôs refusing to move his stuff out. He said that me and my daughter are always teaming up against him but I don‚Äôt see it that way. Whenever he has a problem, he wants it his way and his way only. He won‚Äôt ever consider it.

Okay, Reddit. I‚Äôm losing my mind and I‚Äôm getting desperate.

A few weeks ago I started to smell this weird smell that seemed to kind of take two forms.

I first started noticing it when I was in the bathroom. Initially it seemed to be my toothpaste giving off this light, but off putting smell. Then I was smelling it while on the toilet. Then I noticed the smell coming out of the basement/laundry room area (which is across from the bathroom). Then I noticed it coming from the kitchen. Then I noticed the smell seemed to be coming from me, specifically my pits. Now, I‚Äôm tasting it when I eat.

I really don‚Äôt know how to describe this smell. Sort of burnt rubber, but sweet? But also like something is decaying?

My fianc√© thinks I‚Äôm just smelling my sister‚Äôs weed (she lives with us, and smokes so, SO much weed), and I have smelled a VERY similar smell when I know she‚Äôs smoking. I think this is one part of the two forms I‚Äôm smelling. But my fianc√© smells nothing, and he‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm making this up.

I cannot track this smell down to anything specific! It‚Äôs very rare I smell it outside of the house, but I am starting to notice I‚Äôm smelling it in the yard too.

I‚Äôm losing my mind.

827,"A bit of context: I'm a 19 yr old male, from a 3rd world country, who took a gap year(sort of), who has no ideea where his life is going.

Last year, I applied to two Law schools(forced by my father), and got into none, due to the way admission works in my country. They take 50% of your S.A.T and 50% of the admission exam grade and that will be the final grade.
I did great in the Law school's exam but my S.A.T grade brought my admission grade down. I was short of 5% of getting in.
Is it my fault? Definitely. The thing is, where I live, in high school, you have to choose a specialisation(math-it, latin-history, social studies and so on...) 

My parents chose math-it for me, without me having any saying in it.
I f-ing hated it. I'm glad at least I didn't flunk it.
I was humiliated by the teachers, a classmate kicked me in the groin resulting in me having a testicular tumour(he got away with a slap on the wrist), and many more... I got a 75% out of 100% S.A.T grade(the way it works here). Most people there got a 90%-95%.

I could not change the specialisation(I really wanted biology-chemistry) because I would have had to bribe people in the education comission(I live in one of the most corrupt countries in the world)

This year I'm having a go at pursuing getting into medical school. There, the exam accounts for 90% of your grade and 10% of your S.A.T. This is what I truly want. I busted my back learning, no social life(there wasn't any to begin with), and mainly hard work..

But what if I don't get in? I can't really speak to my parents as they are... not exactly the most reasonable people I know... 
I do have a get out of jail free card, that being an engineering university where I know for sure I can get in but I don't want to be an engineer... Plus, If I'll stay another year at home my parents will most likely kick me out...

I've tried talking to him about it, saying that I'm worried and that it's bad for his health, but he told me that he doesn't care what happens to him and that he doesn't care if he dies young, and occasionally says that he ""doesn't deserve food."" On top of all this, he has depression and has been refusing help even though I've been trying to talk him into it for the past 2 years (not constantly, just bringing it up every now and then). I'm really worried and I don't know what else I can say or do to help. What else can I do? I'm desperate",17Jul2020,1

834,"    A bit of background first, my dad invited his girlfriend and her kids to come with us to Coronado lasted year for Easter. His girlfriend always complained about everything even when she didn‚Äôt need to, she‚Äôd always come up with some reason to complain. When we got to our hotel room she got in an rhyme not with my dad and they didn‚Äôt talk for a few hours, we went to dinner and everything seemed okay until we left. My dad had to go somewhere with my sister (forgot where) leaving me with the gf, her daughter saw one of those scooter things and thought it would be fun to ride them around. Now keep in mind that the mom was drunk as hell and she only had 2 drinks. She sat there for 15 minutes figuring out how to start the scooter up and once she did we kind of had fun for a bit and then she started calling me a bitch and then I just kind of tuned her out. The next day we went to breakfast and she got drunk again and started arguing with my dad in public (again) and she walked off for an hour and me, my sister, and her two daughters walked off with my dad to distract ourselves from that mess. She finally found us and started yelling at my dad (who did nothing the whole time) and then he decided to just go back to the hotel. The whole car ride she was cussing me and my dad out. 

   When we got back she started acting like Jack Torrence from the shining (minus the axe). She started trying to get into our room by hitting the door over and over and when my dad folded her to F off she started hitting it harder and looking through the window. I had to sit through it and pack up my stuff, because we weren‚Äôt gonna stay there after that. My stuff was right next to the door so I just cried the whole time while I packed what I needed and then we ran off. We had to walk for a bit to get to the place to sign out of the room. We took her car there so we were stranded there. Long story short my ads friend picked us up and let us stay the night at his house. 

    Anyways, sorry for the wall of text it just feels good to vent. He‚Äôs been talking to her recently and they seem to be friends now but I can‚Äôt live with the fact that she might move back in with us again. She scarred me for life and now I have fucking flashbacks to that day almost everyday and I have to pretend I‚Äôm okay when someone asks what‚Äôs wrong.

838,"The short of it is I am struggling to figure out what language I should take for my college credits.

Logic:  
Easiest: German  
Most Desired: Japanese\*  
Most Usable(?) in Future Career: Latin  


Longer version:  
\* The college I am at does not teach Japanese which was the one I desired/desire to take most. I would have to become a transient student and take the course online. I have taken Japanese before, but as it was over a decade ago, I remember only a little. I have been to Japan several times and love it so this is the most in-life applicable language as I plan to return for future vacations, but I also know it is very difficult. Have some concerns about maintaining GPA with this one. 

Latin is one that I am considering since it is the origin of many languages and I do enjoy the idea of Latin. I am in school for an English degree, so I can see this one coming into play regarding writing. I am unsure how difficult Latin is in comparison to Japanese. However, outside of writing and cool tricks, this is likely never going to come into play in other situations. 

German is easier than the other two (to my knowledge) and I'm primarily of German heritage so makes more sense to me than French or Spanish. While I am interested in German almost as equally as Latin, I prefer Japanese the most. Latin and German are almost a toss-up, I just imagine German will be easier to take and would be the least stressful to maintain my GPA. It could be used in the future since it is a spoken language, but less applicable to my life outside of eventually wanting to visit Germany at least once.  


Any advice on the languages would be appreciated or even your experiences with each. (Esp Latin cause I have no idea what difficulty level to expect) Even aspects to consider that I may not have thought of is also appreciated.",17Jul2020,1

840,"Long story short the original plan was to stay two weeks with my cousin and I was super excited and it‚Äôs been something that‚Äôs been a big deal in my family, and I was telling friends and stuff and I was genuinely excited. I really like my independence and just doing my own thing, and not having my parents on my back felt great and it felt like I was on vacation. I‚Äôm a college student but I never got to live in the dorms and I commute from home so I‚Äôve always wanted to experience independence.

Anyways, my cousin says she‚Äôs picking up a friend and that I have to leave bc it‚Äôll be ‚Äúawkward‚Äù if we‚Äôre both staying. My mom told me this from the beginning but I thought she was just saying that bc she didn‚Äôt want me to leave. I just feel that‚Äôs kind of douchey and my cousin been staying over 3 times a week for the past 2 months, and like she originally wanted me to stay over so that she wasn‚Äôt alone.

It just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth how she didn‚Äôt realize how big of a deal it was to me, and she woke me up early just so that she could kick me out and go pick up her friend. I just don‚Äôt really have good trust with this cousin and I guess we just kind of grew up different in some ways. 

I‚Äôm supposed to come back after the weekend, but then I think she doesn‚Äôt want me to stay over some nights bc she works those nights, which doesn‚Äôt really make sense why I should leave.

842,"So I had to get two teeth (first bicuspids) removed so my cuspids could be lowered with braces. The orthodontist gave me the extraction order and I went to a dentist I‚Äôve been to a couple of times already to get it done. When I got home afterwards, I looked in the mirror and realized that the dentist extracted the wrong tooth on one side (2nd bicuspid instead of first). What should I/can I do now?

I was wondering if I could sue or file for some sort of compensation, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that. 

I will be going back to my ortho to see what he says and if indeed I got a wrong extraction, and I will decide what to do then. I suspect that since a wrong tooth was extracted, maybe the braces can fix it by moving it over, but now my time with braces on will be extended, something I was hoping to avoid. On top of that, one of the teeth the dentist extracted also had a filling on it, a filling that he himself did this past month; And I had specifically made sure that the teeth I was getting extracted didn‚Äôt need/get any work done since there was no point. So now I‚Äôve also lost the money that went into that filling. 

So what should I do and can I get compensation for this?",17Jul2020,1

845,"Hello. Yesterday was my 18th birthday, which me and my older sister (working) had planned for for quite a bit. We bought props for videos and we would end it off with a nice dinner, her treat. My father was disapproving of this because he felt that a simple dinner would be enough, and refused to go unless we follow through with his plans. This wasnt the first time he had done this, we had always known that he was a cheapskate (even if it wasnt his own money, claiming that ""I am not worthy to eat the food there""). He straight up argued with my mother on why we shouldn't spend our money eating a good dinner for a good 45minutes. 

My sister had invited over my grandmother (father's mother) to come over for dinner as well. When she heard that my father wasnt going, she said why not we just follow his plans so we can all go together. To prove a point, because he has been doing this for years on end, we decided that no, we are not going to compromise this time. He also felt bad for not going for my birthday, but he felt even worse if he would watch my sister ""lose"" her money on a fancy dinner. We are not struggling financially in any way, it's just his nature. This made him come to a verdict and decided to fetch us to the dinner location but he would eat at a nearby, cheaper place. At the dinner place, we realised that the waiting time was 2 hours and had no choice but to choose another location to eat. But because he was rambling for that 45minutes before, all the nearby shops had already closed, then we just headed home, completely ruining all our plans.

This may sound small, and it is, but we have all tolerated his ""I want it my way"" character for years on end and it is frankly pissing us all the fuck off. He would throw child like tantrums if he doesnt. He hasn't contributed much to my development as well. My mother was the one who taught me how to ride a bike. My mother was the one who taught me how to shave. My mother was the one who paid for most of my education. I honestly dont know what the fuck is he here for and why the fuck would my mother  still want to stay with him. I dont know through what means, but I want him to disappear from my life to truly be happy. 

Moving out isnt an option (I'm asian) because its highly ostracized in my culture until you get married, which is typically during your late 20s early 30s. I really dont want to see his face anymore, his presence is just upsetting and many others agree as well. He got pissed at me for getting angry about ruining my birthday plans, then I ended our parent-child relationship there by implying that I will never be talking to him ever again.",17Jul2020,1
846,"So, I'm very concerned about a friend of mine who has from what I know, experimented with hallucinogens in the past during his college years and is now ill with a chronic muscular/digestive illness (I'm not aware of the specifics). PS. he's now back home and from being in quarantine with his parents + sick, I doubt he's still doing drugs, to preface my question following.

I saw him this week and had a very strange conversation with him. He mentioned being on heavy medication and feeling high because he of it. From our chat, I learnt that he actually believes that's he's in a matrix-like musk-style simulation and he sounded very rational as he described his beliefs to me, comparing himself to Tyler Durden from Fight Club. He said other stuff like having seen his mother/father die in an alternate reality etc etc. He also apparently believes that I am part of this group of 'enlightened' people like the ones in the Matrix who know their reality is virtual, so he confided in me. Also, I can assure you that he was not messing around and was being completely serious/honest.

Today, he messaged me saying that he's under 'house arrest' after a doctor's appointment yesterday and that the people he loved and trusted in his 'past life' don't 'recognize him anymore.' (assuming he means his parents/siblings especially if he's told them about his beliefs). From the way he's acting, I'm assuming he's experiencing psychosis but of course, I'm not a medical expert.

And a last detail, when I saw him last around a month ago and he was perfectly normal. The events described above happened within a span of a week tops.

My question is, what sort of heavy medication (and medication for what sort of illnesses) would result in such extreme effects? What terms are used for the behaviour he is demonstrating? Can his past drug history have any links to this current behaviour and illness? Do drugs like LSD/shrooms cause chronic muscular or digestive related illnesses? And also, as a non-expert, what can I do/say to someone experiencing such symptoms who decides to confide in me?",17Jul2020,1

848,"Hey all, throwaway account bc the person it is about knows my reddit. sorry that i became so long i tried to avoid that.

Sorry for my english, it isn't my mother tongue.

I just want some opinions or tips because i just don't understand anything at the moment. 


So it all starts 10 years ago ( i try to keep this short). With 12 i needed to go to therapy for the first time because of weird behaviour i was showing. Long story short i was diagnosed with schizophrenia (this will be important later) when i was 14 and was in therapy on and off again but i never compeltely struggled with it regarding the fact i grew up with it and was in treatment) 

I haven't understood what schizophrenia meant but was confused and scared and kinda found a new place for myself in gaming. (was lost for a few years) Within the next few years I came to terms with it and didn't hide it anymore - lived more or less openly with it.

To the story now finally: I met on a minecraft server with 3 or 4 other people and we really hit it off! kept in touch ever since. Those people are slightly older than i am. As we grew up we also met sometimes even though we lived quite far away from each other. Our friendship was great.

As it always is, i clicked with two people most, a boy and a girl. let's call them Ben and Nancy. 

Ben stopped going to high school after dealing with depression and was only home all the time. basically he lived in front if his computer and was more of a quite guy, it didn't stay this way though. he warmed up a lot but was still struggling a lot.

Nancy was more of an active girl, wanted to try and experience new things etc. She also had her problems though, as everyone who sits 10+ hours a day in front of the computer. With 23 (current age) she still lives with her mum who's from a foreign country who works as a cleaner more than 40 hours a week to afford a small flat for both of them. Nancy hasn't finished any of the educations she started and only sits at home crying on the internet about what a bit** her mum is because she tells her she needs to help in the flat. (washing or cleaning etc). Nancy is also very overweight and calls her mum abusive because she tells her to loose some of the weight etc. she says she has anxiety and i don't know what else but things like panic attacs and so on. i try to not go into to much detail. 

Personally, i don't support her behaviour but it's not my life and i'm the last one who wants to tell her what she should or shouldn't do. 

So fast forward a few years. I went to highschool, more or less stopped gaming and lived a (more or less) typical life. Had ""real life"" friends but still always kept in contact with them. sometimes i was even envious that nancy and ben had so much time for gaming and new online friends. i kinda missed the lifestyle and the community. We still kept visiting each other from time to time and still talked a lot through skype or discord. 

Usually Nancy and my talks follow a specific pattern. she talks about what she wants to accomplish in life and where she wants to go and what she wants to do but how she can never do it due to mother/money.... etc. we were dreaming together a bit. we weren't really talikg about the real life out there. we were more like two people who could dream together if that makes sense? or we were gaming and talking about boys or so. I would think of myself as a very supportive friend. I care about her a lot and always talked to her when she was down.. the thing is, i always knew that i COULD have those adventures sometime. i visit the best university in my country at the moment, i have a great job and earn a lot for a student and have wonderful friends in my life (who aren't entirely online). I live together with my great partner who i deeply love and some friends and i absolutely love how things are. Except for:

Half a year ago Nancy ghosted me completely. She didn't answer my calls or messaged me back. She only texted me quickly: i'm gaming
and i said great what are you playing can i join etc. but she was talking to some guys she met online and said it's bad timing and she'll reach out. 

guess what? never happened. i tried again and also asked ben and he said she's talking to him normally and so on and i should just ask her and so i did but she said again she hasn't time. I thought fine maybe she just has enough of me for now (i completely understand that sometimes you need space from specific people) then she started putting stuff on her instagram story like ""know who your real friends are"" or ""sometimes silence is an answer"" 
i asked her if that has anything to do with me and she said no but didn't go into it and she took like a week to answer. 
i brushed it off and asked ben about it. he said he doesn't know anything even though they two still talked a lot. 

the instagram stories continued and then i realized that she puts them down as soon as i saw them... i mean maybe i am going crazy right? absolutely not.. i controlled it for a week or so. 

then i just had enough. she didn't pick up the phone. so i sent her a message. a long one (like this thread lol joke) and asked her wtf is wrong please tell me! then she called me and told me she is gaming with some guys right now but told them how important this talk with me was to her and i kinda felt like i should feel honored or something that she decided to talk to me?

than she talked and talked (but honestly it was just nosense) and i was ANGRY and said NOW SPILL IT!
and she said it is because of my illness and that she's afraid and she doesn't want to have anything to do with me. it would trigger her anxiety etc.

i was shook. she basically knows since i do. she supported me in that time (8 years ago bzw). and as i said i don't struggle ""a lot"" with it and i don't talk about it if i do. i talk with someone professional to NOT scare people if i need help with it.

I am sad. But more than that, i am angry. I just can't believe that and even told her i think thats bullshit. It never affected our friendship or something. we talked for about half an hour about it and she tried to argue with me that she has panic attacks thinking about it. (she claims she has about 2 a day for whatever reasons but i have no idea how panic attacks work and i DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY ARE NOT DANGEROUS). The only thing is i want to say is, i can't imagine how she can have panic attacks about me: a few hours away, in treatment, not struggling etc

i even told her she has no right to tell me it is because of MY condition because i have never let it come between us or even showed it in the friendship after my first therapy. (about 7 years ago for the record)

After this 30 minutes she needed to go back to the other people she was talking with but promised me to sent me a voice memo. she did the next day, it was about 7 minutes long. it was the end of the break, i started listening but i only got into minute one and needed to pause it due to course. texted her back thank you and i'll listen to it. after the course, the message was gone. i asked her why, she said she'll make me a better one. that was a few months ago. she hasn't texted me yet. 

What do you think about that? Is it possible that her anxiety is so bad? Shouldn't i tell people about myself? I am just not sure if I should emphasize more with her or if it is only made up or a completely different reasons? For people with anxiety or panic attacks, can you relate? 

i need some thoughts... it has been months but i can't wrap my mind around it.

851,"I have a friend who is going through tough times. She had depression for an extremely long time and everyday she thinks that dying would be the best solution to end everything. 

It was until recently that she started to open up to me about things that had been going on at home. Almost everyday, she would tell me something about how her mother would yell at her and tell her to die and sometimes she would beat her. Her father does nothing to help her and does not wish to help her either, and her siblings are the same. 

She has abusive parents that cause her extreme physical, physiological and sexual abuse. Her mother yells at her and calls her names such as ‚Äúslut‚Äù, ‚Äúb***h‚Äù, ‚Äúsatan‚Äù, ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù. There are much other words but those are the ones I have heard recently. Her mother thinks she is a slut and shamed her about it even though she has never found any interest in anyone. She shames her of her body too by calling her fat and telling her she is not pretty and that she is flat, and yells at her saying things like ‚ÄúI wish you were never born,‚Äù and giving her death curses. 

Sometimes she would slap her and there was this one time where I heard that her mother slammed her to the wall. She would try having talks with her mother telling her that she is asexual and telling her that she has had depression, but her mother wouldn‚Äôt take her seriously or believe her and would yell at her for it. 

My friend really wants to die but she can‚Äôt because her religion prevents her from doing so. It pains me so much to hear this from her. It pains me to see that she doesn‚Äôt know how strong she is to keep this up. It pains me SO MUCH from the fact alone that she wants to die. None of it was her fault, yet she was lead on to think so. 

She wants to die and I can‚Äôt stop her. I want to tell her that there‚Äôs so much to life, but I don‚Äôt think I can. 

I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that the sky is blue during the day. I don‚Äôt know how to tell her how bright the moon is during the night and I definitely don‚Äôt know how to show her that the sunset has many pretty colors. I don‚Äôt know. 

I want to help, but I know that sometimes there‚Äôs nothing I can do and I just have to accept it and support her. But I can‚Äôt! I want to help! I want to help even though she will hate me afterwards. I want to call the suicide hotline for her or just ANYTHING! I can‚Äôt talk to her about it because then I know we would fight afterwards. 

She would hate me but I‚Äôm willing to do anything to help her even if it will end our friendship.

THEN THEY BOUGHT ME ANOTHER BUDGIE, i was upset but quite accepted it. 3 weeks have passed and for my birthday they bought me 2 huge parrots like parrots and when i said why did you buy it, they said its for my birthday and i yelled i dont want any kind of bird and they jokingly said then its for us :D :D :D. And they cant take care of birds i told them cover windows, they cant see glass. And they said the opposite, like if they see glass, birds can see glass too.

853,"TL;DR : I am crushing super hard on a girl at work I met 2 months and its the first time Ive liked someone more than lusting. We talk extensively and are super similar and friendly, she asked me for my phone number but is a bad texter and doesnt text first. Is it way too soon to ask her to hangout (platonic or ""otherwise"")?


Ok I'm going to get super specific because I feel its warranted, if the person in question sees this   sorry i guess?

I started a new job about 2 months ago. I was a floating worker with no real place to go but a guaranteed job. For the time being I was doing simple menial work, and during that time I went out of my way to talk to a girl who I hadn't spoken too before (not normal for me). Long story short I was completely smitten with her and we had a shit ton in common right off the bat. After a while of getting to know each other she mentioned that there was an opening in her department, one that one way or another I took. So starting in the new department we got to know each other more and more and we have an uncanny amount in common. One big difference though is she has experience with relationships and to be blunt Ive never even held hands with a girl. 

So coming up to the present we work together and talk a ton about our interests. I'm still super into her but I cant tell if shes interested and I dont want to move too fast if she is. She seems very friendly with everyone but unless Im imagining things she laughs and is a bit more awkward when we talk about nonwork things. She asked me for my phone number very awkwardly and Ive texted her a few times over the last week but shes never texted first. Ive sent her things I have made in person and she is super squirrely about reciprocating and I'm worried its because Im being pushy or something. Should I ask her to hangout as friends, make it a little more like a date or am I thinking way too soon, I just feel like either the chemistry is there or im completely fucking high. Any advice or just someone to mull it over with a more unbiased view would be extremely appreciated.",17Jul2020,1
854,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post on here and I've decided to get the opinions of strangers because I do not know what to do with this situation.

To begin, I matched with this guy on tinder who we will call J. J and I had both graduated from the same high school except he was a year older than I was and we had mutual friends. So J and I begun casually seeing each other in mid May right around when the pandemic was picking up speed. We continued to see each other every week, with more and more days getting added on to our hangout schedule as the weeks progressed.

At first everything seemed okay, but as we began seeing each other more and more, problems began to arise. First it was over past relationships, then it was over past social media content, and other things. It got to the point where we sorta hit a ""breaking point"" where I confessed a lot of my past actions that are incredibly private. 

After the accumulation of those fights, we got to the point where we agreed we couldn't have any more arguments or else it would simply result in us not working out. Ever since then, we had been growing strong, with the exception of one fight.

But we are almost at 2 month mark and I'm starting to feel that perhaps I'm more invested in a relationship than he is. I find that I compliment him, I treat him kindly, and I think about him a whole lot. He'll call me and text me and hangout with me. But is always quick to make sure to point out that we are ""not dating"" when something starts getting a bit...shaky? 

I honestly don't know what to do. He has repeatedly said that he is not one to just ""date,"" and the reason he is taking longer is because he's rushed into other relationships in the past. I know that it is a concern of him, but I feel like he is not taking my feelings into consideration. I have been waiting and today I hinted at perhaps starting a relationship and he said he is not there yet. Should I be patient? Should I just let him go?

I truly feel in my heart that he might be ""the one,"" as I've never felt this strongly about someone. But...this is beginning to affect me.",17Jul2020,1

857,"It‚Äôs something I (20M) have been contemplating for a while. I came back home in March, as my university closed. Throughout my life, he has always been the same: moody, aggressive and uncompromising. He cannot accept any personal fault, and even events which are mostly or even entirely caused by him will be somehow blamed on something or someone else (usually me). In about the past month, it‚Äôs constant criticism, usually over nothing. Stupid things like him thinking that a steak bake (UK term I think) is a steak pie - it quite clearly isn‚Äôt. He is impossible to disagree with, even when I try to be civil. The last straw was a few days ago; he had unannouncedly decided to wash my trainers, and so I had no shoes. I thought I had one other pair (he has at least 5), but it turned out bizarrely there was only one shoe. So I took one of his formal pairs, and the next day, when I was due to see my mum for a few days, I took them again as my trainers were still wet. I did not tell him this because a) he would shout at me for ‚Äòlosing‚Äô one shoe and b) it was 6am, and I went early as I couldn‚Äôt sleep. When I got back, he yelled at me for taking his ‚Äòwork shoes‚Äô (I later counted at least 3 other formal pairs of shoes), went on and on and on, and then said that if I put one more toe out of line, I can pack my bags and get out. After this rant my mind was made up. He ignored me for two days, and childishly would talk only to my brother. I have the means to move out, and go to my uni house, with the help of my mum. I accept I am often forgetful or clumsy, but to me that does not justify the abuse I receive. Am I doing the right thing? I don‚Äôt ever want to talk to him or see him ever again.",17Jul2020,1

860,"A bit of background first, my dad invited his girlfriend and her kids to come with us to Coronado lasted year for Easter. His girlfriend always complained about everything even when she didn‚Äôt need to, she‚Äôd always come up with some reason to complain. When we got to our hotel room she got in an rhyme not with my dad and they didn‚Äôt talk for a few hours, we went to dinner and everything seemed okay until we left. My dad had to go somewhere with my sister (forgot where) leaving me with the gf, her daughter saw one of those scooter things and thought it would be fun to ride them around. Now keep in mind that the mom was drunk as hell and she only had 2 drinks. She sat there for 15 minutes figuring out how to start the scooter up and once she did we kind of had fun for a bit and then she started calling me a bitch and then I just kind of tuned her out. The next day we went to breakfast and she got drunk again and started arguing with my dad in public (again) and she walked off for an hour and me, my sister, and her two daughters walked off with my dad to distract ourselves from that mess. She finally found us and started yelling at my dad (who did nothing the whole time) and then he decided to just go back to the hotel. The whole car ride she was cussing me and my dad out. 

When we got back she started acting like Jack Torrence from the shining (minus the axe). She started trying to get into our room by hitting the door over and over and when my dad folded her to F off she started hitting it harder and looking through the window. I had to sit through it and pack up my stuff, because we weren‚Äôt gonna stay there after that. My stuff was right next to the door so I just cried the whole time while I packed what I needed and then we ran off. We had to walk for a bit to get to the place to sign out of the room. We took her car there so we were stranded there. Long story short my ads friend picked us up and let us stay the night at his house.

862,"Shortly after I moved into my current house (my roommate owns this house and it's less than a year old), my roommate mentioned that she wanted a dog. I recently lost my last dog and have been craving doggy time, so I offered to help her take care of a dog. I found a litter of puppies online and we went to check them out. She fell in love with one dog and I fell in love with another. It was decided that we'd both have a dog and we'd share the responsibility.

At first, it was going really well. My roommate and I have opposite work schedules and we've been working from home because of the pandemic, so at any given time someone was awake to take the puppies out to pee. We were crate training the puppies and things were fine, but then I noticed that I was the only one to play with them or train them. I figured that maybe she was busy or didn't understand their needs, so I bought her a dog training book. Well, she never read it. Whenever she has questions or is frustrated with some aspect about the dogs, I send her YouTube videos and refer to the dog training book.

Overall, she is a really nice girl. She has no issue with getting up in the middle of the night to check on them when they cry. She frequently take them outside to go to the bathroom. She smiles whenever she sees them. She takes their healthcare seriously and buys them toys. I think that she takes them on a walk about once or twice a week, and to the park a couple times a month. I'll admit that my walking has been less than ideal as well. From hearing about her history of owning dogs, they were the kind of dogs to be kept in a kennel outside for all their lives and were never allowed inside.

My roommate needs the house to be close to perfectly clean, all the time. I get it. It's a brand new house, she's proud of it, and we need to maintain it so that it'll keep its value. When we first brought the puppies home, she didn't want them ever walking on the carpet and we had to wipe their paws every time they came inside. That didn't last long. She has declared that if the puppies are going to be out of the crate or play pen, that they have to be constantly monitored (which means no checking your phone or being otherwise distracted) to prevent accidents. I agree that they need to be monitored because it would make potty training much harder if they preferred to go inside. However, they are mostly potty trained at this point and can stand to be looked away from for a few minutes. There are still occasional accidents. She once mentioned that once the puppies are completely potty trained, she will be okay with letting them wander around the house. However, she doesn't let them out of the crate in order to be potty trained in the first place. I've brought it up to her and she had no response.

My roommate never lets the dogs out of the crate except to go outside. She'll play with them for a few minutes and then put them back in the crate, where they either cry or stare blankly into the abyss. Whenever I am home and not working, I put up the baby gate downstairs and let them hang out in the living room. My roommate doesn't want them on the couch, so I stopped letting them on the couch. Keeping them at home is really very stressful because they could ruin the house at any time and they are so terribly bored that all they want to do is chew on stuff, run in circles, and fight with each other. Maybe I'm embellishing a little bit. They are extremely well-behaved for their age and how sporadic their exercise regiment is. They listen to my commands most of the time, and they can loose leash the shit out of a walk. It's 106 degrees outside, so I can't really hang out with them at a park. To remedy this, I bring them to my friend's house. He has a huge property and other dogs for them to play with. They are noticeably much happier at my friend's house. They don't fight, cry, or chew on anything. I can let my guard down and know that they're having a good time.

A few days ago that same friend came over and let the dogs outside because he brought his own dog and that always gets them excited. My roommate's dog absolutely loves to play in this muddy spot by the house where the washing machine outlet is, and she ran right for it. We had to hurry up and leave, so I hosed her off, put her in the crate, and left. Shortly after, I got a text from my roommate saying that she was upset that I hadn't been watching the dogs. I tried to explain and she didn't respond. When I got back home, I noticed that her dog had been shampooed and dried. It hit me that every time I've washed the dogs without her, she's gone out and washed them again. She's never told me that I didn't do a good job or anything. I've probably missed some mud or something.

The next day, she text me again and said that if I want to play with the puppies, I have to play with them outside. She said that she, ""Can't have them jumping around"". Being with them outside is not a good plan because it's so hot, there's no shade, that dreaded muddy spot, and all my potted plants. I bought them 20 ft leads and attached them to the fence. Whenever they are on the leads they have panic attacks and scream while choking themselves, and then they dig holes by the fence. Anyway, this means that if the puppies are home, they have to be in the crate.

To try to remedy our predicament, I once again tried to explain to my roommate that they always have a ton of energy whenever they are at home because they don't get enough exercise, socialization, or brain stimulation. I suggested everything that I could think of: a dog walker, doggy day care, a video conference with a dog trainer, and just more time with them. She said, ""Nah, I'm good"". I decided to tell her that with how much time we have them stay in the crate/pen, it is animal abuse. I really went all out in explaining how detrimental it is to their well-being. I even suggested that we re-home them if needed. She told me, ""Let's say that you worry about your dog and I'll worry about mine"". She hasn't said anything to me about it since.

I'm planning on asking her to sit down and talk with me about it in a few days. In the meantime, I need credible resources detailing the detriment to a puppy's life being contained. All of the articles I've found so far just say, ""Don't do it"", or they attempt to make people feel better about leaving their dog in a crate while they're at work. It's like leaving a dog that you care about in a crate for all their lives is such a horrible thing to do, that even the internet assumes that you won't do it. I'm worried that she won't let me take her dog on outings anymore. I also can't move out because then I would be sealing the fate of her dog to live out the rest of her days in confinement.

TLDR: My roommate has recently mandated that if our puppies (one is mine and one is hers) are home, they have to stay in the crate except to go outside with constant supervision. How can I show her that this is not good for them and work out a plan to allow the puppies some freedom while also maintaining the value of my roommate's new house?",17Jul2020,1

868,"TL;DR i might accidentally be making my favorite shitposter on facebook uncomfortable, what is my best course of action?


This is probably a lot of usless information but it's all context I suppose.
So, I(22M) added some girl (shes somewhere around my age, I'll call her J) on Facebook a long time ago. I think I liked her hair or maybe I thought I knew her or something, I don't remember the exact reason. Anyways, I more or less forgot about her for a little bit but then I started seeing her posts all the time because she posts memes like it's her job, and they are honestly really funny.

Well I once saw a meme that was right along the memes she posts so I sent it to her (first time I ever actually communicated with her) and said something like ""I think you might appreciate this one"". That's all that was said, no response or anything. A while later passed and I'm still seeing her memes and stuff and I might comment on a meme here or there, nothing like conversations, but just little relevant thoughts or stories to what the post was about. (I usually comment check to see the poster after the fact because I rarely check who posts stuff first)

So more time passed and someone else mentioned they liked a certain type of meme format (the same kind I sent J long time ago) so I sent J a message asking if she had any similar to it.
Again, no response. Oh well ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I didn't think anything of it.

Aside from probably a few more comments on posts  that's pretty much the only communication there has been.

Well today I was about to comment on a post of hers again and before I did my mind just went ""man I hope it doesn't make her uncomfortable when I comment on her posts"" and all of a sudden it clicked that that is a very real possibility.

I didn't comment. I wanted to message her and ask to double check that it doesn't bother her that I do it, but I mean if it *does* make her uncomfortable, the last thing I want to do is dive into her inbox and make it worse. Not to mention she didn't respond then last two times, I'm not sure she would respond the 3rd time.
So I thought about just deleting her from facebook so it isn't a problem, but honestly she's probably one of my favorite posters because she's kind of hilarious.


So i guess my options are:
A) just delete her and say goodbye to the memes
B) send her a message and ask if I make her uncomfortable, and if she actually responds and turns out i do, I can ask what she would prefer
Or C) just assume all is well and continue on like nothing ever happened",17Jul2020,1

871,"Dear reddit, 

As the title suggests i really need some advice on how to handle this. I'm a female, this is a throw away account and im sorry its such a mess but im panicking. 

There have been many instances where my brother has done things that have made me incredibly uncomfortable and i have had no idea how to voice these concerns to my parents as we all live in the same house. I dont want to give away either of our ages but i am under 18 and he is in his 20s. For example, i do gymnastics and during lockdown we have been doing online sessions for our squad to stay in touch and stay fit, and we have to wear a uniform which is a leotard (like a one piece swimming suit). There have been instances where i will eat dinner with my family after gym and notice him staring directly at my chest while im eating. Whenever i stood up from the table he would stare at my legs or my behind which i found a bit disconcerting too. Shortly after these instances i went and got changed straight after my virtual gym sessions because it made me uncomfortable but i didn't mention it to anyone.

 But then when i was in my room in my leotard before the session started he came and asked me a question but he had his phone camera pointed directly at me for a long while while we were talking. I dont know for sure if he was taking photos or a video but alarm bells were ringing. The phone was by his chest rather than his arms being by his sides which is how he normally is? There have been other random times where i bent down to reach something and i saw him look directly at my behind before i stood up, and hes been standing by a cupboard and i ask to grab something quickly and he just wont move out the way so i have to get overly close to him, unless someone else is in the room.

 Then a few days ago i was sitting down noodling on my phone wearing a spaghetti strap top which was low cut as it was warm and it's a pajama shirt, so from above you could see down the shirt to my cleavage. The thing that really freaked me out is that he came over to see what i was doing, and then this is what i know for a fact that i saw: he angled the camera (from a standing position) down towards my chest and his thumb tapped the bottom half of his phone screen. Once again, i think he took a photo of my chest but i dont actually have any evidence as it could have been a complete coincidence. If i raise these concerns to my parents it could potentially destroy a lot of relationships as i still have a long time before i go to university and he doesnt have a job so isnt moving out any time soon. We are all still in lockdown so whatever happens life will be hell for everyone. Even if he was taking photos of me i dont think he would be stupid enough to just keep them on his phone for anyone to find. I cant tell if im being super ridiculously paranoid or if i actually have something to worry about here! Accusing my brother of having *incestuous child porn* is a fucking almighty claim if i dont have absolutely rock solid evidence to back up my suspicions, which i DONT, but my gut is telling me that this behavior is odd. What the fuck do i do?",17Jul2020,1
872,"Hi,

I'm sorry in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors, I'm on mobile and not exactly in a good state of mind.

I won't bore you with a 10k word long paragraph of my backstory, so here's the info that I think is absolutely necessary to understand my situation:

1. I was born to an abusive parent. I still live with said parent. They are too smart to leave evidence that can be documented.
2. My other parent is a deadbeat and I have not been in contact with them in years. 
3. I am not in contact with any of my other blood relatives because my abuser kept me isolated from them. 
4. I have a disabled dog. She depends on me specifically to survive. I am not leaving her or putting her down under any circumstances.
5. I am poor. I've been saving up as much money as possible, but my abuser is forcing me to pay some bills, and with covid I am now only working about 12-16 hours a week. By the end of the month, I may be fully unemployed, and still paying bills, which will dry up my savings in a few months.
6. Jobs are hard to come by in the area I live in, and that's without bringing Covid-19 into the mix. Now, no one is hiring. 
7. This area is also isolated. I can't just get a job in the next town over- I'd have to have my abuser drive me for hours. They're not inclined to do so, to say the least.
8. I don't have a car or a drivers license/permit.
9. I don't have any friends in financial situations that are stable enough to help me. Trust me, I've asked.
10. Due to years of financial, dietary, and mental health issues, my dental health is horrible. i'm talking one broken tooth, another massive cavity, and developing cavities in most of my other teeth. I am doing what I can to slow the rot (minimal sugar/acid, brushing/mouthwash, etc) but as it stands it is likely that either the dental situation will become life threatening or too painful to bear before I am in a financial situation in which I can afford care. My abuser cannot/will not pay for my care.
11. I currently live where I work, as does my abuser. The work environment is hostile and my abuser is spiraling, and I am getting the sense that even though it is against all of our better interests, they are going to force us to leave and live in their car again, with no income between the two of us.
12. None of my friends are able to come and drive me somewhere. Ubers, taxis, lyfts etc are also not an option- this place is too far away and even if I could get a driver the cost would be astronomical.
13. There are no shelters of any kind near me.
14. I don't have a computer.
15. My abuser is keeping most of my stuff (including valuable items that i don't want to part with) in a storage unit that only they have the key to.
16. I am physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. I have been struggling to keep my head above water for my entire life, and my fuel seems to finally be running out.
17. I am 18 years old, and female. I am not attending college nor do I plan on doing so any time soon, as in the current situation and state of my mental and physical health I consider that an unwise endeavor.
18. I have a high school diploma and a certificate in creative writing that doesn't mean jack shit, but I worked 3 years to pay for it so I might as well include it.


I think that's everything. If you need more info let me know. 

I'm pretty sure that the only thing that's gonna get me out of this is a miracle, but if you have other ideas then I am all ears.

873,"I‚Äôve had issues with mental health for pretty much as long as I can remember. I was bullied through elementary school, my grandmother commented on my weight constantly growing up, my parents had a nasty divorce causing me to have to take on a motherly role for my older brother, then I was abandoned by my Mom, and I‚Äôm bisexual girl in a tiny rural town which caused issues, and my dad and brothers near constant fighting. So none of my issues are surprising honestly. When I got into late 7th grade through 8th grade I started self harming and thought about ‚Äúthe end‚Äù almost constantly until my dad and stepmom sent me to therapy, and then it was better for a while. 
Then we couldn‚Äôt afford to send me to therapy so I said I didn‚Äôt need it anymore and I stopped going. Now I‚Äôm going into my senior year and I feel like I‚Äôve been sent back in time emotionally to how it felt then. Sophomore year I lost all of my so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who made jokes saying that I was dead after I was in the hospital and didn‚Äôt acknowledge my existence. Then my grandpa (a man who was a second father to me, he went to school events and sports, took me to doctors appointments, and watched me every summer and whenever my parents were on a business trip or just too ‚Äúbusy‚Äù[lazy] to watch me) died from stage 3 cancer, and my brother moved back in after running away and living at my moms. It‚Äôs extremely hard for me to function lately and even though I act like I‚Äôm happy all the time I‚Äôm just tired all the time. I feel either sad or angry sometimes but mostly just numb, like in functioning on auto pilot. I‚Äôve ended up for the most part switching my sleep schedule so that I‚Äôm awake when everyone else is asleep so that I can be left alone. Deep down I know I need some help but I can‚Äôt work up enough courage or whatever to tell my parents. Last time I needed help my dad broke down and then afterwards he acted like I just needed to force myself to feel better. Every time I try to tell my parents the words get caught in my throat and I can‚Äôt say it and then I either get even more depressed or seriously pissed off again. I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore so I came to reddit. Hopefully one of you guys has some advice for me.",17Jul2020,1
874,"I spend a lot of time thinking about what books to buy. And when they arrive I immediately think about what books I can buy next. I don't collect any books, only the ones I am interested in and plan to read, but even that can get very expensive since most of my books are manga and comics (which overall are more expensive than novels).

 And before buying a book I must make sure that I'm getting the best edition of that specific book even if I consider the contents to be just average. I am a jobless college student so I can't afford to buy as many as I'd want to. I don't have anything else going on in my life, which is basically studying and buying books.

This doesn't seem to be too bad at first but thinking about books occupies a big chunk of my daily life. I can't concentrate on completing my assignments, my studies and sometimes I stay awake at night thinking about books that I wanted to buy but now are out of print and blaming myself for not buying them at the right time. I even get a dopamine rush when watching book collection videos on YouTube (and I watch a lot of those).It kind of feels like porn.

I don't think reading books and creating your own personal library is a bad thing, but in my case I think it got out of hand. I am worried I may develop more symptoms over time. I don't want to stop reading books and adding them onto my bookshelves, but I got very tired from the stress.

876,"Hi, so I have a lifelong issue that I'd like to finally fix(25 year old woman, about 5'3ft and I weigh around 118lbs) 

I've always been on the thicker side growing up, and I've recently lost a lot of weight to try to fix this issue... which resulted in an even worse situation. My boobs are fucking small AND saggy in appearance. I used to have C cups when I was heavier, but even at that size they still had a saggy and downright just unattractive (In my eyes) look to them.

They are what apparently are called balcony boobs, meaning there's slight weight at the bottom and little to no weight on top. The areolas and nipples are on the large side as well, which is just so unappealing to me. I thought that losing weight would maybe perk them up (I know, silly me) but exercising just deflated them completely. Now I have small droops on my chest with large nipples that point forward. 

So I came up with the idea to make an OnlyFans, as my last job shut down due to Covid-19 and its been impossible to get hired anywhere! I wanted to raise enough money with selling contents to get surgery, but people either love big breasts or small PERKY breasts. And I have neither.. so my question is, how do I sell content knowing my breasts look nothing like the girls who actually make money on there? I feel like my subscription list would drop if I went topless in any of my contents! What should I do???",17Jul2020,1

So, I was in a relationship for two years (12-14-17 \~ 3-10-20) with a girl we will call L. We were really good for eachother until my BPD kicked in and i would be distant. I tried to tell her all of this, and for the most part she was understanding. Around last december, i started going through multiple stressful situations at once, which was severely effecting my mental health (grandma was dying of a brain tumor, i lost my job, was getting stuff ready for college). She also had just lost her grandma and couldn't deal with it (not v important but still a factor). I started isolating myself and couldn't find the courage to even get up some days. The next three months of the relationship were very much in discourse. There were lots of arguments that I still think about. We eventually broke up and she started dating my roommate a week later. That hurt me the most out of everything, so I moved up to IL to be with my mother. I started being very flirty with people after I came to terms with my ex and my ex-best friend being together and met K. She is completely into me and I was willing to try a relationship. Now, I am slipping back into my little depressive state and not connecting with many people. I don't want to break K's heart, but I don't love her.

878,"17M. It's become a common thing for me to compare myself to others my age, but only when it comes to employment. Of course the money is a big part, but other things like sociability and experience are major factors as well. Starting about 4 months ago, I've rarely been out of my room and my money as been draining as well as my happiness. I've been refusing to get a job that isn't something I know I'd enjoy.

All of the fun things I do are no longer fun because I do them 24/7.

I'm generally a happy person but this week has been nonstop breakdowns and reckless behavior in an attempt to hurt myself. I've been having suicidal thoughts but I know I can't bring myself to actually do it. I take solace in that, but if I can *develop* suicidal thoughts after assuming I would never stoop to that, I know it can get worse.

I've convinced myself that I need to get a job so I can escape this rut, but there's an issue. I've never been one to shy away from hard work, but I have particular tastes about workplaces that narrow my available choices down pretty low, and I haven't gotten a call back from a single one.

When I turn 18 later this year I will be allowed to work at some other places I actually want to work at. I know I'm being picky about it, but after seeing countless people my age working at places they enjoy and me not having anything to push me or the willpower to get off my ass and find something sufficient, I feel like this rut I'm in is only going to get deeper.",17Jul2020,1
879," 

I went to high school with her and first 2 years we didn't even talk. In the 3rd year of high school we started helping each other by studying together(over texts and voice calls) and sharing notes. We also used to chat a lot during that period. After we finished high school we didn't chat at all. I didn't want to bother her because she was preparing for college and I did as well, so I didn't want to distract her and myself. After we joined college we exchanged a couple of texts about joining college went and for the next 3-4 months we didn't hear from each other(to make things clear, we were not that close, so it is not big surprise). When we started college I contacted her to see how she is doing and until New Year we didn't talk/text. At New Year's eve I wished her all the best and she appreciated it. Then next 2 months we texted a little. I was not the one who needed to reach out first all the time. She did it as well. I was planing to invite her to see each other and catch up, but we went into quarantine. She invited me to play some video games with her and her friends during quarantine and it was fun. Then one day she randomly texts me and says that she had an situation which reminded her of me. 1 month forward and we are here. We texted about our finals and I mentioned when mine final exam is. Night after exam day she randomly texted me with wishing me good luck. I was shocked. She remembered that date (which I told her 15 days before). After that my birthday came. All of my friend wished me all the best vie text, but she knew that I like programming and made effort to code custom birthday wish for me. I said that I am sorry we can't go out because of the quarantine and she said that there will be time for it.

P.S. She laughs at all my jokes (to be honest some of them are really good, but others not so much).

He was sexually abusive during the relationship, which I had never fully realized until it ended, and was very emotionally abusive throughout the breakup and months after it, almost raping me at one instance. He is a very toxic person who is triggering to be around. I didn't have to see him at work for a few months because of covid but am recently having to intertwine with him and communicate more often now that work is changing. Everytime we switch shifts or have to talk because of work, he acts like nothing is wrong and speaks in a very normal manner to me which is extremely disturbing (trying to make conversation, speaking ""friendly."" He clearly isnt aware of the horrible things he has done, and certainly not of their degree. I thought I could deal with him, although there is no reason I should, and it is appalling that he has the nerve to decide not to quit. He should be ashamed and if he was truly sorry for what he has done, he shouldn't show up in my life at all. 

I cant, and absolutely do not want to, see him at all and want to bring this up to my manager. However, I have no idea how to go about this. I don't want to come off as incapable of ""working with others"" and want to make it clear and understood that I really can't affiliate with him any longer.

Another person was also bit by the dog but only on the ankle. The family didn't accuse him of lying and they exchanged numbers. When my mom asked for their contact (both parties, because my mom believes the other person witnessed her getting bit by the dog), they refused.

[item description](https://imgur.com/gallery/XFbmsMt)

To start off, the item was a pottery set. It had been used a few times. Though it retails at $30, the clay and cutting cord as well as much of the paint was missing , so I listed all ‚Äúdefects‚Äù in the description. I sold this item for $13, while seeming like a decent amount, I only made $1.70, while having to pack and ship the item myself because of shipping and sellers fee. This was in hopes some child would get to enjoy a pottery set for a cheap price if they didn‚Äôt mind buying the clay themselves. 

A few days later, a woman offered me even less, $12. Of course I respectfully declined, as I couldn‚Äôt go through all that hassle for 80 cents. 
She then purchased the item, and using a box which would have cost $20 and bubble wrap I brought her item to a UPS Store and shipped it.

A few days later, I got the notification that my item had been rated. I saw that I had also received a message from the buyer. 
She asked why the clay and cutting cord was missing. Since it had been this way since the beginning, I explained to her that I had never had and would never claim to have something like this. She then told me she had ‚Äúscreenshotted‚Äù my description. 

Of course, this is completely impossible, since sellers cannot change the description after an item has been sold. Seeing that she had sold a few items herself, this should have been obvious. 
I asked when this had been taken to confirm, and she admitted it herself - ‚Äúbefore I sent a message‚Äù. This implies it would be after receiving the package, days later after the item description had been locked.

I asked her about my rating in a moment of panic, as I had only 14 reviews so far, all positive from kind and respectful buyers. If she left a four paragraph essay about how I had cheated her, as I suspected, it would cause a huge problem. 
As soon as her message loaded I was shocked. Her accusations were untrue, but I had (and still do not) have any idea how to deal with this. 

I asked her for a screenshot, or to say I tried. However, likely realizing her mistake she blocked me. 

I have contacted support and no response in return. I will not be able to see her review or star rating until I have rated her back within the next two days, however it is unlikely support will respond by then as they have been very slow since COVID (as is understandable). Once I rate her back the exchange is final, and I can not let that happen until she owns up to her mistake or Support fixed her review (both extremely unlikely).

I have tried everything that I could, I don‚Äôt know what more I can do.

903,"Okay I‚Äôll try to keep it somewhat short. 

I work for my dad as his bookkeeper (he own a business). I have severe mental illness, including C-PTSD. My parents know about one of my traumas, that is pretty big. 

I have been fighting to stay alive for over a year straight now, and that‚Äôs not including the other 9 years of mental illness, eating disorders, and self harm I fought through. 

I‚Äôve been telling my dad that they need to hire someone else to do this job. I‚Äôve told them how hard my daily life is, to the fullest extent that I think they‚Äôll listen (I wrote them a letter outlining my struggles). I have asked him to hire someone new multiple times over 6 months. Every time he ignores me. He asks me to do more hours. When I tell him I can‚Äôt, he says I just have to ‚Äúpush through it.‚Äù My mom keeps telling me that I need to do more hours. She tells me that if I don‚Äôt, my dad is going to drop dead of a heart attack. That I need to take some of the stress away before that happens. 

I carry this weight around with me all the time, the pressure and guilt, that it‚Äôs my fault my dad‚Äôs health is deteriorating. Guilt that I can‚Äôt live up to their expectations, and I can‚Äôt keep up with the paperwork. I am just not well enough to. I‚Äôm drowning in it.

I‚Äôm sitting here right now, behind over a week on paperwork. 

I have been on the edge of admitting myself to a mental hospital for months now. I have one picked out, and I have a plan in place to get there. I am going to end up committing suicide if some of this pressure isn‚Äôt taken away from me. 

I considered telling them about the suicidal thoughts. But I know that they would think I‚Äôm manipulating them, or that I‚Äôm saying it just to get a rise out of them. They would say, ‚Äúhow dare you say that! We lost our nephew that way.‚Äù 

So, I‚Äôm at a loss. They will not listen to me. They don‚Äôt care about my mental health. I am going to end up dead, and they‚Äôre going to wonder why it happened. I‚Äôm really at a loss right now.

904,"Hi all. I am 25F(non-binary) and a mom, to enter. 

When I was 21 I had my daughter, I had a rough pregnancy and had my tubes tied so that if I ever decided to have kids again I would do IVF and make sure timing is right. My pregnancy was awful and almost died during childbirth, but I was determined that I‚Äôd like to have another kid one day when I was older and could comfortably take the time off of work to stay home/have extra medical care.

I‚Äôve had pain in my pelvis for as long as I can remember, I constantly had pain during sex and horrid periods. I hated gynecologist so only ever saw one during pregnancy.

I started going to one because my new job has stellar insurance and she was AMAZING. Really listened to me and made me feel heard. Well, she ordered an ultrasound which determined some things but mostly that I have severe adenymosis. The tissue lining my uterus is gown into the muscles, this is something that normally strikes women in their 40-50‚Äôs and menopause takes care of it. So being young, my options are to live in constant pain or have a hysterectomy.

It sounds silly but this is a bit world shattering to me, as it means that being pregnant may slip through my fingers and the option to have another in that way will be gone. I know I can freeze eggs, adopt, etc. but those options (though wonderful and valid) seem to have a lot of downfall between costs and failure rates. 

This isn‚Äôt exactly the news I thought I‚Äôd get but here I am. Do I opt to get pregnant now and have a child I‚Äôm not ready for so I can get the hysterectomy immediately? Do I get the hysterectomy and just freeze my eggs? Do I get the hysterectomy and move on from the idea of another baby? I know ultimately the decision will be mine but I‚Äôm wondering what others would do I guess. It‚Äôs just not a decision I thought I‚Äôd have to make now, I thought I had so much time.",17Jul2020,1
905," 

Long time lurker, first time poster. I am in need of some advice, and have quite the tale to tell. This is based in Illinois.

TL;DR I am sexually assaulted twice by employees of my leasing office within 6 months, they are still trying to charge me nearly $2,000 for moving out.

Be me (25F) move out of parents house and into a shoebox of an apartment for the first time. Live there happily for 9 months. I had been working just a few minutes up the road so I regularly came home for lunch to chill with my kitty cat. Typical Tuesday - come home for lunch - and at 12:50 PM head out to parking lot to drive back to work.

But wait - something's different. I are double parked in by the landscaping/snow removal crew. Continue approach ready to ask them to move their truck so I can get back to work on time. BUT I notice the employee is facing my car with his hands by his crotch. YUP, HE IS URINATING ON MY CAR. He hears me approach and turns around EXPOSING HIMSELF because he doesn't bother to even put it away first.

I immediately contacted my leasing office through our online portal with something along the lines of ""are the landscapers not allowed to use your restrooms? Cause \*describes incident\* just happened. you gonna give me a free month of rent for this trauma or pay for therapy or a car wash or what?""

Within the next few days, I miss 1 (one) phone call from the manager of the leasing office (despite having indicated I prefer to be contacted via email). I write them AGAIN on Friday saying ""hey I missed a singular call and tried calling back but no one picked up. I want an email because I work during your office hours. Can I please be contacted?""

Receive an email at 6:55 PM on that Friday asking for my availability to have a phone call NEXT week.

Email back with my availability the following Wednesday because of a family emergency (which I explained in the email).

THIRTEEN (13) DAYS PASS

I email once again saying I am still wanting to talk.

EIGHT (8) DAYS PASS

The leasing manager writes back that she was on vacation and asks for my availability (which I have already provided twice).

There is no success in connecting on the phone, but I am in the midst of a family emergency and just don't have the capacity to hound these people. I never contacted the police hoping to just resolve the situation without including the pigs.

My lease is up for renewal (expires in Feb., but they demand a commitment in Nov.). I am in no state to be moving as my grandfather is dying in the hospital so I renew.

Fast forward 5 months - my sibling is sick of their roomies and is wanting to move out. I offer to be their roomie for many reasons. We contact my leasing office about touring a larger unit within the community. We get connected with (the dumbest mofo I have ever had the displeasure of working with) we'll call her Cher cause she hella Clueless.

Cher is all delighted that she can potentially rent out a larger more expensive unit during the pandemic (COVID-19, baby!). We inform her that I would be vacating the shoebox apartment so she gives me these forms for an ""on-site transfer"" and says I gotta pay $300. My sibling needs to fill out the application and pay $60. We fill out the forms and fork over the money. We are all set for an end of May move-in as long as the credit check and background check comes back clean (once those come back then we can sign the lease). Cher also says there needs to be an inspection of my current shoebox apartment which she submits a work order for. I request that she inform me of the exact date and approximate time I should be expecting maintenance. It's a pandemic, I'm working from home, I am a young single female living alone. I would like the opportunity for someone to come over and be there while strange men enter my apartment. She absolutely promises me that she will let me know the schedule. Cool, I take a nap on the couch.

THE VERY NEXT DAY she sets up a call with me and says that the unit is actually not available to us.

Here is where things splinter a bit.

1.) Back it up a few months, I was hospitalized at the end of December and because of that went on a one-time payment plan for January rent. I paid half on Jan 1st, and the other half on Jan 17th (after pay day). So Cher claims that because of the payment plan, I was disqualified from an on-site transfer until I could consecutively pay rent on the 1st for 6 months. Cher never mentioned any of this back in January when we were establishing my payment plan. I was later told it is not their policy to disclose the terms and conditions of going on a payment plan because ""we can't predict if you'll want an on-site transfer in the next 7 months."" (In my mind, this is all a direct violation of the ADA). But Cher works with her manager and says that once I pay my June rent on June 1st, we can be lined up for an end of June move in as long as the unit is still available.

2.) On this phone call, Cher excitedly shares that ""things move fast around here, we have actually already conducted the inspection of your shoebox apartment"" HOLD UP WHAT. The only conceivable time that maintenance could have entered my apartment - based on working hours and the timing of our communications - would have been while I was ASLEEP on the couch. So that means one of two things. Either Cher failed to inform me of the date and time of the inspection - as she had profusely promised - and maintenance just showed up unannounced, did NOT knock, just let themselves in and proceeded to inspect every inch of my shoebox apartment while I slept on the couch. OR maintenance lied about conducting the inspection. To this day, multiple people from the leasing office have indicated that their maintenance did not lie about the inspection and it was in fact conducted... SO maintenance completely violated the terms of the lease by barging into my apartment and did whatever they wanted while I was passed out. NOT COOL, SUPER CREEPY, I CONSIDER THIS SEXUAL HARASSMENT/ASSAULT.

I am just hella confused and my head is spinning at this point and I don't know how to react. So the phone call ends.

We patiently wait out the 18 days.

June 1st hits, I paid my rent early we email Cher asking ""is the unit available? can we tour it with masks and gloves on (still pandemic)."" Cher responds that they do not have a unit available for a July 1 move-in. However, the unit is still listed on [apartments.com](https://apartments.com/) and [zillow.com](https://zillow.com/). So we ask if they unit has been claimed or if it is undergoing renovations to figure out why it is not available. Cher says nothing about a tour.

Cher responds that units can only be held for 14 days maximum which is why we cannot move in July 1 and she is ""doing everything she can to get us a unit for mid-July move-in."" (when did mid-July get mentioned? Sibling's lease is up June 30th).

We respond asking if we can move-in in the next 14 days OR if the unit is not claimed in the next 14 days can we secure it for a July 1 move-in? We also asked if sibling could move-in now and have me added onto the lease 2 weeks later.

Cher waits a day then replies that she worked it out with her manager that instead of me needing 30 days notice for an on-site transfer, they can cut it down to a 14 day notice (ok when was that even a policy?). But I now suddenly need to make rent on July 1 for my current shoebox and then we can move in mid/late-July? Cher also says sibling cannot move-in first because their income alone does not qualify for the apartment and my income is needed to secure the place.

I reply with ""when would we know that we are guaranteed this unit? And, can we tour the unit?""

Cher responds that once I pay July rent on the shoebox, re-fill out all the paperwork for the transfer, pay $300, sibling fills out application again, and pays $60 then - if the unit is available - we can see the unit.

We call because .....ummmmmm..... what do you mean we need to pay you $360 first in order to even tour the place? Because during all of this nonsense, we have been touring other unrelated properties with no problems. Cher claims that because the leasing office is closed for the pandemic, they are not doing any tours for the public. 1.) I am not ""the public"" I am a current resident 2.) On July 5th they updated their website to say they are allowing tours for up to two people who wear masks and gloves. (Hello discrimination lawsuit. The COVID numbers have not gone down so they aren't reopening tours for that reason. They couldn't even guarantee us a tour even if we had paid the $360. They knew of my medical problems from Jan. and they kept switching between calling my sibling my brother and my sister so they knew they're non-gender conforming. So you really gonna deny a tour to a resident with medical issues and their Trans sibling, yet offer tours to the public? Hello lawsuit!)

Fast forward 15 days. We find the PERFECT place and sign the lease. I re-submit my notice to vacate (part of the forms Cher had me fill out in May). Cher IMMEDIATELY emails back saying ""I'm confused, last we spoke we were going to have a mid/late-July move-in once rent is paid - if the unit is still available. We also have other units that might open up for an August and Sept. move-in. Boo Hoo we even adjusted our own policies for transferring for you"" This was also the first time Cher revealed the address of the place - it faces a major road and has no outdoor space.

We respond ""we were actually able to tour other places and found the perfect one. We were hella uncomfy with financially committing to a place before even being allowed to tour it and this whole wait-and-see approach is no good for us. Good luck renting that dumpster-fire of a unit though (in the middle of a pandemic)""

So Cher then responds that I need to provide 60 days notice and pay a bunch of fees for breaking my lease. I ask for the manager.

Begin conversations with the manager - we'll call her Dionne to go with the Clueless theme.

TURNS OUT Dionne is the one who so blatantly ignored me back in November after the first instance of sexual assault. I am not pleased to be working with Dionne again.

So I explain the whole damn situation to Dionne via email. I say I am moving out because 1.) Lindsey has been jerking us around for over a month and we're fed up and 2.) because I no longer feel safe living in this community where I have been sexually accosted twice in the span of 6 months. I explain the violations committed by the employees of the community and cite the portions of the lease agreement that have been violated. I say ""I ain't paying shit, you went and voided the lease by violating me. Also I am moving out in the next two weeks, F your 60 day policy (which was 30 days and then became 14 days??? How an any sane human follow all of this)""

4 days later Dionne calls me (on my damn birthday too). Dionne is M A N I C. She is just rambling saying how Cher followed all of their rules and regulations to a T and Dionne is such a stickler for the rules and praises Cher so much. Dionnne says that following the November incident (and for other reasons) the landscapers/snow removal crew has been fired (why is this the first I am hearing of this, 7 months later?). Dionne does not mention the second incident of maintenance letting themselves into my apartment at all. I am at work (new job, no longer working from home) and do not have a lot of time to be on the phone. So I just let her say her spiel and we hang up. She says the only way that I will be allowed to move out is if I pay two months rent and I sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). FUN FACT - my lease and this NDA are NOT in my legal name (let's say my name is Abigail, everything was written out as Abby).

I feel coerced and just sign the damn NDA under duress just so I can leave these awful people behind and move on with my life. I say nothing about the two months rent.

Moving day comes and I tell the whole saga to my therapist and parents. They are LIVID. They say it's bullshit I need to pay any fees and I should press charges. I send a message to Dionne saying that I do not feel comfortable paying two months rent for a place I am not inhabiting and was forced from by the actions of the employees of the community.

A week passes. I email Dionne saying the apartment is clean and empty and ask when and where I should return my keys. She responds two days later saying to drop the keys off at the office before 6 PM.

Three days pass, and I log in to pay off my final utilities. They have utilities entered on July 1st and July 9th (I dropped off keys July 6th), they have also charged me July rent, and two months additional rent. I email Dionne saying ""hey, fix this so I can just pay my utilities and we can all get on with our lives."" I email the next day asking for the contact info for her supervisor. To this day, I STILL have NOT heard from Dionne.

I send a general message through their website requesting the contact information of Dionne's supervisor. Good old Cher gets back to me saying Dionne is on vacation (how convenient, must be nice to go on vacay that much). Cher claims Dionne has attempted to get into contact with me and asks for my availability for the following Mon/Tues because that is when Dionne will be back from vacay. I inform Cher there have been 0 attempts made by Dionne to contact me within the past two weeks and once again request the supervisor's contact information. Cher gives me a generic hotline to call. I try calling and you need to know who you are trying to reach to be connected with a human. So, for a third time, I ask Cher for the direct contact info of the supervisor and explain I at least need their name to use this stupid hotline. Cher says all she is allowed to give me is this stupid hotline, nothing else. I call the hotline again and get connected with the general operator. I tell her I need the supervisor of my community to contact me ASAP for financial concerns and I prefer to be emailed to keep it all in writing. To this day, I STILL have not been contacted.

Yesterday, the leasing office had the AUDACITY to send me statement. Excuse me? I have been trying to two weeks now to get clarification. I email back saying that I have made attempts to get clarification and have not been responded to and would like some assistance.

Guess who replies?

Low and behold Cher says ""I would be happy to help, what questions do you have?""

So I just straight up copy and paste what I sent to Dionne about the double-charged utilities, July rent, and two months rent being charged.

Cher assures that the statement has the correct amounts for utilities and only cover July 1-6 despite being dated the 9th. Cher then cites the leasing policies and how I am responsible for prorated rent in July and the two month rent for breaking my lease.

I inform Cher that I am contesting these additional fees because I was sexually assaulted twice in 6 months.

3 hours later, Cher says she was aware of the Nov. incident but not the May incident (ummm honey you were an accomplice...) and to provide her with the police report numbers.

I slowly explain to her that I had not gone to the police in hopes we could settle this on our own. I then ask if I am being advised to report to the police and press charges.

Cher replies that I had renewed my lease and therefore there is no violation of the lease (WHAT? She also provided the incorrect years). So, I slowly explain how the original lease was violated by the Nov incident, and the renewed lease was violated by the May incident. I once again ask if I am being advised to go to the police.

She responds the next day saying she can only advise on the lease policies and cannot decide for me if I should go to the police.

I ask for the status of my statement balance and if police reports are necessary to contest the charges. She says that my statement balance remains the same and does not understand what I mean by wanting the fees waived.

I attempt to call her and am connected to a third-party phone answering goblin who cannot give me any direct numbers nor connect me to Cher nor Dionne. I email Cher asking her to immediately call me.

She replies she would prefer to keep everything in writing and asks if I would like to set up a payment plan. I respond that since she is clearly not understanding, I wanted to explain it to her over the phone, but fine let's continue to email. I once again, slowly explain how the lease has been violated twice and therefore these fees are not mandatory per the lease. I ask if it is preferred by the community if I sue them and tarnish their public record. I once again request to be connected with Dionne's supervisor because clearly 1.) Cher is way out of her league 2.) Dionne probs doesn't even work here anymore cause it has been three weeks of silence.

Cher replies that all she can do is advise on the lease policies. I reply saying ""does this mean the community has decided to not waive the fees despite the two acts of sexual assault?""

I have yet to hear back from Cher.

**So what does everyone recommend I do?** I would greatly appreciate any citations of federal or state laws to help build my case against these clowns. I was thinking next step was to go back to that hotline and try to get connected with a supervisor so I can go over Cher and Dionne both. Going to court sounds like a huge hassle and I do not have a bunch of time off from my new job to entertain these fools.",17Jul2020,1

907,"First off, hes such a sweet boyfriend and does really nice things to me, he never lies to me whatsoever.

So about 6 months ago (when we weren't dating but we just secretly rlly liked each other and it was pretty obvious) I found out that he would jerk off of other girls (he said it was just the thoughts that came into his brain and he didn't really think about it and just let it happen) and it made me uncomfortable. even though we weren't dating or anything I just felt really hurt at the idea that he would get pleasure from fucking other girls when he only likes me.

He said he didn't realize it would make me sad because he barely thought about it himself, since they were just thoughts that came to his brain that he didnt stop(while he tried really hard to not to do it off of me bc he wasnt sure about how i felt about him and wanted to respect me)

When i told him it made me really uncomfortable, he was REALLY sorry and stopped immediately. He apologized over and over and over and promised me there were no attachments whatssoever and they were just thoughts that came into his mind that he should've stopped.

Now we are dating and it just still bothers me sometimes about how he could get pleasure from the thought of other girls. We talked about it and he ensured me that Im the only one he wants and he said his attraction for other girls only stay at like a 5 second reaction of finding them cute but stops right there, and promised me that if he sees any girl wearing sexually explicit things he'd away and not think about it. (except he did admit that maybe he'd get turned on for one second and then think about me instead)

Now I know its normal for guys to get attracted to other girls for a few seconds and move on and he is honestly really committed to me. but ig his past actions just makes me feel SO SENSITIVE and now i feel like im not ok with him just thinking about other girls at all.

I dont know what to do i really want to move on from it, because he did some really crazy stuff for me to make me feel secured (i cried realy hard this once over a call and he immediately blocked all the girls he follows on instagram voluntarily, ofc i made him add them back because that's kinda rude lol)

910,"I am a 19 year old male, currently living at home with my parents.

They are quite controlling and have been my entire life, I have to report to them where I'm going so they can make sure it is a ""safe"" area. More like an area they know, with roads that are easy. I must report to them when I get there and when I leave eventually. I am not allowed to just go somewhere, I must know the location, people at the location and what we will be dong, so it may all be approved. I have tried before saying that I was just going to go ""out for a drive"" so that I could just drive around aimlessly and explore the area I grew up in. This has always been shut down with an ""absolutely not.""

My parents have made it often clear that I am not trusted, nor seen as an adult. I cannot drive on highways as they think I lack enough driving experience. (been driving for 2 years now.) And all of my bills, taxes, affiliations such as doctor, dentists, banks etc. Are all handled by my parents, when I have attempted to do them myself or asked to learn about them, they have just said that ""they'll handle it."" So I am completely left in the dark in that area, and am totally dependent on them for it.

I desperately want to move out and live as I please, but this fact along with that I feel I may not be able to work towards passionate goals while working full time just to pay rent.

914,"I was visiting my mother and I was helping her clear out some stuff. I came across a ton of meds. My mother is diabetic, has skin conditions, in general I would say she‚Äôs unhealthy and experiences a lot of health problems. I checked the date on these meds and they are dated for 2019, some of these even older....Years older!

What am I meant to do with them? Should I throw them out? Are they still useful?

For example I found paracetamol, ibuprofen, co-codamol and antihistamines. I thought that these although prescribed in 2019 (or older years) can still be helpful as they are over the counter meds that anyone can use for a specific reason. So thought they are still worth keeping.

But then I went on to find quite a few insulin pen ‚ÄúNovoMix‚Äù like whaaat?! She hasn‚Äôt used any of them and it says to use within four weeks on the packaging AND to keep refrigerated which she‚Äôs done neither. These are completely useless now right? I should throw them out right? I don‚Äôt know what to do, they are completely new in their packaging but the dates on them ?!

I‚Äôve also found Amoxicillin and antibiotic creams some completely unopened. This tells me she hasn‚Äôt finished her full course of antibiotics which has probably contributed to her continuously feeling unwell. What am I meant to do with these? The antibiotic creams can still be helpful for her skin condition but what about the amoxicillin? Like I have no clue what to do with it? 

It feels so weird just binning all these meds that are unopened and the thought came to maybe give to the pharmacy so they can dispose of it appropriately? But I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt want her to get in any sort of trouble.

Me and a friend were scouted to model for a shoot that takes place this weekend, and I‚Äôm going on holiday (by the sea) the beginning of next week. And I guess it needs no explanation why the two of these events taking place makes me judge my body more than I ever have, or really need to.

I started a diet from Monday which mainly consists of consuming nothing but protein shakes and an apple until dinner. Needless to say, it‚Äôs probably made my body problems worse considering Monday me ambitiously expected to lose at least two pounds before the shoot. 


- side note... I know that redditers usually have a habit of making a persons problems seem more extreme than it is... but I assure you I don‚Äôt usually care much at all about how I look, I‚Äôm particularly good at hyping myself and keeping positive.

918,"Hi all, I just received an offer for a position within my current company that feels like it was tailor made for me. It is exactly what I want to do, and it sort of fell on my lap (a friend of mine works on the team, knew they had an open position for what my goal role is, and facilitated conversation between me and his manager). 

I really like my manager, but the role I'm in just isn't for me. My current plan is to contact him on Monday and let him know that he has been a great manager and that I have learned a lot in this role, but that I received an amazing opportunity I can't pass up and that I am willing to transition 50/50 for as long as needed (or 2 weeks still mulling it over).

924,"My best friend was in an abusive relationship with another close friend of mine. This relationship lasted for over a year and ended about two and a half years ago, and I knew that it had been a difficult relationship, but I only found out the extent of it a week ago, when my best friend was ready to tell me just what happened. For their privacy, I won't relay any of it here, but suffice it to say that I've seen definitive proof that the relationship was very abusive and detrimentally harmful to my best friend, who was subject to many different kinds of abuse. I completely believe them and understand that my other friend was at fault.

But when the two of them broke up, all of that wasn't clear. My best friend told me and the other members of our very close-knit friend group about some of the things that had happened, but because we were teenagers at the time and emotions ran high, we weren't able to recognize it as abuse and instead turned the whole thing into months-long drama where we flamed the abuser and dredged up everything from other manipulative things they'd done to numerous people in our group to petty bs that had nothing to do with the real issue. I'm deeply regretful of how we initially handled it, and I feel that if we'd been more mature and reasonable, things would have turned out better. But the main thing that came out of this was that my best friend felt like they had to apologize to the abuser, and the two of them became close friends again through the end of high school. This meant that my other friends and I felt like we could befriend the abuser again, and we pretty much tried to never bring any of it up again, except to laugh it off. (This also had the side effect of the abuser feeling as if they could play the victim, one of their most common abuse tactics and general ways of recounting stories about their life that make it very hard to engage with this person and make them see what they've done wrong.)

The abuser is one of only a handful of my high school friends that I'm still in contact with, and until a week ago, we talked pretty regularly. They've texted me a few times since then, all about unrelated things, but I haven't responded. My best friend is the most important person to me in the world and I truly believe for their sake they should never contact their abuser again, and I feel awful for continuing to be friends with their abuser for years. But I'm really not sure what I should do now. I don't have any intention of continuing to be friends with the abuser, but they also have a history of mental health issues, and I'm worried about the effect on them if I suddenly refuse to contact them. We attend college near each other and planned to see each other in person/travel to and from home together, so it isn't just online contact I have to terminate. I can't just ignore all their texts, and they're not the kind of person who would take my silence well. They also have no reason to believe this has anything to do with their old relationship, so I'm worried that my silence would be seen as some sort of unwarranted passive aggression (not that I really want to care about their feelings after learning details of what they did, but I honestly still have a hard time not seeing them as my friend, even though I'm very angry with them and have no intention of forgiving them unless they acknowledge and seriously fix their behavior, something they've shown no signs of ever doing and that I find very unlikely of happening in the near future). I don't want to confront them, though, not only because I doubt the effectiveness of trying to explain something like this over text, but because I don't want them to try to contact my best friend again (who has also been ignoring their texts for a week). Quite frankly, my best friend has had enough of this person for a lifetime, and I don't think creating any sort of situation in which they have to defend having been abused to their abuser would be good for them at all and I want to avoid that at all costs.

I also feel responsible for the abuser. Their best friend is also one of my close friends (and the only other person from my high school friend group I have regular contact with), and though I don't want to violate my best friend's privacy by revealing details of their abuse, it's becoming increasingly sticky talking to this third friend with everything my best friend and I have been talking about, and I'm worried that if things continue, they'll get dragged into this too. I know this third friend has also felt manipulated and controlled by the abuser in the past, though this was all smoothed over around the same time my best friend smoothed things over with them too. Do I have a responsibility to try and get my third friend out of this friendship too? Do I have a responsibility to inform anyone the abuser is in a relationship with about the things they've done? (I've talked to other people who dated the abuser in the past, and their abusive patterns are definitely not unique to their relationship with my best friend.)

Also, as an endnote, everyone involved in this story has struggled with mental health issues and are currently going through individual rough times, and I'm really worried about upsetting them and making things worse. I really just want all of this to be over so I can help my best friend move on from their trauma. I won‚Äôt do anything without their knowledge and consent, I‚Äôm just not entirely sure what it is that I should be doing. I'm really not the important person in this story, they are, and I refuse to let myself hurt them by trying to fix this situation.

TL;DR: My friend just informed me about the extent of abuse in their relationship from years ago with another one of my friends, and I'm trying to figure out how to gracefully cut out the abuser without inciting trouble or making anything worse. I'm also trying to figure out the extent of my responsibility in preventing someone who I used to consider one of my closest friends from doing further harm.",17Jul2020,1

929,"Hi, 

I couldn't find a specific subreddit for this question but here we go. I'm currently making a table-top rpg game that I'm planning at some point to sell and pitch, I've been working on it for almost 2 years now and have re-written/edited the core rulebook 8 times. I'm planning on asking a group on Facebook that's the town I live in if anyone would be interested in playtesting the game because I want to make sure it's good to go before pitching it to someone or going the self-publish route.  

Assuming I can get 3-5 players fully committed, I'm friends with someone who owns a tabletop gaming store in my town and he says I can playtest the game there. My question is (because I'm very cautious with someone possibly taking my work) would it be a good idea for me to have them sign a paper, after speaking with a lawyer or whomever on the verbiage, that ensures they're not going to steal my work or make the mechanics of the game their own? 

Maybe I'm being paranoid but I want to know what do you guys think?",17Jul2020,1
930,"Background info: 

I am 16 yrs old, going into Junior year. Just a few months ago I bought my own phone, from money I had made working. My parents had forbidden me for years from owning a phone, but I finally convinced them to allow me to purchase one.

After buying the phone, I also purchased a screen protector, and 2 cases (one ended up not holding up well). During all of this, my parents paid not a single cent. Now, I want to add my phone to our family plan, so I can obviously use it as a phone, and not a WiFi-locked tablet. However, my parents are claiming that I should pay for my phone bill, each month. 

My family is not even close to financially unstable, so my parents aren‚Äôt doing this to save necessary money. They have a belief that I should be ‚Äúresponsible with money‚Äù, even though I am a very responsible person, and understand the value of money. They have said multiple times that they will not assist me at all with college payments, or car payments, so it is not as if paying my own phone bill is a compensation. I have to pay for my own haircuts, if I want to get snacks that aren‚Äôt part of regular meals, etc.,

I don‚Äôt think it is right that I should pay $26 a month, especially considering there are so many other expenses I need to be saving up for. I am an active member of my community, I volunteer though BSA, I‚Äôm top of my class, and all that, so it‚Äôs not as if I need a lesson taught to me about responsibility. They also make it seem as if this is a normal thing for a child to do.

After I payed for everything related to my new phone, my parents insisted I must also pay my own phone bill, even though I have proven my responsibility, and have many other more important expenses to be worrying about.",17Jul2020,1

My mother has extreme PTSD and also tends to have very bad experiences in the hospital.

I was allowed in to pre-op and even into the PACU recovery with her. They are now saying that was only possible because it was outpatient and not in patient surgery. 

My question is, what legal course can I take to insist a family member accompany her? It is not a low risk surgery and would require a 3-4 day recovery in the hospital.

I do not crave intimacy, and I would much rather masturbate than have to engage in any sexual performance. I have always had a low sex drive; however, the opposite is true for my partner.

I have noticed that the lack of sex has greatly affected him, even though he vehemently denies it. Yet he does feel rejection, and discusses this topic often with his therapist. 

We live together, and neither of us makes any moves on each other (he won‚Äôt because knows I don‚Äôt want it and will immediately back out). We haven‚Äôt even kissed in a couple of months now, and I can‚Äôt bring myself to comprehend why I am so opposed to intimacy and affection.

I feel that I am depriving him of a gigantic part of a relationship, but I‚Äôve been considering that I might be asexual due to my lack of interest in sex, or that maybe there is something else going on with me mentally?

At the beginning of our relationship, there was some oral and fondling, but it was always me putting in the work and I eventually got tired of it and did not want to participate in it anymore. In fact, I felt very turned off having to be the one in control. It eventually just fizzled our completely. Initially, I believed my sex drive was hormonally imbalanced, but after some blood work, I was reassured that my levels are just fine. 

I love my partner very much, but can‚Äôt help to feel that I am not delivering on an important part of our relationship. A part of me would be open to allowing him to find a sexual partner, but we are so ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô that such an idea might be a bit on the radical side for us.

I met this girl a few months ago here in Reddit and after that we dated for about a month.

Everything was going fine, we we're always talking on the phone day and night so in a sense we somewhat clicked and I thought ""great, she's the girl I'm going to marry someday."" She introduced me to her friends and some of her siblings and vice versa, basically we let each other into our life. But after a month of dating everything went down, she suddenly became cold towards me and I immediately knew that something is off so I asked her if we're still ok and her answer was ""I think, not anymore."" She told me that her brother advised her to not be in a hurry in going to relationships as she sometimes can't differentiate the difference between love and infatuation.

So fast forward to today about a few days ago I tried talking to her about us and the last thing she said to me was ""It's not what I wanted."" So now I just don't know if I should still be hopeful for the idea of us.

Most of my clients have large-scale projects, which result in four-figure invoices on a regular basis. Like most of us, I have an idea of where some of my income is spent: bills, purchases for my kids, the works.

I get paid, then I pay my bills and I'm in the clear. Everything is good. Except my motivation flies out the window.

Today, I was in the middle of a project that I estimated I could finish four days early. I received a notification on my phone that I'd been paid for the previous project, and even though I was in a groove and working like a madman, I immediately heard this little voice that said ""Stop working.""

I listened to it. Again.

We always have enough to get through bills and upcoming expenses, whether it's doctors, school stuff, home items, and things of that sort. The point is: I'm not hurting for money or for work, I'm just not getting ahead of the curve, either. Not the way I want to be.

I kick myself, sit back down, and say ""Okay, we're going to do this,"" but it goes like molasses compared to when I know I need to get paid to cover expenses.

953,"It goes without saying, two people don't just become friends with a simple verbal contract. It takes effort to build a sustainable friendship; a friendship that you can rely on.
It was easy in school, I used to be quite popular, even though I always hated the attention. I lost all the attention after someone harassed me by forging a rumour that they sexually harassed me. Since I was a boy and not a girl, the rumour was glorified by the school. By that I mean I cut off everyone that mocked me for it. In the present I get anxiety whenever I meet someone with any connections to my school.

Anyway, In college I started off as a reclusive person. I won't lie, I did make friends in university, very few but I did. Now that my university life is almost over, I want to know what's the secret to a successful and strong friendship.

How do I befriend someone, not just for the namesake's?
How do I make a bond that is as close as family without having to have a romantic-al angle to it?
Moreover where do I find people to befriend?

954,"My karma isn't high enough to ask this in r/cats.

It's only been 24hrs so I'm well aware that panic is premature. 

My cat Salome (Sal-oh-may) is around 8 months. She came to us at just 7wks from a cat farm. She was tiny and unwell. As we had her from such a tiny kitten, she is really attached to us. We are her entire world. We live on a ground floor and she doesn't go outside despite the windows being open. She hates strangers. You can just tell she loves us more than the average cat would.

I wanted to get her a friend to play with. We knew it would be difficult but I really thought she'd enjoy it. I found the perfect kitten, only it was 12wks. I'm starting to think it was a mistake but it's not been long so it's likely just anxiety.

He hisses constantly which has made Salome obviously very defensive. She hasn't moved for 24hrs. She hasn't eaten, drank or gone to the toilet. Even when I put things in front of her. I keep thinking maybe I should have got a younger kitten that doesn't hiss and jump about. Salome is great with my rabbit and even my hamster so that shows she is capable of making friends. This kitten attacked my rabbit even though he was in a cage.

 This kitten seems really different to the vibe of our home I guess. He didn't seem to even notice being rehomed and that we were different people. It shows he cares less about humans. I can tell my partner isn't into him but I think it's just the contrast between the two and the fact that Salome is now utterly miserable. Plus, I know the feeling of comparing a pet to another. My partner just keeps saying how aggressive this kitten is and it's true. His claws have been out none stop.

I know it can take up to a year for cats to be friends. I just don't want Salome to be miserable in her own home for that long though. 

This kitten went from it's mums home, to another home and then to me. I really don't want to give him up. I don't want to give him up but I'd do anything for Salome to be happy. I was never a cat person until I got her and now I cry just looking at her or hearing her breathe hahaha (wtf). I certainly don't want her to change at all. 

I don't know what's best for her and the new kitten. Her can't keep going from home to home. Surely it's best if he goes to yet another home that it's done now but that's so silly because it may take time. But what if all this time passes and nothing gets better. I'm in a small flat too.

How long should I let Salome go being this depressed? What do I do if she doesn't eat or drink eventually? What should I do?",17Jul2020,1
955,"My parents went to drop off a package for me at a certain shipping company in the United States. The clerk was rude and yelled at them and used a demeaning tone. They aren't opening up completely about what happened but it was apparently bad enough that they thought the clerk would just throw the package in the garbage in front of them. 

The reason I know that this was racist in nature and not just a clerk having a bad day is because one of my friends who is black told me that she went to a shipping company in the same county one day, and waited in line for 10 and then her white friend arrived. The clerk then asked her friend to come forward and be served, while she stood waiting in line.

I believe that the postal company must be notified of this incident. I still don't know if my package will be shipped, or if the clerk ended up throwing it away.

skip to the end for my question unless you're interested in the boring background story.

the title might sound misleading but dont get me wrong, I love my parents and theyre amazing up until now they've provided all the stuff a normal 17 year old guy could wish for. now im turning grade 12 this year which in my country (iraq) decides on which college you can go to. Now my parents have always been the typical middle eastern parents where they would ALWAYS tell me to study during school days and it was annoying but I got around with it all my school life. Because of that ive always maintained high grades and to my parents that means ""im smart"" which is really not the case I just pay attention during class and I barely study at home. I just sit in my room for hours and my parents think im ""studying"" I do feel guilty when I say iam studying but im actually not but I make up for it by getting good grades. Now heres the problem, summer just started and I have 5 different tutors and I have 7 lessons a week each is 1.5 hours minimum. The study load is more than I can take and when I tell my parents they keep brushing it off, the amount of load has increased STUPIDLY since last year and to be honest I didnt expect it to be like that. on my last math test I got a 66/70 score which my parents werent happy about and told me im slacking off which made me angry. Theyre expecting me to go into med school which requires an average of 96-100% on all exams. Now it wasnt that hard to get a score like that past years because we had two semesters and each term the exams would include half of the book. This year the exam includes the whole book and the questions are written by teachers from other schools. Ive already told my parents I really dont have any interest in med school and have fought with them many times and they always say this line (being a doctor is the only profession that a good amount of pay that lets you live your like comfortably) and theyre always talking about no one getting employed these days beside doctors because they can run their own clinics and stuff. Today my mom caught me on my phone and she was real mad and told me im ungrateful for not studying and I told her its too much for me and I cant handle it, she then said that im being ungrateful for not studying and the thats the only thing is to study as a student. I really cant take this much and its getting on my nerves that I cant express myself without sounding spoiled or ungrateful. I gave up on arguing with them and tried to study for real and I iust cant get myself to do it its iust boring and repetitive and most of it is just memorizing stuff ill forget later.

962,"So I was admitted to a state university, the largest one in my state. I was so excited to go because they announced that they were going to be doing in person classes this fall. 

Last week they changed their mind and said they're only doing online classes next semester and not adjusting tuition.

 I was furious, so I applied to another state school. Much smaller, definitely not my first choice, but they will be on campus this fall. I have been out of high school for over a year and a half, have no friends, and can't find a job, so I just want social interaction.

964,"A few days ago, as I was procrastinating online between study sessions, I stumbled across a Wikipedia page about a murder case that happened around the 70's-80's. Having read similar stories in the past without being frightened, curiosity got the best of me and I started reading the whole page. I mean, how bad could a solved case of 40-50 years ago be? Big mistake. The case was unimaginably violent and cruel -- it was beyond what I had expected. On top of this, turns out the murder happened in the towns near where I live (approx. 20 or less min car ride away). I was so shocked and shaken after reading through the entire page, that I started feeling light-headed and dizzy. This had never happened to me before in such situation. The story keeps me awake every single night since. The image of the victim's body creeps into my mind right when I'm about to fall asleep. I keep thinking of how easily anyone could have been a victim, how it could have been my mother, or even myself (as only a small portion of the people involved got arrested). The problem is, it is currently exam week for my university. The sleepless nights have exhausted me, and I am too tired to concentrate during both studying and the actual exam. And what's worse for me is that if I don't pass this semester, I have to redo a whole year, which I honestly can't afford. Although, I know I need to get over this quick so that I stop negatively impacting my health and my education, I don't how to. Essentially, it's my own interpretation and imagination of the murder that is causing me distress -- what should I do? Please help.

965,"I grew up in a very strict, religious, and conservative household, I never got ""the talk"" and anything moderately sexual was seen as disgusting. For example, if a commercial was too sexual, the channel would get changed. When I was about 12, I stumbled upon porn games, and my mom walked in while I had a screen open which had an anime woman with no top on but the picture was cut off right above where the areola would start. I was shamed and still feel embarrassed thinking about the memory.

I'm an adult now, and I feel a sinking feeling in my stomach when I come across anything moderately sexual, and I feel extremely guilty and a sense of panic or anxiety when I see NSFW pictures. I want to be normal, but I'm not sure how.

968,"I'm 19, female. Currently not working, I had a job for a little bit so I have some money saved. Not a lot. I want to find a way out of my house desperately. I'm really not happy here, I won't go into it because it's a can of worms, but I would be much happier and healthier if I could get out, or even if I just had hope that I could get out. 

I have a lot of questions, my mother hasn't really taught me anything, and my anxiety prevents me from functioning like an adult most of the time. I want to try to be independent soon. I want a job, I want to move out. But I feel absolutely hopeless. With my anxiety, it's hard for me to talk to others, and I can't really answer phone calls. I did work retail at once point. I haven't gone to college, I took a year off to figure out what I wanted to do, and I still don't know what I want to do with my life. The only thing I'm decent at is art, but I'm still awful at that. I had interest in programming, but I could not do that, and taking a class when I was in high school made me feel embarrassed and stupid for even trying. I like music, I'd like to make some, but I know I can't do that and it's useless for me to try. I'm saying this because I don't have any motivation, any drive. I don't enjoy doing anything, and I only do art because I feel like it's the only thing I can do. So, my obvious choice is art school...but I'm worried I won't make enough to survive as a type of artist. First question is: how do I figure out what I want to do? Or will I? What should I do if I don't know what I want to do at all? Is there any hope for me?

Second question: I want a job. Honestly, I do. I didn't hate having a job, just felt very disrespected by my boss, and I have pain and sickness that makes it really hard to be on my feet for hours. I don't think I could go back to retail, especially with the virus now. I don't have good health and I feel like putting myself at that much of a risk is not wise. I would prefer something online, but I don't know how realistic that is. I can't answer phones, so anything where I have to do it constantly is honestly out of the question for me. I don't mind emails I think, I don't think I would hate a desk job, but I don't know how realistic that is either. I'm not looking for a bunch of money I guess? It doesn't have to be a real job, maybe something to do every once in a while and make some money...I don't know... I don't even know where to look for jobs or anything. I'm just hoping someone could point me in the right direction or something...I don't know, I'm sick of sitting at home all day doing nothing, it makes me feel awful.

My other, and last question. I have some money saved in my bank account. Should I be doing something with that? I know there's stock things and different types of savings accounts, I think I should be doing something like that since I'm sitting around doing nothing much, it would probably help me in the future. But, what do I do, how do I know what's best, and how do I go about doing this? I don't have a job, but I make $10 - 20 every once in a while due to selling art, so I could keep putting that money into something with interest. 

Thank you for any help...I feel completely out of options and I'm so lost. I just want to start moving on with my life but I feel like I can't. I feel trapped by my poor health and ignorance, I just want to be better and work towards improving my situation.",17Jul2020,1

 So far I'm the only one he shows his stuff to and I've been trying to be supportive which is smth I kinda regret because now he has such unrealistic expectations that he is some kind of prodigy (he genuinely told me that he's planning to reach out to Netflix to make his book into a NF original).

979,"Saturday night, My dad was acting crazy. We decided to throw a party for my aunt and her family since this was her first time being in Florida and coming to see our house. During our parties, the games of spades are always being played. My whole family takes cards seriously despite them not winning anything in the end. Long story short, he needed up losing and went outside with phone and headphones. He started walking back and forth on the literal street without any shoes and was singing loudly. When my mom, sister, and I tried to ask if he was good, he would purposely ignore us like they weren't there. My mom even tried to place her hand gently on my dad's chest to stop him from walking but he looked at her with such disgust. At that point, we were over it and when everyone started to leave, my mom wanted to close the garage (we usually have it open during parties). Once doing so, we left him out there and went out to the patio with my aunt, her wife, and two kids, my uncle, grandmother, sister, and her 4 friends. We were all just chilling until we heard the front door open and we saw my dad walk in.We have a large window that faces the kitchen from the patio so it's easy to see what he's doing. That's when he went to the tv and decided to blare music despite him still wearing headphones. Then he went to turn off the patio light as well as the lights in the kitchen and living room. We still tried to ignore him until my grandmother decided to go back inside to turn on the lights to the living room and the patio. When doing so, my dad was dancing with a butcher knife and went towards my grandmother before she could even turn on the patio light. This resulted in all of us jumping up and trying to move her away. My mom was livid and asked him wtf was he doing. This is when he starts degrading my mom by calling her all these names and even stated that we wouldn't even have this lifestyle if it wasn't for him, so everything is his. He tried to pick up the tv but I think it was too heavy so he settled on taking the cable/wifi box instead. Tbh, tensions were so high to the point where I don't remember small gaps. But there was a point where he started to degrade everyone. My uncle wanted to fight him at this point because he couldn't believe what my dad was doing. So a lot of us tried to hold damy'on the back because we know he would beat the shit out of him. However, my dad started to antagonize him more and cursing everyone out. I was so pissed to the point where I started to push my dad back from trying to go to damy'on. It was like he didn't even see me despite my crying and telling him to stop. I didn't want anyone else to be in harm's way and I was livid that he would even act like this. That's when I slapped and pushed him to a corner. But while doing so, he started laughing which made him slap him again and kick him. My sister pulled me away and I ran outside because I was so hurt. I felt so scared because I wanted someone to help get him away but I also didn't want the cops to be called. He was acting so crazy with us so I was terrified that he would do the same if the cops came. Our neighbors called the cops, idk how we all went outside but we all started arguing on our driveway. His whole attitude changed and he acted so civilly. The cops escorted him away and my family and I decided to lock everything down to make sure he can't come back inside. My mom's friend went to go talk to him and he told her that he didn't do anything wrong because he wasn't bothering anybody. As for the knife, he said that he forgot he had it in his hand. I've never seen my uncle cry before and it hurt me a lot because he wanted to fight my dad for putting us in harm's way.This isn't the first time my dad has acted this way during parties at our home, its not all the time but it is often. However, it has never escalated like this. I've grown so sick of it despite that I love him. 30 minutes after the cops escorted him away. My dad came back and tried to get inside our house using this keypad we have to open the garage but luckily we took out the batteries when he left with the cops.My dad has been trying to talk to all of us through text and calls. The next day, He sent me a message stating that he will always love me and that this has nothing to do with me. I didn't reply nor did I read it until now. He tried to call me earlier today but I ignored it. I'm still pissed at him and I don't want him coming back to the house at all but I still love him. I genuinely don't know what to do at all. Apart of me feels bad for ignoring him, like maybe I'm drawing this situation out. But another part of me wants him to just leave us alone and hold himself accountable. Every time I think about it, I start crying all over again because of how conflicted I am. What would you do in my shoes? would you talk to him? how do you know you're ready to even talk?",17Jul2020,1

982,"So my best friend have depression, and she's been going to the doctor and so, and she felt better for two weeks, but yesterday she spent all the day crying and eating pills for sleep, she sent me some voice notes and it was really hard for me to hear that, as she could barely speak. Since she told me the depression stuff and so, I have accepted the fact that, in any moment, she can suicide and there's nothing I can do about that. She had some anxiety episodes really hard and she has almost been hospitaliced and so, so I have really clear that, somewhen she could die or idk. 

I forgot to tell that she is from a small village that is really far (5 hours by car). I used to go every summer but this one because of covid, I couldn't, as I stayed in my grandpa's house and it's really risky to go there this summer. 

Ok, since the voice note yesterday, she answered a couple of messages more and she hasn't answered nothing more. We usually talk a lot everyday but today it seems like she hasn't opened whatsapp even though I've kept talking to her. So I'm a bit worried.

I've been thinking and I don't know... I want to see her soon in case that she die or smth, I really want to see her, but everything is so difficult rn... If I go, all the village would know that I'm there (as everyone there know me), so I can't go without telling my parents...

I'd like some ideas, because I want to see her but idk. I've thought about staying home one week without going out and then, go to the village, but that doesn't mean that I can't catch covid while going (because I have to go by bus), or even there, or idk.

Ok so I did, but since I saw that doctor something seemed off but I thought to give him a change. Well I was right. I don't have a problem for needles but for the first time this was a frustating situation because he said multiple times he couldn't ""find the vein"" but he still put the needle in, and even worse he started moving it around, twisting it slightly and pushing it even more..it made me feel sick..plus my hand got swollen really badly and couldn't move my fingers for few hours because I think he bursted the vein( idk if that is the correct term sorry), he did it on the hand..

My mom said that it is up to my choice if I want to do the test again in few days (but with a different person) .. I honestly don't know...after this horrible situation..especially that I am a piano player training for a professional level.. Should I do the thyroid test? Also should I make the complaint against this doctor and if so what should I say in it?

TL;DR : I am a pianist and my hands are very important to me. I have 2 questions:
1. Is it normal for doctors to say ""can't find the vein"" after putting the needle in 4 times and leaving your hand swollen for hours, and if so is it a good reason to complain againt it?
2.Should I take the thyroid test? bc I am now scared

987,"DISCLAIMER: I know people have it MUCH worse than me during this difficult time and the least of their worries is travelling. I know I am privileged but I just feel like I need to talk to someone about this and need advice. 

When I graduated highschool I decided to take a year off to pursue my music career and I worked part time at a grocery store. At this time I was also battling anxiety and depression. I wanted to travel but I was too scared and didn't really have any one to go with. I ended up taking 3 year's off highschool due to my music and my mental health. 

I started university in 2017 and I told myself I would travel in the summers. Didn't happen. Last summer I wanted go on a contiki tour to Europe, I already put he deposit down, but my boyfriend couldn't take a month off because he has a full time job and is just an apprentice. So I was going to go by myself but that kind of made our relationship a little tense. He persuaded me that we would go to France next summer (2020) together for two weeks and I agreed. Well here we are, dealing with a global pandemic, not really knowing when it will be safe to travel again. Even if it is deemed safe to travel again, I would probably have anxiety of catching the virus while travelling and I don't know if that will wreck the experience. 

I am 24 and still have a year and a half left of college and I want to go to grad school which will be another 2-3 years. My boyfriend and I are saving up for a house, so we will have a mortgage. I'm not currently working right now due to Covid so I am making like no money, but I have saved up about 6000 dollars from last summer. I'm worried my boyfriend will get mad at me if I don't put that towards a house we want to buy in the future. Oh and I would like to get married and have kids before I'm 30. All of that costs so much money and I don't know how I am going squeeze travelling in there. My boyfriend would also rather have a house, car, &amp; babies than travel. I know I have to make sacrifices, but I don't know which ones to make. 

I feel like I wasted 3 years of staying home because of my anxiety and depression, and it's hard to see my friends and people on Instagram that have travelled the world. I'm just sad that the window of opportunity that I had, has now been taken away from me. I have such a strong yearning to see the world and experience different cultures and get out of my little bubble in Canada. I have traveled a little bit to the states and Mexico with my parents, but I want to go travelling for myself and my own learning and experiences.",17Jul2020,1
988,"Hi. Never posted here, so forgive me if I step on any toes.

Essentially, I can almost never say ""no"" to myself, when it comes to making a decision about something that will immediately give me a rush of endorphins, even if I regret it later. This happens with impulse purchases, drinking/smoking weed when I really don't need to, delaying hygienic tasks for way too long, and most significantly, calling in sick to work when I don't feel like going. That's the real nature of the beast right there, the other stuff is semi-manageable, but ever since I first started succumbing to my depression 5 years ago (which has more or less always been a factor, only at that point I was letting it win) I just started giving less and less of a shit about even my immediate future, at least when it came down to weighing what is actually good for me vs what will give me a fleeting hit of satisfaction right now. So as my depression worsened, I would call in to work, maybe once a week at first, but progressively more and more until I inevitably lost my job. I actually briefly started working somewhere else, but my condition worsened, I called in multiple times, and I eventually just stopped showing up.

Following this, I feel like I can't be helped, I convince my parents to let me move back in with them, and sort of leech off of them for the next couple years, no job, no friends, not leaving my room for anything besides food and to use the restroom (and often delaying those for unhealthy lengths of time due to an excruciating anxiety that has now developed over ""being seen"". I'm very suicidal at this point, but somehow I eventually manage to reintegrate into society a little bit. I manage to start going outside again, and find a couple local (under the table) jobs with extremely low pay to help get back on my feet. But even at that point, when I needed money more than ever to fix up my now defunct car that hasn't moved from my parents' rear driveway, so I may transport myself to a better job and ultimately move out again, I would still call in sick and spend a lot of my income on weed and junk food. Pathetic, I know.

Somehow my condition is actually improving, I'm no longer suicidal, not as depressed, and I try working from home, as much as my limited skillset would allow. Freelance writing and editing, and still spending income on shit I don't need.

I'm now no longer suicidal, wouldn't even say I'm very depressed anymore. I manage to get a part-time job at a grocery chain, decent pay, certainly the best job I've had in a while. And of course, within a month and a half I start calling in sick and eventually quit with nothing else lined up.

And now, to the present; I have miraculously convinced another employer to hire me because they foolishly didn't refer to any of my previous employers firsthand, they just took it on credit that I'm a ""dedicated worker who only misses a few shifts a year"", and I am freaking out a bit, reddit, because deep down, I really, really *genuinely* want to keep this job. I want to make a living, and be able to know that I will not only have the continued security to keep making that income, but also the discipline to not spend the money I make on shit that provides only fleeting satisfaction. I'm gonna be 30 in 3 years, guys, and I just can't figure out how to tell myself ""no"". It is actually ruining my life, and several times already I thought it already had.

i (f14) am trying to get help for this but i really dont know how to go about it. i have been feeling extremely depressed for over 3 years now and it's only getting worse. i would say nearly a year ago i started the self harm but have had suicidal thoughts since the beginning. my parents dont know anything about this and i would love for it to stay that way which makes getting help quite hard. i have talked to teachers very vaguely about this in the past but they emailed my parents about it which didn't help at all.

nearly a year ago i distanced myself from and pushed away one of the best and only friends ive ever had because i felt i was being to much of a burden to him and quite frankly it is not his job to put up with me like this. i have only gotten lonelier but ive promised myself that i wont reach out to him again until im better but i dont seem to be improving. ive been holding off on getting help for a long time but im just so lost and i want this all to go away.

i need therapy or something but i dont know how to get that. i dont have money to pay for stuff like therapy and i cant exactly ask my parents for it because they would just ask questions constantly and we are not really in the right place financially to afford a therapist anyways. so, what do i do? 

i feel like a bomb that's finally reaching its last minutes before it explodes. theres just this constant voice in my head preventing me from ever feeling happy with myself again. it would be so much easier to end it all but that's selfish and my cat wouldn't know where i went lol. so yeah, any reply is appreciated, thanks for your time :')",17Jul2020,1

She even defended the guy who kneed George floyd and says that he got carried away and says that she's sick of hearing about saying that floyd wasn't a saint. She defended the cop who pushed the old man who fell on the floor, and trump claimed he was a member of ANTIFA, by arguing he should have been walking on the other side of the street. I've tried telling her that a cop could assault her and not be placed in jail and how she cannot sue the cop even if she wanted to. She keeps comparing this to the corrupt cops in Mexico and saying we should respect police and do what they say without question and accept whatever punishment THEY give not the justice system. She says that its biblical that humans should respect the law and follow it including the ones who enforce it. She resorts to just either belittle me or just run away from the conversation that she initiated when I present facts and documentation of police brutality. She says that I should not try to educate her because she is my mother and god did not send me to educate her. I try to tell her that I can call a cop a peice of shit and he wouldn't be able to nothing legally because freedom of speech but she argues that he should then assault me and rightfully so and arrest me and she says she would not help if this did happen. This is how deep her police apology goes I even said if I was a police officer I can assault her without anything happening to me. She then got violent and threatened me so she clearly has a line and that seems to be it's okay if it happens to others but not her. How do I break through this and get her to understand the way she's thinking is wrong bigoted and just disgusting. She's super closed minded she's even said if her mother was here and trying to boss her around that she would kick her out but goes on to tell us when we have homes that we cant tell her shit that we should welcome her with open arms even if she does boss us around in the home. She seem to think everything is fair game for her to do but it's not okay when it happens to her it's a childish mentality that I hate.",17Jul2020,1

1011,"First of all, I know this is a very mild issue considering to soms other posts and it's privacy a stupid concern, but it has been bothering me for some time now and since I'm new I'm not sure where to post this and I really want to talk to people. Secondly, I've only watched up to season 9, so please no spoilers from season 10-15.

A very long backstory:

So more than a year ago (I think around the beginning of 2019), my sister started watching Supernatural and I think it's fair to say she got a little bit obsessed, like she would watch it on her computer the entire day in her spare time and at night until 3/4 o'clock. She also tried to make me start watching, but I wasn't really interested at the time. I was like: ""sorry, don't feel like it rn, but I'll afd it to my mental list of things I will check out perhaps once"".

Then my sister begged and finally convinced her to buy the series (a box containing season 1-13). She put it on on the tv in the living room and I watched the first episode and enjoyed it, so I decided to watch some more. 

As I said, I enjoyed it. I wasn't overly as obsessed as my sister. My sister wanted to watch at least 4 episodes every single day. At first I didn't mind so much since I was really enjoying it at first, but it did start to get a bit much for me. I also wanted to watch other films, but most of the time my sister put on Supernatural before I could say anything.

At the end of season 5, I wanted to have a little break of Supernatural. It was a nice round ending to the first 5 seasons, and I like to take the time to think about what I've seen and come up with fan theories and fanfiction and stuff. I thought in a week or 2 I might feel up to another season. So I told my sister I needed a break. Two days later she started up season 6. I commented on how I would have liked a longer break, but didn't complain too much since I was still interested. 

End of season 6, pretty much the same story. She went straight to the next season while I wanted a little break. I wasn't as much invested as at the beginning of season  1. I mainly watched because I liked Lucifer and knew he was making an appearance that season and because the main plot was still interesting.

Same with season 8, although we did watch a little bit less intensely. I was starting to get mildy annoyed with the constant conflict between Sam and Dean and the lack of resolvement of said conflict (seriously, they BARELY talk and it's considered solved). But the plot was interesting enough.

After season 8 I finally managed to make clear to my sister that I wanted to stop watching for a little while. She finally respected that, although she kept asking me almost everyday of I was ready to continue watching. I kept saying no.

Now I want to state that I easily feel guilty and said feeling often comes a messed up sense of duty. As an example, when I want the third film of the Lord of the Rings, I feel like I HAVE to watch film 1 and 2 first, or else I'll feel guilty. Stupid stuff like that makes me feel guilty. I know it is stupid and I am trying to work. But at the time one part of me felt guilty for not continueing the series because my sister clearly wanted me to and I felt that maybe I couldn't be considered a fan if I hadn't watched every single episode. 

Another part of me didn't want to continue watching, partly because I wasn't as invested as when I first started watching and partly because of my sister. Because she tries to kinda force me to watch when I state I don't feel like it, she comments costantly while we were watching because she's already seen it (I'd rather watch the episode in silence and discuss it afterwards) and also kinda spoilers things (not completely,  but she'll say stuff like ""oooh this certain thing is going to go on for several episodes"", ""he's the trickster, do you REALLY think he's dead?"" and ""If you don't like conflict, you're not gonna like this.). So part of me was also hesitant because I found my sister a bit annoying to watch with and sometimes I prefer watching alone. Sidenote: I recently tried to explain this feeling to her but she didn't get it. She didn't understand how I could NOT want to watch something TOGETHER always.


Anyway, after about a two week break my messed up guilt catched up to me, although I still was unsure if I even wanted to continue watching, let alone with my sister. So I found a compromise: I'd watch one or two episodes from season 9 by myself and if I wasn't interested, i'd wait some more until I felt ready or quit watching entirely. If I was interested, I'd tell my sister and we could watch the rest of the season together. I deliberatly didn't tell my sister beforehand because I was sure she'd want to watch together and I wanted to form an opinion on my own.

So I watched two episodes and was interested in the plot, so I told my sister what I had done, thinking she'd be happy I wanted t9 continue watching. She was not pleased to say the least. She SCREAMED and CRIED and went on about how I could have done this to her when I knew she wanted to watch together. I really didn't mean it like that.

The following day she got over it and we REWATCHED the two episodes I had already seen (she was insistent that she wanted to watch EVERYTHING together) and over the course of a couple of weeks we watched the entire 9th season. We finished it about three weeks ago. 

I did not like the final few episodes AT ALL. I do not like family drama in films that much and this season was FULL of it and it didn't feel resolved for me at the end. I didn't like Dean becoming violent because of the Mark of Cain (although I think Cain himself is pretty chill and okay) and I really didn't like how he treated Sammy. And when Dean was extremely violent AND died AND becane a demon in the same episode... I kinda lost it inside my head. When the credits rolled and my sister asked me hopefully what I thought of it, I went upstairs without saying much, because I didn't want to burst out in a rant. If other people do like the Mark of Cain and Demon Dean, that's completely fine. This is simply my opinion.

Now I am not sure if I want to continue watching or not. My sister has multiple times tried to put on season 10. The first time I made a oh-god-please-no face (which she accidentally saw) and I bolted upstairs to hide in my room because I was NOT ready at all. She becane really upset. The next time she tried, I told her that she could watch it if she wanted, but that I wouldn't watch with her. She then decided not to watch herself. It is pretty clear that she wants ME to watch and see my reactions (that was pretty much the same with the first 9 seasons).

I do however like reading fanfiction about the content I've seen already. My sister has seen me do this several times not and looks at me with confusion and betrayal. How could I read about Supernatural and not want to watch it ? I'm like: ""Season 5 Gabriel has nothing to do with Mark of Cain or Demon Dean. Why can't I just ignore one and read stuff about the other. ""

My questions for my fellow redditors:
Should I continue watching Supernatural or not and should I watch it with my sister or not? Am I being mean to her if I want to watch it alone? Can I still call myself a fan if I haven't watched every episode and mostly enjoy only season 1-6 and some moments of the other seasons? Am I in the wrong for reading fanfiction while not wanting to continue watching right now? Are the other seasons worth watching?

I know this is probably just me being insecure and feeling messed up guilty about nothing, but I'd just like some advice from some people who don't know me.",17Jul2020,1

1027,"Hello, well to start off I found a lump/mass growing around a year ago. I have been thinking about this for the last few months and have been reading various articles and pages.I know self diagnosis is stupid and one cant be truly sure unless given proof but  there are reasons that I want to keep this secret ,atleast for the time being, just in case it IS what I think it is.

*With covid going around most hospitals (atleast in my area) are reluctant to take patients. 

*Money. My dad is a freelancer and makes enough to get us by but his job has been declining these past few months. My mother is a teacher, though currently jobless due to covid. Were currently tight on cash and just barely getting by. 

*I'm ready to die. With the little intel I have gathered if it IS cancer then I have roughly 4-5 years to live? Do not get me wrong, I am truly greatfull to be alive and I do not take death lightly. I am absolutely terrified of what might happen but It does not mean I   am not ready for it, I have have absolutely no idea what to do in my life in my future. I always thought about purpose and shit and I dont really see a future for me.

*Burdens. I am young. I am currently 15, youngest in my family with two older siblings. I live in a country where parents usually support their children up to college and are very family oriented. With that said, my parents are going to be seniors soon and with me still in highschool, on top of the surgery/therapy costs that cancer will bring and then me going to college right after is just a huge financial burden on my parents and I wouldnt want that for them to be in debt especially for their age. A funeral would cost much smaller in comparison, yes they would mourn but as all humans do, eventually move on.

Id like to hear your opinions on my very at home self diagnosis. I know I'm basing all of this out of theory and I'm probably being majorly selfish but I think Im going to enjoy the rest of the five years. (Though Im hoping for it to be just a cyst if I ever get tested).",17Jul2020,1
1028,"I'm about to be a senior in college. I'm going to be an RA to save $10,000 in housing costs, but I already had a cat which was not a problem in my last apartment because I have letters and from my physician that I need him, so per my state's laws, they have to allow me to have him.

Well, I went through every single hoop my school's disability support services demanded. Had my physician fill out 16 pages of ridiculous redundant paperwork like they asked, but now they're calling her office saying it's not enough and they need a letter from a therapist too (even though that was not specified once to me). I see a therapist at my school who fully agrees my cat is needed for my anxiety and nightmares, but unfortunately her contract with my university doesn't allow her to make recommendations about ESAs to our housing department/disability support services. 

So now I'm basically fucked. 

I need to have my cat with me or I have panic attacks and literally cannot sleep at night without him. This is all documented in the paperwork provided by my physician, but it's somehow not enough. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm thinking that since I'm going to be the RA that I might be able to get away with just bringing him.... I mean after all, I'm the one doing room checks and such.

But if somehow I get caught, I risk losing my job, housing and consequently being out $10,000, and my mom will disown me. But I *need* my cat. It's just a shitty situation and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please don't berate me - I know a lot of people don't think ESAs are legit, and I was pressured into accepting this job by my mom, I didn't really have a choice. I figured since my physician could fill out all the paperwork they say is needed that it wouldn't be a problem.",17Jul2020,1

But, I don‚Äôt fully know them and therefore do not trust them or have that sort of bond where I know enough about them to be too close sort of thing. We decided to get a house together starting in the next couple months, where I will be the only one in the house doing my dissertation and hopefully graduating next year. One of them works full time while 2 others are retaking their second year, with another mate doing a placement. 

Here‚Äôs my issue. I‚Äôve been really worried that being in an environment where my mates like to rave/party (and take drugs) and mess about is quite prominent, especially when my inability to say no or to completely FOCUS on my studies can vary.

It would really suck to fall behind knowing my track record, but they are genuinely fun people and I would have an amazing time with them all for my last year of being student.

1041,"Throwaway account because my friends know the other one.

I'm currently a college student that receives financial aid to cover everything - housing, food, tuition, etc. When COVID cases rose in March, I went home to stay with my parents since places shut down on campus. My college has settled hybrid courses this fall, and they're letting students take some classes on campus. At the initial announcement, I cancelled my on-campus housing and signed an off-campus lease with some friends. My parents reluctantly approved because it wasn't their money.

But then COVID cases skyrocketed, and then my parents took back their approval. Now I am basically forced to sell my lease and stay home. I admitted (out of fear of getting COVID) that I could take all online classes, and they agreed that I should switch to those. Most of the reason that I say ""forced"" is because I can't drive. They wouldn't let me get a license because of ""car insurance"" in the past and right now road tests are closed. So, it's honestly up to them to let me go, and there is no way that they would let me move in, even with the financial independence. If I told them my classes were on-campus they would let me go.

I haven't left the house for non-essential tasks since March. The other times was to drop off a package, then go to the doctor because I became ill (not COVID). I barely can go outside without getting chastised by my parents, I'm discouraged to exercise, and can't even cook my own food without ridicule. They call me weak and fragile in health for everything, and only use natural remedies that have good intentions but bad execution. A lot of their theories come from allergies that I don't have.

Fortunately, they believe in COVID and they do let me see doctors from time to time, but everytime I go, they treat it like a burden. Like, ""You should have worn a jacket yesterday, that's how you got sick and now we have to spend all this money."" I've been sick for months now with an unknown cold/virus/something that isn't COVID. The doctor referred me to see a specialist, they made me cancel the appointment out of COVID fear and trust in natural remedies.

I also wanted to go back on campus to get personal counseling from SA trauma that I had experienced last year - none of which I can tell my parents about since it involved an ex-boyfriend they would have basically disowned me for dating.

If I don't sell my lease to someone, I would have to pay thousands of dollars to have residence in a place I can't move live in. I'm extremely stressed out about finding someone, and haven't slept well in weeks. Overall, my mental health has plummeted and I've regressed to depression I haven't experienced since I moved out for school.

I have considered about changing some non-essential classes that are on-campus so I can live away from them, but I feel dishonest for lying. On the other hand, I'm concerned about getting COVID and I know that home will prevent me from getting it. What should I do? And if I just end up staying home, how should I cope?",17Jul2020,1

1050,"First of all sorry for my English.

I(m16) broke up with my girlfriend(f16) of almost three years a couple days ago, even though I still love her.
We were in a good relationship, no problem except some differences within perceiving the religion(I don't really believe in anything, she is strongly Christian). I felt that my feelings are a little weaker but it's surely periodical.

Maybe I acted too quickly... but recently I started to 
meet and talk to one of my female friends more frequently, just some friendly meetings with her and her friends, later just with her alone. I didn't really think of her alot until like a week ago. We were texting a lot, and well, I just fell in love... I've tried to check if this is it, but I want her so bad, no matter what.

Well so I got in love with two girls. The reason I broke up with my girlfriend was that my feelings to the other one are so strong, I think it's more of a love than crush/infatuation. I don't know if I wouldn't cheat on her in the future, actually I already did by falling in love with my friend, thinking about how would it be if we were together and so on... I don't know what should I do, I've already hurt my ex, I don't want to cause any more harm.

It was my first relationship, lasting for quite long, and now I can't imagine living without her, she is the best... On the other hand, I crave the other one as much as my now ex-girlfriend. I am undecided, willing to go two mutually exclusive ways, and I feel like I will walk into the wall between them and stay in this state, alone, if I don't decide. But my emotions are fucking me up.

I think of my self as of very immoral and hopeless person, maybe I don't deserve neither of them. I can't help myself, I would beg my girlfriend to come back to me and for forgiveness, because I really miss her and don't want her to be in despair, but it wouldn't change my feelings to my friend.. Recently I have no strength to live normally, the choice is impossible to make for me from my present point of view. Neither way will I be happy. I just live another day and wait for something to end this shit so my problems all disappear (but I'm not suicidal). I act hopeless about it on my own, and I have no one to get advice from.

1052,"Hi r/advice,

So I just learned today that my uncle and aunt are paying a Chinese-American lady under the table for some domestic help. From what I hear, that couple isn't shy at all about why they take cash only. They are underreporting their income to 1) avoid paying taxes and 2) to stay under the threshold to receive welfare. They, apparently, matter-of-factly state that ""it's cash so I don't need to be taxed."" And from what I gather, they sincerely thought so.

They aren't really educated (middle school or high school diploma from China) and barely spoke any English as they immigrated to the US when they're close to retirement age‚Äîso I do think a good percentage of what they are doing is just because they are unaware of the laws here. On the other hand though, underreporting to receive welfare is definitely fraud and there's no reason to expect that it's a cultural difference or language barrier that caused any misunderstanding.

My struggle is that I know even with the apparent welfare fraud they're committing, they are barely surviving on their meagre income. They truly are poor, but they earn a bit more than what they can qualify for welfare‚Äîand without a graduated scale it's either or for them.

What should I do?

For a variety of reasons, my uncle and aunt decided to stop employing them. Would reporting the fraud implicate my uncle and aunt?",17Jul2020,1

1056,"I (24F) am living in a house with 7 others people since 3 years. I move from my home country for my studies and decided to stay there after my graduation.

For an expat it's always tricky to find a new home and friends. A lot of people are coming to this house for only 6 months/1 year. And with 4 of my roommates we are still there after 3 years and don't want to change this.

When I arrived a girl (we are going to call her B - 24F) was living there. B was someone who smoked a lot of weeds, slept during the day, didn't go to school and didn't work. Her parent was paying for everything and she has a angry temperament. But she was always smiling, singing, like a little sunshine in the house. I never had trouble with her before. My roommates call me the ""little mummy"" of the house because I take care of important stuff : new visitors, internet, electricity and other problems that arise.

B moved out after a years because her parents didn't want to support her anymore. They were worried about her and want to shake her up.

2 years later I received a job offer for 6 months in a foreign country (1500 km away). It was quite an opportunity and I was looking for a sublet in order to get back after the 6 months. At that time B was looking to relocate in our town but having little money she could not get a lease right away. She was just beginning a new job in order to be independent. So its seemed perfect for both of us that she would take my room and wait for one of the other roommates to leave before taking a new room &amp; a lease. So she paid nothing (no deposit, no rental assurance) except the rent and moved in. I also gave her my transport pass free of charge (I already paid for it and didn't need it for the next 6 months). She was supposed to stay in my room from February to end of July.

I left for my mission and long story short I was trap there during the covid19. Due to my nationality I was not able to go back to my house and because my family are not in my home country I was not able to go anywhere. I spend 7 weeks all alone in the middle of a forest. It was so lonely, and I didn't see any human being during this period. I don't want to be ungrateful because I was able to go in the forest (and not trap at home with no garden), but not seeing anyone face to face during this period put me in depression.

When I managed to finally coming back to my house I no longer had my room and I made sure to find another accommodation (I wasn't going to fire B because we had an agreement and I was coming back earlier due to Covid - middle of June).

I was sleeping on the couch of my house for two weeks; B regularly come home to see her family and never thought of offering me to borrow her room while she was away. When I asked she didn't answer her phone for several days (but called my other roommates). Or when she was replying she just say ""I don't know when I will be back"" (and left for 4 days). Also she didn't offer to return my transport pass and when I asked her she got angry shouting ""But how I am going to do ? I need it"". She finally gave it back to me.

B refused to talk about the future because she was ""too stressed"". And I made a mistake : I had no room, no job, impossibility to see my family after a way-too-long experience alone so I told her face-to-face that I want to find the best solution for both of us. And if the best solution was for her to stay in my room we could manage to find something. She replied that she want the same for both of us, make best in this difficult time. B also lose her job due to the pandemic. But she didn't do anything and she was excepting me to find her a new lease (call the owner and talk about her for exemple).

I left to another house where I was able to find a room for July and I was thinking I could manage to come back in August as planned before. But B told me I didn't understand our first agreement (before my departure) and I was not supposed to get back before end of August.

Ok, post-covid situation is complicated for everyone so I found an accommodation for August and tell her I will be back in September. And we never talk about the room again. Except she start telling everyone that she was keeping my room. I took some time for myself after this intense loneliness : I felt ungrateful not to enjoy being with people but I was completely unsuitable and I had just found a place where I could sleep (no more fear of not having a bed). And it was very hard to see all my friends and roommates waiting for me to return to my role as a little mom. I was in no condition to listen to their problems and do it the way I used to.

After this time alone I started resenting her as if I had been too nice and she was taking advantage of me.

So today I told her I want my room back at the end of the summer and she just say no. She told me we had an agreement, also that I am a bad person and disrespectful. She also said that I don't have to gave her order (literally: 'give me back my room') and that I had to ""calm down"" because I will not get back 'her' room.

Still today she didn't have a lease for another room and I don't know what to do.

I feel guilty to change my mind but I have the feeling she was taking advantage of the situation and of the fact I was very fragile from my experience. I am the bad person here ?

Ok so like I genuinely am wondering what the purpose of living right now is. Like I know people *always* think that, but I‚Äôm not a typically suicidal person, like I don‚Äôt want to die, I just don‚Äôt want to be me or live the life *I*personally have. But like now there‚Äôs essentially nothing enjoyable about life. In the beginning of the year, my family planned to go to Disneyland for vacation today. Cancelled. We planned to just roadtrip to the New England colleges as a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù vacation. Cancelled. Then, we decided just to go to a beach that‚Äôs a few hours away. Cancelled. I needed to visit the dentist next week. Cancelled. I wanted to go to a lunch with my friends. Nope. My family is not going to concerts, or sports events, or evening dining out anywhere. We haven‚Äôt been inside a restaurant since March and I only go to the store (which I used to really enjoy doing) about once every few weeks.


Don‚Äôt say to get a hobby. That‚Äôs pointless. I have plenty: yoga, running, painting, makeup, etc on top of studying for standardized tests in the fall and working remotely. But what‚Äôs the point of exercising? To stay healthy? Live long for what? To stay at home forever. No one would even be able to come to my fucking funeral except my parents lol. Everyone was on a ‚Äúquarantine glowup‚Äù in the beginning, but what‚Äôs the point now? You‚Äôre not going to see anyone until next year and my fat ass will give up by then. 


Prior to quarantine I found a really good group of people I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with. I still facetime them and stuff, but again if I died what would they do? They already went to that aforementioned lunch without me. If I stopped responding they‚Äôd never know the difference. My parents wouldn‚Äôt want them at my funeral. 


I had a dream about a boy I obsessed over in the school year and I woke up thinking how stupid that was. I was so afraid of like telling him I liked him and now I haven‚Äôt spoken or seen him since March. Like there‚Äôs no point to anything. At all. 


I feel like the purpose of regular life is to just enjoy it and find a way to maximize happiness in whatever way that means to you. All I think about are moments from my regular life prior to March that make me happy and how it will be a damn long time before any of that ever happens again. It doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

1064,"You know how they say that if trouble and hardship seem to follow you everywhere you go, then maybe you're the problem? Well, I have this friend and roommate (who we're going to call Austin) that makes me believe the saying isn't true. He's the type of guy who - if you really know him - you can't help but feel bad for him, because despite his intentions, kindness, and talent, he just never wins in life.

He just lost his job because his boss was illegally shortchanging him, and then they had a ""disagreement"" about it when Austin confronted him. Shortly after, his friends there all ghosted him, due to his now-former boss slandering his name. (The place is a sinking ship and they were all just trying to make it work together, so now it looks like he abandoned them.) I get that this sort of thing happens, but this is only the most recent thing. It's like everywhere he goes, the bridge to get there burns for reasons outside of his control...

We were in a choir together in college, and it was kind of a hostile place to him through no fault of his own. I know this because I'm his friend and in the same room when him when he's socializing, and he's literally harmless - yet the president of our choir spread rumors about him because of some petty love triangle, and they'd go to outings without him. He doesn't even get invited to alumni events even though I do, and he tries not to show when he's upset, but I can kinda tell that he is. What's more, even as talented as he is (this man can really fucking SING I swear to God), you wouldn't know it unless you heard him in the shower, because his public solo performances just go wrong for ridiculous reasons. In his most recent one, the accompanist started his song in the wrong key, and he had to sing it way higher than he was used to. It was not good; his voice cracked loudly in front of the whole audience.

I've seen time and time again how he's dealt a bad hand, but I've never really taken it seriously because we just make fun of him for being really unlucky - until now. Earlier today I overheard him talking to his dog in his room. I thought I heard him saying ""Why do I even bother..?"" and other muffled phrases, but he was clearly depressed.

I've told him that some things just aren't his fault for going wrong, and we try to make him forget these things when we go out. But I think it's really getting to him. I'd hate to tell him he needs to see a therapist, because really there is nothing wrong with him; it's all the shit that life throws at him, and misfortune is just drawn to him.

1067,"I‚Äôm a 21 year old male currently in college. I‚Äôll start out by saying I have a great life. I love my friends and family and come from a privileged middle class household. However, the past three years of my life have felt totally pointless. There have been times where I was happy in the moment but overall when I evaluate where I am I feel awful. I was diagnosed with an attention disorder at around 8 years old but my mom didn‚Äôt want to put me on medication. In high school I was able to work through it, finishing homework at the last second and graduated with As and Bs. I was a three sport athlete and overall a very happy person. So much so that I was voted ‚Äúmost likely to brighten your day‚Äù my senior year. Where as those yearbook accolades mean nothing I was incredibly proud of it and very happy with how proud my parents were of me because of it. College came around and my attention disorder caught up to me and my grades were poor. I ended up dropping out of my university and enrolled in online school as I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life and couldn‚Äôt afford the tuition. I fear that I may be depressed. Two years ago I lost 30 pounds in three months without knowing it because I barely ate. Along with that, I‚Äôve shown other signs of depression with my concentration, low energy, and I feel emotionally numb most of the time. I have trouble admitting to myself that I may have depression as I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù and sad I just don‚Äôt feel much. I know I need to make drastic changes in my life in order to make my parents proud but every time I try I fall into the same bad routines.

1068,So ive visited my dad for 2 months since he is in another country and yesterday we decided to drink together. We had a few beers and then we opened a bottle of vodka. My dad got pretty drunk and went to sleep. I didnt get drunk at all and just went to bed to watch a movie on my phone. Suddenly i heard that my dad had woken up and went outsite. After 20s i got a little bit worried and went to check out on him. When i opened doors i just saw him standing like 1 meter away from our doors to house and asked him what is he doing so late. He said he is PEEING. I was like wtf why dont u pee inside our toilet is like right next to your bedroom. He said that makes sense and just passed me and went inside. I thought he is joking but i saw a pee on the ground. And didnt know what to do. He just peed all over our entrance. He is sleeping right now and i just cant sleep at all. I keep thinking why did he pee there. Should i ask him about it in the morning? Or just act like nothing happened. I swear we are a normal family and he just got scared like i saw his secret lol,17Jul2020,1

I'm a guy in my mid 20's and last year I met this other guy at work and got along real well with him..

long story short, his sister (age 17) began working here, and months later this guy ended up being unjustly fired and I began bonding with his sister.

we initially conversed for the first time about her brother and what happened... then over the next few months had some great conversations and we realized we relate quite a lot.

I suggested we hang out, and she didn't seem eager to... I backed away and yet he continues to approach me and we had our best conversations ironically.

She knows I'm very respectful of boundaries, and I've told her I don't want anyone to feel obligated to talk to me, and more recently I told her that I am going to back away, simply because I don't feel like she reciprocated my feelings or appreciates me..

Usually I'm conscientious and find ways to converse with her, but lately when she saw me and said ""hey"" I just nodded and kept moving.

And since then she has approached me to talk to me at work... we work on opposite ends of the store so she doesn't have to do this.

She's saying hi to me any time she sees me... asking me questions she never used to like asking how I'm doing, how she hasn't seen me in a while, about my living situations, what food i cook etc. She is showing appreciation in ways she hasn't before...

i don't understand why she does this. I can't tell if she's interested or not at this point.",17Jul2020,1

There are a lot of other issues that have led me to this point but trying to date is the thing that has broke the camels back and destroyed my mental health. I am probably not even fit to date anymore at this point, I can‚Äôt even describe with words how much I hate myself. I don‚Äôt hate anyone, for my entire life I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs ever been a person that I‚Äôve hated, but I fucking hate myself and I never realized how much until I tried to date.

I‚Äôve been trying to date for a while now and I‚Äôve taken all the advice I can get, I‚Äôve lost 80 pounds, I‚Äôve bought a car, I have new clothes, I‚Äôve kept a job consistently, I believe I‚Äôm a naturally nice person and I always make people laugh, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôm not good enough. I‚Äôve been on tinder gold, bumble, okcupid, hinge, I‚Äôm on it all and have been since October and I have had 0 dates and probably 10 matches between all of those combined. I‚Äôve had friends help me draft bios, help me take pictures, everything you are supposed to do and yet I have made no progress.

I have never in my entire life had a single person care about me beyond what I can give to them, not my parents, no one. When I was a little kid when other people fantasized about fun stuff I was day dreaming about having a family that loved each other one day, having a wife who I would be best friends with, and now I‚Äôve just accepted that‚Äôs not possible. No girl is going to settle for some ugly fuck with a shitty history degree and no prospects and I don‚Äôt blame them. No way would I want to be involved with me either, I have no upside.

I‚Äôve accepted that it‚Äôs my fault, everything has been. When I think back to all the times I was sad because I had no one who cared about me or when people would put me down I realize that out of all of my life experiences I am the common denominator; all of these people from different walks of life and even different parts of the world decided independently when I put myself out there to be a friend or whatever the case may be that I wasn‚Äôt worth their time. It‚Äôs my fault. I don‚Äôt know what about me is off putting but it is my fault and I spend every day in agony hating and hurting myself for it. I just want my life to be over, I am not strong enough to live like this every day knowing that I am never going to be good enough for someone to love me.

I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship anymore and no girl deserves to deal with my bullshit. I don‚Äôt know what advice I‚Äôm seeking or what I‚Äôm doing here, there‚Äôs no one I can tell this to in my life and I just need for someone to know. Any advice on this train wreck would be appreciated, thanks.",17Jul2020,1

1076,"Hi reddit, 
I (21F) recently ended an extremely toxic 16 year long friendship with my best friend. The ending of our friendship was the final straw and really showed me how toxic our relationship was. I can admit to being extremely codependent and easily manipulated by this person. We had terrible fights over the years but I always did anything I could to rekindle our friendship because to have her as a friend was much better than ‚Äúan enemy‚Äù. I don‚Äôt view any of my old friends as enemies just people who served a purpose in my life and no longer do now, she does not share this view and has tried to hurt everyone who left her life. She‚Äôs very malicious by nature and in the past threatened to ruin my life while we weren‚Äôt friends. I was young at that time and now I‚Äôm old enough to understand she can‚Äôt ‚Äúruin my life‚Äù but I do find myself getting really intense anxiety knowing she knows more about me than anyone else and knows things that are very personal and private and the idea of her sharing them sends me into a panic attack. Although she‚Äôs not in my life I‚Äôm so cautious to not post anything to upset her or post pictures showing I‚Äôm enjoying myself because I truly think it would send her into a mean streak of trying to hurt me. Like I said I‚Äôm very easily manipulated by this individual and she knows how and where to hurt me. I feel sad because I ended this friendship to better my mental state and I find myself still feeling controlled by her. Some of you may be thinking why were you even in a friendship like this? it was not all bad and we went through immense trauma as children together and that made our bond no matter how toxic extremely hard to break.

The last time we met was three weeks ago , we took me to a party introduced  to everyone we had such amazing time and spent all day together . He was all over me .

Anyways , I ended up falling for him but lately he was kind of pulling back hard .
I told him that I fell for him and asked to go on a date and he confessed that he‚Äôs back with his ex and he is really sorry .  
She literally never left him alone , she kept calling every day etc. Begging to get together .

At the same time every employee is walking out of my job due to awful management and I plan to also. They cut our stores total hours and added about two hours worth of new duties per shift that no one can handle while also slashing our yearly pay increases. The amount I'm being payed currently is not enough to support myself anyways. On top of everything my car is having transmission issues. I paid a mechanic 1300 to replace it and it was replaced with another bad transmission. Took it back to him and told him it was still broken and he told me to leave it and he would look at it. He let it sit in the parking lot for two months without touching it. He lied and said he did not knowing I live a block away from him and could see that he was not working on it.

So I (16F) have been friends with this guy (16m) for a while now. i (unfortunately/fortunately) caught feelings. it‚Äôs important to note that i have severe anxiety, so admitting my feelings took a lot of guts from me, but i did do so over text which wasn‚Äôt the best idea. I‚Äôm going to sum up the conversation below (this took place in march before covid)

me: hey, i need to talk to you about something but i‚Äôm afraid if i do you won‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. 

him: op, you can tell me anything

me: okay well, i like you and have for a little while now. i didn‚Äôt want to seem like i was being distant or didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore so i felt like i needed to tell you before anything happened. 

him: it‚Äôs understandable why you feel like that. i hope we can still be friends, but i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm in the right headspace for a relationship right now, especially with (shared activity)

me: i totally understand that and i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm quite ready myself (another tragic mistake)

him: it‚Äôs ok. i already kind of knew

me: i‚Äôm sure it was easy to figure out. please don‚Äôt feel like you have to say it‚Äôs because of our (shared activity). i already knew you didn‚Äôt feel the same way, and that‚Äôs ok too. we‚Äôre still going to be good friends (uh oh)

him: it‚Äôs not because of (shared activity) at all. i‚Äôm just dealing with a lot right now and don‚Äôt feel mentally ready to be there yet 

me: i had no idea, i hope everything is okay. your mental health is far more important than my feelings towards you. 

i‚Äôm going to end the summary of texts there. he clearly doesn‚Äôt want to date, and i understand that. as i mentioned, i have severe anxiety as well as adhd and have previously dealt with depression. these factors make me hyper-fixate on things and read to deeply and worry easily. 

my question is, do you guys really think he does have some type of feelings towards me? i know he doesn‚Äôt want to date, but is it possible feelings are there? 

i also feel like i should mention that the texts i summarize are from march. as our covid restrictions have lifted, we‚Äôve seen each other more. last month, he opened up to me (i‚Äôm the only person he has told) about his personal and mental health issues. i had no idea. he also talks to me lots, and knowing i struggle with anxiety, constantly reaches out and tries to find resources to send my way to help cope with these things. he makes an effort to talk to me all the time. 

to wrap things up, i don‚Äôt think he likes me romantically, but several people think he does. i don‚Äôt want to ask him, especially knowing all of the things he is currently dealing with. i just want to know if it seems like the feelings are there, and what i should do next.

Maybe this whole music think is a bit too risky and, at this point, I should be having better opportunities. I‚Äôve always told myself not to compare myself to people in other career fields because things are just different. I guess my main issue he is that I know people will look down on me for working in this industry. I‚Äôve already have people brush it off as something stupid and naive and seeing so many of my old friends pursue different careers (seriously a TON in finance and banking) I cant help feel that I might have shot myself in the foot. 

Has anybody been in a similar boat as me and come out the other end? How do you deal with being scared of wanting a certain career that is risky?",17Jul2020,1
1099,"I honestly hoped that they would not call me back, I bombed the whole thing, it was just terrible, I get a call back and they want to set up another one, should I go?

1101,"I (2X Female)come a Muslim family. I took weed to sleep a couple hours after having multiple energy drinks. I know. I didn‚Äôt realize it at that time but I thought the caffeine had worn off. I started tripping...hard. I have bouts (when I‚Äôm not high) where I sometimes don‚Äôt feel real but into lasts for a couple minutes but now I felt stuck in that ‚Äúrealm‚Äù for days while in real life moments had only passed. Everything felt unreal. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I felt like I knew I was dying. I weirdly walked to the living room and started calling 911 while my family was just going about their day. I was so far gone. Confessing and crying, telling everyone to say nice things at my funeral. My whole family was losing their shit. The EMS arrived and they kept yelling at me asking me what I took and telling my mom to step back cause I took drugs. My mom started telling calling me dirty and garbage. I haven‚Äôt been the best child to my parents. Most of biggest family problems are either directly or indirectly related to me. I tried hard to listen to the EMS but my mind was telling me I was fake and this wasn‚Äôt real and seeing my mom. Somehow I got in the ambulance idek what happened. The EMS people were rude. I know they were trying to save my life but they kept talking to me like I was wasting their time. I could hear them talking about me. I told them I ate edible chocolates but they kept asking how much gummies I ate? I literally felt like I was dying and my chest was so tight, I just knew I was gonna die. After that everything was a blur. I stayed at the hospital overnight literally trying to remember how to breathe. I got released the next afternoon and I felt like I should‚Äôve died in the hospital cause the humiliation of of facing my family. My mom began saying we have to talk about it and saying her and my father beed to have a talk with me. I couldn‚Äôt breathe again. I wanted the earth to swallow me. I‚Äôve tried so hard to stop being the family f***k up and sit there and listen to my parents say how much I disappointed them and that I‚Äôm still a child cause I clearly don‚Äôt learn from my mistakes. I honestly have no one to talk to. Pls any advice?",17Jul2020,1
1102,"I (18F) am going to make this quick, but basically my sisters and me (four of us in total, two under 18) are spending the summer with my narcissistic, abusive dad. Ordinarily, we live on the other side of the country with my mom, but felt comfortable enough to spend the summer with Dad. There haven‚Äôt been any incidents of abuse and we‚Äôve had a great summer. But my mom just called me in tears and asked if she should worry about us not coming home. Apparently my dad‚Äôs been making comments to the youngest two (16 and 13) about how easy it would be to get their hobbies and stuff set up in his state. Comments like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got some great swimming teachers out here‚Äù and ‚Äúyou know there‚Äôs a ballet studio right down the street?‚Äù And since everything with Dad is basically super-fun vacation mode 24/7, my mom is now terrified that we won‚Äôt want to come back at the end of the summer and that we‚Äôll just choose to live with Dad. Legally, only me and my twin sister could do that, since we‚Äôre the ones over 18, but she‚Äôs still worried. I don‚Äôt believe any one of us would choose to live permanently with Dad, and I told her that, but I don‚Äôt think my reassurances were enough. She‚Äôs very afraid of Dad taking us away from her somehow, since she‚Äôs lost a lot to him and basically custody of us is the only thing he hasn‚Äôt taken from her. It makes me sick to my stomach to think of her sitting alone at home all month, scared to death that we won‚Äôt come back, but I don‚Äôt know what to say to comfort her. Any advice would be appreciated.",17Jul2020,1

1104,"My father (56), a govt employee, has been using a live streaming app called Meme Live since January. I just discovered that he spent around ‚Çπ18k this month to gift broadcasters which is enough to blow me. I've seen he talks to a lot of female broadcasters so often which seems like they're flexing on his money. It's really concerning for me to see his addiction. 

Now I can't just go and bluntly confront him as I've not had good relations and he's harsh to me. I don't understand what's driving him in that egregious app. I was super fine when he used to spend time on tiktok but since it got banned, it diverted him entirely to meme live.

1106,"This post is going to be long but detailed. I posted this in AITA before but chickened out and deleted it. This is real, this is my life... I truly wish it wasn‚Äôt. I (26F) started dating my fianc√© ‚ÄúH‚Äù 3 years ago. My problem is my brother‚Äôs gf ‚ÄúD‚Äù (30F). We all worked at the same job at the time. Once I started dating ‚ÄúH‚Äù I started hearing of a girl by the name of ‚ÄúD‚Äù talking crap about me. I was surprised by this as I have never spoken to ‚ÄúD‚Äù before. I ignore her. I find out she is mad because ‚ÄúH‚Äù stopped talking to her and ended up dating me. I realize that has nothing to do with me and move on. 

A couple months later my brother(22M) asks me about a girl named ‚ÄúD‚Äù as she randomly started messaging him. I told him about the problems she was causing with me and that she was no good. I asked him not to bring her to the house (parents house). He promised me he wouldn‚Äôt. A couple months go by, I find out he has been secretly dating her. It took another turn when he started sneaking her into the house. Once ‚ÄúD‚Äùfound out ‚ÄúH‚Äù would stay at my house often she insisted on coming over (creepy). Around this time ‚ÄúD‚Äù started causing more problems with me at work. I confronted my brother about bringing her over and how uncomfortable it was that ‚ÄúD‚Äù acts like one person towards him but is being a manipulative, vindictive person at work. I asked, again, for him to not bring her over or I was going to move out. I brought this to my parent‚Äôs attention to which they did absolutely nothing. He told me he would limit the times she was allowed over. He continued and I guess mentioned/confronted her in which she started more crap at work. She would talk crap about me, my parents house, my fianc√©, and my family. 

This went back and forth until I threatened to contact HR about her behavior. She quit the job. Months later there was a huge blowout at the house because my family came home to her walking around the house butt naked. I told my brother to tell her to put some clothes on as that‚Äôs extremely inappropriate and once he told her, she started *screaming* about me, my parents, the house. I couldn‚Äôt believe the lies she was concocting. She told my brother I harass her (I have never spoken to her) and that I bully her. She told my brother she was leaving because ‚Äúhas your sister not seen an ass and some tits before‚Äù. My brother offered to sit all 4 of us down (Me, him, H, and D) to settle this stuff once and for all, and she refused claiming she (30F) was to old for that. A couple of days later he apologized but the apology was only valid if I apologized to ‚ÄúD‚Äù. I said absolutely not for the disrespect and hell she keeps trying to put me through. 

Fast forward, fianc√© and I ended up moving out. I am a full time student that wanted to stay at my parents until I graduate so this created a whole other dilemma for me. My parents didn‚Äôt intervene with anything because they felt if they said something that my brother would leave and never return. I made it very clear that I had to move out because they refused to speak up on someone harassing me and allowing them to come into my home comfortably. I hold resentment over it as she is still at my parent‚Äôs house very often. I‚Äôve spoken about how hurt I am that they have never said anything. The only reasoning they have done with me is that when I go to visit over there she is not allowed over. 

Their rental is now over and they bought a house closing in a couple months. They need a place to stay and of all places to stay my mom decides she wants to get in at the complex I stay (35 mins from her house in a different state). This would mean my brothers would come too and the gf would now know where I live and be staying here. I feel like if I say no to my mom it‚Äôs now going to start a fight. 

I need advice on the entire thing.",17Jul2020,1

1108,"am I being too much as a girlfriend???

I just want to ask if i am being completely irrational or are my feelings valid? not gonna lie, sometimes i feel like I need a therapist

So anyway. my boyfriend and i have been together for nearly 2 years but most of it is long distance. (We will reunite in September). we are still doing long distance. but a lot of times i feel like i am way down his priority list. obviously I don‚Äôt expect anyone to put me at the top of their list. but i feel like i am just in the background of his life you know? don‚Äôt get me wrong, he is an amazing person and boyfriend apart from this. but it really really really hurts me. i try and have been trying sooo hard to not let it affect me because it sounds silly but it‚Äôs so difficult. sometimes it hurts me too much that i have suicidal thoughts. now, those feelings normally go away but it bothers me that they‚Äôre there in the first place. 

i do have hobbies and i do do and love doing things on my own. but i feel i can sometimes be so clingy. we text throughout the day but not much maybe 3x, depending on the day. but i always expect a call at night. and I‚Äôve said that to him at the beginning when we started to do long distance. he said that was okay, i would‚Äôve compromised but he said it‚Äôs ok. then last night he said to me ‚Äúugh you are so obsessed with me!‚Äù now he was a little stressed because of something so I understood him. but all day today, every time I would think about it i would just want to cry? Lol. he has said other things before that would indicate that he doesn‚Äôt really like talking to me that much. idk, i probably sound so psychotic. 

then just today i was waiting for a call/text and he called me really late because he went out drinking. that is totally okay with me!! but i was sad and hurt that he didn‚Äôt care enough to let me know that he went there. he said sorry though.. he said he meant to let me know but he forgot because he was drinking. i have felt like this a couple of times throughout our relationship, to be honest.. but think I am just a paranoid and jealous person. I don‚Äôt know

am I expecting too much from him? like, is this too trivial to be getting upset over?",17Jul2020,1

1112,"I‚Äôm a 21 year old man from out of town working a government internship in DC.

They definitely pushed it to the side, made light of the situation, and even blamed it on me. All the while, it was pretty traumatic for me and I no longer feel safe in this city.

1116,"i just heard that its a sign of a psychopath/future serial killer if you kill bugs and small animals. im 15 and up until like 13 or maybe even 14 i would catch frogs with my siblings and hit them with sticks and spray them with water. i thought they were disgusting and i didn't want them in the yard. we also used to drown ant hills and any other annoying thing in the yard. 

ive since realized its wrong to kill frogs because theyre minding their own business. but bugs on the other hand are so annoying and i think its ?funny? to kill them. i dont really think its funny i guess but i dont like them so we throw rocks at flying bugs and step on other ones. sometimes if we're roasting marshmellows we light ants on fire if they get close to us. i dont really know if its wrong, but im scared we're psychopaths or something now. i dont really enjoy the fact that things are dying and i would never kill anything like my kitties or dogs, i just absolutely hate bugs so its entertaining when a bug that's bothering me is killed. 

could i really be a psychopath? and what about my siblings?",17Jul2020,1
