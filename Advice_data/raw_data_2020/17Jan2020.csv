1,So I'm a basic bitch college student and I've never been to an actual party. Despite my floor having them somewhat consistently and me being directly invited to join in my brain always turns off and I decline. I like my flatmates and would be totally down to join but I panic before it goes any further. Looking for a way to get over myself and just join in.,17Jan2020,1
2,"Alright so I'm in college. I'm a guy 21yrs old. never had a gf and still a virgin. anyways theres this pretty girl i always make eye contact but I'm always the first to break it. I want to talk to her but nerves, and i feel after all the awkward eye contact she probably thinks I'm weird. For someone reason I have this habit of getting a crush but I avoid them lmaoooowtfiswrongwithmeoooo. Anyone else ever been like this? If so how did you get out of it?",17Jan2020,1
3,"Please like honestly please if you can please DM me. My family is struggling a lot with my brother and his OCD. Every night he screams and yells at my mum and ive posted dozens of times but tonight was the worst. My sister had enough and interrupted him while he was yelling (which only ever worsens things the best thing to do is to wait for it to end but sometimes it takes hours and she couldn’t handle hearing my mum being attacked verbally) and told him to shit up before she called the cops. I begged her to come back into her room (I was with her during the fight because I was scared) and she did. She then went into her bathroom and cried. I went in and she got up and said she’s leaving to go to her boyfriends and asked if I wanted to go. I said no and she continued packing. I just froze in place and stared blankly before crawling into bed and she hugged me said she loved me and she’s sorry but she doesn’t want to stay in the house anymore otherwise she might hurt my brother. And she left quietly. My brother saw her and went and told my mum and my mum panicked. Got upset and rang my sister and asked her why she left. She explained I assume and my mum hung up and I heard her sob a bit before throwing her phone. Now my brother is sleeping downstairs and my mum is probably crying in her room. I just fucking need someone to speak to because I’m so fucking terrified for everyone in my family. So please, if you can please DM me.",17Jan2020,1
4,"I dated my ex from September 2018 to June 2019. He moved countries in February 2019 and I travelled to see him in May 2019. 
When we hung out, it wasn’t like a relationship. Since he would just come over late night, have sex and then go. However, he wouldn’t allow me to go out in the day, because he wanted to see me, but wouldn’t meet until night time. So my day felt wasted. 
I even explained to him, I didn’t like it. Because I felt I had no self worth and just felt like a slut. He said he wouldn’t do it. But he kept continuing.
I felt very much hurt and disrespected. So I end the relationship. 
He apologised a lot, but I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. He then said to me, he wants to still be friends and wanted me to stay in his life, because he still cares about me. We stayed friends and he travelled back to my country (that was planned before the break up/he bought the tickets).
We hung out. But he also did his own things too. (Because it was his holiday). Anyway, cut to the last few days of his holidays, we are at my house, talking and sitting (mind you I showed no interest in wanting anything more but a friendship). He then suddenly kissed me, I was taken back and commented jokingly “I guess you still like me then”
He responds “Like you? I don’t even love you. I’m just horny”. 
I slap him, and tell him what is wrong with him. He then tells me, he was angry that I broke up with him (I broke up with almost 2 months before this occurred).
I asked him why didn’t he say something before if he was upset, and he told me he didn’t know what to say. He apologised and things were normal.
He went back to his country in the middle of August and we still text daily. He even requested I send at least 3 messages to him a day, and he do the same. 
I did and so did he. 
Cut to October, he starts becoming distance and I ask him what’s up. He explains he will be busy with university and will text me in 10 days. I’m like fine. 
10 days go past and I get nothing from him, but I leave it. Then I message him. 
He explained what was going on and I understood. We continued to talk, but after that, each time we talked, he would start an argument and become rude.  I told him to not be rude, because I don’t like it. He apologised.
Cut to November, he said he would say happy birthday to me when my birthday came. He never did, so I said to him “oh thank you for wishing me happy birthday”
He says “I was going to wait until 9 am there to send a happy birthday” (we have an 8 hour difference, he’s a head)
I said “well you could have wish me a happy birthday anytime”
He then responses “Actually, I wasn’t going to send you a happy birthday, because I wanted to hurt you”
I just ignored him, because I didn’t want my birthday to be ruined. After my birthday I had a couple misses calls from him and fifteen messages, the first half of those messages were rude to me and the other half were saying “I shouldn’t have said that”.
I said it fines and we were talking normally. 
I didn’t talk to him for a few days, and so I sent him a message saying hope things go well, good luck on your exams.
Normally, he would say thank you. 
But he just read it and ignored. So I asked him, what I did wrong. 
He then said this to me “I don’t know what to say to you anymore. Because you always start arguments with me”, even though I never did. He starts being horrible to me, but I’m still being nice and then he goes “Maybe I’m just being a dick because this semester is so difficult on me”. I told him I would message him after the semester is over and he was like “thank you, I’m really sorry for being dick. I want to buy you dinner and hang out again sometime”.
We stopped messaging, I sent him a merry Christmas message over the Christmas holiday. 
He did the same. 
I texted him recently, because his semester is over. But now he has just ghosted me. 
So, why did he put me through all that, begged me to stay in his life and then just become a massive dick.

7,"hi hello I just made an account so I could get some advice anonymously. I hate bugging my friends and family because I don’t want to seem like I’m just guilt tripping, but since dropping out I had to move back in with my parents and they want me looking for a full time job. I told them I would like to start with part time so that I could still have time to work on building an art portfolio. My mom told me that she isn’t going to let me do part time unless it’s two jobs. 

I know that this shouldn’t be something to freak out over, but the idea of having to work full time and make art after just failing out of school terrifies me. It gets me spiraling, jumping from “oh god I have to find work” to “I’ll never be paid enough to support myself, there’s no future for me, I’ll never be a successful illustrator, there’s no future for the planet either, I should just kill myself”

My mental health has never been great but anxiety has gotten worse over the last 6 months and it feels like I’m spiraling back into my old high school mind.

I feel extremely childish for jumping all over the place and reacting like I am, but I feel like if I’m not given time to heal, design my work, and make more content then I’ll be miserable and suicidal like I was in high school.

8,"Hello, I hope this is an appropriate place for me to ask this question. 

I graduated from college in May of 2019. Afterwards, I applied to every relevant job that I saw. After over a month of applying, I finally got an interview scheduled, and was hired as a part- time worker at a community college in my town. The job is fine (aside from a pretty condescending supervisor, which I can tolerate 9/10 days). The pay is okay. However, I need a full-time job and they are not able to offer me that. I am 23 and I don't want to live with my parents any longer, and can't change that without a higher income.

Recently, a full- time job opened up at the university where I got my degree. Based on the job description, I was very interested. So, I applied and was granted an interview (which was today). I got a call a few hours later offering me the position. I was incredibly excited about this; for the first time, I will be making enough to live on my own and I will get benefits. When they offered the job, they asked that I start on February 3rd, which I agreed to.

The problem is that I think this means I would only be able to give my current employer a weeks notice. I had thought starting February 3rd would give me enough time for the 2 weeks, but I made a mistake. I work Monday- Wednesday each week. This Monday, the college is closed. On Tuesday, I will be working really late because we have a very important event. Originally I had thought that I would wait until Wednesday to give my resignation, because my boss is prone to panicking during these events. I do a lot in my position, and I know it will be really hard on them to be without me before they can find a replacement. So I fear that if I tell her the day of the event, she will have a meltdown.

However, If I tell her on Wednesday (The 22nd), that will only leave 3 more work days (27th, 28th, and 29th) before I am done. I feel like this is crappy of me to do, but I am unsure what would be a better alternative. Should I tell her the day of the event? Should I call tomorrow? Should I just tell her Wednesday? Should I ask the new supervisor if I can start a week later I am truly freaking out about this. I hate confrontation and I have never quit a ""real"" job before. I could really use some advice.",17Jan2020,1
9,"Throwaway because why not...

I am currently a senior in high school and I work two part time jobs. I live with my dad (48) and my younger sisters. (16 &amp;13). The problem I have is the cleaning by which I mean that I usually do all the cooking and cleaning. The only thing I don't do is laundry which even then I have to take out clothes from the washing machine and either hang them up or put them in the dryer. 

Although I used to not mind about doing these things it has been dragging me down lately. I always end up cleaning and it is making spiral out of control. My room has been getting messy and my grades have been dropping. I feel miserable and unloved sometimes because of it. Everytime I stop cleaning in protest my dad ends up getting mad at all of us so I usually end up caving in. 

I tried explaining it to both him and my sister that it stresses me out. My dad's response is ""well don't assume that someone else is going to do it"" my sisters just laugh at me and say ""it is not that deep"" I don't know what I should do at this point. So how should I deal with this reddit?",17Jan2020,1
10,"Context:
This is my first uni year and it's registration day. I know no one and i walk confused around the campus until someone points me to a long queue. Bored waiting I start talking to this girl next to me. We started to get along and we stuck together by the end of the tour. I started to like her and I thought that I might have a chance so I asked her to go on a walk with me, to get to know each other better. So we spent like 1-2 hours talking, it was really fun and I started to like her a lot and she seems kinda into me too. Next day I texted her and she took a while to respond ( maybe a day). So my insecure ass did the worst thing ever and asked her if she didn't want to talk to me anymore because she took so long to respond. She kept responding hard and it didn't take me long to get bored so I didn't say anything anymore... Now I know she was probably busy setting up and accommodating to uni.

She is in my class too ( we don't study the same thing but we share most of our classes) so I see her a lot. First 2 weeks ( about 1 week after we met) I didn't want to talk to her thinking that I messed up so whenever we saw each other we just smiled and walked away. After a bit we acted like we never met and to me it was sort of ok. This was 3 months ago and I never stopped liking her but was never in a position to talk to her again.  Now that I'm finally settled and feel good around my friends and I got my life I  order I feel confident. At this point it's not like I can't talk to her I just want to know if I should and how to. It seems kinda weird to start talking again  after all this time. Also I can't really find an opportunity to talk. In class seems inappropriate as she seems to be very into them so I don't want to bother and we can't have projects together because we don't study the same thing. Any opinions?",17Jan2020,1

so i recently went through an extremely painful breakup, so painful that i’ve been crying myself to sleep every day for almost two weeks. i feel hopeless and worthless and i don’t want to get up or do anything. 

i feel like i may have depression and i want to see a therapist about it. the only problem is i have overbearing parents (i’m 16 so i’m still in their custody) and they tend to want to know everything about me even if i’d like to keep things private. they also like to freak out about small things.

13,"A few weeks ago a guy approached me and since I was lost, I asked him for directions. He then asked for my number and so on. I usually don't give my number away that easily, but a friend of mine actually told me to take some risks a day before. So I thought this was the risk I should take....bad idea. When we planned on having a date he basically tried to lure me into his home. I didn't feel comfortable and left before meeting him. Afterwards I found out (through Youtube) that he's a well known ""pick up artist"" and uploads everything he does, to ""coach"" others. This makes me feel disgusting. To think that he tries this with so many girls. He's lying to us (he was clearly lying to get me to go to his place) and this feels like borderline rape.

14,"I live in Canada and I've always been very driven and independent: started working when I was 14/15, pay for my own tuition, bills, purchased my own car, etc. I've gone to university to study to become a high school teacher, but after about 3 years, I decided it wasn't quite right for me and didn't want to spend more money. I took a huge risk and dropped school to go into hairdressing. Now, after about 2 years of doing hair and already having left working at a high end salon to work from home, I'm starting to question whether this is the career I want to do as well. Don't get me wrong, I love doing hair and it's a great career, but I feel like I might be happier just doing a regular office job with more stability, career advancement, extended benefits, etc. I'm honestly super open to any job as well as long as it's not some dead end job, however, I'm not really into having to pay tuition and go back to school for it unless it's a 1 year course or something.

Should I push through with hairdressing a little more to truly get a better idea of what the job entails or find another career? And if so, which career or company would be a good option to look into?

15,"I am a 23 year old female with a past I’m not so proud of. At 16-17, I was experimenting with drugs, 18-19 I got involved in some pretty heavy stuff, was into casual sex, etc. I completely changed my life around, I’ve got good things going for me and don’t like to bring up my past because I am embarrassed and that is not me anymore, whatsoever. I recently just got a new job, a really good one, and am in school to pursue my career which goes hand-in-hand, actually, with the job I just got. Anyway, I met another girl that just got hired and we hit it off in training. I realized that I know her husband, and it is from the dark times of my life — we did drugs together and slept together. I haven’t told her that I know him, and not sure if I should. For one, because I don’t want her to dislike me, and two, I don’t want to explain my past to her and bring that into the new job for her to potentially tell everyone I work with.

She’s shown me pics of him and I didn’t say I knew him or anything, and she already asked to exchange numbers, I’m afraid if we become friends on Facebook or something it will come out that he and I know each other, and I will come across as a liar. Do I tell her he and I know each other from those days and keep out the sleeping together part? If so, I’m sure she will ask him or bring it up and I’m sure he would refrain from saying we slept together, but if he did, I feel like that could potentially strike her the wrong way and cause drama at my job.

17,"I don’t know if I’m judgmental, or just picky.  But if a person shows interest in me 90% of the time I don’t like them back.  I hate feeling this way, but I just don’t think that we are compatible.  I’ve thought a lot about this,  it is not a superiority thing, or even a “bored by the other person” thing.   I’ve been sort of alone for most of my life, I’ve always had friends but I’ve always felt alone.  When in a relationship with these people,  I am unable to have a fulfilling conversation and often wind up listening to them vent.  I should mention that I do live in a small town. 

When I do meet people I like, I can not be me on spot.  While conversing with these great people I’ve  always felt unable to carry on conversation or unsure of how to react to their stories.  I don’t laugh usually, unless watching a stand up or a comedy show.  So much so, that people mention it.  I guess I don’t convey feeling much at all.   This makes me feel guilty, for not making the other person feel good.   I usually don’t know what to say or how to react, so I laugh, smile, and nod.   

It really shocks me when people want me around, I barely ever talk.  In fact, I speak better to a group of people versus one person.  Sometimes I’m funny or witty,  other times jokes go over people’s heads.  I’m unaware of the current goings-on, I’m clueless when it comes to memes,  I’m off all social media except Reddit,  so really I know nothing and am completely unaware.   I can tell you random information and compare everything to some movie/show/book or any other media I’ve consumed recently.

We had a few good years but quite suddenly I became complacent. I felt I was too young to be in such a serious relationship and I broke up with him. I kinda knew then that it was a bad decision, but the urge to see ""what else is out there"" was too strong.

Shortly after we broke up he went traveling for a long time. He met someone, they fell in love, they got engaged. I met them her, they are great together, he truly loves her. She is now part of the family that I once considered my own. The only family I ever had but left.

Recently I have come to realize that I have stumbled from one bad decision to the next ever since I ended us. I had horrible relationships, deep depressive episodes, moved from one place to the next in hope of finding something that isn't there. 
Looking back it kills me to know where it all went wrong and not being able to go back and fix it. I don't know how to live with my guilt and thinking that my life has been a complete waste and that I ruined everything.

We always talked about how lucky we were that he was so easy to train and live with. We recently adopted a rescue dog from a shelter because we thought he would like another dog to hang out with. Once we adopted our new dog, our things started getting chewed up, like shoes, clothes, etc. We thought maybe it was the new dog adjusting to our home. So we gave it some time. Then more things started getting chewed up. Tools, furniture. Expensive things. We still assumed it was our new dog, since our lab never acted this way, and secluded the dogs to an empty room with dog toys in it while we're at work. NOW. In the last WEEK. Come to find out, it's our lab! And not only were we shocked by that, but we are also shocked that in the last three days our dog has torn down all of the blinds in the ""dog room,"" busted through the window and was wandering around down the street when we came home, and ripped up the carpet. What is going on with him? I assume he's pissed we adopted this other dog, but it's been four months now and rather than adjusting he's only getting worse. We crated him as a puppy and so we did that today--he bent the bars on the cage and caught his ear on one of them, cutting it. If we leave him out, he will destroy our house.

I was hyped and all but she stopped answering my texts again :( Now I don't know how to approach this girl, I know she is not active in any social media, but that's the only way I have to contact her.

29,"I'll make this short.

So basically, I've always had friends everywhere I go, but it has never been the case that those friends ever want to text me back or even hangout. It's always me asking them upfront every time. At school, it's the same story. I have a group of friends I hang out with, but outside of school nobody from the group (or even outside it) ever calls me upfront and wants to hang out with me. 

I'd say my personality is mediocre. At school, I laugh a lot (idk if it gets annoying) and love to joke around a lot. When I hang out with friends, we are always all joking around, but they often tell me in a very joking way (yes I am sure) to 'stfu' and they often don't actually listen when I talk seriously. I doubt it's their problem because they treat one another seriously when they talk seriously. 

However, this is just a mere observation, but after my anatomy class, I am **always** the one to say 'bye have a nice day' to my teacher and he would always respond. For context, he is an extremely serious and kind of narcissistic guy and doesn't say bye to anyone unless they say it to him. But today, many people in my class, like usual, were saying bye to him, when I decided to just walk past my teacher and not say goodbye (partially because I forgot and the other half because I didn't feel like it) and he immediately said 'bye u/midnightxmas'. That might not seem like much, but a weeks ago too, I was sitting next to one of my friends/anatomy lab partner. I am usually joking around a lot with him and he does too but not as much as me. He is one of the people that doesn't take me that seriously and tells me to 'stfu' a lot just as a joke too when I am talking seriously. But that day (a weeks back), I was experimenting with how people would respond if I changed my personality a bit, so the entirety of class I kept my mouth shut for most of the time and didn't joke much. When he would joke, I would sometimes not even laugh and maybe just gave a smirk or two. So does being a bit meaner give you respect, or how can I change my personality and get my everyone to respect me and wanna always talk/be around me?",17Jan2020,1
30,"I broke up with him last summer and have regretted it every day since. It was purely me. I broke up because I felt I was wasting my time with him, I just didn't know what to do when we were together. (In hindsight, it was completely salvageable, I might have just needed a break!)

I am a hardcore introvert, much better at entertaining myself than others. I hardly even hang out with friends. We talked about it, he said it was ok, but I was afraid he was quietly upset. I get busy, and I was regularly only spending a few hours a week at most with him. It was perfect for a time. We never fought, stayed strong for a year. But I guess I lost interest. We've got a lot common like gaming and movie addictions, but you can only do that for so long. I convinced myself I could get my time back, and have no stress about the relationship if we were just friends. 

I've been terrified to talk about it. My plan was to start hanging out more and bridge the gap I made in my stupidity, but time just flies and weeks go by without me doing anything. I get really depressed thinking about it. I worry I'm running out of time. I'm leaving the state in fall. I decided I'd like to get back together before then, but I can't do long distance. (I can't keep an online conversation going for longer than five minutes.) And that worries me too, because talking about the future together was another thing that scared me away.

How can I get over my introverted-ness, and get the courage to actually ask him if he wants to get back together? He may say no, but I'd kick myself if I didn't ask before it's too late.",17Jan2020,1

I'm still living with my mom, I just graduated, and with my situation I'll be out of her house in less than a year, so there's no point in moving out, not that I can anyways because I'm in college. Anyways, I'm with my mom. If I order them online, I need the box to not show they are cigarettes. I know there are sites you can order cigarettes, but does anyone know of any that are reliable and don't send the cigarettes in boxes that make it obvious cigarettes in the box? Like, I need my stuff sent to me in a plain box and I have no way of knowing if that's what they'll send. 

Will these sites check my ID? And if they do, can I use someone else's ID and still use my debit/credit card?

35,"Honesty in this context majorly on job applications and such. I'm a grad student, and today I had an interview for a part-time job. The job entailed quite some physical labor and a long-term commitment, neither of which I could commit to the employer. So I turned down the job saying that I won't be able to live up to your expectations (I was hoping for more of a simple office aide position). My friend went in after me, and took the job. I'm not sure if he will be able to commit to the job, but he's game. 

The interviewers told me that they appreciated my honesty, for they've had multiple students claim to commit during the interview and then not deliver. Most of them quit unceremoniously once their SSN got processed. My friend said that dishonesty is just fact of life. But in my book, as far as any kind of work is concerned, I do not like to be dishonest. I never commit something unless I'm sure of it. Does that make me weak/naive?

Seriously, put me under a little bit of pressure and I'll disassociate for hours.

39,"Some backstory: No, I don’t live in the US and me and my mother can afford my college tuition without any help from the banks. (In my country it costs around $1.3k/year)

I knew this was going to happen before I even started it, but now I really can’t stand it.

I’m currently studying economics at college (Finance, Insurance, Banking, and Stock Exchange) and I don’t feel like this subject is for me. Before college I went to a high school which specializes in Economics, so right now I’m pretty familiar with the subject, unlike other colleagues of mine which are extremely new to it. 

The problem is that my mother truly believes that without a college degree I will not be able to find a job and that it is the only way I can get a “high paying” job. 

I told her that I will 100% not work in a bank or in some kind of insurance firm and she had no problem with that. She believes that just because I have a college degree it will not matter what line of work I choose. All that matters is to have one.

I know that she does this to protect me and that she really wants the best for me but in reality I’m just losing valuable time, money and energy. 

I’m currently failing 2 classes this semester and things are not really looking great. In the past I was taking treatment for ADHD and until 2 months ago I was on treatment for depression, my focus right now is almost non-existent, especially on something I’m not at all interested in.

The problem is that the subjects I’m interested in are not thought in any type of college. 

I want to start going to the gym, I want to quit cigars, I want to start reading books that I find interesting, I want to start meditating, I want to work on my passions, I want to start seeking help from a therapist rather than taking a shit load of pills, but I just can’t. I feel trapped.

I’d rather work 15 hours days for minimum wage on something that I enjoy than 8 hours days on something I truly hate for maybe the average wage.

I currently already work for a non profit organization in the social services field that pays quite a bit more than most other agencies of the sort for the field I am in. They always give employees working for them opportunity to move up in the agency after they have completed school and really take care of us well. Since I started working in the social services field I have found just how much I love it and tossed around the idea of going back to school to further my education to BA, then Masters. I am just really struggling right now with numerous things in my decision making. The first being the fact that I am, and always have been a bad procrastinator and I feel due to the amount of money achool would be that I would stay disciplined but im really worried Ill procrastinate like I did in high school and fail lots of assignments. So thats the first thing I would like advice on: if you were a procrastinator, how did you transition into being more disciplined when going to college? 
The next thing is the idea of this schooling being a long commitment being year around for the next 6 years. I feel like it'll really put a damper on excess funds and time with my family. Im also a single mom and am concerned i wont be able to work full time, study, assigments and give my daughter the time she deserves. So if you have went to school as a single parent, how did you do it and still have time for much else without losing your crap?
A big concern is the amount of debt I will acrue and if it will be worth it in the end. Since i started my job 9 months ago, it put me into a new tax bracket and FAFSA will barely help pay with anything. It will all be subsidized and unsubsidized loans. I dont want to spend years in debt. Their positions with masters degress at my agency is 28 an hour. I know it'll be a huge increase but I feel like I will take years of the extra ill be earning to pay it off. Is it worth it? I guess thats a decision ill have to make.

All of expect for one have graduated with degrees that lead straight to mid to high paying jobs and we are all comfortable, not rich but all the bills are paid on time, we have all the things we need and many of the things we want, except for one of us. There’s one guy that dropped out and hadn’t really held a steady job ever. It’s one minimum wage thing after the next, all his bosses are “morons and assholes.” He’s basically a terrible adult and employee but a great guy and a good friend. Because of this he’s dirt broke all the time. 

The group likes to go out to try new restaurants once a week and we also meet once a week for trivia at a local brewery. We go on trips and see concerts. We also hang out at home but not as much. Lately that one friend has been complaining that he feels excluded and like we’re pushing him out because he can’t afford to join us when we hang. Obviously that’s not our intention and we really want to fix it.

Couple of things in our way: 
We’re not going to go out less, we love our Tuesday trivia and Saturday dinners. We can replace them with at home hangouts occasionally but none of us are willing to give it up.

49,"My (34M) gf (27F) has confirmed that we are over. She was all I had after my separation with my ex-wife.

I have worked FIFO for the last 12-13yrs and during this time came to be depressed which I am getting treatment for. My friends at the time would seem to always organise things while I was away so I constantly missed events. This was no great loss as when I left my ex-wife she told their wives that I had cheated and none appeared to have defended me (I did not cheat and would never had). My best man from the wedding told me that they'd hang out with my ex-wife because it was in the best interest of the kids, nothing about me or my wellbeing. I have since cut them out of my life.

I have two wonderful kids that I share custody with my ex-wife but with only 6 days off I don't have the time for much else. She has also talked about relocating back to Brisbane which would significantly reduce my time with them. Before anyone jumps in, my lawyer has already told me that this will happen, it's just a matter of time. 

I met my now ex-gf at work who helped me work through a lot of things including being civil with my ex-wife. She has been my entire world for the last year and now that we are over I feel like I have nothing. I have no friends of my own, I am still working FIFO so find it hard to find time when I have my kids and with depression I don't enjoy anything anymore. As soon as I mention kids, most people don't seem interested in hanging out. Plus I've never met other parents to hang out with. Add to this, crippling social anxiety over meeting new people. 

The reason she is leaving is because she is struggling with my kids, neither her fault or theirs, which scares me that I'll never find anyone else for another 10yrs until women no longer want their own kids. 

How on earth am I supposed to rebuild my life from here?

52,"People in this story:
Manic friend: B
Friend 1 &amp; friend 2
Manic friends family
&amp; Me

So B has always been relatively quiet, funny, just an all around good normal person. Her family has had a a history of bipolar disorder and manic episodes although B has been tested and does not have bipolar disorder, but i’m not sure about mania.

So all of a sudden one day B posted saying she was following some advice she received from a friend and also quoted advice from a friend who has passed said about her.
Althougu i’m unsure about one of the advice i know h tu e quote from the passed friend was like “B has a great personality and should be herself more”

After that things went haywire. Like absolutely whack.

She started posting conversations with sugar daddies and her questioning their lifestyles, her posting videos of all her friends calling them crackheads for being her friend (she’s became fixated on calling everyone and everything a crackhead) She’s been posting HOURS long snapchat stories and instagram stories of her saying things about the gouvernement watching her and that we all have the power to be crazy and that she’s acting normal and society had convinced us that we’re all just seeing her as crazy because of society. People have tried to reach out and offer help and she’s posting their screenshots saying how their wrong and they’re too brainwashed. The list goes on.

One night B was supposed to pick up friend 1 from university for dinner and she was late getting friend 1 because she drove around for 3 hours in her car crying and laughing about how no one questions anything and her being crazy doesn’t make her stupid and how we have the power to kill ourselves and that she can show us how to act this way and how we’re all so brainwashed. And this is not like her as she always complains about money and gas because she is currently a full time student yet she drove around for 3 hours wasting gas. 

When confronted about why she was 2 hours late, she said she was doing it as a joke and she wasn’t really manic and how she wanted to show us that her being crazy was a way of awakening us and showing us were brainwashed. All for a joke.

Again today i saw her stories on socials as me and friend 1&amp;2 were talking about it and we sought out the help of friend 2s cousin who is a nurse who said we should seek medical help but the thing is B is so convinced she is doing this as a joke and isn’t wrong that she is completely missing the fact that she’s going nuts. She also takes medication that we aren’t sure if she’s taking.

As i mentioned earlier her socials on social media and again filled with her calling a restaurant and walking in to try to get a job randomly and yelling at the lady while recording herself saying she deserves a job and that everyone has the power to have a job and when she was driving home she was talking about how she went the wrong way on purpose cause she can and keeps telling all of us that we can question things and do what we want and how overpopulation is real and we all die. It’s all very very odd.

Just last week her and i were studying for a class we have together in university and she did chapter 2 while i did 1 and now she refuses to share the notes we did together with me until i join her way of thinking which is extremely frustrating.

I’m not mad at her i just want her to get better like everyone else. We’re really at a dead end as she’ll ignore and turn on anyone giving her advice, even her family knows at this point and she’s recorded herself yelling at them.  She doesn’t think she’s ill and thinks that everyone but her needs help.",17Jan2020,1

Right before I threw out the flexeril she was to the point of not able to stand on her own, literally falling, not being able to speak coherently, vomiting all over the place, and wouldn’t remember most of it after

I,[18m,CA] still live with my very strict parents and recently became sexually active with my gf.  Last month, my high school were handing out free condoms at a rally and I put them in my pants pocket. I got home from the rally and changed from my school clothes. Stupid me left the condoms in my pants and my parents found them because they were sticking out the pockets a little bit. My parents overreacted and I explained the school handed them out. I obviously told them I wasnt sexually active because sex before marriage is a no no under there roof. My parents even called the school and threatened a lawsuit for ""encouraging students to have sex."" 

I know you can get condoms through the mail/delivered to your house but my parents opens my mail/packages so that's not an option. Amazon lockers would be really perfect for me because there is one in our Safeway grocery store &amp; I pick up groceries by myself for my parents but unfortunately my parents track my money so I cant order anything online without them knowing and our Safeway location doesnt sell condoms. I cant ask other family/friends because they all have a big mouth. Yes I know this is toxic living with them. I'm a senior in high school and I am 100% moving out when college starts.

I really enjoy spending time with my gf and sometimes I have to say no to her because we dont have protection or sometimes she has to say no to me when we get in the moment and sometimes we dont use protection. Its just a crappy situation for both of us because neither of us dont want to be parents at such a young age.

64,"I’ve been having some trouble with my family lately. Basically coming up to 3 years ago my dad took his own life and I found him. Subsequently I have developed ptsd and have attempted to turn to my family members for support and guidance ever since, but they are cold with me. My parents divorced when I was young and whenever I try and bring up my flashbacks or how I’m not doing so well coping with my dads death they change the subject and just tell me to get over it. My mum implies that she doesn’t need to spend any time with me and constantly sends me condescending Instagram posts on how I’m making myself miserable and I should just move on and stop moping around. I don’t have anyone else besides my family but they make me feel horrible for daring to breathe anywhere near them. Whenever I have bad panic attacks and want to talk to my mum she blocks me because she’s with her boyfriend. She never wants to talk to me and I feel like I’m a burden on her. I’ve isolated myself because the ptsd symptoms are so intense but not being able to talk to my family about how much I’m struggling is really starting to mess with my head",17Jan2020,1
65,"first time posting on reddit so bare with me, also kinda long

DISCLAIMER: i’ve never gotten a proper diagnosis nor seen a profesional (just thought i’d include)

for the past 2 or so years i’ve suspected i have adhd. i’ve never told this to anyone and i feel like they wouldn’t believe me if i did. I have always been a quiet kid, with good grades and behavior (at home and in school). However, i’ve always had problems with focusing, and have a short attention span (and the most common symptoms for inattentive type adhd, but that’s too long to list). My suspicion started 2 years ago, but i feel like these symptoms have gotten worse over the past 6 months. I’ve contemplated going to the mental health counselor at my school, but it’s really daunting for me. I also don’t want my parents to know because they’re already burden with other problems(not getting into). So the question I’m asking is, How do I go about getting help with a possible mental disorder without alerting my family to much?",17Jan2020,1
66,"My friend (16f) has had this ongoing problem with a girl for 2 years. Recently it’s picked back up, as they have been making fun of her Tik Tok and YouTube channel. They also sit there where she’s in earshot and call her a “fat b*tch” and other rude stuff like that. I walked into a class I have with her, and she was in tears.I (16m) want to do something about it, but she doesn’t want me to get in trouble. Is there something I could do besides telling the principal, because I just want to help my friend.

67,"I have come realize that I am borderline compulsive liar. Do I tell the truth? Yeah sometimes but more often than not I tell lies. I am married to a good woman and have 1 child with her, (3 years old). She is a full time mother/homemaker and I am a father (though my shadyness could probably argue otherwise) and an employee, 50 to 60 hours a week. I have squandered a fair amount of money from our savings. We have enough to pay the bills but not much more than that thanks to me. I also hide what I do when I am away from home. I.e. take half days to go see a movie by myself or go see my parents or brother or just random errands that I don't feel I can tell my wife about. I am concerned that if I stay married that I am going to really mess something up financially and have them end up on the street but yet apparently this fear isn't enough to get me to stop my shadyness (sp?) So I am wondering if it's best for me to divorce so that any financial issues that I would cause would be very limited?

TL;DR I'm a (arguably because it's never been diagnosed but wouldn't argue against someone if they said I was) compulsive liar, embezzler, and just generally shady. Would divorcing be the kindest thing I can do to protect my family from me?

P.S. She also has some anxiety that is difficult for me to find ways to support her emotionally. Some of that anxiety is my fault and I know that.

68,"I’m about 5’5, and weigh just under 80kg (around 175lbs). I’m 27yo and have had big boobs my whole life. I’ve always hated how big they are but never thought there was anything I could do about it.  I’m a size 14-16(AU) which is around a US 10-12, and my bra size is 14G (36G in US sizes I think??)  I’ve never been happy with the shape of them, and they’re really quite heavy and uncomfortable. I’m restricted with what kind of clothes I can wear, and nice swimwear/bras are almost impossible to find with my proportions. 

Recently I’ve come into some money and I’ve been talking to a few different plastic surgeons about having a breast reduction without any private insurance.  It’s something I think I can afford, but after speaking to my family and partner no one seems to think it’s a good idea.  I want to take them down from a G cup to a C. 

I gained a bit of weight over the last 5 years and have had a really hard time shedding it. I did manage to lose a few kilos recently but it seems my chest is still the same size if not bigger. Everyone around me is suggesting that I just continue trying to lose weight but I don’t know if it will work - Even if it did I’d still be keen on a breast lift.

69,"Hey guys! I’m going to try to keep it short as possible. So before I give most of the context, I really want to say that I do love my boyfriend and I want to try to talk about these issues before I more seriously think about ending the relationship. I guess the advice I’m looking for is how to bring it up in the least emotional or bitchy way possible. 

He and I have been dating for about 2 years. We met in college and clicked immediately. He was kind, thoughtful, smart, funny, and we agreed on a lot of social/political/life things. As time went on and we moved in together, I personally think that he developed a drinking problem (or I just figured it out when we started living together). Other life things have happened, causing him to become extremely stressed. He rarely goes a day without drinking, even during work, and every time I try to talk to him about it he becomes irritated, and it turns more into a rant from one of us than a conversation.

He’s embarrassed me in front of my friends by doing really stupid things when he’s drinking, and those friends have reached out to me saying they don’t want to drink with him any more. If he stopped the heavy drinking I genuinely believe most of the problems we have now would be nonexistent. He gets irritated, angry, doesn’t give me as much affection as he used to unless he wants to have sex, and I honestly don’t want to be around him at all probably 85% of the time when he’s been drinking (sometimes he doesn’t have a nasty drunk attitude). It’s taking a mental toll on me. I cry a lot more now. When I cry in front of him, he feels guilty, but walks away and leaves me alone. He’s also told me that he doesn’t want me to rely on him for emotional support (he was drunk telling me this) which honestly broke my heart, because I feel like part of dating someone is being there for them if they are feeling down. 

I would have left him by now, but when he’s sober or just slightly buzzed he is the same person I fell in love with. I don’t know if I believe that the “real you” comes out when you’re drunk, but I have thought about it in this case. I don’t really know what to think any more. 

I really want to sit down with him and talk about it. There are glimpses of the time we were both really happy, and we laugh and we hug and everything seems normal again. But I can’t keep going through this cycle of being so sad and feeling so alone, and then being happy, and then going back to feeling alone again. His drinking is starting to cause problems with his job too. 

If anyone has advice on how to have a sit down conversation with him without it turning into a rant or argument where nothing really gets talked about or solved, or even just advice on how to get the conversation started in a non-hostile way, I would really appreciate it.",17Jan2020,1

71,"So we, a marketing department at a tech company, recently hired a woman named Alex to our team. 

Since beginning 3 months ago, Alex has really struggled with the job. She’s struggled with things like completing work in a timely manner, asking for help when she needs it, and participating in meetings where we are brainstorming ideas.

On top of all of that (and more), she’s needed to take personal time several times since beginning. From surgery to illness to her sister being sick to watching her nieces, it feels like one thing after another keeps her from working her scheduled hours. 

We’ve tried to speak with her and coach her on company practices including 3+ weeks with 4 hours of on-boarding, but it feels like she’s just not getting it. 

My boss is now becoming frustrated and while we’re about to set her up with a 60 day improvement plan, she’s just had another problem that I’m reluctant to tell him about. As I mentioned above, she struggles with getting work done in a timely manner and I’ve just discovered she spent 3 hours on something that should have taken 1/2 hour simply because she didn’t know how to do it. 

This is a reoccurring issue with her and we’ve discussed what she should do in those situations before. We’ve both told her multiple times to let us know as soon as something takes her longer than 5 minutes and yet again she just wasted a bunch of time because she couldn’t just ask.

I know that her review is coming up soon and despite all of her issues, I do see promise in her and just think she doesn’t understand how some companies work or that she’s giving off a bad vibe. I’m trying to decide if I should tell my boss or if I should speak with her privately. I feel like this may be the final thing that makes him say “Yeah, this isn’t working out” but she genuinely seems to think that what she did was okay. 

What do you think? This is actually a pretty great company to work for, especially in our field. Good pay, great bonuses, and pretty impressive work we’re doing. So while I want to try to give her the chance to stay and hopefully be a great asset, I’m also realizing that she may just not be the right fit.

74,"Last Friday was a shitty day for me. I witnessed one of my classmates being bullied in the morning, and had a school assembly in second period. I am very protective of that classmate, as a large portion of the grade has something against them and how they identify. So I go into second period wondering how all of my classmates could be such shitty human beings. Then we go to the assembly, which is almost literally hell for me. There is really loud music, the lights are out, there is some sort of sound-based light rig, and on top of that we are packed in like sardines and my best friend isn't there.
Once we get out of that shithole of an assembly, someone I know starts stepping on my heels. They do this often, though I always tell them to stop. Friday, I told them to stop, then when they didn't, I turn around and yell ""can you fucking not _____"". That catches the attention of the teacher, who angrily asked what happened. The kid who was stepping on my shoes goes through their normal routine: ""it's like a magnetic attraction; I can't help it"". The teacher then sends me to what my school calls SAFE. It's a little room with no windows and three desks. It's tiny. No room to hide.
So, I get there, and the dude greets me with, and this is a direct quote: ""So you're the potty mouth"". I couldn't really believe that this person just insulted me like that; they don't even know me. I ask what he said, and he repeats the sentence word-for-word. I sign in, and the guy does this geusture. It's the kind of thing you do when you get another stack of papers to do just before you go home. And he pairs this with ""oh Lord Jesus"". 
I, already crying, because I have no self-control, go sit at one of the desks. He asks me one or two questions, and I respond with one-word answers, and the woman who runs the room along side the dude tells me (again a direct quote): ""we use yes ma'am, no ma'am, yes sir, no sir, please and thank you in this room"". I find this a Stark contrast to ""potty mouth"".
A little while later they tell me I can eat, but I don't (I feel uncomfortable eating near some people; I also have trouble at restaurants).
The dude escorts me out, convinces me to stop by the bathroom, and I spend the rest of fourth period crying in the bathroom.
So, in a few weeks, because I was in SAFE, I will be barred from participating in two ""reward"" events. I'm not bummed at all about missing them; they brought shaved ice trucks in and you had to pay for it, and the whole thing is always too loud and too dense for me. What is bothering me is having to stay back; because I can't go, I'm going to have to spend 40 minutes with the SAFE people and a friend of mine, who I absolutely cannot cry in front of.

So, am I being a whiney bitch? Should I suck it up? I honestly have contemplated intensionally getting myself sick rather than telling my parents that it would cause anxiety for me to go.",17Jan2020,1

84,"Hey guys,

I am currently working in Arizona and make around 42k with good state government benefits. I was recently offered my old job back in Houston, TX for being in Forensics where I would make around 55k and can go up from there. I previously worked in Houston for 3 years at the job and decided to move back to Arizona to be closer to family and friends. I love Arizona, I love the outdoors and being close to friends/family, I started dating a girl I really like, but so far since I moved back I am not fond of the job and my commute is about 1 hour compared to Houston where it was 10 minutes. I also do not make much compared to what I was making in Houston and I have way less savings going into my bank account. I dread going to work basically, I live for the weekends. In Houston I liked the job and I loved the pay. I was able to live comfortably and save up for nice vacations and had room for spending money on things I wanted, however I had no social life due to the schedule and me being alone away from family and friends. I'm feeling like the only reason I left was because I was unhappy being away from family and friends and I got very homesick. I didn't have alot of friends in Houston so alot of my free time was just spent at home. I am hoping that if I do go back to Houston then my current GF would go with me, however she is up in the air since her family lives in Arizona. 


I don't intend on pursuing a career in the field I'm in, in Arizona, I do eventually want to get back into forensics, so career wise, I think going back to Houston would be smart. However I also believe that mental health and wellness plays into a decision like this and I want to be sure to make the best decision for my career and the best decision to keep me somewhat content and happy with my life. 


I know some personal finance enthusiasts might say it was a stupid decision to take a pay cut and move back to Arizona in the first place but it was a mental well-being situation. I feel like my mind keeps going back and forth on this situation so I would appreciate some input from some outsiders. Thanks everyone!

89,"This might be a little long so please bear with me. 
So you can get an idea as to what’s going on:

I’m a 22 year old female,  I’m currently going through a break up and dealing with a stalker.

I have borderline personality disorder and an anxiety disorder. 

My boyfriend was a drug addict when we first got together. I helped him go to meetings and get clean. 
He was clean for a year but we dealt with other issues like my panic attacks and break downs. He wasn’t very supportive of me when I would go through things with my mental health. 

He would tell me to shut up when I cried and told me I overreacted. Things were good when they were good and really bad when they were bad. We share a dog together as well and we had an apartment together. 

I can’t blame him for being unproductive because I know that’s on me. But I’ve been trying to go back to finish high school but my anxiety is really bad and it leads me to drop out. I can’t afford therapy and I’m starting to really worry about what to do. I want to be in therapy and learn proper coping mechanisms but it’s really hard when I don’t have any support. 

I don’t have friends, I caught my bf relapsing the other day and I told him to move back to his moms  house cause I couldn’t handle him being high on pills again. I was so disappointed and upset that he wasted a year sober. 

I don’t live with anyone but my dog and cat. I feel overwhelmed with bills now because he’s gone and won’t respond to me. He blamed me for his drug use yet he was on drugs long before I met him. 

Does anyone have any tips for budgeting? Or where I could possibly get resources. I love my pets and I don’t want to give them up. I will try my best to do things but I don’t have a car to get places and it’s -40 where I live. My only mode of transportation is walking right now.

93,"Backstory: I experienced alot of violence when I was younger and sort of normalized it never would have thought it would effect my adult hood.

Long story short my ex and I were in a very toxic relationship. Here's short of what I did

I was very physically abusive to her, I even spit on her multiple times.

I choked her until she passed out multiple times

I fought her so called brother and tried to kidnap him during a hurricane 

I put a knife to her throat multiple times over her cheating 

I'm emotionally abusive: I talked about her dead brother, told her mother that she was a junkie whore etc 

The last incident I went into a manic rage because she wouldn't wear a wig instead of her hair(I loved her hair) and felt like she was going to work to flirt or something I really dont know why I freaked out tbh 
I was supposed to take her to work but I tripped out and said she not going. So I choked her and let her go, she tried to run out and I went and grabbed her and carried her back into the house and bystander called the police she stabbed me in the eye, and I said "" so you want to stab people right"" and grabbed a knife ( I believe if I would have stabbed her if she didnt run) and when she came back with them she said I'm not protecting you anymore and I got arrested. 

I honestly just black out when stuff like this happens and dont remember most of it. This happened a year ago, I recently tried to start dating again after a year and trying therapy. But I'm noticing the same patterns being controlling and being emotionally abusive already. So I broke things off. 

I cursed her out and said extremely mean things to her after I didnt get my way (telling myself I'm doing this to push her away so I dont hurt her and she doesnt hurt me)  because I know what happens when I feel hurt.


What I need advice on is how do I stop being abusive to women that I'm dating before I actually hurt someone and I go to fucking prison.

My bestfriends brother choked his wife to death and burned down his house and hes in prison for the rest of his life. He was on drugs! All I do is weed and psychedelics!

But I did see a bit emoji of a guy when they were texting.

Now my dad has been through 3 or 4 major arguments about cheating. It’s usually my mom doing it or some how texting other guys in a way.

My parents don’t touch each other’s phones as well.

95,"My friend and I go to a small school where everyone knows each other and certain families are generally more excused from poor behavior because they’ve been going there for generations. One of these families has a son who’s notoriously liked by the school’s staff and students but bullies my best friend and I: belittling us, constantly searching for contradictions in what we say while ignoring the hypocrisy in his own statements, insulting us for a perceived lesser intelligence, etc. He’s whittled me down to a point where I constantly feel like I have to be in defense, and as a result am painted even more like the bad guy.

97,"I was with my first boyfriend for a little over 3 years. We broke up just before I graduated high school, and he quickly moved on. I left the area, and am married. Nearly 20 years later, we hadn’t spoken a word, until I received an email. He expressed regret for breaking up with me. He is married to the women he left me for, so they’ve been together nearly 20 years. After a few exchanges, I asked about his intentions, and why the need to contact me 20 years later - while married. He apologized and said he just needed to get it off of his chest. I’m confused, and assume he must be having  marital problems. What does all of it mean, and more importantly - why the heck do I even care? I’m married!",17Jan2020,1

During this time I had failed to secure a job as I was only at home for a month. However, during this month, I spent every day at home by myself. This broke me, and I ended up feeling lonely and depressed. I began going out with friends more often, but I feel like the damage had already been done. I began fearing spending time at home alone. Even now in college where I don’t have any really close friends, if I have spend a whole day in my dorm room by myself I begin feeling lonely and sad. I have a fear of always being left out or missing out. How do I begin enjoying the feeling of being alone and spending time by myself again?",17Jan2020,1

101,"I really need advice from someone who’s been through this- I’m year 13 student doing a-levels in part time employment and I’m not coping at all

I’m overwhelmed with my job pretty much all the time. I am always stressing out about it. I only started in August last year (and this is my third job since 2017) 

I was finding my weekly hours too much as I would go to school Monday-Friday and then work all Saturday and all Sunday and sometimes during the week straight after school, and there wasn’t one day of the week where I could just solely focus on revision and school work. 

This was causing ALOT of stress for me (and still is) because I knew in myself that I wasn’t dedicating enough time into my studies and I would be skipping Monday off school where I would work on Sundays 12-9 and be exhausted and not have the energy to go in the next day- my attendance is 82%- which is awful 

Anyway- fast forward a couple of months and they cut down my hours but if I’m being honest it’s really not working out for me, it’s so difficult to find days where I can just focus on school work let alone plan going out with mates and other activities. Which leads me onto another reason why I’m stressed-

My rota for that week will come out 2 weeks before so it’s impossible to plan future events because I never know if I’ll be working. My parents and mates all get frustrated with me because I won’t know if I can make the event or be able to go out with them untill a week before. I know this is what a job in the real world is like but I can’t help and feel like I’m missing out on nights out with mates, trips in London that I’ve missed and big family birthdays that I haven’t been able to attend. Obviously this has left me feeling very lonely as I feel like I’m missing out on opportunities and good times while I’m still young 

Basically, I’m really considering leaving my job because of how much of my time it’s taking up and the fact that my education is being affected by me not turning up for school and just generally tired all the time and not focusing. But the reason why I don’t want to leave is because I’ll feel pretty worthless and pathetic if I do as to me it just seems like a stupid reason to leave, plus I feel like it has made me such a confident person dealing with customers and it has definitely taught me how to me a more resilient person to difficult situations. I’m worried that if I leave I’ll regret it because I start becoming more shy and loose that confidence that I gained there.

My teachers have all told me to leave this job as I’m a full time student but it upsets me when I can see everyone at sixth form who also have jobs and just seem to be getting along just fine, no stress but I can’t seem to manage it and it just makes me feel like I’m shit.

The only thing stopping me is that i cannot give up my full time job because i obviously have bills to pay plus i have to pay child support, my SO doesn’t make enough to cover our expenses either. I also live an hour away from either of the colleges, we will call them college1 and college2, that i can go to and my son lives an hour away as well but in the same city as college1(college2 is an hour in the opposite direction but it is also a better school for the program i want to go for) and finally college2’s classes are 8am-3pm(unsure of college1’s schedule) and i currently work 6:30am-3pm, so i would have to start a new job on top of juggling school and a family. 

Phew, i think i covered everything. So my advice needed is how would someone in my predicament juggle all of this or make it even feasible.

One alternative i should add but its unlikely, my SO grandparents have an extra bedroom&amp;living space in their basement and im sure they would not mind if we moved in to lower everyones expenses and they live closer to college1 and my son, down side with this option is there are already 7 people living in the home 2 children and 5 adults.

My friends think I should leave him, I really don't know how to. I love this man so much just he always gets mad when I either talk to a guy, be nice to someone, or if I am happy over something that isn't him. Like last week I had a test in college and I told him I did good on it. He just looked at me and screamed at me ""It's just a number"" I ended up apologizing to him later that evening. I can't go to class without him wanting to know who's in it he never lets me talk to his friends, yet I let him talk to mine. Makes sense. Not. I feel super unhappy but he has done nice things before just his anger lashes out most of the time. My boyfriend calls me mean and he calls me needy when all I ask him to do is to stop yelling at me for being happy over something else or having to do a school project with a guy partner. Sometimes he doesn't make sense to me.

126,"So recently I got invited to a very seemingly prestigious program called NSLC. Basically it’s a nine day intensive program that focuses on giving high schoolers as close to real word experience with their dream and hopefully future careers. At first I thought it was just one of those camps that preyed on academic achievers in order to get money that claim you are “invited” but really anyone could attend, but after some research I’ve generally concluded that they really take insight into who they select to invite and the program seems really beneficial and I would love to attend. Unfortunately I come from a very low income family, I buy basically everything I have because neither parent is in the picture and I live with my retired grandmother, so I can’t really afford the $3,695 price ticket. My very close family friend told me if I could come up with the rest of the money that he would pay $1,000 dollars toward it and I have other family friends that could probably take care of the air travel, but that still leaves $2,695 to raise. I’m 16 but I have a job where I make close to 300 a month depending on how much I work and I sell vintage thrifted clothes on eBay and can sometimes make $100 a month but I still have other things to pay for like my phone bill and school fees, so I wouldn’t possibly be able to raise enough and even if I could it would take a lot of time and effort and I could definitely put that money towards elsewhere, and I really hate asking people for money, but I mean if it’s important enough than I’ll do it right? I’m thinking that maybe I could raise money over the next year and attend 2021 summer after I graduate, which they said they would allow, but it really sucks I know that I want to go this summer and I have until March to enroll, and what if some miracle happens and I end up having plenty of money to go but I missed the deadline? I really just don’t know what to do.

127,"This is a throwaway account. Also, brace yourselves for an essay.

I'm a 27 and I left my full-time job to pursue self-employed projects with no real plan, only high hopes to become successful. I did this to follow my heart, but I ended up failing miserably and now I'm completely broke.  
Earlier this year, I met the man of my dreams, but he lives in EU and I live in the US. We have hung out a handful of times this year and although it's too soon relative to most, but I want to marry this man. The problem is, he has one more year to complete his doctorate and another year of military service in EU. There is at least 2 years until we can be together completely.  


Here is the dilemma:  
I currently live at home with very overbearing parents (they blow my phone up at 9pm if I'm not home) and they obviously are not happy with the fact that I left a secure, financially stable job with benefits.   
As for the EU boyfriend, he invited me to move abroad and live with him, and I would be completely taken care of financially and he would let me live with him for 1-2 years until we both move back to the US together. I would not have to work, nor would I have to pay bills or rent, but obviously I consider complications with health insurance, visas, etc that come with living abroad.   
He said would love for me to live with him (as would I) during one of the most difficult times of his life. He said he needs me to keep him grounded and would love to have me there since pursuing high education is extremely stressful/exhausting, and having to do military service for a year is mundane.  
As mentioned earlier, I left a full-time job to pursue other projects. It was one that was within the field I got my Bachelor's in, and frankly I was kind of an idiot to leave in the first place considering they rarely hire people and it was a very good company to have on a resume. I left there on good terms though, and I'm almost positive I'd be able to come back and work there again if I just texted my former boss about it.

  
Realistically speaking, if I went back to my old job, I'd stop feeling like a deadbeat loser, I'd make some money, and have health/retirement benefits, but I'd probably only be able to visit my boyfriend once a year and maybe for a week or 2 at a time. Also, plane tickets to see him are $1,000 minimum.  
However, if I decided to move abroad, I'd have pretty much everything taken care of me with the exception of paperwork and having to also move my dog with me.  


I'm deeply in love and want to be there for my boyfriend during this time of his life, but I'm afraid of what others might think if I up and left (especially my parents; my mom told me she might as well kill herself if I moved countries to be with my boyfriend. Awful, manipulative guilt trip if you ask me). I'm also afraid of just having things handed to me on a silver platter, and I don't want to be broke for the next few years while I wait in the EU with my boyfriend.  


Going back to my job feels like a last-ditch effort at a decent life for myself. I see it as giving up on myself, and projects I had, and giving up on my boyfriend since I couldn't make the effort to even try moving to be with him. It's also a 1.25 hour commute by car each way (roughly 2.5 hours of commuting a day, which is awful). Moving near my job to shorten the commute is not an option as I live in an expensive city and the job does not pay a wage in which I can afford both rent AND other expenses. I'd be living paycheck to paycheck.

I don't know what to do, I feel stuck, and I feel that all this pressure is on me alone since it's my life and I have to choose whether to move or stay. My boyfriend does not have a choice and cannot move to the US for another 2 years.  


I'm afraid of my overbearing parents, I'm afraid of leaving the comfort of what's familiar to me to be in a completely foreign country that I've never even visited, I'm afraid of losing my boyfriend due to the distance, and I'm afraid of going back to my full-time job because I don't want to feel like a failure.  


Please just give me some insight, I feel so lost.

128,"Hi everyone!!! 
So I have quite a lot of info here, forgive me as I’m just really anxious. 
I got married in Jan 2019, and let’s just say he wasn’t the man I thought he was and now we are headed on the path of divorce. I’m the one who is probably going to pay for it, it won’t be too bad financially since we don’t have extensive financial dependence on each other or length of marriage. 

We were living in a city that I love, I moved to for the independence, and I had so much fun! I was able to make things work for myself, worked so hard to get there, and eventually he wanted to move back down to my hometown and so we did. 

Stuff happened, I dropped out of school for a year and a half, worked for my LLC I own. However, now that I’m out of this awful relationship I just felt this huge urge to just move back to the city and be independent again. I just filled out some sublet forms, I got approved, super quick process in a nice area in the city. I haven’t deposited anything yet because I got cold feet due to financial reasons (my dads advice). I would have approx. $3000 leaving, I have to pay for one way ticket ($78) my subway fare for the month ($200) put down deposit and rent ($1600).... and of course alllll of those hidden fees in the city. 

I’m getting cold feet and I feel like I need to back out. I was expecting money to come from my school but it’s coming two weeks later than I thought and I don’t know if I should push leaving right now. I feel really bad for getting my tenant excited and we are so close to closing this deal. 

I’m also regaining my interest in medicine again, and I don’t know if I even have a good shot. My school messed up with withdrawing me in time and I was unaware and I failed all of my 4 classes thinking they shut my account down. They said I can make them up and it won’t show up on transcripts like it never happened, but I’m still anxious. Maybe I should just stay at home with my parents and save like $20k and move to the city and start my life then? I just hate being a bum staying with my parents, especially when my dad acts as if I’m a burden. 

I’m just really confused. I don’t know if I should just take the leap and see what happens, or to just wait, process my divorce, go to therapy, and have some leverage. The only thing is I am kind of unhappy in this area and I get serious FOMO of other people making it work and having fun in the city I like. Ugh.",17Jan2020,1
129,"Background: My husband and I moved from AZ to MI after our first daughter was born. She's now a little over a year old now and I'm 8 months pregnant. We just moved back to AZ because we were unhappy, and the lifestyle was not what we expected. We decided to move before the next baby was born so we weren't stuck longer than we had to be. My mother said she could help us out and we could stay with her no problem. Two weeks before we left my mother informed me that she agreed to let my cousin come down too. 

My mother only had one extra room, so she's been trying to get us to find a place sooner. To accommodate my cousin. Now when I originally talked with my mother the agreement was that we would need to stay with her for at least 3 months. 2 months after the baby was born because I'm having a csection. So I won't be able to pick up my other daughter and i need someone to be here to help me lift my daughter. So either my husband will have to take off work or she's have to help. She said no problem we will figure it out. 

So now that I'm here I am just stressing because things haven't worked out as planned, my husband had a job lined up that didn't pan out. The obgyn office I was suppose to go to has been dragging their butt, so I haven't been able to get in yet. My feet have been swollen and I have been feeling super shitty. 

I've been trying to engage with everyone, but it has been hard because I have to keep my feet up and watch the little one. My husband helps when he can but  he's been doing a lot. Everyone else just seems to avoid me. 

My cousin doesn't say much to me period, just walks by. She spends most of her time outside in the hot tub or on the phone talking to people. Or watching tv upstairs in make shift bedroom. Unless my brother is home, then she'll hang out with my brother and husband and ignore me.

My mom works until 5-6pm then goes to bowling 3 nights a week. Today she didn't even say hi to me just the baby then left. So I hardly see her, and when she is home she's trying to make things comfortable for my cousin... which urks me a little bit because I'm struggling to keep up with cleaning and getting stuff unpacked.

What can I do to engage better? I'm starting to feel really excluded. Is it my mood that makes everyone avoid me? How can I be better?",17Jan2020,1

133,"So, context is due.

I (20F) graduated high school early, therefore I started college early. Initially, I wanted to major in Theoretical Physics, but didn't get into the program by a few points, so I initially settled for Pure Math. I've always liked math and I love the analytical aspects of it; it literally teaches you how to think. At the same time, I've always enjoyed analyzing society and the relationship between the means of production and people, so I thought it was a good idea to switch to Economics in my second year of college. 

It was good at first, but nowhere near as analytical as I thought --and was told-- it would be. We didn't delve into the deeply quantitative methods I expected. Classes were more like, ""memorize this information and fill a bubble"" instead of challenging, and I didn't feel like I was learning as much as I should. Over time, I became bored and deeply disappointed by the program. So, seeing as it would take me 55- credits to graduate from Pure Math (vs 45 from Economics), I decided to return to my initial major last semester. 

Last semester was terrible. I took concentration classes and was academically challenged until I got in an accident. I fractured my ankle, couldn't walk, and fell into a deep depression, which meant that, for the first time in my life, the semester was far from okay; withdrew from 2,  failed one concentration class, passed 2 electives. 

Right now, I have doubts about returning and failing again. I don't know if it's a carryover from last semester or if it's what I genuinely fear, but I don't know if I'm cut out for this. I find it hard to see the joy in my major and it's driving me insane, because I don't know if I made a mistake by changing or not. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, what would you recommend I do?",17Jan2020,1
134,"
honestly i give up. i really don’t think my family or anyone at my school understands what i’m going through. this past month i have to been through hell and back. my dad stole from me to feed his addiction, my mom overdosed (she’s alive and seeking treatment), now i am at my grandparents. everyday for school we drive 45 minutes. for the past few weeks my school is too busy trying to give me detentions for unexcused absences. so the office lady says “when are you going to start showing up for your detentions?” all i’m thinking is i’m so sorry but the LAST thing i’m worried about right now is detentions. my school knows EVERYTHING i’m going through and not one person has offered me support. we have counselors and mental health specialists out the ass, and not one person is worried about me. did it ever cross their minds that maybe i am truant because i can’t stand being depressed, anxious, and bullied everyday. not too mention the person i reported to them for bullying is now student of the month. so isn’t that just great?!!? the next time any staff talks to me about anything irrelevant i’m going to go off. nobody truly gets how hard shit is. it may sound stupid and like i know people have it worse than me. but this shit is fucking with me mentally. and i don’t know how much longer i can take it. i’ve been more than respectful to everyone at my school including staff. i swear if i just died tomorrow nobody would care. at least that’s how it feels. it’s easy for me to rant now. but in person i cant even begin to rant without breaking down.",17Jan2020,1
137,"I (23M) had a blood test done a couple weeks ago to monitor how I’m doing on a certain medication. The results alarmed me a bit—for background, my little brother had kidney cancer a few years back, and the way they caught it was through his extremely elevated red blood cell count and creatinine levels. These things were a little high on my test—not extremely, but enough to be outside the normal range that I’ve always been square in the middle of.

I’m waiting to hear back from my doctor about whether she’s alarmed, if it’s due to the medication, if I need to have more tests done, etc. However, if there is reason for concern, the tests to confirm if there’s a problem would likely take a few weeks for me to get all the results; if there is something wrong, and it’s serious, then we’ll likely have to move quickly before it gets any worse. Should I tell my mom now about my initial results?

On the one hand, my family values open communication, and I don’t want her to feel that I was keeping anything from her, especially if it does end up being serious and something we need to act quickly on. I also could use someone to talk to, as I’m a bit worried for my health at the moment and trying to keep my cool until I know more. On the other hand, my brother’s illness was a very difficult time for the whole family, and I don’t want to needlessly worry her over what may end up being nothing serious. I also worry that telling her at this point would be selfish on my part—maybe I’m subconsciously trying to find someone to talk to about it, instead of thinking of what would be best for the whole family. 

Should I tell her now, or wait? If I wait, when do I tell her? When my doctor orders more tests? When we learn the results? When we make a treatment plan? How do I balance my guilt over keeping a secret that could be pretty serious with protecting my family from worry that may end up being needless?",17Jan2020,1

147,"I moved from the midwest where I lived for 30+ years to the Los Angeles area about 5 months ago. I always imagined myself on the west coast, I love visiting the west coast, and I love traveling in general. An opportunity came up for a transfer within my job and I took it. The first few months were exciting. New places to see, exploring, hiking, going up to the mountains, biking at the beach.  

It has been 5 months and suddenly I am absolutely miserable. I could barely function this week. I go to work, I come home and cry and go to bed. I miss home. I miss being just close enough to family that it only took a couple hours drive and I could spontaneously visit. I miss all of my work colleagues and my work environment. I miss my friends. I have gone to some meetup groups and just can't click with anyone. I continue going, but nothing feels like friends.  I am naturally introverted and have some social anxiety and I should have realized how difficult this would be. It's so exhausting to force myself into social situations. I feel absolutely alone. I've got no one to rely on around me. I've got no one to come home and talk to. I didn't realize how much of a comfort that was. The cost of living is really hitting me. I can't make a long term life out here, it is just too expensive. I'm sick of mega traffic, I hate that it takes at least an hour on a good day to get out of the city, I'm irrationally sick of looking at palm trees. I came out here because I like hiking and I like mountains, but I feel like my adventure is over and I just want to return to my base comforts. I used to travel around the US and around the world, I'd go off on my adventures and be able to come home and relax. I feel like I can't relax, I feel like this isn't home, I'm so stressed out and alone.  I've always felt like a strong and independent person, and this has just knocked the wind right out of me. 

Now I miss that snow fall, the home comforts, the sweater weather, my friends, my family. I missed a real autumn. The way I feel is unbearable. I try to stay positive, eat some of the foods I've found that I like here, take walks and go places I like. It's just so hard to keep this up. My stomach is in knots and I'm barely eating. I've skipped meals because I couldn't stomach it. Everything inside of me feels like this is wrong. I regret it. I want to go back home, I had the perfect life, I was happy, I could afford to live and travel, I had friends and family, I had a good job, I could have afforded a house someday, I didn't stress out about money. I don't think I can get that back and I regret everything. California would be great if I grew up here and if I could afford it, if I had friends and family here, if I had people, it's a lovely state. I didn't hate my hometown, I was always just wanting something new like on my travels, but what I didn't realize was that coming back to the comfort of that home was just as nice as the travels.

I'm just looking for how I should approach this. I dwell on wanting to go back in the past and telling myself not to do it. But I can't do that. I don't know how to move forward. My job is good, I like my job, I want to transfer back where I was but openings for my job are limited and I don't know when that might happen for where I transferred from and if I would even get it. I'm afraid of disappointing the people that got me out here. I'm not sure I see a way to deal with this or see a clear way forward. Do I pursue trying to get back by any means necessary? Do I try to stay and make it work? I'm afraid of being seen as a failure if I do move back, by myself and others. I feel like I've messed my life up.",17Jan2020,1

So my parents are very strict to me from a young age, and taught me that we should never do anything “non sustainable”(freelancer, actors, etc). However, ever since I was around 4, I’ve been very interested and just, loved singing. I sang almost everyday when they are not home. After a few years (I am 16 this year), I realized that I wanted to sing for a living. This was the only time I’ve ever had a dream job before so I decided to try for an arts school near my area. But then, I soon realized that reality isn’t a hippity hoppity happy little story. In a moment of hope and optimism, I proposed my dream career to my parents. Well.....my dad slapped me, hard. That was the only time he had hit me before. My mom screamed at me for disappointing the family and wasting their efforts of raising me to become successful. I was shocked. I cried my eyes out until they were swollen that night.

155,"TL;DR: Two days ago, I snapped at my boyfriend's brother (lets call him B), who is 3 years younger than my boyfriend and I, but I'm not sure if I acted the right way.

Basically what happened was that I was face timing my boyfriend and B came into the room asking for help on a math problem, which wasn't an issue at all until he started to continually poke fun at me (now I know this whole issue sounds dumb, but please hear me out). At first, I realized he was joking around (my boyfriend's family is very playful in general, and they like to joke around by pointing out each other's flaws) so I laughed along with him, but as time went by, I noticed that he was progressively getting ruder and didn't cease to stop. Eg. B asked my boyfriend ""What is she even good at?"" in a rather condescending voice, and my boyfriend replied that I spoke different languages. I stayed quiet to give them space, however, B simply snorted at this comment and said ""oh yeah, so the two languages we already know. Thats not special."" All the while I was sitting there, listening to the while thing. I stayed silent because I didn't want to seem like I was overreacting by speaking up about it but progressively, I started feeling angrier and frustrated for not calling him out despite how I felt (eg. ""She has no social life, just sits there and studies, so what IS she good at?"", or ""I'd rather date a dancer, my girlfriend is a dancer and she at least knows how to do something good."", or ""Oh wow, she's in nursing. Just gonna give out needles for a living."") so.. I ended up snapping at B, but also at my boyfriend, because he didn't really do anything about B's behavior except laugh it off.

The reason why I got so angry is first of all, honestly who does he think he is?? I understand that although he has a playful personality, he shouldn't be talking all that smack about me when we don't even know each other well. Secondly, he wasn't even directly asking me these things, but asking my BOYFRIEND. I told B that ""if he was going to talk smack, say it to my face"" and told him how disrespectful he was being. He shouldn't be the one talking smack about people when he was the one needing help..

My boyfriend and his mom thinks I overreacted since B was only joking, but man, it really felt like at the time, B was looking down on me. That wasn't funny. My boyfriend and I talked about it yesterday, and he told me that he didn't know I would take it so seriously, since I was initially laughing along at B's jokes, hence why he didn't stop him. I know its my fault for getting mad at my boyfriend, since it wasn't his fault. I also understand that I should've taken into account that B JUST entered high school, and that its not acceptable for lashing out on someone so young.. But I don't know, I feel like I needed to stand up for myself, especially since I'm so used to letting people push me around and let things slide. I don't want to let myself be a pushover anymore, but since some people tell me that what I did was wrong, it makes me think that I was simply overreacting.

I know this is a rather stupid topic, but I want honest opinions about my justifications to my actions, as well as what I should do to improve my flaws. Theres an unspoken tension whenever my boyfriend and I are together now, and I'm not confident in facing his parents again either. Is this a sign I should cut it off?",17Jan2020,1

(A lot of people joke about my name, but when they did it, they rallied the whole class against me, only reason why It didn’t really matter at the time was mainly because I only had ONE class with them). Soon after the month that they were joking me, I got moved to the other side of the room, and that year ended.

At a really young age I  started using the internet alone (Maybe age 10). I was in an emotionally  abusive household and the only place I could really find comfort was in  the friends I met online. That being said, I didn't make the most sound  decisions. Since I was about 16 I've said some pretty awful things  out-loud (whether they be in social circles I had back then, or general  places on the internet). Some of them are absolutely incriminating. I  kind of swam in this conservative and controversial ideology until I graduated and moved out  at 18, where I was finally able to do things like get therapy for  dealing with my anxiety and depression (medically recognized). I talked  to my therapist about how I feel like in the modern day, the things you  say on the internet stick around and haunt you forever, even if you  don't think like that anymore. It becomes impossible to forgive and  forget your mistakes because your digital footprint is always there.

But this has just been killing me recently. I genuinely can't make friends.
I'm in a program in school that made most of my classes be with the same group of students for the entire 4 years. I've been trying to be friends with the group of people here but I feel like an outcast. No one listens to me, or they ignore me, and I've gotten one of their discords before, but it doesn't help, as I quickly found out that they didn't like me much.

I've tried to talk to people in my other classes but it's to no avail, and now the only class I openly talk to the class in (forensic science) is being removed because the teacher is leaving, because the school hates her for being more conservative in her beliefs and that she's teaching us about ballistics (also the school is very homophobic and she sponsors our school's GSA).

So yeah, I have no friends.
I'm also an introvert, and my anxiety is very horrible, and I also have PTSD. I can't just enjoy myself in school because I get so lonely, and the only person that cares to speak to me is my boyfriend, who I only have one class with.

I'm not looking to change myself, I'm perfectly fine being me, and I think im just generally not compatible with my class, but I just want to at least make friends to talk with because I'm dreadfully lonely all the time.


TL;DR
I'm socially awkward and don't quite know how to make friends.
My classes mostly all consist of the same group of students, who don't really like me for unknown reasons.

164,"I made a post on the serial killer subreddit saying that I had just written a letter to Edmund Kemper and that I would post his response in a follow up post. I thought it'd be interesting to start a dialogue on how to talk to serial killers from my extensive studies and knowledge about the subject. Not long afterwards, I got a notification saying the post was removed because ""it doesn't offer anything of value to any user"" and they said that it was ""against the rules"" to post about writing a serial killer. However, if you were to go through the serial killer subreddit, there are MULTIPLE MULTIPLE posts about writing serial killers. The moderator was also really really rude, and then muted my ability to go on the serial killer subreddit (my favorite subreddit) simply for asking ""where in the rules does it say you can talk about writing serial killers?"" They didn't respond to that, they just muted me from being able to go on the serial killer subreddit. I encourage you to go on the serial killer subreddit and look at the ample amount of posts there are about people writing serial killers.

165,"For the sake of anonymity, we will call my ex ""T."" Well, I met T when we were both 15 years old and both sophomores in high school. We had a good 4 years together, but since we met so young, we grew up and thus kind of grew apart. We just broke up one week ago, and I still consider him to be my best friend. It's a very amicable and mutual break up, and neither one of us blame each other. However, it would be wrong to stay together just because we have a lot of history together, and we both felt like ending the relationship was best for us, for a very long while at least.  

My problem now is that my life used to revolve around my Ex. We met just after I moved from my home state to a new state across the country, so everyone I know here is through my Ex. I know we are still friends and everything is nice between us, but I want to start building a foundation that has nothing to do with him. I want to meet people nearby, and make new friends, but I don't know how! My problem is that I don't want to join a dating app, I don't want to date, I just want to meet new people. I am an adult under 21, so bars or clubs are not an option to meet people. I have no idea where to go because I need a place where it would be appropriate to make friends and mingle. 

What are some things that I can do to help myself feel confident enough to go out, after 4 years of staying in? I need help finding ways to re-enter the social world, so I can make new friends, and possibly eventually date again.

167,"Alright Reddit I've got some questions, and hope to hear your opinions on the topic. A friend of mine committed ""suicide"" almost a year ago now. I'm skeptical about the whole situation because, well he did it and no one heard it (his roommates were less than 50 feet away) 9mm shot to the head. Well while we were mourning, his roommate and baby momma were awfully close (uncomfortably close). I noticed it and said something to them, that it's not right, and makes me feel weird. Keep in mind the ""roommate"" and I had hung out before, went to high school together all that good stuff. Anyways, the roommate was the same person that caused the two to separate, all of this happened at my house. Well needless to say less than a year later the ""roommate"" and baby momma are getting married. I don't associate with them anymore, I can't see the kid that used to call me uncle, all that good stuff. Keep in mind the ""roommate"" was a state patroller so no investigation was done.

The pay is more than the base pay at my current job, but I work overnights, and it pays $1.50 less than my shift differential.  However, it would me only Mon-Fri, 8-5, and I would never have to work holidays.  Currently, I work overnights, weekends and holidays.

The health insurance benefits are much better, but the PTO offered is significantly less (I get 150hrs  per year now, this new place offers 40 hrs in the first year).

173,"So...it's been a very long and trying day. I will do my best to detail everything I can.

I am rather sick, and today I was at home asleep. I get a call from an area where my Credit Union operates. I answer it and the conversation goes about like this:

Lady: ""hello, this is So-and-So (i don't actually remember her name) from X Credit Union. We've detected unusual spending on your account. There is a charge from Delta Airlines for $499. Are you traveling in LA, Calafornia?""

Me: ""No.""

Lady: ""Ok, we have put a hold on your account. Don't worry, no charges have gone through yet. This is for our recorded line, can you verify your mother's maiden name?""

She goes on to ask me all the typical bank identity verification questions, confirming each with ""Yes that's what we have on file.""

She goes on to explain that the debit card used to make these attempted charges has been compromised and needs to be replaced. And then she asks me to verify my PIN.

Now, please don't judge me. She seemed very legitimate and I was just woken from a deep sleep and my brain is very foggy from being sick.

I realize in hindsight that this was a mistake. Turns out she was scamming me. She somehow had enough of my information in order to put a travel notice on my account for Florida. With my PIN, she then proceeded to wipe all of my accounts clean at several different ATMs and stores in Tampa, FL. 

A few hours later, I go to check my accounts and realize what happened. I immediately call my bank and they say that I need to go into my branch to close my account and open a new one. While I am at this branch, I ask the branch manager what can be done about this fraud, what are my options to get my money back, etc. She tells me that I can file a police report, but otherwise they can't help me at all - but she had the audacity to try and sell me on a loan. 

So I call friends and family and let them know what happened, and they tell me that CU's are insured for this reason. So I call the fraud department and they say that I can fill out a ""Member Fraud Packet"". So my current plan is to go into the branch as soon as they open tomorrow and fill this out. 

But my question is what do I need to know about NCUA and my rights when it comes to fraud like this? Because it seems like the answer is different depending on who I talk to at my bank and I'm really unsure of how to find the information and how to be prepared. I'm entirely un-knowledgable and unequipped when it comes to stuff like this.",17Jan2020,1
174,"I’m pretty new to driving and I don’t trust myself going to where the concert is taking place as it’s almost an hour and a half away so I’m deciding on taking an Uber or having my sister take me which she doesn’t mind. This will be the first concert I got to by myself. 

I’m not taking any of my siblings because they don’t like the band I’m seeing as much as I do and they refuse to pay anything over $70. I’m spending at least $120-160 and I’m not paying for their ticket because I’ve done it a few times and two they’re not that fun in concerts. I wanna be banging my head and singing along and stuff and they just stand there even when everyone around them is having a good time. It kill my whole mood honestly.

176,"I’ve had depression since like 14 years old and when my mom found out, she got mad at me.

And now I’m trying to move out and wanting to see the world, my mom is suddenly latching herself on to me.

178,"I’ve grew up being spoiled. I know, I’m sorry for my existence. I’m literally the definition of spoiled brat and my family never lets go of that notion they have for me. 

But just because I’m spoiled, I’m not allowed to complain? I’m not allow to disagree? Wow does that sound shitty, but please read my story. 

I’ve grown up with a mom who’s always working (never around) and a missing dad. My mom spoiling me is the way for her to show her love. She feels bad for leaving me all the time so she uses gifts as an excuse for her absence. 

And as I grew I increasingly became more spoiled. She lets me do mostly everything however she still helicopter parents me to this day. I’m 17 and still need to let my mom meet my friends, know where my location is before going out w them. 

but I guess it’s whatever. 

We argue all the time now, and I can’t stand talking to her because everytime it turns into an argument. And when she pulls up the, “Youre so spoiled card! I gave you everything and I can’t believe this is how you treat me”. The conversation is over. 

Because I can’t counter that. 

Some arguments I’m in the wrong. However when I’m right she either pulls that card or stops the conversation at her own terms. Today she crossed that line. 

Background: When my mom left she made my unstable, clearly stressed out (11 year old) cousin to take care of me (5 year old). She was being taken care of by my mother as she came from a third world country with her brother and mom. She abused me on some occasions, other times she just traumatized the shit outta me. Now she’s fine, through a lil hurtful sometimes I forgave her. Through I stand by my words that what she did was wrong, no matter the circumstance. 

Argument: 
Mom: Your cousin was only 11 years old when she did that to you! It was my fault, I shouldn’t have let her babysit you all the time!

(“It” refers to when she threatened and shook me violently when I was naked and learning how to shower by myself (I was scared of showers for some reason. Stupid fear but as a terrified 7 year old I don’t know what to say))

Me: Ok so it was your fault. Wait why could you just hired a real babysitter for the all of us then?

Mom: (gets mad) I didn’t have the money! I was working all the time, I can’t believe you asked that and said it was my fault. It was because you didn’t want to go with me to work and always wanted to stay home! 

(Mom has her own business I would go all the time as a kid until I finally got sick of the place. I just wanted to chill my child ass at home y’all. I’m sorry)

Me: Wait so we blaming this on me now? 

Mom: IT WAS NOBODY’S FAULT. STOP TRYING TO BLAME PEOPLE! WHY CAN’T YOU JUST LET IT GO?!

Me: (Surprised pikachu face) I already forgave her, that’s why I still talk to her. I’m just saying it was wrong that she did that. Because I know it certainly wasn’t right for doing me like that. (Starts getting emotional, I have a shit grasp on my emotions) PLEASE I don’t want to talk about this anymore please get out of my room!

Mom: WHY CANT YOU PUT YOURSELF IN OTHER PEOPLE’S SHOES. I KNEW IT I SPOILED YOU TOO MUCH! THATS WHY YOU ACT LIKE THIS! YOU’RE SO DISRESPECTFUL! I WOULD NEVER TELL MY MOM TO GET OUT OF MY ROOM. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT OF MY FUCKING HOUSE? GET OUT! 

She turned this on me like that y’all. Because I was spoiled growing up, she stormed out of my room and now I don’t wanna speak to her. But last time I didn’t speak to her she’d get mad after a while. I just don’t want to start another argument and it’s sad our relationship is this way now. 

And it’s all because I’m a spoiled brat. I blame myself for this and if I dare try to blame my mom I’m entirely that- I’m 100% a spoiled shit. So I’m always 100% in the wrong, and my mom can do no wrong because she my mom. 

And she always says that I blame her for everything despite she tells me she blames herself. 

Am I wrong like my mom tells me I always am? Is it my fault? Please tell me Reddit, if I’m wrong I’ll try to correct my ways. Thank you. 

TLDR: I’m always the spoiled shit, if I ever try to correct or tell my story/opinion I’m always in the wrong. Mom refuses to listen to anything I say and when I do the same, it’s wrong because I’m suppose to be the bigger one or else I’m always gonna be named a spoiled brat.",17Jan2020,1

180,"I’m tired, cold, stressed, and hungry. So I’m gonna keep this brief.

Started working at a ski resort near my house today. Me and one of my best friends both have created the same schedule so we have each other. We won’t always be with each other of course but it’s nice to have breaks and carpool. 

Anyway I was put in a shack at the top of a slope today. I feel like I didn’t really know how to use the walkie talkie well. Then this dad fucking cursed me out because his little kid slipped when she got off the lift and bumped her head on the chair (she had a helmet on and was literally calm and fine. The dad was the one flipping out). 

Then the lift accidentally stopped for like 10 mins because of me. I was so embarrassed and almost had a panic attack but I kept my cool. This little bar fell out and I didn’t notice because I have anxiety and I was so frazzled and mad from that dude yelling at me that I didn’t notice. 

I have a bad quitters mentality because I’ve had horrible anxiety all my life — which I do see a therapist for — and it’s so easy for me to quit things when they get hard or uncomfortable because I don’t like my stress levels to skyrocket. 

I know I can’t quit because I was so miserable sitting around with no job doing absolutely nothing. I want to get better at this without all this anxiety. 

I worked from 3-9:30 today and tomorrow I have 10:45-5:00. I’m dreading it. I need to stop being a whiny wimp and just do it but god that really discouraged me.",17Jan2020,1

184,"So here’s the thing, I just got out of a very toxic relationship and I can’t tell if I’m rebounding, I have fallen in love with this girl, or I just loved the conversation I had with her. So here is my story:

While I was in my relationship, I was going through a very rough patch and I wasn’t sure if we were gonna stay together, so I was texting my friend who was on a vacation to Malibu with his girlfriend and her two brothers, this night (in the midst of my very very rough patch) I was texting about his trip when his girlfriend took his phone and started texting me. Maybe it was because they were drinking but she seemed really interested in our conversation, so we talked and we had a lot in common, since I’m a wide range of everything including, German, Irish, Italian, etc. she loved that saying she has a whole lot of respect for people like me. Keep in mind her boyfriend is also from the same area so she loves that too, so back to me and her. We both love the same music, both have very cool backgrounds, and over all have very similar view to life, unfortunately our conversation didn’t last that long because my friend wanted his phone back, so we said goodbye and I was honestly sad to see her go. After that I would reread our convo over and over again and I couldn’t tell why I loved it so much. That was a couple weeks ago, since then me and my ex broke up. Just last night I had a dream about her where she is still with my friend, but me and her were hanging out alone. In this dream (since I’m omniscient in my dreams) I knew she was falling for me and I had already fallen for her in the dream, so we drive around and go to dinner and what not, we don’t have sex but she scrapes her knee and I care for her, mean while this guy says something to offend her. He is twice my seize and had biceps the size of basketballs, also, I’m pretty much a pixie stick that can max maybe 145 pounds bench pressing and around 225 deadlift, so I’m not very strong but I beat him up anyway, and as I make my way back to the car I tend to her knee and as we are about to kiss the dream ends

Does this mean I love my friend’s girlfriend? Is it just a rebound? Or have I just been in love with the conversation with her?

186,"I'm having a really hard time with a lot of things in my life right now. My father started to verbally abuse me and my sisters since I was 6 or 7. My oldest sister got depression and whatever she did was just written off as ""she has depression do it's ok for her to do whatever"". Since I can't remember anything before 6, I kinda just thought what my dad did was what all parents do. My mom became toxic when I was about 10. She locked me in a bathroom for a day or two with only water. Then every one of my birthdays, I woke up, went to swim practice, can home, and was locked in my room. With no food (except for my storage which was only a few non-perishables). Whenever my parents got into a fight, my dad would leave, my mom would scream at us, and then leave while my oldest is begging for her to not go. This would happen only at my house and theme parks. About three months ago my dad became angry for some reason I can't remember. My sister and I got into a fight and she stomped off. About 5 minutes later I wanted to go find her to apologize, but my dad screamed at me that if I didn't let her go, I wouldn't get dinner. So I went to find my sister. My mom just have come downstairs and asked Dad what happened and then screamed at him because a few minutes later I was heading back inside and my mom went to Rachel, talked with her, then left. My dad left shortly after. My dad and mom decided to get a divorce, but where I live, you have to live separately for one year before you can. So my dad got an apartment and this is where my memory of what my parents did to me came back. I stopped loving them. I kept me having depression a secret. I didn't do a social studies essay. Eventually I told my mom everything. Especially that I think I have depression. She says ok and that she'll take me to a therapist the next week. Two months go by and no therapist. Then I see my older sister vaping today. I don't want to live anymore. My life is living hell. The only reason I haven't committed yet, is because of my boyfriend and best friend.

190,"So today I ordered some Jamaican food on Uber eats. I got an oxtail platter for the grand price of 20 dollars ( before Uber eats fees). Mind you I am aware that this is a steep price for oxtail as I usually pay about 7-10 dollars for a regular oxtail platter, but this was the only place available and the picture on the app depicted this big platter with about 8-10 oxtail bones and a liberal serving of rice so I figured that the price must be worth it. Long story short I ended up paying 36 dollars for this food. When it arrived however, it was literally nothing like the picture. The food was cold. Like ice cold and not only that but they gave me one and a half oxtail bones... WTF. They decided to cut the bones in half and gave me 3 halves. I guess to make it seem like there was more. Obviously I was upset and I wrote to Uber eats customer service to ask for a refund. I even sent a picture of the 3 halves as proof. And they basically said something along the lines of “ sorry but we can’t give you a refund. You can rate the restaurant in order to help them improve their food.” I really don’t want to be “that person” but honestly this was a total rip off. 20 freaking dollars for 3 oxtail bone halves?!?

I've had a friend for around 3 years now and we've never been extremely close but still friends. He's always had anger issues and all that but my other friends and I have managed to deal with it, along with his parents. However, it's getting far worse now, and it's reaching it's climax. Up until last Saturday, I was dating his twin brother (I'm female, if you were wondering) and I broke up with him because he wasn't putting much effort into the relationship, and he barely texted me unless I texted him (obviously there's more that I don't want to share, but those are valid reasons in itself). Of course, my friend had something to say about that, and started harassing me over text message, demanding to know what happened and why I did what I did. In an attempt to get him to leave me alone, I gave him a brief summary of what had happened, but of course he wasn't satisfied. He insisted that I explain myself and he tried to tell me what I was feeling. He said that my reasons weren't valid (because, according to him, communication isn't that important), and that I was being dumb. Throughout this I tried to tell him that I don't have to explain anything to him and that he doesn't have a right to my personal business, to which he responded with ""Well the fact that you are replying to my ""interrogation"" proves that I have every right."" Yeah, pretty crazy. Hopefully you guys can give me some advice on how to deal with it. He seems to believe that he has every right to my business and can't keep his nose out of anything. It's like I have to run everything I do by him for his seal of approval. Please help.

201,"So a few days ago I went for a medical school interview and the setup of the interview itself was very casual. I was sent an email that referred me to an alumni that went there and met up at a coffee shop. I was probed with the usual med school interview questions and some casual things. I was told earlier that this would be a more casual interview to get to know my personality as some of the more serious questions about school would be answered beforehand on a sheet of paper to be submitted. 

So here's where things started changing. During the interview he asked me a bunch if things, one including about why I didnt order food at the cafe. I said I was on a diet, to which he briefly said that I looked nice. I shrugged it off as someone who isn't too serious and just being friendly. So I go home and that was it. The next day, I texted him to let him know that I answered the questions on the sheet of paper and to please look over them to be reviewed. Blah blah more med school stuff. Okay. Then he said something along the lines of ""aside from [med school stuff] we can meet again for drinks, not a cafe"". I dont know how, but it escalated from there. He asked me about parties and my favorite kind of alcohol and very flirty. Hes hinted that he wants to do kinky things with me and invited me over to his apartment and just now initiated sexting. I have been more or less dodging his questions but I guess I am misleading him. 

I'm looking for advice on this if anyone's been in this situation before or if you know of anyone who has. I am wondering if this is illegal too? Not sure. FYI (VERY IMPORTANT) he told me during the interview that he is not part of the committee that decides whether I get accepted or not. He will, however, be a great influence on what he summarizes and will send to the committee regarding my questions I answered on the paper and my personality when we met. Not sure if this matters but this is for a Carribean medical school.",17Jan2020,1

204,"**My mom made me move out to live with my aunt and uncle** (all of their kids, my cousins, got into **ivy league schools**.) At first it was because of her shingles, but now I think its something else. Maybe my grades? She claimed it was my behavior but idk? I've been wanting to quit Adderall ever since I started it basically but about 4 or 5 months in, and its almost impossible to quit because I will do shit in school while I'm detoxing. I was doing better in school before I started taking it as well, doing worse now in sophomore year. I've been with my aunt and uncle for almost 3 months now and they've signed me up for about 6 different people to watch me 24/7, including a pharmacist (really a therapist), an actual therapist, a mindfulness program, an ""executive function help"" lady, and a fake track coach who watches me while I work out, as well as a tutor. I don't believe I need any of these people, I'm not depressed, I don't really have any issues, and don't see why I would need therapists or anything like that. I love my mom, but  all my life I have wished my mom cared significantly less. (Don't have a dad) (Might I add that **my mom is anti vaccine** to give you an idea of the type of person, this also shows she might care for me TOO MUCH, because she believes they might be dangerous.) I'm a determined kid who wants to be able to thrive on my own and flourish into the person I want to be without constant care. To give you an idea of the type of people my aunt and uncle are, they take away my phone every chance they get, watch me 24/7, make sure I fall asleep at 11:00pm, and set a timer for my showers and wait outside, constantly knocking on the door to make sure I get out.  I'm not a bad student, I'm a good 16 year old kid and run a few very successful businesses, which I'm proud of at my age. After I was talking to my aunt and uncle about **quitting** **Adderall** they advised that what I **ACTUALLY** need to do is to not only **INCREASE** my dosage, but also **to take a 12 HOUR VERSION 7 DAYS A WEEK** and a 12 hour version + a 4 hour version on school days. I've talked to literally every person trying to ""help"" me(all the therapists etc.), that I wan't to quit, but of course they wont help because they're making money off of the situation. Instead of support, I'm only getting told I need MORE Adderall instead of less.

205,"Hi, everyone. I'm kind of in a conundrum here.

Simply put, I detest my current work place. I honestly cannot stand working there anymore. The environment is toxic, there's practically no camaraderie with anyone in my workplace (except for the people in my department, I get along with them really well), the overall morale is extremely low (we barely get any sort of recognition or feel any sense of accomplishment no matter how hard we worked), and it feels like it's mentally destroying me from the inside. I dread getting up from bed to go to work and can only imagine the kind of horrors I would have to face every day of the week while I'm there. I can only find comfort in the weekends, but the anxiety starts to build up on Sundays, knowing I have to go back to that hellhole the next day.

As of now, I am looking for a job with a few interviews lined up for next week. Because of how toxic the environment is in my workplace, I've been very tempted to put in my 2 weeks at a moments notice. However, knowing how job searching is like, there's that sense of discomfort knowing that it might take a bit of time before I eventually land one. I've saved up quite a good amount of money from my current job, so I'm financially secure. I'm also currently living with my parents with the intent of moving out once I find a future opportunity.

Based on my situation, Should I quit my job or should I stick with it until I find another one?

Thanks for the help",17Jan2020,1
206,"Not looking for a diagnosis here. But here is how I would describe my father. 

I grew up not understanding why my dad would not show me any affection. I didn’t really get hugs or kisses, and when I did they were awkward or felt forced. Then, he responds to things like “I love you” or “thank you” with just a head shake or a “mmph” noise. This low key kinda fucked me up over the years. It was really hard to get him to leave the house to support me for any kind of recital or performance I was in and he was notorious for being late AF to everything. When I would go to daycare after school, he would be the last parent to pick me up at 5:55 on the dot whenever the business closed at 6. Note, he got off at 5...

He is extremely smart, borderline on the barely socially functional side. He is extremely in his own world to the point where it makes others in his life feel neglected. My mom divorced him because she realized he would never come around and want to spend time with her, he only wanted to work on his studies. I found myself around the age of 10 questioning why my dad would never spend time with me when it was his turn with custody on weekends. I mean, I would literally have to fend for myself starting around age 7 every time I got dropped off at his house he was so stuck in his studies. Im now 20 years old and go to college out of state. I came home for winter break this year, and for the whole month that I’ve been here he has only seen me three times and it’s always been me approaching him. It breaks my heart because one time when we had lunch it was with his coworkers and all of the things he mentioned about me to them were dated things, as if he didn’t even know anything about me. Which is crazy considering I do stay in touch while I’m away. 

He’s one of those people who are referred to as being “geniuses” by their peers. Sometimes I’ve heard excuses for why he is so shy, because nerds are supposed to be shy or whatever stereotypically speaking. He is a very established and well known author and historian. He has a doctorate in history and a masters in English, multiple published books, is locally “famous” for this... When he isn’t writing his next book or at his job as an archivist, he’s listening to his favorite history podcasts. He told me he’s listened to 300 hours in the past year. 

He also dresses relatively the same way every day and has done so for almost 20 years now. Some may say that’s typical of men, but I’m talking certain details that just won’t budge. He has to wear a certain kind of boot, khakis, polo, tucked in always, super white socks, etc. I don’t think Ive ever seen my dad out of a polo shirt unless it was a graphic tee he wears to bed. 

So, now that I’ve described my dad to you, here is where I need advice. I’ve confronted my dad about his behavior in the past, trust me. Every single thing I’ve mentioned has been discussed and just sort of shaken off by him as not a big deal regardless of how it affects other people. *My dad never got tested*. His parents were both “trophies”, my grandma was the hottest cheerleader in town and my grandpa was a rock and roll legend where we’re from. Their egos were way too high to think anything else but that their kid was just a quirky genius. Do I bring this up to my dad? Is it even my place to get him tested, and even if he did get it done, would it even change anything beside having some kind of closure for why he’s basically neglected me my entire life emotionally? I just don’t know what to do with this information. Like should I just continue life assuming he has a problem so that it makes it easier on myself for why he does what he does?",17Jan2020,1

210,"So this is gonna seem a little insane and honestly this whole situation feels insane.

So at the end of 2019, there was an unexpected death of a friend. He got sick, like really sick, and his body just gave up. This obviously devastated a lot of people, myself included, as it was so sudden.

One person it really affected was my best friend, because she was basically in love with the guy. They had known each other for way longer than I knew him. She's been so sad ever since and I'm trying everything I can to help her.

Why I'm coming here is because they were basically flirting with each other for a couple of years. I'm talking sending pics, suggestive topics, and texting everyday. She was super into him and, I thought, he was into her since he kept asking for more. A small problem though, they never made it official. He kept saying he ""needed time to figure some stuff out.""

But here's the thing, I found out from an acquaintance who is friends with this guy's family that he had a girlfriend. I was shocked and disgusted almost immediately. But, I can't find evidence on how long they were together, if they were together. I did some Facebook stalking (I know I'm horrible) and this girlfriend did post a giant message about missing him and that ""he left too soon."" But there are no photos of them being together on his or her pages. There aren't even any posts of them being tagged together in stuff. Regardless, I'm pissed off at him because, if this is true, he was basically lying to my best friend and betraying her trust, as well as cheating on his girlfriend.

I'm asking now, is it okay for me to never tell my best friend about this supposed girlfriend of his? She's already taking his sudden passing so hard and I feel like this might destroy her.",17Jan2020,1
212,"Recently, I was watching a video I made of myself. Nothing new, you've probably done the same at one point. But while watching, I noticed several things:

\-The gap between who I thought I was vs who I actually am really took me by surprise

\-I sound so different from what I thought it's not even funny (I also found out I can't sing. And I liked singing so much!)

\-Unrelated, but one side of my face is droopy, almost windswept, and my lip doesnt really *move* on that side, if you know what I mean. It is noticeable and very weird to look at. Maybe i'll get it checked out

\---

I was watching myself in a whole new light. I knew I was weird, but I wasn't expecting this at all! (I just wanted to sing...). 

You might be asking, ""but where does this whole Autism thing come into play?"" I've actually had suspicions for a while. (Note: **Suspicions**. I will not self diagnose). My interests are always very specific and I never think about anything else, *ever*, once I am in to something. Apart from that, I am just not  very good with people. I like speaking in front of crowds, and I am not afraid to share what I like (never ends well), and I am always open to making new friends. But after watching myself, I felt I was totally missing out on what was really happening. It is a miracle that I even have friends! Anyway, I was wondering how much I actually stood out. I was starting to wonder if people were just keeping their mouths shut. Even though no one openly hates me, honestly, I wouldn't even be able to tolerate me, so it's definitely a wonder. 

But here's the thing. I am still living under adult supervision and care, so if I really wanted something done, I would have to ask them. I am always trying everyday to be a better person (even though I am never studying hah...) and I think if I do end up having autism, or something is wrong, then it would be a really hard to get back up. And in technical terms too. I have seen a documentary where they didn't hire the autistic person because he was autistic. It's really hard to get rid of the label once you have it. 

So, what should I do? I am **suspecting something** like autism/aspergers amongst other things, so I am not overthinking about one thing. Should I just leave it? Would I be better off that way? (For those who are bassing on personal experience) What would ultimately benefit me in the end?

Thanks!

I primarily wanted to get a job as a developer, but I had this job and another that was in the immediate area of where I'm from, but was just a tech support role at the end of the day which was not what I wanted. After deciding to take this job I initially had it planned to just be in the job for a year or two then go back home. I enjoy doing what I do to an extent and the software I am working with is really cool, as so are the people I work with (my bosses are some of the best people I have met and worked with). I do get to work on and write code on an internal program we use and absolutely love it. Any time I get to spend my day working on it, my day is gone in a blink which helps me know that I am truly in the career field I truly enjoy. The fault for me in this instance is my loyalty. Loyal to my family, my friends, and my employer. Which is what makes this a hard decision.

I cut off ties completely because I really could not deal with the constant bullshit anymore and it became extremely toxic. The healing process was extremely difficult. There were days where I felt disgusted with myself and how I looked. Days where I would blame myself. Nights where I had shut down completely where I couldn't eat or talk and just cried myself to sleep. Even with a great and big support system, it was rough. 

However, they have recently come back into my life. They have apologized multiple times and have shown that they are truly sorry. But I still can't bring myself to forgive them because they had all the time when I was struggling to apologize, but didn't.

This is still a problem because he can't bring himself to be awake the rest of the day, so after a few hours, he drops dead in bed for another good 10 hours. And to make things worse, he's the heaviest sleeper I've ever known. You have no idea. 

We don't have school right now, but soon will, and this habit of him makes me extremely worried, because it can affect his performance. Any advice for him on how to start having a healthier sleep?",17Jan2020,1

I want a career in computing, looking into courses there are things like math involved that I was not the best in highschool. That’s fine, I’m sure I can take courses before entering the program. My real problem is my brain. I feel like I’m so slow, mentally and emotionally. Obviously this was bound to happen, but I guess my question is will it get better? Should I even consider a course academically driven? Because I’m being told by everyone that I should just go into a trade but that is the last thing I want :(",17Jan2020,1

It's only 7 of us in the office. aAll female and we love to shop online. Most of the time, we order altogether, using one debit card and we'll all venmo our share to the person with the card. Everyone except this lady that I will call Josie. She will pay cash. All the time. Worse, Josie will wait until paycheck to pay. She has never offered to use her card for anything. She said her husband cannot shopping transactions in her account. 

Josie also will take half of the food on everyone's plate. She will bring leftovers for lunch for ""everyone to eat"" while she ""tries"" our food. When guests bring 2 boxes of donuts for our office, she will take 1 box for her because she thinks she deserves it. One time, an employee from the sister company gave $100 for boba, costed $25 and then pocketed the change.

Today, Josie did something unbelievably wrong. Like can't you see the huge eff-ing line in front of  you wrong. She asked for 10 pcs of feminine pads and she'll pay for them on Tuesday when she comes back from vacation. We were all like wuuuuuuttttt.

I dont have a lot of money to spare, but I feel like it'd be a bit of an empty gesture unless I were to donate the money I made as well from those few extra hours. And if I were to do that should I do it myself or ask them to do it for me? (I trust that they would do it.)

Im 18 (ik theres no rush, but I do want to make money) &amp; my mom always wanted me to be a Nurse (filo mom lol), and I looked up to that she had always mentioned how she worked hard for her masters and bachelor’s (shes no longer a RN as when we moved to Canada in order to practice again she would have to go to school for all the years she had already done to just be a nurse again). Up at the point of when I was in highschool when people started asking me what did I want to be I always answered one of two things (1) an engineer (2) something in computer sciences. 

I did want to go to a top university as well but now I’m enrolled in a college as I wouldn’t say perform well in highschool as I did just not up to what I really could’ve gotten. 

I’ve payed my first semester tuition by myself and now I’m considering it was a waste. And all these books..

More so i hate how life is in this experience and it is nothing but striving to get a boring job grinding for money for almost no higher purpose. I feel like the society and oppertunities i apparantly have is not motivating or worthwhile. Im next to broke just under 7k canadian, and have no career or interest in working fulltime. I know some think im entitled and maybe i am, however i thought life would have better options but not for the poor. Im i think im close to asking for the cheque and leaving. But at the same time i always end up just going throught the day playing video games because the worlds in the system are so much more immersive and entertaing then the real one.

Everytime i get a job its because i think i can stick it out and get money but i know money does not motivate me much anymore. I want free time and to explore the world and enjoy whats left of being young if any is left. I see so many things i see as problems with society and it kills my workethic i guess.

My family is broken and poor, i am poor, my options are work with what i see as bad oppertunities.

I need a damn break from this or like a reset or somthing, i feel dread waking up to go to work. Eventhough people in my position would stick it out and probably do alright.

I have a hard time being motivated by apparant oppertunities

I hate how unfair the world is run

I hate being confined to terrible oppertunities because of financial and social class systems

I hate my parents because they caused this

252,"Preface: I started work at a small business 4 months ago now. The chain of command regarding this situation starting from the bottom is as follows:

1. Me, along with one other also in my position 
2. My Direct Supervisor (Named Rob for the sake of a name}
3. CEO and Founder of the Company (Phil, Who my Rob and I work side-by-side with day to day)

I may also note that this is a small company with less than 20 employees who take part in various tasks for the company. There is no HR department or anything formal like that.

I am new to the industry and Rob has been doing this for about 4 years now. He has a TON of knowledge and basically teaches me anything I know or will know in the future. Rob has the direct ear of Phil, the CEO, and founder, and is closest to him out of anyone in the company. It is well known that Rob is the lifeline between Phil and the rest of us. It is also well known that Phil takes the word of Rob very seriously.

I have committed myself to work as much as I can. I never say no to a task presented to me and always attempt to go above and beyond, stay late, and do whatever it takes to get the work done.

The issue: There have been many instances where Rob will express to my coworker and myself the displeasure of Phil in an attempt to get us to work harder or stay longer on any given day. We never hear it from Phil himself.

When either my coworker or I say no for any reason to Rob in regards to staying late or working out of the office, Rob will make comments such as ""I don't know what Phil is going to think..."", ""I don't know how this is going to look..."", and things of this nature.

Today I informed Rob that I will not be able to work this weekend because I will be out of town with family. 20 minutes later as we are leaving, he says in front of my coworker and I ""Man, \[insert my name here\], is on the verge of getting fired! He doesn't want to get this done over the weekend."" He said this with a smile on his face and with a joking tone but I am sure it need not be explained how this is all sorts of wrong. 

Long story short: I feel like I am being manipulated to doing with Rob wants me to do at any given moment because he knows that we know he has Phil's ear and can spin the story on us at any moment. This is starting to stress me out in a very negative way outside of work. I'm not sure what to do or if I should do anything at all. I need the job and need the money at this point in my life.

Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you.",17Jan2020,1

So i brought this up and he says that distance is hard. I just said ok. He then comments about how it means i should move closer and i told him id have no problem moving if we could actually meet and see if our dynamic actually works out beyond the screen. And i asked him if distance werent hard what would he do different and since it is what is he going to do he replied we would han I g out etc etc and that he does not know what hell do since it is hard.

Since then I have always had trouble letting people get to know me as well as not knowing who I truly am. I feel that since then I have put on a mask of who I wanted people to think I was and now it has been so long that I have trouble knowing myself. I still struggle stuffing down my emotions, and don't know how to express emotions well. On top of that my father passed away 2 months ago from cancer, and I know I still need to process that, and will for a long time. Now is the time for me to go back and process the trauma of my parents divorce that has left me feeling alone, and lost in my pursuit of knowing, and loving myself.

A year later, I live with roommates who are all my friends, and I’m trying to make more friends. I am in a major that I love now and am doing things that will give me the career I want. However, there are things I’ve recently experienced that make me worry I may be developing schizophrenia:

- I suffer from both anxiety and depression.

- I used to see flashes and dots in my peripheral vision, or even movement, and it would freak me out. But after I stopped being scared of them, they went away.

- I feel a lot more connected to the world, but every now and then, I feel like the world is unfamiliar and unreal.

- I occasionally get hypnagogic hallucinations.

- I’m a hypochondriac.

- I’m not as good socially as I used to be. I feel like there’s always a wall between me and other people, so it’s hard to form attachments. But recently, I’ve been able to break down this wall a bit while talking with a friend and it made me so happy to finally feel a genuine connection again that I almost cried.

- Sometimes my brain convinces itself that the simulation theory could still be true or that the world isn’t real.

- I also have a history of marijuana abuse while I was a teenager.",17Jan2020,1
283,"Hi everyone!, I was recently hired at the new company (like two days ago). I’ve put a lot of thought in and I would like to continue going to school.

284,"Love.

I believe love is a drug. You can easily get addicted. I honestly believe it’s the worse drug to ever exist. My heart has felt this drug a few times in life. It’s an amazing high. Something I can’t explain. You feel it rush through your body. All because of one human being. I told myself this year was going to be my year because the past 5 years of my life has been mainly about love. I thrive off of being in love. I love being in love. It’s a drug I wouldn’t mind being on forever. But I just happen to meet someone once again. I often keep a small circle. Family and 1 childhood friend. Other than that I really don’t associate with anyone else in my daily life. I either put 100 percent into someone or none at all. So in my past 5 years of life I’ve had 3 boyfriends all which have lasted more than a year. All in those 3 boyfriends I lost myself in the process of loving them. When I’m in love I’m willing to even give up myself. It’s so wrong. Why do I act this way? Is there any way to start working towards not being this way? Or am I just like this? Is it healthy? I’m just so lost. I’ve always known I’ve loved much more deeply than other people. It’s one thing I used to be really hard on myself for. But I sort of learned to accept it.

285,"First off, if you're just going to be judgy please don't comment. I need real help right now.

I'm a high school senior. I have a flash drive that has a bunch of nsfw pictures of some guys ive talked to, and some pictures of me (mostly my face) in a folder clearly labeled ""Me"". Some are guys I've catfished, I don't really do that anymore however one of those guys is on my flash drive. I think I either lost it at school, likely close to the end of the day, or on an RTD bus/walking home. I don't know what to do, I'm starting college in the fall, and kinda worried that my life could be ruined. I'm gay and most people at my school aren't exactly supportive, so if someone at school found this and instead of turning it in decided to go through it, or if administration decided to check it, I really don't know what I'd do. It was on my keychain that I'm always carrying and I don't remember feeling it getting snagged so I'm slightly worried that someone may have taken it on purpose too. I'm planning on getting into class early so I can check everywhere it might be and I've already emailed RTD but besides this I don't know what to do.

286,"I (25 M) have been seeing this guy (27 M) for a while now, around ten or eleven months. We met when I was on a break with my long distance boyfriend where we allowed ourselves to see other people. At first I didn't think much would come of this relationship at the time, but we've been seeing each other fairly regularly. I have since ended my long term relationship as of October and have continued to see this guy, but I've realized for some time now that I just don't have feelings for him, and after this long of knowing him I don't think that's going to change or there's any real chance of them developing anymore. 

The thing is, our relationship has never been explicitly romantic. It's been physically intimate and there's been talk of us potentially being in a relationship someday, but we're not together per se. That said, I think being together is his long term goal but I've realized it's not mine. Truthfully, it's hard for me to even talk to him, as he's nice but I often struggle to meaningfully connect with him as a friend, let alone more than that. I tend to be somewhat of a private person around people I don't know well, and though my guard has gone down in the past few months, it still feels like he's struggling to get to know me. 

Ultimately I think I just can't be myself around him and don't really know what to do. I'm not sure if I should cut off the relationship completely, or just tell him I'm not interested in being anything more than friends. If I cut off the relationship, I could be ending a potential friendship. On the other hand, if I tell him I just want to be friends, he may construe it as me leading him on. Plus, I don't really think we have much common ground in the first place, and I just don't feel myself around him, as hard as he tries to get me to open up, it never feels natural for me.

289,"So I met this girl a few weeks ago and ever since she's given me pretty much all the signals she likes me, even though she has a long-distance boyfriend. She asks me to hang out constantly -- like get drinks, go to yoga with her, etc. One night we hung out and she took pictures of me surreptitiously -- just pictures of me sitting on the couch, walking around, etc. She texts me throughout the day, sends selfies sometimes. She likes and comments on my IG pictures and tags me in hers.

This is the first time I've been attracted to a women and received so much attention from her. I'm 23 and don't normally get much interest from women, so it's uncharted territory. Inside I know the mature thing would be to try and continue being friends with her, but it's honestly so hard. Whenever our conversations get deep or heated I want to go in for a kiss but know I can't.

290,"okay I made a throwaway for this because it's actually really personal, it's never even something I've put into words so sorry if this makes zero sense, but basically I'm so confused about what's going on in my brain. For reference I'm 19 and a female! 

okay here comes the damn essay about my stupid brain. Diagnosed with anorexia in 2015 and have never properly shaken it mentally despite being physically recovered/weight-restored for some time now (2 years approximately). I never understood myself why I developed it/what triggered it, as I went through my past/family history with my therapist and all the 'typical' triggers for an eating disorders in young women weren't there, i.e. past abuse, a family history of mental illness, all that kind of thing. 

recently I've been thinking, and I realised that all my 'body goals' are literally skinny guys. while most girls my age want to look like kylie jenner or bella hadid or whatever, I don't find that attractive. and I always thought that maybe skinny guys were just my 'type', but more and more I realise that not only are they my 'type', but I almost want to look like them. and I've realised recently that my anorexia came on very strongly and suddenly at around the time that I hit puberty, it was literally me rejecting the changes in my body at the time. if that even makes sense. It doesn't make sense to me, I mean I know I'm a girl and I feel like a girl, I just don't like the body that accompanies it. 

I never connected the development of my anorexia to literally trying to starve off physical changes, but in hindsight I think it was subconsciously. I was trying to stop myself from developing the body I have now, which I feel so deeply uncomfortable with despite being a healthy weight.

I genuinely don't know what's going on, like as I've matured I almost start to hate being a girl more and more - like I want kids eventually, but the thought of actually having to have them makes me sick to my stomach and I can't think of anything worse. Almost every aspect of being a female makes me uncomfortable.

these feelings about what I look like and stuff have gotten more apparent recently and I just don't know what is going on, mentally. Has anyone got any advice or maybe experience with similar thoughts?? thank you so much.",17Jan2020,1

293,"For as long as I can remember, I have never gotten along with my sister. There are no happy memories that I can remember. From what I’ve been told, my sister became very angry when I was born. I can understand being jealous of a new baby and the attention it gets but, my sister was different with her anger. She wasn’t the type to just ignore me or just be somewhat mean to me..... she was violent. The first memory I have of her being angry with me is when I was 5 and she was 6. I was taking a nap as I was sick and wasn’t feeling well. My sister quietly came upstairs to the room she shared while my parents were downstairs. She grabbed a pillow and put it over my face and began to press as hard as she could on my face. I woke up once I was having trouble breathing and began crying for help but no one could hear me. I kicked and tried pushing her off of me but she was bigger and stronger for a 6 year old kid. My mom finally came upstairs to check my fever and found my sister trying to suffocate me. My mom pulled her off right before I was about to either pass out or possibly die. My mom yelled at her but that was it. She wasn’t grounded and had nothing taken from her. I was scared of her from that point on until we got older. As we’ve gotten older the abuse has gotten worse. She steals from me, she threatens to kill me, she hits me, she breaks personal belongings, and tonight she had me arrested. I was arrested after we got into a fist fight. I was defending myself and my mom as my brother had threatened her. I am home now as I was released but I also have to go to court soon because of this. My mom always says she’ll have my sister put in a home for disabled children or send her to an institution but never follows through. We live in the same house together. I can’t leave home as I am 19 and I’m just starting to build credit and my job doesn’t pay nearly enough for rent or utilities for me to get an apartment.

295,"To preface, my boyfriend and I have been together for several years now (around 4-ish...can’t remember exactly how long, but approx that) and we have had some issues in the past that we’ve ALWAYS managed to resolve. I’ve never been one to hold grudges, but this really, REALLY irked me. 

So before we get into the nitty gritty, let me explain a few things: I have NO issue whatsoever with my boyfriend having friends that are girls, just as long as he respects the boundaries that a normal relationship would have (which is mutual, or so I thought, idk I’ll get into that in a min), I am a huge trust-buff and I literally don’t care what he does as long as I know what’s up- not in a controlling manner, just because he and I are dating and I’d like to know when he’s out (we live in different parts of town, I literally live 30 mins out in the booneys lol). I don’t care about the little things, just that I know he’s okay, however; he has this friend (we’ll call her V for the sake of privacy) and she HATES MY GUTS. D, my boyfriend, doesn’t seem to care about that. 

A few years back D and V became very close friends out of high school, my relationship with him was fairly new and I was a little hesitant at first with her, but soon enough, she and I became aquatinted too. A month or so after that I heard that she had been talking MAJOR shit about me to my boyfriend, which I didnt understand why (i had given her no reason to), so I confronted her about it. She, at first, lied to me saying she wasn’t the one saying nasty things about me, but later owned up to it. At this point, silly me thought she and I were friends, so I was a little sad that she’d say things about me behind my back. I later found out that she liked D and was saying shit to try and get him to break up with me. I was furious and developed a small amount of hatred towards her, but I eventually ballsed up and forgot about it and moved on.

A year or so after this first incident, I got off work late and called D to see what he was up to. He answered after a few seconds of ringing and seemed very uninterested in me so I just decided to hang up. At this point I was a little curious to see where he was through snapmaps (as he’s usually asking to facetime or whatever whenever I call), and he is in the city over with V and some of her friends. Take in mind it is like 1 AM. That didn’t really sit well with me, but I brushed it off. I knew they weren’t alone together so it was fine. I know that last line sounds a little controlling, but I just don’t like the idea of my boyfriend hanging out with someone that likes him and has admitted to being sexually attracted to him TO HIS FACE.

Flash-forward to a few months ago, V is talking shit again and D is playing it off as a joke and is laughing about it. I got frustrated, we got into a fight, and I guess he said “It wont happen again” as a form of appeasement, because it most certainly did. V got her other friends in on it and they spread rumors about me and I found out about it an entire week later through snapchat, not my boyfriend.

Today D and I got into a fight. D and I argue as most couples do, we butt heads, we are so much alike it is completely unreal. The only difference is that D is a bit of a narcissist. I started picking out the characteristics a few months ago when we had a bit of an argument over something silly. It’s his way or no way at all. I’m by no means a saint, but I sure as hell don’t deal with that shit. Anyway, I called him (I just got out of the hospital at this time and he wanted me to facetime him so he could check up on me whenever I was ready) to find him gaming, as he usually does. He’d answered my call on his iPad and V and her friend S were on his phone in a group call. He does this often with his friends so I took no mind of it and asked him what he was up to later, the conversation goes as follows:

Me: hey babe! What are you doin later?

D: nothing, do you want to come over.

V, interjecting: that’s disgusting. 

S: yeah, hang up on her, she sounds fucking annoying.

V: god, she is.

By this time I had muted myself because I was talking to my mom, but I was still listening. D didn’t say a word to quell their shit talk, and it had irritated me. They said some more nasty things about me, but whenever D mentioned I had gone to the hospital, they were being catty and saying things like: 
“She probably went because her body is rejecting her shitty ass attitude” and, “did she finally try and kill herself”
D only laughed and told them i could hear them. The second one really hurt, I am an attempt survivor and my mental health isn’t the greatest, so i was very upset with the fact that he wouldn’t say anything (he is well aware of what has happened and is happening in accordance to my depression and anxiety). So i hung up and messaged him a short while later explaining, very civilly, that it hurt my feelings that he let those girls talk like that about me, given the current circumstances. He totally brushed my feelings aside and told me to grow a pair. 

To shorten things up, i was very angry with him for the things he let them say. His only response was that i was in the wrong for feeling the way i did. He tried to gaslight me back into the relationship and then spammed me and begged me to “calm down”. He’d told me this before the spamming: “if you have a problem with it then leave. I dont want you if thats your heart.” So I did leave. I left because i have enough on my plate and the fact that he gives me reasons to hate the people he’s around is gross.

I already didnt like her, but I said nothing because I know that he needs friends too. Now I see that it was a huge mistake and I hate V with all of my heart for being a shitty influence. I know D is accountable for his own actions, but when he’s with, around, or talking to her he is a completely different person. I’m fed up. He’s called me delusional for leaving him, called me names, told me i was a cheat and had no reason to feel the way i do. Then contradicts his own argument over and over again by begging me to come back. I don’t think i owe him a damn thing when he cant respect me enough to tell his friends to shut their mouths. I would go to hell and back to defend that man and he can’t do the same for me. He won’t.

All advice is welcomed. What do i do in this situation? I love him but its so hard when it doesnt feel reciprocated.

Edit: i forgot to mention that he wouldnt allow me to spend time with my guy friends. It would be an entire fight if i even so much as THOUGHT of spending time with them. It was not mutual now that I think about it.",17Jan2020,1
296,"I have an abusive ex with a book coming out in the spring. It looks like it’s going to be a pretty insignificant, niche piece of writing, but his treatment of me directly impacted my own path in life in terrible ways. It’s frustrating to see him experience no repercussions for being an awful person, and I have a sick feeling that I’m not the only woman he’s harmed. Should I tell the publisher about who he really is?

Here’s a rough draft I slapped together while admittedly dealing with some big PTSD triggers. My friend and sister both believe I should send it. I don’t know whether or not I can trust this impulse I’m feeling, but it’s tormenting me right now. (Yes I do therapy, though I moved recently and haven’t found a good replacement just yet.) 

I’m really struggling to figure out what’s best and hope y’all can point my tired brain in a good direction. 

**ANYWAY, THE LETTER:**

I recently discovered that you are publishing a book by Crapweasel, and I feel you should know that he systematically abused me. We were in college at the University of _______. It was a long time ago, but my life is irrevocably marred by what he did to me, and what he helped my rapist do to me. I am permanently disabled due to the rape and abuse I experienced, and Crapweasel facilitated my greatest traumas.

To be clear, Crapweasel did not rape me. He did, however, engage in physical abuse, though he is a smart man and thus a skillful abuser who is able to deftly cloak himself with gaslighting and plausible deniability.

I dated Crapweasel briefly and maintained a platonic relationship with him after we broke up. We were both ________ majors and lived in the same coed dorm. The abuse occurred in 1999/2000, when we were 19 - 20 years old. 

First, I will tell you of what Crapweasel did to me himself. And then I will tell you about how he aided my rapist and stalker. Crapweasel enjoyed physical intimidation. Once, he invited me to his dorm room, and then had his roommate hold me down so Crapweasel could film me frantically struggling to escape. I did not in any way consent to this. It was cruel and terrifying. While not a large man, Crapweasel was bigger than me. He developed a ""game"" during the coldest part of winter, wherein he would repeatedly shove me to the ground into banks of snow if he encountered me on the way to classes. He would modify his own route to classes to ensure that we crossed paths. He did not injure me. He claimed it was all a joke. But the truth is that day in and day out, in public, he shoved me to the ground over and over, while laughing. The psychological impacts of this were horrific, especially given how he facilitated someone else's ability to harm me. I stopped attending classes because of Crapweasel. He is half of the reason I dropped out of college and fled back to my home state. 

Right after my 20th birthday, while hanging out together and goofing off, Crapweasel and I met a man online who was our parents’ age. This man proceeded to groom me, stalk me, terrorize me, and rape me. I had a very rocky relationship with my own mother, and this man used that to control me. He would regularly travel to Our College Town and rape and abuse me, while terrifying me into silence. Crapweasel thought this was extremely funny. He maintained online communications with this man to help my rapist keep tabs on me when he was out of state. Crapweasel would gladly inform my rapist of my location, send him messages encouraging him to continue abusing me, and share those communications with others, again for the sake of his amusement. Later, Crapweasel informed our teachers and everyone in our small, tight-knit major about the abuse I was experiencing--not because he was trying to obtain help for me, but to turn me into an object of laughter, derision, and ridicule.

What happened to me in college left me permanently physically disabled--the nerves and muscles in my pelvis are irreparably damaged--and I have severe PTSD that will haunt me all my life. While Crapweasel did not rape me, he harmed me almost as much as the man who did. And he did so deliberately, *just for fun.* As a side note, he also repeatedly ridiculed me for grieving for my father who had killed himself when I was seventeen. He reveled in wounding me.

I am happy to explain this in greater detail to anyone from your publishing house. I know of times where Crapweasel was cruel to others, but not to a degree that probably matters as much to any of them as my experiences matter to me. What he did to me was vastly darker and prolonged.

I realize you are publishing Crapweasel’s book in April. I haven't decided if I will publicly address this yet, but you should know who you're dealing with and the baggage he has invented for himself due to his cruelty and sadistic sense of humor. At some point, I may decide that the best thing for me is to address this publicly. If that's the case, I will release this email to demonstrate that I did what I could to alert you to the fact that you are publishing the work of a man who gleefully abuses women. I sincerely doubt I am the only woman he tormented, and someday, I may try to find the others he has harmed.

I'm sure you will publish him anyway, but you should give serious consideration to any further support of this person.",17Jan2020,1
297,"so, my coworker is my husbands brothers gf and we hang out pretty regularly with his family and sometimes we just make plans together. we used to be friends,but she’s really sensitive and on several occasions she thinks I’m being rude when I’m not and she gets extremely defensive. she will yell at work and cause a scene.. this has happened 3 times. the first time she yelled and cursed and I just laughed and said calmly that she looked crazy.. my manager came out of the office really upset asking who was yelling but never (to my knowledge) told her to stop. he did tell me I HAD to make up with her after a week of not speaking to her bc I wanted her to apologize for the outburst.. I fake apologized for my manager but it ended up making us actually make up. We got close again until she did it again.. this time I didn’t respond when she yelled, she kept yelling at me everytime she saw me I assumed a manager would intervene at some point but no.. eventually at the end of the night (in private) I asked her to not yell at work bc it could get us both into trouble, if she was that mad at me just text me or something just please don’t jeopardize our jobs.. she started yelling again and went yelling TO out manager.. he told both of us to deal with it or he’d fire us.. I tried explaining that she’d been doing this all night and I’m not reciprocating but he didn’t want to hear it. now, this is the third time she’s done this... I literally cooked her dinner at my house last night and today she thought I was “being mean” to her at some point.. she yelled while walking away in the dining room and less than 5 minutes later I’m approached by a manager and I’m being told I’m instigating things and that he’s going to fire both of us.. I tried to explain that I wasn’t even speaking to or about her when she started yelling but he doesn’t believe me.. I waited until after work and calmly texted her telling her I wasn’t mad at her but I don’t know what to do bc this keeps happening and I don’t want to lose my job. She freaked out and blocked me on every social media and I’m assuming text bc she hasn’t responded after the last one... I feel like I’m losing my mind.. I don’t know why she thinks it’s okay to react I’m this way .. even if I were slightly mean to her would it really be okay in her mind to get me fired in the heat of the moment just bc she thinks I’m “being mean” to her? I have really bad depression and anxiety and I’ve had this job for the past four years.. I’m scared of losing it and having to start over somewhere else. I seriously don’t know how I can make her like me or why I even have to? she’s the one causing a scene and doing all of these dramatic things but I’m lumped in with her just bc I’m the person she’s upset with? 

TLDR my manager is telling me unless I make up with my coworker I’ll be fired but she’s blocked me on everything and is extremely unprofessional at work and I’ve asked her not to yell but she just yells more.",17Jan2020,1

We did not have time to rehearse as a whole group because one of our group members was absent for two days, including the day of presentations. When we rehearsed despite a missing group member we timed ourselves and consistently got 5-10 seconds past a minute.",17Jan2020,1

311,"Hi all. So long story short, I quit my job after two years since I was horribly burnt out (as in 60-70 hours a week) and not in a good place mentally (my dad unexpectedly passing away amongst other things). I was desperately trying to get a new job and then I started working at new job I got from an old supervisor (called S). I'm super thankful for the opportunity but I feel like I'm going crazy here which I'm going to try to put into writing now. 

So first two-three months, I was learning the new job pretty well. I can pick up things pretty quickly. But I was still feeling burnt out from my previous job so I was somewhat in recovery mode trying to take it easy since my dad's passing. I manage two junior members of the team and my managing style is very hands off if I find that you're doing fine (I'll step in if I have to). So S asked one day if one of the staff is working on something that was not so high on the priority list (I doubled checked too - it didn't need to be done so soon). I told S that my staff was working on something else that was essential to the project. I don't remember exactly what S said but essentially S said that I wasn't doing enough to manage my staff and I needed to step it up. I was shocked to say the least. I felt like I was only two-three months in and I was already expected to do a perfect job. Like I said before, I was so burnt out from my last job that I immediately felt anxiety and dread. At my last job, it was always go go go and barely any breaks and I felt like nothing I did was enough despite the praise I would get about my work but that job just made me so anxious. And then I come here and still nothing is good enough. My mind can definitely go off the deep end so I felt like I was going crazy. Well anyways, the assignment got done but that was not the end of my anxiety. S did apologize later on but I will always remember the anxiety that gave me. I really felt like I didn't really have the necessary support for the job. 

Months pass, my anxiety ebbs and flows. I think about my dad a lot so I get depression bouts. I didn't tell anyone about my dad's passing because I'm a very private person and I don't like people getting all up in my business. But one day, it just got too much and I broke the hell down. So I confessed to S that my dad passed away and ive just been feeling overwhelmed and stressed. S told me that I have to speak up when work is getting too much. 

But here's the thing I started to noticed as time went by. I would occasionally vent (like chit-chatting) that people are putting information into the system incorrectly even after correcting them many times. S just tells me to not get so stressed over minor things like that. I wasn't even stressed though - I was just sharing my experience with my other staff since they experience the same issue. Even as I'm typing this, I'm not sure why what S said didn't sit well with me. Like for S to brush off something that could be important to me as something trivial? I don't really understand it. I can kind of understand if S was trying to give me advice like don't sweat the small stuff but idk why it bothers me so much. 

S does this a couple more times with similar scenarios. Don't get frustrated. Don't get worked up. Don't get stressed. It's driving me crazy! As a result, I get more and more irritable. Now I just keep my head low and quiet and do my work. S started to notice that I was getting irritable at work. Then S started asking me if my family/home life is okay. I understand S concern but it's really none of their business. I'm a private person and I don't like people in my business. So those questions makes me even more irritable. And because i broke down that one time, S wants to know all about my life. I'm very careful in what I tell people when it comes to personal and work. I would sharply say that everything is fine and end of discussion much to my annoyance. Then S would keep pushing it saying I know you say everything's okay but I don't think that true like ugh get out of my hair already and stop being so nosy. I also feel like I can't really open up as S brushes off my experiences and feelings as minor even though they say I have their support. 

I'm not really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. Perhaps I just needed somewhere to type this out. I appreciate you reading all the way down here lol. Maybe how do I keep my emotions under control and in check? I've been reading self help books to manage my anxiety. I know that therapy will probably be good for me to work out my issues like anxiety and depression  and grief/mourning. Thankfully I do have support from my family since we are all very close and have gotten closer after my dad's passing. 

That's all lol. Thanks for reading!",17Jan2020,1
313,"My mother was a drug addict who beat me and let men rape me until I was 12. She then got sick, and forced me to work to support my younger siblings when I was 14.

I then worked my ass off paying her Bill's while she made excuses on why she couldn't work while she drunk herself into oblivion.  I ened up getting a serious injury on the job where I couldn't even walk for the next 2 months basically.  I lost my job and that's when it got really bad. She got really verbally abusive.

I sent him an email saying thank you for taking the few minutes, and he emailed me back saying thank you for the candy and that small gestures are important.  He said he was about to email me thanking me!  He also wished me a wonderful rest of my weak, and this is where I’m stuck.  I feel like I should say “you to” but it is also not adding anything of value to our interaction and I don’t want to create a meaningless chain of “you to’s” where the CEO is now annoyed with me instead of impressed that I knew about the small thing he liked.

Brother: 25M

Around mid December 2019, my older brother started to bring his girlfriend over to spend the night. We live with our parents in a 3 bedroom house with our rooms sharing a wall. One night I heard them having sex around 1 AM and I confronted him about it the next morning. I did so because it was incredibly uncomfortable to the point I couldn't sleep until 6:45 AM and had to wake up an hour later. I felt so nauseous and I could only hear the knocking sound repeating over and over, even when I tried to drown it out with loud Game Grumps videos. I told him how uncomfortable it made me and I asked for him not to have sex in the house. He said he wouldn't in the house anymore. 

Fast forward to about 12 days ago, I heard them having sex again. I felt betrayed since I really trusted my brother to keep his word. I purposely threw my door wide open so it would hit my closet door and make a loud enough noise for him to hear it. I don't know if that entirely stopped them since I sat in the bathroom for about 20 minutes trying to calm down. Again I couldn't go to sleep until I was dead tired. Around 12AM (almost an hour ago from this post creation) I heard them having sex again. I did the same thing of slamming my door so they could hear. 

I haven't confronted my brother about this since the first time. A couple things have changed for me since the second time I heard them. Since she comes over every night, I can never sleep soundly because I have the anticipation of hearing it again. I also haven't told my parents and I'm unsure if they know since they're usually asleep by 11 PM. I really need help on how to deal with this. I've told my brother I don't want to get into the way of what they have going, but at this point I am so paranoid at night. I feel like I'm an asshole for not letting them do what couples do but I really can't deal with it anymore. At any knocking sound, I'm reminded of it and its driving me nuts at night. 

Please let me know if you need more information. Thanks for the help.",17Jan2020,1

Which is why i feel so bad having the feelings I do toward my great aunt(who I'll just call ga) my ga had one daughter, I don't know much about her nor have I ever met her. When she was of age she cut both of her parents off along with the rest of my dad's side of the family, I'd like to  try to reach out to her one day because I feel like I can relate to her somewhat. Since I was born I have kind of taken the place of their daughter as well as made up for the grandchildren they never had (which makes me feel extra extra shitty I feel the way I do) She treats me like a BABY, and not like in the ""Moooom don't wave to me I'm in high school"" kind of babying. She has ALWAYS spoken to me in the slightly high-pitch voice you speak to dogs or toddlers in. Everytime I go to her house she has some ""job"" for us to do i.e. building birdhouses. I understand she wants to bond with me but it just feels disingenuous and like she's trying too hard to force a relationship. I'm a very introverted person and would much rather stay in and watch a movie or something instead of ""rugged"" activities like fishing or building birdhouses. I feel like she doesn't even really know me because she's too busy making me do things that she THINKS I would enjoy instead of actually asking me what I want to do. She frequently asks me if I want to do some random activity (I usually never actually want to) and if I say no she just replies ""yeaah let's do it"" like you would do to a child and hope they wouldn't notice they never really had an option in the first place. I think that's my #1 pet peeve in life.

343,"He wants to be friends with both of us. I met my friend (let’s call him A) through my ex (B). B and me got into a really messy breakup and now he’s trying to convince A that I’m toxic and horrible and that since they’ve been friends so long that he should just listen to him and stop being around me. 

A and I play games a lot and B started checking his profile and monitoring who he played with and saw me a lot which caused him to flip on A and tell him that he’s a liar and that I don’t deserve friends. 

A says that’s messed up to leave me as a friend since that’s not his beef and that he won’t to B but B won’t stop messaging him about it. We finally just limit our calls and changed my username so it’s no longer what it was before the breakup. I’m worried B is gonna find out and go ballistic on A. A is sweet and doesn’t deserve this. B even brought in his family saying they’re disappointed in A for still talking to me. 

So basically should I just keep trying to hide from my ex that I’m still mutual friends or for the sanity of A just cut ties? He’s one of my few friends I have left but I don’t want him to have to go through the toxic bull that I went through with my ex.

344,"I got my first car couple of months ago and I know it is all my parents can afford. But since the first time I have seen it, I hate it. It’s a old car and it has some issues like the left turning signal not working sometimes or the tires having issues. When my car acts up like this, I begin to feel frustrated to the point of crying for hours and having urges to crash my car. Today I told my parents about these thoughts and I made my mom cry. I have never seen my mom cry for a couple of years and it hurt to have her yell at me while crying. She told me I can’t compare myself to others, that she is trying her best and that she’s sorry she couldn’t give me the best life. I feel terrible for not feeling grateful about my car and stressing my parents out even more than they already are. But ever since I got my car, I began to have frequent thoughts about self harm or just ending it all and that it would be easier on my parents without me here. I know this makes me out to be a really big brat. I just don’t know what to do. 

I don’t know how to feel either, I don’t think my car is the main issue to my sadness. I don’t think getting a nicer car will cure my sadness as it will only make me feel guilty for putting pressure on my family about car payments.",17Jan2020,1

348,"If someone else asked me this question, at first blush I would say to keep going and just get it done anyway especially given its for a lucrative industry (computer science/software engineering). However the following points make me think it's not worth it:

- The degree is impacting my mental health. It's very stressful, and despite doing very well with my grades so far I have been very depressed during the semesters.

- I am 26 (mature age student). My youth is coming to its final years, I don't want to spend it doing something I hate.

- It is quite possible, perhaps probable that the world as we know it could come to an end on the next couple of decades. We are staring down the barrel of catastrophic consequences of climate change and the collective inaction to combat it. Food shortages, mass migration of climate refugees, loss of nature, economic recessions etc seem to be coming our way. If it's the case that we only have a couple of decades left to enjoy our planet and its natural beauty in peace, why waste it for the sake of ""career-building"". A career won't save you from climate change.

One might say, ""a year is not that long, just finish the degree"". True, a year is not long compared to a lifetime of 80+ years, but it is quite a significant fraction of the remaining time we have before shit starts to hit the fan.

- I have 50k AUD in the bank and job that whilst is dead-end, boring and unfulfilling, it pays enough to pay the rent with enough leftover to spend on modest entertainment.

I am scared to pull the trigger on quitting though. I hear the voices of many inside me telling me to finish the degree.",17Jan2020,1

350,"My best friend has been pushing me to go to therapy.

Basically, I have a really messed up family mental health wise. Literally every person in my immediate family except for me is medicated and in therapy for mental health issues. For some reason I was blessed to avoid some pretty serious illnesses/issues that run in my family (bipolar, schizophrenia, bpd, anxiety, ocd, depression). It's actually a running joke in my family that I'm ""the normal one.""  

The thing is, even though I don't have any of this I can get pretty stressed out as a result of my family's issues. (My parents are going through a rough patch and fight a lot and they tell me things about it/vent. I've told them to stop telling me these things because they stress me out, but sometimes not knowing the reason behind their issues but still seeing the tension feels worse because I worry about worst case scenario. They also slip into unhealthy coping mechanisms occasionally but always stop after they realize it's unhealthy. A few years ago my dad had a traumatic brain injury that hardcore changed his personality, resulting in depression and a lot of other issues that we're all still dealing with. Plus my siblings have anxiety/depression/mood disorders so watching them struggle can be hard even though I don't go through the same things. Also, I don't have a relationship with my biological father (dad is actually my stepdad but he and I see him as my real dad) and sometimes it bothers me/makes me mad even though it's by my choice as he's not someone I'm interested in being around and everyone who's encountered him in recent years tells me to stay away.)

But on the other hand, 3/4 of the year I'm away at  college so I don't really have to deal with these things unless I'm visiting over a weekend. Also, I don't think therapy would really help me since the really bad stuff (like dad's injury) is in the past and I've worked through it. The stress stems from my lack of control over the situation and uncertainty about the future. I don't really see how therapy could help because I don't have unhealthy coping mechanisms, the stress just makes me sad and anxious when new bad stuff happens. I also feel like I know how to handle the stress and have a routine I like to do when it feels like too much (breathing techniques, going to a quiet place and thinking through everything or texting one of my many friends with family issues that understand my problems, but without letting a relationship become me just heaping my crap onto someone). But I feel like a hypocrite because when my bestie was really struggling I pushed them to go to therapy. I 100% support other people going to therapy. But when I think about going myself it's like what's the point in just paying someone to complain about things I can't change for an hour?",17Jan2020,1

We’re in college now and I knew he liked me before but now we found each other again and it looks like we are meeting up soon. I’m anxious as fuck first of all because texting isn’t the same as in person. How is it going to be now seeing someone from your past and now knowing you’re both interested in each other? Knowing me, it’s going to get awkward. In addition, I’ve been stalking his IG tonight. I see he has such a large friend group...he has such a social life. My social life consists of one person that I hang out with in my car or at the park to chat about life. Every time I talk to him he’s always out with his friends. I’m so intimidated by this entire situation and scared to have to talk to him possibly for the first time in years while he is with a group of friends. Knowing him he would probably invite me out with his friends. It would be weird if I told him I wanted it to just be us because then he might take it some other way. 

He’s a pretty cool guy and I’m interested in trying it out to see how it goes but I’ve been putting off meeting up with him out of fear. Of our situation and also due to his friends. Some of which I know and weren’t so nice to me in school, but there are also some who were. I’m so bad at talking in groups. I always say something stupid, trip over my words, or no one hears me. Such a bad light for him to see me in for the first time after years of not speaking. Idk I hate this situation it gives me so much anxiety and I don’t know how to maneuver it. I feel like such a coward and guilty when dodging his requests to meet up but I’m scared ugh. My past experiences tell me this will not end well. 

I also really feel inferior. I feel unworthy of his attention. I also feel like it’s not real. Because I can’t imagine somebody thinking of me like this or even complimenting me. I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t want my low self esteem to keep ruining everything in my damn life...

My roommate (male) loves perfumes and sprays it like 7 times each time he goes out. I open the window wide after he goes out, so it isn't that big of a deal, we all have our preferences after all. 

But last night, at 4 am, he got up, sprayed his (imo stinky) perfume all over him and went back to bed. Wtf? I had to get up and open the window at 4 am, to breathe prooerly. I have not confronted him, because I'm hoping it's an one time issue.

One more issue would be his phone notification. He receives a lot of chats, a very social man. But he puts the notification volume at very loud, even when he's still chatting. It's very annoying to hear.

Another issue would be him scratching himself all day. It wasn't like this at the beginning, but in the recent month or so, he has started to constantly scratch himself. Every 5 minutes or so. I don't know about you, but scratching sounds very annoying to me.

These probably seem childish worries and you're probably right, but I really can't take this anymore.

356,"I am currently struggling to get out of criminal activity and overall violence. 

Abit of backstory, I come from an area in north England which is considered quite rough. My brothers have all been involved with gang and criminal activity...so have the friends I have grown up with and so am I. 

When my brothers moved out when I was younger my mum struggled to pay bills and put food on the table etc (single mum raising 3 kids with no support). She works 12 hrs a day and still is unable to afford. So when I was younger I started making money through selling weed and cocaine because I needed the money for me and my family and all my friends were in it. 

As times goes on it’s hard to get out of that life, if I stop my friends consider me a snake or traitor and will attack or stab me. The suppliers will do the same thing and more and more people start trying to come after you after a while for your money or food. 

People are constantly fighting or stabbing and I fear for my life. I’ve already been stabbed 3 times and think I’m lucky to still be alive. 

How do I get out of this life? I can’t leave because my family still need the money and my friends are all I have.

362,"Me and my wife seperated exactly 2 years ago, we clashed so often and everything was the end of the world to her and it seemed like she was happy only 2 percent of the time. So we seperated after a lot of inter drama between us.  

Our son was 2 years old at that time. Now hes 4 and we both love him extremely. Hes the only thing in my life that I truly love and growing up without a Dad I decided I wanted to be a good one.

Reconciling with my ex was impossible because 5 months after separation I met a girl. She was absolutely obsessed with me from the beginning. She had a son, the dad didnt want any part of the child's life, like my own bio dad. And I liked her and that finally someone was treating me right and appreciating me for me. Not that my ex didnt but there was none of this competition of who has it worse or bumping heads over everything. This new girl I grew to really like. 

Fast foreword to present time. Me and girl started opening up to having my son and her son playing together and being around each other. But having this sense of family again actually really hurts. Not to mention that her son is 3 years oldl, very smart and sometimes funny but he has TERRIBLE tantrums, throws things all the time, gets up in your face and practically yells to get your attention and has seperation anxiety from his mom. Not to gloat but ive been on my son since he could walk. I made him realize long ago that I was in charge and he doesnt challenge it anymore. He is genuinely a great kid.  But certain things happen that triggers girl. Examples: 

-Walking into a room and saying hi to her son and then going over to squeeze my son because i love him and miss him tremendously and I hate that he has to go. Her problem is that I didn't treat her son the same. 

-talking about how I cant wait to teach my son things then she interrupts to include her son as well into this picture. 

-She was against coming over to hang out with me and my son one time because her son was with a family member and couldnt come over and she would feel guilty having fun with me and my son and not Her own. After I said I understood and I would also feel guilty if I was doing something with her and her son and not my own. She got upset and changed her mind and wanted to come over because she realized I was saying that I would feel guilty about having alone time with her kid and not my own. 

I guess I'm asking if anyones ever been in this situation. I put myself here, I get it. I get she and her son are a package deal. But I wont lie.  I would feel guilty if one day i moved in with her and her son and my son was only over on the weekends. I would give more attention to my child on the weekends and I can tell this would bother the he'll out of her. Or it would be hard to feel as excited about having her son around in the same way I'm excited about seeing my own little cub. And I am not a good liar. I'm very honest about how I feel and my intentions. But I need advice on how to handle this situation of blending families. I thought growing up a bastard I would sympathize with one in front of me but I honestly am way more excited to see my son than hers.",17Jan2020,1
363,"So I (19F) have had sort of issues with confrontation with this guy last week at a movie party thing. Well call him douchebag, or DB for short. 

My friend, (20M) hosted the party at his house and we were watching LOTR and had snacks and stuff. There were about seven of us total and I knew everyone in there at least a bit. 
Now, let me make this clear. I am NOT touchy feely, hugs are something you work up to with me, and after 7 years of martial arts and weapons training I am not someone who likes to be surprise touched unless I know you well. Also I'm 5'2 (157cm) tall. 

DB I had only met 3 times at this point, I knew his girlfriend better as she was this super sweet and naive kid of about 17 while he was older than me by about 8 months. Anyway, throughout the movie he had been hanging on and grabbing and even tickling and picking up the other two girls who had come with him to the hangout,

 familiarity I thought was unusual and I could tell the girls were uncomfortable with it as they scrambled away from him while doing that awkward uncomfortable giggle thing girls do.

 However I dont think they were confident enough to ask him to stop so they could just watch the movie. 

Trying to ignore it I later got up to leave the movie early for work. He stands up and asks for a hug before I leave because ""he rarely gets to see me"" all sweet like. Yeah right calling you on that BS I barely know you. I say no and that I'm not a hugger and go to grab my bag from the wall. He then blocks my way and hugs me tightly, completely ignoring what I said. 

We're chest to chest at this point and his head is beside mine, and I froze for a moment. Surprised at his nerve I guess idk. I start pulling out of his grip and try to push him off of me as I am NOT ok with this. He remains holding me and for some weird and very red-flaggish reason starts pushing me towards the wall behind me. 

When he almost pins me is when I finally get pissed off and punch him in the stomach. More than a tap but I was holding back a bit, like a warning. 

When he still refuses to let go I start rabbit punching him in the gut. Hard. After about three hits he coughs and finally lets go of me. I dont say anything and grab my bag and walk out of the house. DB was braced against the wall clutching his torso as I left. (And no I did no actual damage, I know how to gauge my hits and where not to hit, he'll be out of breath briefly and sore at most).

My friend did follow me out to ask if I was ok, to which I said yes and left. I did text him later and said that while I enjoy his hangouts, I would not be attending another one if DB was there. 

I get that some people are naturally more physically comfortable and friendly with others, but this felt predatory to me in a way. Part of me wanted to give him hell right in the living room, but I was so embarrassed and angry I just wanted to leave. 

Some of my friends say I overreacted and he was just being friendly and innocent. What do you think?",17Jan2020,1

365,"Oh boy, this might be long. 

I’m also new to this app for reference!! 
 

To make it more clear 
-I’m (F17) (just) 
- dad is (M55), he has a “fiance” (of about 4 years) who is, A (F30) 
-My mom and dad stopped dating before I was born-
-I have a half brother, B (M14) 

 To begin, my dad has always been a very manipulative, narcissistic and controlling person. 

A few summers ago, when I was 15 (I’m newly 17 now) I began dating a boy who was the same age as me, and I knew him from some of my classes. I’ll call him R. Our dates had always been very innocent walks on the beach or in the Forrest. He’s outdoorsy and so am I.. for the most part. A month and a half had gone by and we were officially dating. We only kissed and made out on these dates and blah blah..
One day I had given him a hickey, I just wanted to try it, horrribleeeee mistake. Immature and kinda gross.. oh god I know, I know. My dad met him, and freaked out at me on the way back. He had asked if we were doing drugs, sniffing markers, having sex or oral sex, the works. We weren’t. I hadn’t even thought about it. At this time in my life, around grade 9, I had also developed a serious anxiety disorder. I was in counselling, but I found it VERY difficult to go to school. I would skip classes and walk 4 blocks to the nearest hidden bench. I couldn’t handle it, it was sort of debilitating. 

A week later my mom showed up at my dads house, I thought she was just picking me up to go home. Apparently he has invited her over so that we could have a sit down conversation about my relationship and it’s direction, and he didn’t want my mom to text me. 
I have a veryyyy open relationship with my mom, I feel really safe with telling her important things, so it kind of hurt that she didn’t tell me. 
We sat down, and I honestly can’t remember the whole of the conversation, it was mostly centred around my dad telling me that he “checked out” the places we were hanging out and how they were so secluded- and how he didn’t want me going to the beach anymore, at all. He talked about rape and abuse, and how he’s talked to “many” police officers about it. He interrogated me basically. 
-*My dad is an unsuccessful martial arts teacher. He has never made a living or even profit from that hobbie. My dad also does Isagenix, like he is FULLY fledged, lives a healthy amount off the profit. It’s his life basically. 

Anyways-I left my dads house sobbing, all of his words really hurt, especially because I wasn’t doing anything wrong, I was being a teenager. My mom did try and stick up for me a little bit, she knows how my dad is, so she waited more until we got into the car to console me. She said it really caught her off guard about the subjects we were talking about, and that my dad told her the conversation would take a different direction than it did. 
Moving forward, I didn’t really want to go back to my dads place, I felt like I might be interrogated more, I didn’t really feel safe. 

Not really sure what happened after that, I know I talked to my counsellor about it, she was really surprised, thought it was weird. 
(Still summer)
About a week later I didn’t think much more about the encounter. I was still a bit confused and feeling humiliated to be honest. My mom gets a call in the morning from my dad, and he says that I’m not telling the whole truth about (idk) and blah blah. I have no clue what he is talking about, I’m running through every possible Thing I could have done, and nothing is ringing a bell. 
My mom comes home from work and says we need to talk. She asks me if I’ve been having any sexual activity of any sort with R (bf) and of course I said no, because I haven’t. So, she says my dad found a bag with a piece of underwear, and a bottle of hand lotion, and sand in the bag. Apparently he and A(dads fiancé, 30) inspected the underwear and found.. discharge?? I don’t even know, it was so invasive. 
The bag, I used for collecting dirty laundry, and I had bought hand lotion, for my hands... 
I don’t know why there was sand in the bag or why the lotion was in there. Honestly I don’t. They thought the discharge was semen, and of course they’d know because A is a woman and she knows these things, and dad is a man and he knows these things. Fiancé “knows” what is “normal”. 

I’m breaking down crying, because it was just so awful to hear that they picked up my UNDERWEAR and inspected it, wtf. 

Blah blah, I don’t want to see them. Of course I don’t. They want contact with me, I state clearly that until I have an apology for invading my privacy, and accusing me of having a sexual relationship with my boyfriend, that I would not be speaking to them. 
I think a week went by until I got a phone call. Of course, it wasn’t an apology, just a bit more accusing and condescending things being said at me. I told him I don’t want to see him unless it’s with my counsellor, that way I feel safe. I told him that since A was involved, that she should come too. 

Before the counsellors, my dad wanted to see me to “get on the same page”. I told him no, my mom told him no, we said no multiple times. He showed up at my door unannounced and my step dad let him in. Dad and A started talking about how worried they were about me, and how I was goin to get STDs, how I was going to end up pregnant, and how THEY BOUGHT A SEMEN TEST, TO TEST MY UNFERWEAR FOR SEMEN. Those things are scams btw. They claimed it had semen. My mom told them to get the fuck out of her home (top ten proudest moments). I was upstairs petrified. I was inconsolably crying. Once they were gone my mom made sure to tell me that her and step dad didn’t believe my dad and A. 

Counsellors appt came, it was awful. They were trying to make me believe that I had done things I didn’t do, including joining a sex ring, and that’s why I was missing school. Fiancé A had talked to her sister about it.... and that’s where that idea came from (I had asked for this whole situation to stay between close family-obviously didn’t happen) 

After counsellors appt. dad tried and forcefully gave me a hug. I know thats a power manipulation tactic, he used to do it a lot. 

Months after that I can’t really remember. I had coffee with him once I think. 

Meanwhile I hadn’t seen my brother B for a few months and really missed him. 

September (2018) set up after school lunch for my dad and B, and asked for A and her son (M6) to not come because I wasn’t ready to see her. The whole lunch dad was pushing my buttons, asking why I didn’t want them to come. Saying that they reallyyyy missed me. Saying that the son kept asking where I was. I told my dad I didn’t want to talk about it, and I didn’t feel like I had to talk about it. I tried focusing on B and asking him how his grade 8 year had been and such. 
On the ride home my dad made a comment about “I’ll always be here for you” blah blah 
and said that he wants to help with my anxiety. I told him he’d actually made it pretty difficult to deal with my anxiety because of his actions. This turned into a full-fledged screaming match. 
I apologized to B so many times, saying that I really hated doing this in front of him, and that I was really upset dad kept bringing this up. We pulled into my driveway and I got out of the car. My dad said how I was really hurting him, and how they only ever did this so that I wouldn’t get hurt and blah blah. It was awful. He always makes himself the victim, only he can be hurt. 

My next meeting was right before Christmas break with my dad. I had texted him trying to set up other meetings, mostly just so I could see B, but he always flaked or didn’t make time. I texted B, A, and my dads number to set up a pre Christmas lunch, only my dad responded. I was pretty excited to see B, but I tried not to let my hopes get up. The day comes and dad picks me up. There is no B, and no A and her son. I asked where they were and my dad said they weren’t coming-this is when we got to the lunch place btw, until then I had been making small talk. 

Basically, lunch is fine. I was really hurt they didn’t come. My dad said something about how A didn’t want to to see me, she had a Christmas recital to go to. It kind of really, really hurt. Especially since everything they did was out of love? And she didn’t care enough to come and see me. She was actively avoiding me. What a grown up. My dad invited me to a dinner at their house for the near future. He also said that A would want to talk to me, and that she wanted some sort of apology (or something along the lines of that). That’s when I decided, in my head, right there, I wasn’t going to be seeing him again. I wasn’t about to put myself through that again. I didn’t need to apologize. My mom has always taught me that my boundaries are very important. I try and be clear and firm, and less rude. Sometimes it comes off as rude but oh well. Anyways,  I didn’t tell him my decision. I just thanked him for lunch and I think he drove me home. I don’t really remember, but I think I texted him that I didn’t want to have lunch with him anymore. 

B’s  birthday is in February, and my dad had a sit down meeting with his family, (he’s called it his family before, I just adopted that name now) and B isn’t allowed any contact with me. They said it was because it’s damaging to have somebody walk in and out of their lives so much. I’ve literally grown up with B, he is my brother. I ask to see him for sometime during the week of his birthday so I can take him out for food and hang out with him. I couldn’t even text him. Nope, denied. 

I blocked my dad for a few months and got my anxiety in order. 

Basically, haven’t seen him since dec 2018, it’s now jan 2020. Haven’t seen B since sept 2018. 

Also, my dad is supposed to be paying child support. He doesn’t. He refuses. 

I’ve also tried to set more counsellor appts with him (with a counsellor of his choosing). He refused for months, constantly asking me for coffee, until I told him that I had already said no, and that he wasn’t respecting that. 
Then, he accepted counselling, ignored me for two weeks, asked for coffee 
Repeat 

When he texts me I turn the conversation to B, and say I hope he is doing well and that I can’t wait to talk to him and hang out with him. 
Pisses off my dad, I don’t care. I honestly wish I had nothing to do with him. I only want to see my brother. My dad uses that against me as much as he can. 

Not really related but I also think my dad is an honest sociopath. He doesn’t have.. a normal sense of what emotion is? It’s hard to explain. 

The question, 
How do I make my dad let me see my brother?

In the legal sense I mean. I’ve asked several people about this. No one really knows. My mom is busy with her job right now and can’t focus or afford lawyers and such. 
To any one who finished this...wow.. thanks. 
I’m not sure if any of this is too much info.. if so pls let me know.

Oh also, still with the bf, thank goodness he stuck with my through all of that.",17Jan2020,1
366,"I recently had a couple (two men) move in next door to me (single woman) and we get along great. We’ve become fast friends and plan lots of dinner parties together. Recently, one of the men has been aggressively picking on me over everything I do. How I wear my hair, how I dress, why I don’t flirt with more men, etc. 

It’s gotten to a point where I dread seeing them because I know I’m going to have to defend myself on some trivial issue. I’m trying to stand up for myself more when it’s happening, but my friend doesn’t seem to be backing down from these comments. Any advice for de-escalating an impending fight?

369,"So I was working a terrible job with horrible pay for a good while. Despite applying to various other jobs, I never got an offer (except one, but like a fool, I turned it away because of a project I on at work). One day, I just decided to practically beg a friend to let me join his company because what they did seemed like a good career choice and the pay was much better. Although it took some convincing, he finally got me a position.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as grateful as I still am, I hate my job even more than the last one. It was not what I expected at all and every time I'm at work, I feel like there is poison coursing through my veins. The pay and benefits are not worth what I suffer through in this new position. I want to quit but I feel like leaving after only 6-months would be a sign of disrespect to my friend who pulled some strings to get me in and would also make me seem ungrateful. But I'm at the end of my rope, I can't stand being there another day, it's driving me nuts and honestly, I killed a lot of my self-esteem.

374,"Around the age of 22, I decided to get into dating. Up till that point, I had no dating experience, and was embarassingly a virgin. I posted the best of my photos, did some swiping, aaaannnndddd nothing. I was getting maybe 1 or 2 matches per three months. I am now 26, still no actual relationship. The profile pics and bio were solid enough, so I looked into what made so undesirable.

It turns out due to the facts that I was Asian, have no college degree, have no stable job, and the fact that I am 5'2"". That's fine, I convinced myself. I just need to work on my college and career job, and look for other Asian females who are shorter than me...right?

 I did go on few dates here and there, but they always ended up with ""Yeah it's not gonna work"" or ""It's not you, it's me"". While I am telling myself the girls were being honest, I can't help but to feel it's because I'm 5'2"". I am losing faith that I will ever have an dating experience, and just go with one of those arranged marriages in my late 30s. I REALLY hoped/is hoping to be in at least one relationship before marriage. But that hope is dying out.

Looking at online for pros of being a short guy doesn't make me feel any better. Reduced cancer risks?  Yeah, as if anyone with a healthy lifestyle can't have that. Cons make it worse; Not making much or finding success, less respect, more of being mocked or treated as joke, inability to reach things, and of course, being ignored by girls taller than me or in my case, even the shorter girls.

I am not suicidal or depressed over my height, but it's a thought that continues to come back. It discourages for me to be bold and try new things or be ambitious about anything. Why try something knowing you won't find much success or being taken seriously? Instead, I am currently leaning towards more ""whatever happens, happens"" type of like, feeling indifferent on everything.",17Jan2020,1

It felt like a very sudden and forceful way to make your finger fall asleep, it's kinda hard to describe. Currently it being almost two days past the stabbing, my finger is still numb and obviously the cut isn't healed. I forgot to mention that I can still move my finger so I probably didn't cut the whole nerve and only the left side of my finger is numb when looking at the palm side of your hand.

385,"I'm in a huge conflict right now. So, me and my family were middle class at best or even not fully that. But, around 12-13 we won a lottery, which at the time was the best thing that ever happened to me. And, not a huge amount but enough that could last 10-15 years in my country. Sadly, that's been the only lottery life has technically given me. 

After that lottery winning I have been living the best life on the outside , good car, education all free and good luxurious lifestyle of eating out and buying most things which i need right away. Pretty much a suppose to be poor kid enjoying the perfect middle class lifestyle. However, I have nothing else given to me. My learning skills are very weak. However, due to the money i was able to switch degrees which is somewhat working now after I put in 4-5 hours each day to understand stuff to compete with the kids but it is working out so far.

But, in the dating and social game is were my real depression comes in. I'm too short to get laid or respected. Not that of a good talker to make up for things either. And, that sucks cause all i hear from my buddies is ""I'm banging her"" and ""her"" like I can't help feel sad. And, that's the reason i feel sad all the time. i don't know how to enjoy life right now cause I know this money isn't going to be around long (which also sucks lol). Like a few of my buddies say your so lucky (most people in my area know I won a lottery) but I don't feel like it. Except when I'm at home. That's the only place I feel heaven, rest I hate life but cannot stay home all the time. Which is the reason I feel sad when I'm not at home enjoying my video-games, sports and talking with my friends.

So, the question Is how do i detach myself for these thoughts and just enjoy the middle class life style which i was never suppose to have in the first place. Like how to block all the noise. Just enjoy everything I have right now.",17Jan2020,1
386,"Throwaway because friends know my username and this is somewhat personal.

I've recently reconnected with an old high school friend and we've been dating for the past couple of months. Things have been going well, however this is my first relationship where my significant other had been in a relationship with and had sexual experiences with other people. Now, logically, I understand this isn't a big deal. We're both adults who have had our own lives before we became romantically involved and it'd be hypocritical of me to be upset with her knowing I've been in relationships and had sexual experiences with other people as well. To be clear, I keep these feelings to myself and I don't get upset with her because that would not be fair to her of course. I just can't help but have a heavy feeling of jealousy if I think about her with her previous partners, or if she tells me a story about a previous experience (we're very open with each other, maybe given my situation it's not very healthy but I figured exposing myself to the knowledge of what she's done would help me accept and get over it rather than to keep her from talking and pretend like nothing happened).

The frustrating thing is that in my own head, I know that there's no reason to be jealous and that what's in the past doesn't matter now. The heavy, jealous feeling doesn't go away though, and I want to know if there's any way I can keep it away. Both to spare my own feelings and to not jeopardize our relationship as a result of my own insecurities/irrational feelings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Jan2020,1

388,"

So my ex and I (21f and 21m) have been broken up for the last month and a bit. We broke up because we had been badly arguing the weeks prior and he told me that he isn’t emotionally ready or mature enough for a relationship right now, and that for the last 5 years he’s had relationship after relationship without anytime to just be on his own. 

I understand where he’s coming from as I remember him never actually wanting a relationship with me when we first met 9 months ago, (we were both looking for friends with Benefits?) but he said because he fell in love with me over time he wanted to make me happy so he decided to give it another try and enter a relationship but over time he realised that he wasn’t in the right capacity to be Handle the responsibility of a relationship. 

He said he still loves me now and still cares about me and I remember being skeptical (in a way I still am) 
How can you say you love someone but then breakup with them? He still tells me he loves me and that he misses me and that it would be so much easier if he didn’t care about me or fell out of love with me but he hasn’t. I can sense the emotional turmoil, as on New Year’s Day he called me saying he loves me and then the next day messaging me saying we shouldn’t be friends, it’s like in his head he’s all confused. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

To add on, we called the other night on FaceTime and I told him that it was a blessing that we had broken up because we were both really young and have always been in a relationship so maybe it was for the best. I also said that I was over dating and that the next person I will date will be the person I will marry which will probs be in a few years. He then said that “but what if in a few years time we date again when we’re both ready” and then he states that he wants to move to my hometown(where I’m thinking of working after I finish uni) after he finishes uni! I’m not going to wait around for him, but I just thought that was weird. 

I know he’s not seeing any other girls or dumped me as an excuse to date around as I asked him the other day if he’s been dating around with other girls and he said “no. That’s the reason we broke up, so why would I date around again?” It might seem like a reason that he’s just making up, but my gut believes him.. my ex is and always has been really black and white so I know if he says something he means it.  

We then talked about (potentially) having a causal sex thing this year since neither of us want anything serious, but I told him that there’s plenty of girls he can find that would have sex with him, and he stated that he didn’t want any of them, he only wants to have sex with me.

So idk, my gut DOES believe him when he says he still loves me and wants to give us another try down the line. But is he just full of bullshit?

389,"Not too long ago I had a serious bout of depression and it cost me my full time job.

Right before Christmas I managed to land a part time job because like anyone else, I have bills/loans to pay and I also need to eat.

At the moment I can safely say that things are a little better. I'm not locking myself in my room any more, I have a job, I'm talking to people again, I have things to look forward to. Even at my job, I like my coworkers, and the hours are all right (wish I could get more, tbh). As compared to a few months ago when literally all I did was sleep, I think I'm okay now.

Other than the bills/loans, there are so many things I need/want to buy for myself: a new laptop, some video games, maybe save up for a vacation... I even have a list of things I plan to buy/pay off in my phone that I look at at least once every single day, just as a reminder (expenses at #1, written in ALL CAPS).

So why do I feel unmotivated to go to work?

Is it because I've stayed sedentary for too long?

I thought I finally have a second chance, but now I'm just gonna fuck it all up again?

I can't tell if I'm just being lazy or not?

The magic of the motivators seemed to have died down after the first few weeks and now they don't do anything for me. I've tried everything I can to give me any reason at all to make myself go to work; I even picked a job near my boyfriend's work place, and match my working schedules with his, so I can look forward to seeing him after my shifts.

But none of that seems to work any more.

For my most recent shift, I called in to say that I would be late because I overslept.

I did not; in fact I woke up two hours earlier than my alarm because I needed to mentally prepare/motivate myself to even get ready for work. I showered, I had breakfast, I got dressed. Then spent the rest of the morning on the couch contemplating if I should go to work or not.

And it's not just with work - right now I have someplace to be, but instead I'm still sitting at home writing this post.

I'm scheduled tomorrow, I don't want to be late (or worse, call in sick) again. I already don't know how to face my coworkers.

So I need help. I thought I was finally getting my life together again, but as it turns out, it's actually bordering between that, and quite possibly another relapse. I'm already starting to hate myself, and when I think back to the time I lost my previous job, I can't help thinking that I'm a failure. I just want to stop this before it goes from bad to worse, and history repeats itself all over again.

I also want to put it out there that I'm **not** looking for medical advice or to ""seek professional help"". I'm already seeing a therapist and taking SSRI's regularly. I just need something that can help me get my ass out of the house.

How do I motivate myself to go back to work? What measures can I take? Do I need some sort of routine, or a change of lifestyle entirely (I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I do close to nothing once I get home from work or whatever)? Any ideas or suggestions you have, I'm willing to take it.

So I don’t know if this post goes here but anyways.
I’m an Indian female and I’m having a difference of opinion with my mother. I generally wear full clothes like fully covered but the other day I wore a T-shirt that showed a little bit of cleavage. I wasn’t going out or anything just in the house. My mother comes up to me and adjusts my T-shirt. I felt offended cause she’s done this so many times. I’m not ignorant to the fact that there are men who are gonna see that and she’s just worried about that but I was home. She also has a problem with me wearing shorts in the house and keeps saying that if you want to wear such revealing things wear it in your room. My problem here is that I’m not allowed to wear clothes I feel comfortable in, in my own house! I’m not gonna wear them outside because I wouldn’t feel comfortable myself. I’m just having a problem accepting this “ wear it in your room “thing. My father has never had a problem with shorts. In fact he encourages me to wear them since I only wear full clothes. Everyday.  I’m not gonna wear em everyday but I just want that satisfaction that if I wear them in the living room my mother isn’t gonna say anything. Well to sum up, my question is am I wrong to feel that my mother isn’t being fair? I mean I should be able to wear the clothes I want in my house at least. I just feel my room shouldn’t be the limit.

When we were little he would tell me stories about the types of things she would do to him and I would laugh but then we grew up, I realized that she was abusive and sadistic. The things he told me guys...it’s clear she hates him like actually hates him. She does things just to watch him hurt and the way that he is it’s clear he’s been severely emotionally abused. She’s done a lot but this is by far one of the most damaging.

My friend belongs to a program in our state that allows students below a certain economic subset to go to college for a reduced rate but like FAFSA it has to be renewed and filled out every year.  She hid the necessary paperwork from him so he couldn’t renew it. He had to drop out of school. He now owes them $27,000 which means he can’t go to another school until it’s paid off. He’s working rn but Jesus Christ that’s $27,000. When he told me I was so mad because she’s ruining his future. He called the school and they said there’s nothing they can do. But Reddit is there anything he can do?

Btw he’s working a job rn but like I said $27,000 freaking dollars",17Jan2020,1

400,"Hey guys, 
I've been pretty upset lately, and i would like some outsiders opinion.

Me (20) and my girlfriend(18), whom i have known for many years, recently started dating again. We did before, but it didn't work out because i wasn't really in a good place (emotionally, my parents got divorced around that time).
But we started seeing eachother again since the end of last year, and for the first time in my life i started talking about my feelings and stuff, with her ofcourse.

When we weren't dating, she hooked up with her boss, she works in a bar. Then we started seeing eachother again, so ofcourse she stopped fucking that guy. But she still does work there, and they are still good friends.

This is bothering me quite a lot, I can't stop thinking about it, especially when she works there. Sometimes she even goes for fun.
She tells me she doesn't go for him, but just for the fun in the bar in general. Which ofcourse is true, she has lots of friends there, but still....

Now, since me and her have a pretty good relationship, and we talk about our feelings and stuff. I told her how i felt. She told me she understands and she'll take into account my feelings.

But then all of a sudden she tells me she's going to a concert with him and some friends, and they'll be sleepin in the city.

So again i told her how sucky that makes me feel.

And again she tells me, it wasn't really thought through of her, and she'll watch her behaviour next time.

I thought all was good then, and i have to say, the bar owner guy is a pretty good guy, but i cant help but feel like shit when she's there.

Now yesterday she went there again, she told me she's going home early cuzz she only needed to pick up some stuff... But again she stayed late.

Is it me? Is it her?

I think i made my feelings very clear to her and still it seems like she doesn't bother.

And no i don't think she's cheating.

What do i do?

(Also, I'd like the opinion of women, because i read that the male and female brain work different, like, women can easily be friends with a guy without having feelings, but men don't have it so easy (science))",17Jan2020,1
401,"Hey homies. In freshmen year I was asked a lot if I was transgender and such because I was a fairly feminine guy who liked having long hair, stuff like that. I saw lots of people coming out as trans online around that time and got hella confused thinking I was trans so I decided to come out to a teacher and see how it would go. After a few months after coming out I realized I wasn’t actually trans. Just confused. It’s been a year and a half since then and I’m now a sophomore but I still see the same teachers trying to help me out by hooking me up to gender therapists and such but after a year of growth, I’ve cut my hair and started dressing a lot more masculine because I’m not really into the feminine things I used to like. It’s probably because I was raised in an all female household and picked up a few habits from my sisters but I am in fact a man and would like for people to see me as exactly that.

406,"Ok, so when I was in grade 9 I made friends with a girl (let's call her Diana). Diana never had friends when she was in elementary and when she was in grade 7 and 8. Later on in grade 10 my other friend (let's call her Bonnie) and Diana became friends. Everything was well until we reached grade 11 and 12, Bonnie was in another classroom but at least I and Diana are classmates. Later on, I met another girl (let's call her Niki) who was also my classmate. Me, Diana and Niki quickly became friends because we have so much in common. Later on, my friend Bonnie told me how she felt like an outcast when she hangs out with us, so I didn't care much because I thought that nothing would come between me and Niki and Diana, that is until we became grade 12. In grade 12 Niki and Diana became obsessed with this new anime which I don't watch. At first, it didn't really bother me but then they kept talking about it, every time I try to make a conversation they shift the topic to the anime. It got worse because they became friends with another classmate of ours (let's call her Aurora) who also loves that new anime. The three of them even made a group chat where they share memes about that new anime. I tried my best to still be positive but I can't handle the feeling of being left out, it is like I don't exist. So I told Niki and Diana how I felt, I told them that I feel abandoned and ignored, they told me that its because I don't try to socialize with them. I forgive them and told them ""you know what, they are right"", besides, Diana doesn't have much experience with friendship. Later on, I decided to read the manga of the anime that they love, Niki and Diana were really excited about that. But even if I finished reading The manga, they didn't let me joined the group chat, and when they talk about The anime they act like I don't know anything about it. Things got worse from here. Aurora introduces Diana and Niki a game, it didn't take them a long time before they became obsessed with it. Every lunchtime in school the three of them play the online game together, and every time they make a conversation they talk about the game. I tried playing that game and it didn't appeal to me, and then it hit me. What's the point in forcing myself to love this game? Even if I play with them they would exclude me like what happened when I read that manga. I want to talk to them but I'm scared if I will just waste my breath, I mean I already told them how I felt when they started to watch that anime and made me feel like an alien. I really don't know what to do with them.

Everytime i ask him ""can i see __ this week?"" he gets soooo annoyed and bothered which i understand he's a father, no father wants to see their daughter with another man caring and loving her like him but cmon... he should know when i told him i have a bf this would happen. If anything he should've said no to me not having a bf if he would be like this. It's bothering because I try and do anything and everything i can to help out with my sisters, cleaning the house, going to work, paying for my own books/textbooks, gas and car stuff. like i can't please him at all and it's annoying a bit :(. It makes me not even want to ask to go see my bf where he lives (by the beach n a lot more things to do compared to where i am.) as i know my dad will get annoyed and say things like ""go live with __ at this point"" or i don't care dude just go. 

I feel like shit whenever i want to go and ask and my bf does come up more than me but we don't have tht much privacy (not talking about sex)to even watch a movie together on the couch aithout my sisters coming in and obviously spying on us or my dad walking out and giving us a loook of disgust (which i know he's joking, my dad loves my bf and thins he s a great dude but my dad did say he hates seeing me and my bf together sitting or him laying on me) 

I just don't know what to do and moving out is def not in the picture as rent is fucking crazy (i'm in socal) i def don't have the funds for it nor does my bf. We both did talk about moving in together one day (he brought it up:,) ) and not having to worry about me having to be home at 11pm and us having lunch and dinner together but i just wish i had a bit more freedom to do things with my bf and friends in general ! my dads more lenient on my friends as they're nearby but my bf no (i think) because he lives 45 mins away and the fact i'm dating him. I also did feel like my bf did wish he dated a girl who had the freedom to do whatever they wanted as he did have past partners who lived on their own (parents paid for rent/loaded) or just had the freedom to move out and shit, but he told me thts not the case and said to just keep doing you and helping out more and to not let ur dads feelings affect you

Once getting home, I sit on the couch to wind down and watch tv for a couple hours before bed and my Couch is directly next to the window looking out at my across the street neighbors driveway.  Over the past few weeks I've noticed he gets home at around 2:30AM.  He leaves the car running, goes inside for about 5 minutes or so, comes out, gets back in his car and leaves.  Then he comes back home again around 10 to 30 minutes later only to repeat the cycle again 1 or 2 more times.  Parking.  Going inside.  Coming out.  Leaving.  Rinse repeat.  I'm not a particularly nosy person, but since it's so late at night and so odd I figured I'd ask if its normal or not.  I'm just stumped as to what he could be doing coming and going 3 or more times in the span of an hour or two.  I hate to assume hes a drug dealer, but I dont have any other guesses.  It's also worth noting that he switches vehicles every few weeks.  I've observed 4 different vehicles that he cycles through.  I have no idea where he gets them.  They arent trashy cars, nor are they particularly expensive.  Just average vehicles.  He drives one for a few weeks and them shows up in a different one, drives it for awhile, then shows up in a jeep for a few weeks.  It's all so strange to me and I'm just so curious!   P.S.  I've seen suggestions online that Uber drivers would show this type of pattern, but I live in Montana, and we hardly have the population for it.  And this is every single night.

It’s been 7 months since we broke up. I know she’s still in love with me and that’s the worst part. The only upside she moved out of state right after the breakup because her family here couldn’t handle her shit anymore. She’s very impulsive and Persuasive and not to mention slutty.

She said that it was due to the company depending on reimbursement from medicaid and medicare. She told me that she has been working for the company for more than a month and they have yet to pay her, until yesterday. However, they only paid her partially along with the rest of her coworkers.

434,"When I was 11-12 I started lying to people. It was the most absurd lies that benefited no one. It lasted until I was about 16 once I learned how to catch myself and suppress the urge to lie. I lost friendships due to my lying and it was a hard time in my life until I got myself to quit.

But now recently that old tendency is starting to resurface and I'm starting to lie again(now age 20) and I honestly have no clue as to why I'm starting again :( I dont wanna lie to people, but they just come out and I'm not catching myself anymore and I'm starting to lose more friends about it. Idk what's causing it but I want it to stop. 

Idk if this has anything to do with it or could cause it but i was addicted to Molly(MDMA) and am now 58 days sober. Could this be from my sobriety? Could it be stress? Depression?

435,"We’ve (both 18f) been friends for over 5 years now and she can be very fun. I do care about her and I want the best for her, but she is extremely irritating and exhausting. 

It has gotten worse over the last years going from her constantly creating drama over the smallest things to her trying to commit suicide anytime someone actually holds her responsible for her toxicity. 

Her newest quirk is that she acts like an armchair shrink that hangs on to every sentence while also shutting completely down when she has to deal with something she doesn’t like.  She has also developed a couple of triggers that she is very insistent on such as Virginia Woolf, our former friend that she had beef with, drugs, the concept of murder, prostitution and rape. (There’s no trauma).

It’s very hard to uphold all of these things and she doesn’t really have a reaction to any of it besides becoming annoyed and whiny. She is also going to have a hard time in general because of this as we live in a country with an attitude towards weakness and difference that can only be described by the phrase “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down”.

I asked her today if she would stop letting him smoke in the house because the whole house smells likes it, there is ash marks on our furniture, and it’s just not necessary. I told her some things I read up about smoking in the house in hopes to convince her but it did not. She said i’ve googled too many things and i’m over exaggerating. I said I hoped those arguments would change your mind but it didn’t. I proceeded to ask her to talk to him about it but she said that I like to control things and that’s all.

I always felt as though my friendship with Kyle was stronger than with Sarah, Sarah has expressed jealousy towards that at points. no cheating ever happened. 
About a month ago they broke up due to their own personal reasons. It was pretty mutual and i have just been hanging out with them both separately a lot to support them. 
Last night I was hanging out with Kyle, we got pretty drunk and had sex. I hate myself for how right it felt to be with him. It was extremely intimate and i feel as though we connect to each other on a really complex level and always have. We even said “i love you” to each other and considered a friends-who-fuck situation. He says he didn’t break up with Sarah for this to happen and I do believe him, I just hate that Ive done this to Sarah. and If she found out at this point in time it would break her. so telling her the truth isn’t on the table  right now. 
I want to keep hanging out with Kyle because he is genuinely one of my best friends. it is just always very sexually charged between us and i hate that i enjoy it and I feel guilty afterwards.

444,"So backstory, my girlfriend, who we'll call Kate, and I are friends with this other couple, for now I'll call them Nate and Mel. About two years ago we were all just friends hanging out together. Kate and Mel had been best friends since highschool and we all met in college. 

Well after some time Nate and Mel started dating. So it was just me and Kate hanging out for a really long time with them rarely. Me and Kate started dating last October. 

Everything seemed great. 

That is until New year's Eve when Nate was having some friend's over at his and Mel's and he invited me over. I asked if it was okay if Kate came. The answer was basically no. Mel wanted to talk to Kate and found it always to be around her. So since my girlfriend wasn't welcome I just stopped by to drop off the cider I promised and went to her place. 

Thing is it's been two weeks. Kate has tried to get ahold of Mel since then to talk about whatever it was but she's basically being ghosted. 

They are both our friends and idk what to do. Mel does have social anxiety so I'm trying really hard to give her the benefit of the doubt. But it's been two weeks. We miss our friends.",17Jan2020,1
445,"I have a best friend, whom I love immensely. A girl I've been friends with for 8 years and who, in my opinion, makes horrible decisions when it comes to guys. 

She's 20 years old. She just got out of a relationship of 4 years (on/off) a couple months ago. This relationship ended more times than I can count, because the guy emotinally abused her. He kept his routine; treating her like a princess in the beginning, then ignoring and mistreating her, prioritising his friends and his computer and his sleep. If she'd do something nice or plan something romantic, he'd cancel or take it for granted. Just generally putting everything before her and finally, when she couldn't bare it anymore and wanted to leave or left, he'd pull her back in. When she tried to cut all contact, he would show up at her work continuously. He would write and call and apologise for being such a douche and make promises to do better by her, only did she not leave him. He would also cut himself and send her pictures, and threaten to do worse, if she wouldn't come back to him. Any way he could, he'd try to keep her from going. She'd break more times than I can count. Numerous times, she'd call me barely being able to breath from crying so hard. She'd be sad, upset, angry, scared - you name it. I'll admit, she is very emotional and if she falls for someone has a hard time letting go. 

Anyway, she finally fell completely out of love with him, and wounded up dating another guy, a colleague, just a week after. Even though she's denying it, knowing her I suspect that she already had feelings for this guy, which is what eventually gave her the final motivation. Now this guy, sigh.. In the beginning, all sweet and nice and flirty. They work together every weekday. He is however quitting in a about a month. Anyway, since both of them just recently got out of a serious relationship - his breakup being forced as his ex moved far away - they decided to keep the pace ""slow"" - which my friend is not accustomed to seeing as her first and only boyfriend she met when she was 16. After a couple of months, they decided to make it exclusive (yet not tell other colleagues). This lasted about a month or so. Then, because he is still not ready to have a girlfriend and won't be in the near future, and she won't wait more than half a year, because she knows how she feels, she knows she's in love with him, they decided to call it quits. Because he barely has time to hang out after work, and she wants more than this. Yet he still tells her he'll ""wife her up"", that she is beautiful, the perfect woman etc. and keeps writing to her and giving her long looks. This relationship's had her hurting and crying as well. 

He then just recently told her, he had kisses someone else whilst they were exclusive.   
Now I've told her, if she wants to keep this going with the hook-ups, the flirtiness, if she enjoys it, she should. You never know where it might take you, how it might turn out. But if she feels, she needs more, if it isn't enough, if it hurts her too much, she should drop it. 

Through all if this, I've given her so much advice. Like really, really a lot. And I know, that if she would listen to me, she would be in control of this. Which she agrees to, but then goes and does the exact thing, I argued she shouldn't. Now I KNOW, she'll end up hurt and broken again, right till he decides he's horny or lonely again, and this is just the circle they're in. 

Right now, I am so angry with her. I know it's her business, I know it's her feelings, her heart, but it just pisses me off, that she won't listen to me. That if I choose to distance myself from this, stop giving advice, she'll stop sharing about this - which unarguably is a major part of her life, so I'll feel like I'm missing out on her life or she'll hide things from me. But I know I'll get even angrier next time she's upset, because he doesn't really want her, and she's too weak to let go. I believe, it get's personal to me, because I hate seeing her sad and it upsets me, when I can help, yet she refuses to listen and let me. I also believe, that it gets personal to me, because I see all of it as a major weakness; this being unable to dispose of something so unhealthy for you, these major feelings that just thrusts her into heartbreak after heartbreak. I see it as a huge weakness, and it just pisses me off.

447,"I am 33m, very few responsibilities outside of work. No kids, mortgage - just my career. I live in central London and most of my time is spent working, thinking about work, or spending time with my girlfriend.

I have been working straight since I graduated at 21, just taking my annual leave. No complaints about that, that's how my normal life has been.

But I'm quite bored and having considered things over the last few years, I want to have time off and relax. 

I was meant to have a planned career break in 2019 but it never happened as I was involved in a serious health problem in April 2018 and couldn't travel or do much that involved lots of effort until quite recently, so those plans were effectively cancelled. I am still a little unwell but am in far better health than 2018 and 2019. Essentially I was unfortunately diagnosed early with chronic nerve pain which has been hard work to deal with both physically and mentally - and has left me feeling quite tired at times.

I have saved up hard over the last 13 years living a quite cheap existence and have nearly $200,000 saved in various different investment pots.

So, I am considering taking 6 to 12 months off work and having a long break to re-fresh my life - then re-enter the work place in a new environment.

I am concerned by this however that: 
1) future employers would have a very dim view of my time-off - I can of course make something up as to how I filled my time productively.
2) I will struggle to find motivation to re-enter the working world, having had an extended amount of time off work.
3) I would be leaving my career position that I have worked hard to build and become respected part of my sector within.
4) Think my girlfriend would have a very poor view of this and consider me to be a lazy boring person, she may even become jealous of me.

Just really after sounding boards about this idea. Obviously my income would fall quite low if I did this. I make about €150 a month from passive income which I could live off just about if I live a quiet time, spending no money expect on essentials - which is basically what I want to do. So I wouldn't cut into my savings to get at all. There is a big opportunity cost to not working - I close all the opportunities it brings and the income generation over that period of time.",17Jan2020,1

450,"Hey Reddit,

This is more of a brainstorming post. I am 27yo and was in a really bad spot for the last 4 years. An abusive relationship fucked me up badly and I am struggling with the aftermath ever since. 

I broke up more than a year ago and I still mourn the loss of her, although I am 100% sure I did the right thing. The last year I smoked A LOT of weed and drowned myself in fast food and online games, because it was the only thing that gave me peace between my emotional breakdowns. On top of that my grandfather died a slow and painful death and I tried to care for him as much as I could, while I watched my family crumbling under all the pressure (not only from that situation but many more).

I love my friends, I trust them and know they love me and vice versa. But all of them have drug problems, and not only with weed. Everywhere I went, every event/party/get-together, there was heavy smoking, snorting or taking pills involved.

2 months ago I stopped smoking weed for the first time since I was 16. I deleted every dealers number from my phone. I have to admit that I feel the benefits already. I lost the 14 Kilos I gained over the course of the last 2 years and I am much more the person again that I like to be. I take care of myself again, leave the house daily and do stuff, but I still have a long way to go. I think I never want to go back to regular smoking ever again.

This is where I need your advice. I have a lot of hobbies, I love to cook, I love listening to and making music, I was actually very talented in sports. I try to build a routine, going to sleep and waking up at the same times everyday - stuff like that. I am starting from absolutely nothing though, so every step is a success I guess.

Gladly, I am financially stable and have a job. I also am currently enrolled at university, but I am unsure of whether I want to keep doing that or not. I will move into a new flat in the next 2 months, which I am pretty damn hyped about.

I want to go into the gym again, I did it for a few years and never felt better at that time. I want to have that feeling again. I want to be happy again and feel good about myself and not make that dependent on a woman.

What helped you to really make a difference in your life? Every advice, recommendation or anything else is welcomed here. Tell me your story, I am looking for inspiration.

Thank you so much for reading and have a great day!",17Jan2020,1
451,"A couple of years ago, I was working in a local pub serving drinks behind the bar. One of my best friend's dad would come in there a few times a week with a group of his friends. His dad is very religious and is a very involved member of the Catholic Church in our area.
Once he recognised me he gave me a pretty big tip when I served him (tipping is quite rare in my country.) Over the weeks and months that I worked there he was giving me more and more tips every time I got him a drink, and sometimes he'd give me unusually large tips. I started to get a weird vibe from him after a while, like he'd hold my hand with both of his really firmly when he'd give me my tips. He'd hold onto my hand for ages saying things like ""you're a great barman"" and stuff like that. I started to get pretty creeped out by it all.

After a few months of this going on, he got really drunk on red wine one day and he beckoned me over to him as I was walking around the pub collecting glasses. I went to him and he pulled me aside and said something along the lines of 

""Now, I'm not gay, I can't stress the fact that I'm not gay enough. But I do have an appreciation for the male form...I used to have a lad who I would pay £100 per week and he'd get undressed for me and let me look at his naked body. Does this sound like something you'd be interested in?""

I was really shocked but I 'm a pretty easy going guy so I just kind of laughed and said thanks but I'm not interested. I didn't see him again while I was working there and I left the job not long after.

I know that he has a wife, my best friend's mom. So I basically have this knowledge that my best friend's dad is trying to essentially cheat on his mom with young men. So part of me thinks his family needs to know? But then on the other hand I feel like he's probably gay but has had to hide and repress it due to his faith, and in some ways I feel sorry for him because of that.

My gut instict is to not tell my friend, or anyone else. Do his family have a right to know? Or will they be better off not knowing. I don't know if it's really my business to be potentially tearing apart a family, especially the family of one of my best friends.

452,"so i wanna join the australian army (keep in mind i applied once before this but i was too young) and when i was 23 i applied again,  even if its a non-combat role, for context 2 years ago, when  i was 21 i tried to kill myself because i went through a tough time losing my grandmother (who i was closer with than my father) and my gf who i was with for 5 years. after dumped her(which i regret) i feel like ive got nothing left (2 years after)  and now its 2 years after that and i want to join the army even if its a non combat role. but because of a previous knee injury torn meniscus and the recent suicide attempt i don't think they will ever let me\\

(keep in mind i lift weights and play baseball weekly and i have no problems) so for baseball im out best pitcher) and btw i dead lift  70kg (idk how much that is pounds) 

&amp;#x200B;

the point im trying to make is

i know can easily complete the basic training and i know that because i know people in the Australian army. 

 

also ive been looking up to the army for as long as i can remember and for the last 2 years i can think of nothing but it (in terms of what i want to do). i want it more than anything but im afraid of  not being allowed to be in it. because last time i applied they told me i was ""not fit"" to join whether that be medically or psychologically and if i wanted to change that i need new medical information ?(they didnt tell me which it was)

&amp;#x200B;

keep in mind i weigh maybe 75kg (idk how much that is in pounds but probs not alot)

&amp;#x200B;

i think i am fine to join (at least the reserve army) because unless WW3 happens i probably wont be able to fight in a war) (keep in mind u have to ask to fight in a war overseas in the australian army (thats what i think someone told me))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the last time i applied they told me to get more information from my psychologist or a medical professional. but i haven't spoken to her (my psychologist) in 1 year since she became a manager and doesn't see patients anymore and there hasnt been any medical advances in relating to the meniscus (knee) 

they want some form of new information to show im not some idiot trying to kill himself (most likely)  (and that's not me anymore) i have 1 more chance at applying for the Australian army.

&amp;#x200B;

also when i was seeing my psychologist  (in the past) i stopped seeing her early because i didn't feel like killing myself anymore and she acknowledged that (idk if she wrote that on my profile or not) 

&amp;#x200B;

(cause ive been told u get 3 chances) (maybe thats just through normal means of applying idk)

&amp;#x200B;

but overall i think i've got 1 more chance at being able to do what i dream of (im jealous of those people who get drafted i mean by all of this)  like i have the highest respect to whoever fights for their country and i want nothing more to do that with my own.

457,"So I’ve just moved into a flat in London on Saturday after starting a new job late November and staying on friends sofas. 

I didn’t know anyone looking for a house so I’m living with 4 randoms for the time being - I thought everyone seemed cool but as time has gone on, specifically one person has began to make me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

So it was having a beer with 2 of them, I’ll use fake names for now, we’ll call them Marcus and Antonio. Marcus starts making weird comments about my age (I’m 24, 10 years younger than him) and then my nationality and how I have an advantage to him and the other flat mates as the only English person. Just very odd comments to make the second time you’ve met someone.

After some silence watching tv he then apologised for being confrontational - I said I took it as nothing and assumed he was joking. He then started making weird comments again soon after and again apologised for being blunt.

The next day I thought okay, he was probably just drunk and it’s nothing. But last night I heard him arguing with the Russian tenant (Viktor) who has only been here for one week longer than me. 

It seemed as though from what I heard that Viktor had put something on his fridge shelf. Marcus starts accusing him of being passive aggressive and says it’s pissing him off ‘dont fuck with me’ he says. Then calls him a f**got and storms into his room. (I believe the Russian probably gay)

Now what the fuck do I do? The guy seems unhinged and snaps at really minor shit. We were watching don’t fuck with cats and he starts having a go at me saying is this the kind of shit I like etc? I’m worried he’s going to threaten me the moment I piss him off. Want to just avoid him, or talk to the other housemates but I’m not sure how chummy they are with him. Obviously I will speak to Viktor when I can.

459,"Okay so I (21f) have a best friend (19m) who is bi, but mainly guy leaning. He's a really lovely guy, can be quite shy but from what I know he's very sexually active. Which is fine, his body his choice. He's currently seeing a guy, Lets call him Chris, who I've met and is lovely, but I know my BF has also been sleeping with other people. My personal opinion on this is that yeah, not the best thing to do to somebody, but at their age and if there's nothing ''serious'' going on between him and the guy he's seeing, it's his choice. 

One of the guys he told me about was a mutual co-worker who had not yet come out as gay, or bi, but my best friend told me they had been together a few times and slept together. This guy, we'll call him Dave, is lovely to me in work, but I wasn't the biggest fan of how he was treating BF. (hiding him, ignoring him in public, love bombing sometimes.)

Story time: 

I went to a very late Christmas party on Wednesday night, BF wasn't there as he left the company, and I spent most of the night with Dave. Dave lives very faraway and I'm quite central so I said he could stay at my place, as I'm usually very open to people staying with me instead of wasting money on taxis. We ended the night around 4am, and were walking home together, I was pretty tipsy and ranting about some drama that had happened just before we left, and we eventually started talking about BF and their situation. Dave was being quite withheld about stuff he knew I already knew about, like him and BF and their relationship, and since I was wasted I just straight up asked. To my surprise, Dave denied being anything more than friends with BF, and said they had never slept together. 

I wrote this off for the night and just said that I might have mixed stuff up, but in reality it hurt because I know what I know, and I believe my BF. He really likes this guy as well, and I don't know whether or not to tell him what Dave said to me.  BF knows I'm quite forward and would have asked Dave about the situation, so he's been asking me to tell him about what we talked about. I don't know if its right for me to say what I was told, and I don't want to hurt BF. I think Dave is quite confused about his sexuality and I don't know him well enough to put this past him, and I know that he was seeing a girl while sleeping with BF and not telling her that he was gay/bi. 

Do I tell BF what I know? Any advice on how to handle this would be great. I feel awful.

I work as a grant manager for a couple of local municipalities which means my day is spent in a cubicle drafting applications all day or chasing down pieces of information from people to put the application together. It feels very soul crushing. I don’t think humans were meant to stare at screens all day.

I often dream of a job in construction or manual labor where I could just turn my brain off and get lost in the physical work. At least it would be better for my posture. 

I have been applying for other jobs but I find myself having trouble identifying what kind of work I want to be doing. I want something with good work/life balance that allows me to not have to take my work home with me or to be stressing about what work is waiting for me the next day.

464,"I'm a catsitter, meaning people pay me to take care of their cats while they're on vacation or just a few days away.

TLDR: Is it acceptible for me, as merely the catsitter, to buy a cheap cardboard scratchpad or similar as a gift for a cat who doesn't have anything to scratch? 
More context below:

------------------------------

There is this cat whom I'm now catsitting for the third time. The first time I noticed he had a quite badly ingrown nail and notified the owner,bthey thanked me for being so observant as they hadn't noticed and said they'd have it taken care of. The second time I catsit here, about a week after that, the ingrown nail was not yet fixed and I offered to take the cat to the vet, if they wanted me to, to have it fixed. The owner declined and said they'd take care of it the next week.
Few months go by and I've not heard of them again, and I worried I overstepped my boundaries as a catsitter? But then I get booked by them again, saying how pleased they had been with my care, and that the cat was pleased too since he had his nails fixed since.

So now I'm catsitting this same cat again, and I notice his nails are growing rather long again, and judging by a wound on one of his toebeans (not the toe that was ingrown the first time) he recently had another ingrown nail fixed. This cat has no scratch posts or similar and is an indoor cat, so it's no wonder that his nails keep growing too long.
I'm a crazy cat lady and this catsitting is more of a paid hobby for me than an income provider. Seeing a cat struggle like this with owners who mean well, but are maybe not so educated in cat care, is difficult for me because I'd love to help but at the same time I don't want to overstap boundaries or offend the owner. (the owner seems really friendly by the way, with good intentions).
So I've been thinking of buying a simple scratch pad and leave it as a gift during this catsitting. Basically I'm using the money for this catsitting for that. I don't expect, and wouldn't even ask the owner to repay it, I'd much rather see the cat simply helped with a decent scratching spot. 

Would this be okay, or is that not done/offending to the owner? What are your thoughts?",17Jan2020,1

469,"So I have been chatting with this girl for almost the entire school year now. I was moving from a much larger public school to a private school and she really helped me get settled and make a bunch of friends within the first weeks of school. It was great and honestly I was just glad to have her as a friend. And we chatted it up for months since. Well anyways their is this boy who honestly I have no problems wit. But he quite talking to her for 3 months or so because he was gonna try and date a discord girl. I don’t think it worked out and suddenly this month he asks her out on a date. They already had the date and she seems pretty happy.  I don’t want to ruin our friendship over this and I really don’t want to make things awkward between us. 

Since it was their first date they aren’t exclusive yet so I was thinking about telling her how I feel about the situation but I think that is just coming from jealousy. But think about what the guy would blow off if he finds another discord girl he seriously blew her off and quite talking to her for months. I don’t want her heartbroken again after her last rough relationship.

I was thinking about asking her out after I get my drivers licenses because well it is important to have a way to bring her to dates and such. But now it feels like an awful time to ask her out.

I am a teenager born in an asian family, currently studying in year 11 (16f). I’m going to be getting my grades for my first term of IB by the end of this week, and the past few weeks have been very hectic and stressful for me. I have my responsibilities as a house captain, club leader etc (just like any other student I guess) and on top of them I’ve maintained a total score of 35 out of 42 ( basically we’re graded for 6 subjects, each out of 7). This was considered very above average in my year level, many of my friends are getting 25-30. 
As much effort I’ve spent on my grades and school activities, my parents have never acknowledged or complimented my accomplishments. They’re always complaining about me not doing well enough and comparing me with my siblings. I have a brother who’s a year older than me and he got 39/42 for his final score and recently got in a university he wanted.  Before he was admitted, my parents always scolded him for being lazy or underperforming, but as soon as he got in my parents immediately shoved him compliments and cooked him special dinner and gave him food during meals.  
My parents used to always tell me not to be a “failure” like my brother and sometimes even threatened me that if I performed as “bad” as he did, they will literally lock me in my room until I study for idk 7 straight hours (5-12 at night after school) 
And also a side note I like to hang out with friends and play online games with them, but my conflict with family have made us spend less time together and I feel a bit left out. 
After all of these things, I’ve been very emotionally and physically burnt out, I’ve been trying very hard to impress my parents while completing my obligations, but it always ends up with “you could have done better” even if I did my best. All I really needed is a small compliment from my parents to be honest and I also want a break from all of this. I feel very empty not being able to accomplish anything and my motivation to strive for better has disappeared. I also feel lonely and depressed most of the time being neglected by my parents.

I am going to try and be as ambiguous as possible to protect identity, so this colleague will be referred to as 'X'.

X is on a good wage, lives at home with parents, no real financial responsibilities or ties. Constantly asking to borrow money right after payday, constantly trying to apply for loans. At work, X is constantly sniffing, blowing or has a running nose. Also incredibly twitchy and can never seem to settle. Sometimes they will come in incredibly low and look shattered, other times won't shut up and seems to literally be buzzing - to the point where they cannot sit still. Constantly gets phone calls where X has to 'run out and meet someone', no partner as always moans is single. Doesn't seem to be interested in work, never is off her phone. If she gets a phone call, runs to it and if anyone gets up to pass her phone to her she freaks out. Previous partner was a heavy drug user of cocaine, and X confirmed used to use this drug before, but apparently since splitting up is now clean.

I met a girl in 2019 and she sees past my disability, she's very kind and she is attractive. I like spending time with her and she is not like most people our age (obsessed with drinking, doing drugs etc.) To me a good sense of humour is really important and although she has one, our sense of humour is a bit different and I never find myself hysterically laughing with her like you would with a best friend. As we spend more time the initial feeling of passion, excitement and attraction is still there but it has faded. I find myself wanting her to be a little bit skinnier, which I know is not fair since I am far from perfect ( disability). for any one who's been able to keep a long term relationship, how early did you know they were the one you want to spend the rest of your life with.

In hearing distance from everyone he complains how boring all the kids at the party are. When people come over if he is not interested in them he will hardly engage at all.

And I used to be really good friends with a girl and we kinda had a joke that she’d say something, I’d stress out for a minute then would tell me it’s a joke, then continue it on for weeks. It sounds mean but it isn’t really lol.

Anyway we sorta went different ways on good terms. We had different friends and we’re closer to them. 

Now she’s texted me saying I hate her and that I’m watching her sleep, so I thought it was a joke and said “lol nah I don’t hate you maybe it’s the devil watching u sleep 😳”

But she went on and went on. She sounded crazy. She said people are in her house watching her and planning to kill her.

So i asked her if it was a joke and she said no, and this went on for a few more minutes before I asked if she was actually being serious, and said she was.

It’s gone past the point it felt like a joke, over ten minutes, and I’m worried. She ended it really weirdly. She said her mother is plotting against her and said goodnight. She hasn’t responded, and that was 20 minutes ago.

I’ve sent her tonnes of messages asking if she was okay and if she’s joking, no response.

I’m actually shaking, physically shaking not the “hahah I’m shook”. I don’t know what’s going on with her.

482,"So I'll try to keep this short, but quite a lot has gone into the situation to make me think that my daughter is not safe.

When I got pregnant with my daughter, I moved into my now husbands house. At the time, we lived with his parents who kindly took us in. Whilst living with them, everything seemed normal, however after a while I noticed that my husbands father would start looking at me a certain way. 

To be explicit about the situation and straight forward, he managed to corner me in my bedroom whilst husband was at work and he asked for a hug. I didn't think it was too weird, but when he pressed his hips into me, I could definitely feel him against me. I remember uncomfortably moving away from him as the realization dawned on me.

When he left the bedroom, I cried and rang my husband and told him everything. He said that he couldn't be sure if he meant anything by it, and so we carried on as normal, but I was on high alert.

Anyway, this happened on and off, as time progressed whenever the father and i were alone he would take advantage of me, either touching my butt or otherwise. I never said anything, I confided in my husband but things always stayed the same.

Fast forwards to when I finally escape that hell hole situation. We've rented our first place and my daughter is going to nursery. I get a knock on the door and it's the police. They tell me that a family member informed them that he saw my husbands father touching my daughter (who was only 3 at the time) inappropriately. I was in shock...

But nothing ended up coming of the case because this supposed family member ended up changing there story and essentially ended up in a mental institution. Apparently he'd stopped taking his meds, and not soon after this person took there own life.

But alarm bells are ringing. I know that this man is a creep and that his intentions aren't good. How do I know that he wouldn't do these things to a 3 year old? 

Am I suppose to let her near him? Do I risk breaking the family apart by saying anything? It makes me sick to my stomach when she so much as sits on his lap now, I feel like I'm going insane! And I don't know what is the right thing to do. She loves her grandfather to bits, and I know everyone won't believe me if I do say anything. But I feel like I shouldn't be putting her at risk?

Now not to be unfair towards the guy, he gets paid very little, roughly half what we get paid, despite doing the same job; recently he asked for a raise and was denied as he is requested a university degree; which is when issues started.

I started seeing him working from morning to night, do his job, and then he would do his own thing; he would go out, meet with people, etc... etc... using the office computers as he cannot afford his own, you see where I am going. Workplace policy specifies this is not allowed.

Once I confronted him about this and he just said ""But, can you prove it?""... told him this wasn't fair and he said ""I don't play fair""; the cynicism on his face, he was full of it, man I got surprised at the reaction; I told him to quit his job if he was so unhappy and he said something on the lines of It'll be the same thing.

It's hard to be mad at the guy because he doesn't bother anyone; and since he came the team productivity has increased; but he would break every single rule, he doesn't care, I don't even think he cares if he gets fired, and I don't even think they would fire him; after all for management, he is cheap labor.

493,"I’ve been friends with this girl since 2017 we also dated,broke up and became friends again  however since Wednesday it doesn’t seem like she wants to be friends with me anymore. 


She has made this new friend  I don’t like her and to be honest ever since she has been friends with this girl (could be jealousy but I feel like she is not a good person) she hasn’t been her usual self eg ignoring me,room gets quiet when I  enter etc. 

It also seems like I always have to start the conversation. 
Last week she also said she is moving in the next 3 months. I texted her about it and she then said “I’m moving next year”   I was angry as she played with my emotions and she knew it made me upset. 





Any advice will be appreciated.",17Jan2020,1
494,"(Throwaway account, due to personal nature)

I have seen a few examples (in life but also on reddit recently) of people saying that nipples should be covered up and not visible. Basically “I’m uncomfortable if someone else’s nipples are visible through their shirt”. Specifically them comparing this to a mans erection being visible in public.

I personally have very prominent nipples, I used to care when I was young and semi-bullied about it but now that I’m an adult, if someone (rarely) mentions it I have a thick enough skin to ignore/handle it. 

I am not kidding, I can be wearing a T-shirt under a medium loose sweater (think lighter than a hoodie, thicker than a dress shirt) and you can clearly see my nipples, even when I’m not cold (I.e. they’re not “hard”)

I happen to be male, but this seems like a gender neutral issue to me. I only say this to pre-empt bra questions.

Is this something I should go out of my way to prevent? (Wearing multiple undershirts, etc) am I being immoral or inconsiderate by existing without wearing three shirts?

Thanks for your time and hopefully any thoughts you have.",17Jan2020,1
495,"I’m a F(24) who has almost no friends at work because they all think I’m too strict when it’s my turn to lead. At the company there are less than 10 people who share my same ethnicity and out of those in the only one in a leadership role. At the chain of command I’m like in the 4th/5th level with other people. I do admit I was very strict when I first got the opportunity to lead but only because I would get reprimanded for small mistakes I let slip by not being strict. I wanna build a better relationship with my coworkers but it seems unreachable. It’ll soon be 4 years since I joined the company and I only have 3 good relationships with my co workers. It’s been 1 year since I’ve became leadership. I’ve gotten tips such as you have to joke around with them, ask personal questions etc but it’s hard to talk when they’re stuff going on &amp; customers to help. I’ve been thinking of leaving the company because I don’t feel welcomed or wanted. I’ve made up my mind to give my 2 weeks in a month. But before I do I want to try one last time to build trust with my co workers and see if there can be a good relationship. 

Can anyone help me? How would you recommend making friends?

496,"I recently just started going to counselling. It's been something that I wanted to try going to for a couple of years, but I didn't really have the courage to take steps towards doing it until now. Today I had my 3rd session, but compared to the other two I was more emotional than usual. We were doing a sheet to figure out if I was suffering from low mood, it started out ok but as it went on there was a lot of questions that I was not sure how I felt about them. So i just replied ""I don't know"". The counsellor then said that they feel that we are at a standpoint, they aren't sure what to do as they cannot figure out if it is low mood, anxiety (I previously did a sheet for that too with similar results) or something else entirely that I am experiencing. 

At that point I began wondering if there really was anything going on with me. There seems to be nothing wrong going by the sheets I have done, am I really just wasting time being here? I really wanted to just go home. We tried to move on by doing a worry tree; we filled the tree in and were about to talk about one of the topics on it. They asked what does a relationship mean to me. I thought of an answer, but didn't want to say it. So I responded with ""I don't know"". I really didn't want to continue the session. They asked if i wanted to end the session early as I seem too emotional, and I said yes. They then asked if anyone wanted me to go to counselling or if I chose to do it myself. I said I had wanted to do it for a while. They asked what it was that made me choose to go now of all times, I thought of all the different things that lead me to this point and still chose to say ""I don't know"" instead of an actual answer. Thus, the session ended there and I am still not sure how to feel about it.  

I have always hated talking about my feelings because I find it difficult to describe them to other people. So going to counselling was a pretty big step for me, I was really hoping that it would help me to deal with the problems I am experiencing. But I am not so sure now. Will I get better at expressing my feelings to them if I continue to go? Or will I just be wasting money going there every week?",17Jan2020,1
497,"Almost a year ago i moved across the country with my ex-girlfriend, leaving all my friends behind far away. The relationship didn't go well, we broke up after a month in this new town.

I didn't really make moves towards building something new for myself. I just stayed around as a help to my ex until she moved on. Now i am alone here, nobody to talk to. Im 27, don't have a fulltime job so i just scrape by. I don't do anything, i'm so far down and i have no idea how to escape this hole.

I've wanted a girlfriend since I was about 12, so it's not like this desire crept up on me recently. It's been something I've been interested in for over a decade. It's been soul-destroying to go through life perpetually single despite desiring romantic companionship.

In the past I've tried a couple of interest groups, expanding my social circle, going to clubs and bars, online dating and haven't really had success with any of it. Nowadays I don't get out as much because I'm jaded.

In terms of my friends situation, I have a handful of friends that I talk to semi-regularly, all guys. I don't remember ever having someone I'd consider a close female friend. Even if it came to looking for just friends, I don't know that it would be easy to pinpoint where to go to meet like-minded people, but as it stands, I'm not dissatisfied with my current friend situation. It's the romantic side of things that I'm having severe issues with, and I feel stuck with it.

505,"So I have a friend who I love to pieces. Like I really do love her so much. She lives on the other side of the country so when I see her it’s always so nice but recently the friendship is becoming so smothering. 

So for some backstory, we’ve both struggled with depression in the last year or so and she always says that I’ve ‘saved her life’ and that ‘she wouldn’t be here without me’ which makes me feel even more guilty for this post. 

I’ll wake up to texts from her before she’s started work. She’ll text me for her whole lunch hour non stop. As soon as she finishes work, she’ll text or usually call me. She’ll call/FaceTime with no warning and often the calls are anywhere up to 5 hours long and when I want to hang up she gets annoyed at me (e.g. if I want to go and watch something starting on TV, she’ll say I’m prioritising it over her). If I don’t pick up the call at all, she’ll call again. 

If we aren’t speaking on the phone, she will be texting/Snapchatting/Instagram DMing/Twitter DMing me (all at the same time usually) and if I don’t reply to one of those I’ll get ‘so you can answer my Snapchat but not my texts?’. She has my Twitter notifications on so as soon as I tweet anything she’s replying and messaging me about it. 

I feel guilty when I don’t answer just incase anything bad has happened in terms of her depression, but at the same time I literally feel so smothered it’s hard to do what I want to do.

508,"Hey everyone, I'm sorta new to reddit and don't post much but I really need some advice right now and I have nobody to talk to about this.  

When I was 18, I witnessed a very traumatic event which involved the death of my best friend.  I was young and it affected me very deeply but I didn't know how to properly address the feelings I had. I turned to drugs and sex to distract me.

Since then,  I have dealt with my trauma, cleaned up and I am very happy. I got a great job, fell in love, and I have a beautiful 5 month old daughter who I love more than anything. 

Last week I noticed itching in my genital area. I had shaved a few days earlier so I thought nothing of it. It got worse and eventually turned into a really painful rash. I haven't had sex  in a very long time (probably about a year) so an STD didn't even cross my mind.  Yesterday I went to the doctor and found out that it's actually a herpes outbreak. Apparently you can have the virus for years without ever having an outbreak.

So how the fuck to I tell the man I've been with for 3 years that I have herpes? I have been 100% loyal to him,  but he's been cheated on by every girl he was with before me and it's a very sensitive subject. I know that he will be skeptical when I tell him. 

More importantly though;
I thought this was just a really bad case of razor burn. I had been touching the area to apply ointment several times a day to try and relieve the symptoms. I hadn't been taking precautions that I would have if I knew this was herpes- and I change my daughter's diapers several times a day.  I'm scared shitless that I could have passed this to her.

I could NEVER EVER forgive myself if I did.  The thought alone makes me physically ill. 

I'm such a wreck right now. I thought I had left my mistakes in the past and I've done everything to make a good life for myself and my family, I never thought something like this would happen and hurt them.  Please,  I just need advice.",17Jan2020,1

He's basically a menace and is annoying as hell when he wants attention.
    Yet my mom doesn't see it. She's been married to him for over 12 years and she just thinks that it's in the hands in the Lord and whatnot.
   It's fine if she thinks that, but HE WILL NOT CHANGE. He's been narcissistic always, but she keeps making excuses for him. I tell her to leave him and we'll be fine once he's gone. But he is too controlling and doesn't want to let her leave.
  I grey rock my stepdad and I am basically a threat to him since I don't let him control or influence me. So any time he's mad at me, he attacks his wife instead. It's like he can't face me. He's pathetic.

I have a cat, I love him, but he is a pain and a half 😂 he brings live animals in, meows consistently for food, wakes me up four times a night. But I love him and I want him to be happy.

The cat is actually my ex partners and he'll be taking the cat back on 28.2.20.

My fiancé HATES the cat and wants him gone asap. I want him to stay atleast until 28.2.20 as there's no where for him to go before. 

We argued last night because a pleasant evening turned into a row after we couldn't catch the mouse the cat had brought in! 

I don't know what he wants me to do, the cat can't go to my ex partners house until the end of Feb but I can't live in this house where there's tension over a cat.

He thinks by not chucking the cat I'm not respecting his feelings, I'm frankly fed up of rowing about the cat when I've already sorted him going at the end of Feb.

516,"Hi, first of all, English is not my first language, so sorry in advance for mistakes.

So I am a bit lost and wanted to share this feeling, because it feels horrible daily. I know people have more serious problems and it's nothing major, but want to get it off my chest.

I am having trouble on finishing this friendship. I am a female and I met this also female friend in my high school years, when we just started. I always got attracted to lonely and unpopular people, mostly of them introverts, since I am one and I enjoy making people laugh and I don't want anyone to be left alone, since I know what it means. So when I started high school, there was another introvert in the class and I befriended her. Honestly, I could have chosen any other person to be friends with, since everyone like me quite a lot, but I chose her and people started making fun of us, as we were weird people with our introvert personality and weird hobbies (as books and writing it, anime, goth punk emo styles and so on). So in the beginning it was alright, I always made her laugh when she cried, I stayed by her side, I though I was being a good friend and I expected nothing in exchange. I did things like: once she broke her glasses and sat crying in the corridor so instead of being in the P.E. I sat on the floor with her and made puppy noises as that made her laugh.

Of course the only sad part from that time is that she always and I mean ALWAYS declined to go with me anywhere. I mean, I get it, and introverts always wants to be at home alone more than go out somewhere, I feel like that too. But every single time... It kind of crushed me.

As years went by things got worse. It has been now 10 years and things are just out of hands. At first it was small things, she just stopped trying for me to do anything: wouldn't go with me anywhere (as always, so I got used to it, but I still continued to ask), finally she just ignored my text messages for months, but apparently that was MY fault as I tried to seek some advice from my other friends.

As years went by she finally got a boyfriend and actually things got better: she actually started hanging out with me and texting me. But still, when I needed her help, she never answered, later went back to ignoring my texts again for months. Also, whenever we met up it was always me, her and her boyfriend. At first I was happy for her but later I noticed how she couldn't do ANYTHING without him, she even had to make a call to him whenever she wanted to buy something like a food item for herself and asked him is she can do that. It looked weird to me, since I have been in a relationship and I started noticing how it reminded a bit of me and how things ended in a really bad way.

I remember during my another birthday, as always, I asked her to attend. Surprise, but she agreed and that happened maybe once or twice during my life. I was thrilled. And so, since I moved to another city, she actually drove to me. I was in a cafe as she approached me, gave me a gift, sat down for 5 minutes and then said: my boyfriend is sitting in the car and we actually came here so we could look around the town just the two of us, so I need to go. I was crushed... Again.

Things started worsening again. She wouldn't want to meet and when we did, she was either looking at instagram all the time or with her boyfriend. Like, she never talked to me normally when we met. Although I kept making the effort, as inviting her to events, making gifts, choosing gifts half year ahead of time and giving her stuff she I hope loved since it was associated with her current hobbies as for example the gifts I got from her were like: a candle, or those perfume sets that you give to a person when you have no idea what to give or a simple brown mug. I am not a materialistic person and it's not about the price, it just seemed that she doesn't know me at all with such gifts.

Then I started noticing how spoiled she turned out to be. Whenever something happened she yelled as loud as she could and her boyfriend came running and asking what happened. After time her boyfriend admitted he stopped going to check on her because it used to be the most stupid things ever why she yelled.

She started complaining to me all the time. About everything. Like her well payed job, her family (that always listens to her and gives her everything and hugs her constantly, while my family never hugged me and only beat me up while I was crying so I never showed emotions, never cried, never laughed since either way I was beaten up or just alone all the time), she seven kept complaining about her boyfriend ( that he is the worst and she could have chosen another guy and she keeps thinking what would have been), her studies (when she cried in university and got a mark she wanted, it was all it took. And it was simple biology studies while I am suffering with med school 6 days a week). So basically, everything is handed to her on a golden plate and she just takes it and still complains. When she doesn't like it, she cries and then gets what she wants. For example, she went to the gynecologist without an appointment, since there were people waiting with appointments she just started crying as loud as she could. She continued this as nurses approached her and agreed to let her see a doctor NOW. My friend is 24 years old btw.

Another story stuck in my head, as I wanted to start working out, but was shy to go alone to a sports club alone I asked her. She as always, declined. Surprise surprise, she used to go to a sport club and exactly when I asked her to go with her, she said she will never go to a sport club again as it is a waste of money. Okay, then if it's about money, I asked her to start running with me around neighbourhood. She declined. I asked her few more times during half a year. She decline. Okay. Her choice. Then one day her boyfriend, as we were talking, found out I was running for half a year now, he said to me: Why you never take your friend running with you? You're such a bad friend for not inviting as she is trying to loose weight desperately and keeps complaining to me she needs to start working out. I looked at my friend, who just stayed quiet. So I never asked her.

So despite all that, I still was by her side and kept saying that whenever she needs me, I will be there for her. But she got more and more spoiled.  Even her boyfriend stated loosing it, he told me: I can't do it anymore, to run every time she yells or gets angry for no reason at all or to do stuff that she wants and I don't. He said that as we were in our another friends birthday and he asked where she is. Her boyfriend said that his morning she got mad on hell knows who or what so she is not coming. Then I suggested, maybe we should bring her here, since she worked nearby and her work was finishing soon. Her boyfriend lit up and was like: yes, what a brilliant idea! But please come with me, I don't want to do this alone. I agreed and went while having cold and temperature, although I had to leave in a few days to another country I planned for 8 years and wanted not to be sick. So we went to pick her up ( I actually used to come to her work all the time with cupcakes or such, just to cheer her up, because she constantly complained how hard her work was, as she said she only sits at work and watches tv series all day, what a hard job...) As we arrived at her work, yes, she was mad. At me? At her boyfriend? We had no idea. At that time it seems that on both of us so we just looked confused as we did nothing to her. Later we got her to the birthday party and she was happy as ever, enjoying her time, kissing her boyfriend, like nothing happened. Btw, I got sick after that even more, just on time for my long awaited trip.

Sorry, for the long story but now to the main event and ending. So, since I was coming back to my home town for half a year to have internship at a hospital, I got excited and asked her if I could join her DnD group. I asked her in winter, as I was coming back at autumn. She said possibly no, because they have a lot of people already. I wasn't mad, I was calm and asked if something changes just let me know. Then suddenly at summer the dm texts me himself and says that I can attend the DnD session. And so I did from autumn. At first it was okay. Then every session, as I sat besides her, she started mumbling all the time about me. It drove me insane. She kept mumbling EVERY DAMN TIME. Of how bad I play, what a selfish player I am or that I can not be the main character. The funny part is, that I actually just sat quietly all the time, since I felt guilty. Maybe she's right, so I didn't say a word for some sessions. But oh boy, if not for me, she would still yell and scream for most stupid things ever, for example when she rolled a bad number she would just take and throw her dice at a wall constantly while screaming or would just kick her dog. During once session after it I had a private one (since I was missing few session) and she stayed there and listened to my story. But it seems that me being the main character and talking drove her insane. 10 minutes into the session she just started crying. Seeing this, I realized it's just another one of her shows, but said nothing. Since no one paid attention, she started crying even more as dm noticed and started asking what's wrong. All the guys at the moment (like 3 of them) started jumping around her, treating her like a god damn queen. She just started screaming and left the room, occupying the only bedroom (where I and her had to sleep, while guys stayed at the living room where we were playing, since we were on a convention). All the guys got scared and started asking whose fault it was that she cried. So here we were: sitting in living room, with serious and scared faces, nearly crying of not knowing who actually made her cry and questioning everything. As I tried to go to sleep after few hours of this, I couldn't, since she didn't want to see anyone, so I stayed in a kitchen in darkness and tried to sleep on the chair. Later on, she came back to living room all cheerful and laughing saying it was nothing and not to worry about.

So another session come by and I notice my dm has his hand bandaged up. I ask him and he shows me in private that underneath it he has written: just have fun. Since the last event traumatized him, he kept trying so this wouldn't happen again. He was so scared, I saw it in this eyes. So as the session goes on, I had to start talking since my character died and I was in the center of attention against my will and there she goes again, mumbling about me. As the session ends, another person starts attacking me and the dm, since dm screwed up a little by killing me. As everyone is just screaming and pointing fingers at me I have lost it. Since I never show emotions, I just lost it. I started crying (it wasn't helping that one of my friends killed herself just a week ago) and so they start making fun of me crying. I try to say that I remember the friend who killed herself and another one died in a car accident over a few months ago. And so I just go outside, I am tired of this, I am not used to people seeing me crying either. And so here I am: alone in winter, without a coat, just crying in the street, sitting on the ground like a helpless child at night. Guess, did my friend even came after me or texted me? No. Although she always had to drive me home after sessions since it was night. This time she didn't. I just walked home later alone by myself.

Now I want to apologize to her, but for what? I am confused. And honestly, as time is going by, nothing has changed, the life without her is the same as I was her friend. The difference is, I don't need to spend my time on her trying for her, cheering her up, listening to her complaints, making her gifts for half a year. And she still can't even move a finger to text me, as I made such efforts as going to her work every week.

Day before yesterday all was good (had sex), yesterday when my gf got a bit touchy I didnt really get an erection, more like a half one, it went up but not really. I thought nothing of it, maybe today I am just not feeling it.

Today I noticed that after peeing I had a lot of leakage afterwards, not just the normal drop/s but a good amount.

I got a little worried, so thought I test and try to get an erection, again just slightly going up, no real ""feeling"" which you normally would have.

The middle part ""underneath"" the penis (sorry idk how its called) which usually gets stronger and tight while getting an erection (urethra?) basically isnt ""there"" while being half erected.

May I have some infection, or did something ""break"" there?

Sorry my english isnt that good, especially when trying to explain medical stuff which I dont know about.",17Jan2020,1

522,"Hello! I'm kinda new here so sorry for being lazy with this, and I have several projects to do.



I'm in college , currently in a relationship with a girl whom I liked back in June, it was very nice at first 
Like super nice. We both had lots of similarities and we hit it off pretty well, she loves me and I return the feelings .    Anyways , as the months flew by she made drastic changes. 

She would randomly become toxic and snap at me, I shrugged it off for a good while since I thought it was because she was having problems that she weren't bothering to tell me about. I decided to talk to her about it and it went smooth. Three days later that behavior went back and I've been shrugging it off, lots of fights here and there but I managed to pull it off. I was getting constantly hurt and I don't have the courage to talk back most of time mainly because I'm scared that she'll do something crazy or something. Here I am in January, she became verbally abusive with words whenever I slip up on minor things. She says horrible degrading things that I am not going to even try to mention.

She's giving off confusing signs, she makes me feel like I'm worthless sometimes and the next thing you know she's being lovey dovey and nibbling my cheeks while I'm busy with my phone.


 I don't know, I'm at the edge right now.

All in all this may sound fake or weird but I don't really care what you all think this is, I just want a little help.
This probably looks like a small problem but hey! Problems are problems!

523,"So this may be a complete non issue in the future, but here's my situation. 

I'm going to have a new roommate soon. He's this dude I've known for years, good guy and I'm looking forward to rooming with him. Here's the problem.

He's, well, extremely into this new girl he's been seeing. He has gotten his first real girlfriend recently. No issue with that I'm happy for him, however it is clearly in the honeymoon stage if you catch my drift and he's kind of taking it to an egregious level. He rarely hangs out in the friend group anymore, as I would slightly expect when you get a new girlfriend but maybe not to this level. I'm not surprised he would cancel on some things every now and then. He however is kind of flat out blowing all of us off on a consistent basis and I kind of worry this is due to her influencing him to not be with his friends. When he does hangout he's buried in his phone. Does nothing but talk about her. Literally, like we'll talk about anything name something for example, music, video games, day to day shit, and he'll always find some way to bring the conversation back around to something about her. 

She's thrown up a few signs that imo are red flags. Some examples:

She very rarely if ever wants to interact with any of us. We have a diverse friend group, both chicks and dudes so it's not like it's just a bunch of bros circlejerking. We've tried to be welcoming but she's very standoffish. Now sure she claims to be an introvert, and I'm not trying to push her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but my friend in question isn't an introvert. Yet ever since he started dating her, he has kind of become one. I'm conflicted on whether or not this is by his choice or if he's trying so hard to please her that he's forgoing his prior social ""obligations."" 

When they first started talking he went on some trip with a few of his family members. His girlfriend got upset with this for some reason. He tried to explain the reason to me but even he couldn't explain it well, admitting later to not fully understanding it himself either. She wouldn't talk to him for days and he was pretty upset by this. To me I think this is manipulative, and if this is how she acts during trivial issues like just hanging out with his family how will she act during something important?

We were at a party a while ago and he did nothing but sit with her in the corner. Hardly interacted with anyone. We tried to play some darts, something he absolutely loves doing, he looked at her and she just gave him this stare, like a thousand yard stare, and he said ""nah I think I'll sit this one out.""

His behavior simply has me concerned, but I know it's not my place to judge or anything. But I've been in a relationship that feels exactly like this, and it was horrifically abusive. I'm not ready to say that will definitively happen, I just don't want my friend to get fucked over. 

Sorry this is getting long. Now I already asked him months ago if he wanted to room with me because my current roommate gave me a ton of notice that he was leaving. What can I do here? What would you do? I dont want to outright tell him to not move in but I don't want her to effectively move in or create any kind of toxic environment. But again I don't *know* if that'll happen or not.",17Jan2020,1
524,"Hello! 

I'm 25 years old and I have so much trouble in holding down a job. I've held only 2 jobs in my life, one for 2 months and one for a year, and the rest of them have been for a couple of weeks after which I quit. 

I can't say that it's social anxiety making me do this- I got treatment for it and it's still happening. I just can't figure out the cause. I go to work, everything's normal, but then down the line I start dreading getting out of bed and going there and I start making excuses about being sick, and after that I quit. It's not that they're tiring or people are mean or anything like that. And I should be motivated because I'm poor and in dire need of money.  But it's like I just can't.

Context:
Phisical stuff have been weird to me. As a kid I was molested by my uncle. (Not rape itself. My auntie told me that he did not like penetration so I guess that's why)
As a teenager even when I liked someone I had no libido. And when people would try to kiss me I would cry.. The first time I remember trying to hurt myself badly I was 9 in the bathtub. When my parents found out about the selfharming they took me to church to exorcist the demons. but after a while I finally went to therapy and I have been on and off since I was 15.
I took years to finally think and talk about it. I found out that the same happened to my sisters and discovered why I was so disgusted with those sort of things. Since I began Therapy my libido has increased. In 2018 I gave my first kiss and things did not advanced much as we only saw each other at university and I still had some trouble with being intimate. 


I (20) have met a guy(21). An awesome guy that literally makes everything looks possible and beautiful. He is really respectfull and I am certain that when the day comes he will understand whatever happens.

But the thing is, I have been interested in sex for a while now and honestly I think that it is going to happen sometime soon. I have watched porn (kind of a lot) because of my libido but I know they are not really what happens. So I need advise in that manner. How can I prepare myself to it? What should I know about it?How was your guy's experience?

533,"I am a high school teacher. I got my teaching license with the goal to teach at international schools. I have 3 years experience in my home country. 

I am from country A, husband is from country B. We met in China and lived there for 4 years, before getting married and moving to the US for my teaching license. We love to travel a lot and have gone on a couple long backpacking trips.   


Right now we are living in my husband's home country while he finishes his degree. I am also a freelance writer, so that's what I've been doing this school year. 

We are now looking for a new place to move (neither of us really want to live in either of our home countries). At the moment, we are considering Curacao, Taiwan, and China, and I've got a few job interviews lined up for these countries. Curacao is not a huge contender, but the school and admin I interviewed with seemed really great. 

Now here's the issue. I LOVED living in China. I really was living my best life. I had a great social circle, fun job, loved the food, self care services were super cheap, and I loved cycling around to explore the city. Living in our own countries has been miserable.  My husband didn't love it as much as I did and hates the constant crowds, rude people, and general disgusting behavior that's pretty common (so many bodily fluids all over the place...). 

Right now our goal is to live a good life and save a ton of money for our next endeavor (travel, a home, a kid, something else entirely, there's no real plan). 

BUT

We are facing a moral conundrum. China, as you are aware, is a bit of an ethical blackhole, and we don't really like the idea of supporting the country or paying taxes into it. But the job I'm currently interviewing for is really really good. The school looks great, and the remuneration package is out of this world. There are a couple issues though. The school is located in a part of the same city we used to live in that we left after a few months for a different neighborhood because it's so far from the good stuff. It's kind of out in the boonies, and while there's no necessities lacking there, it isn't very fun and isn't where our friends go to hang out. It takes about an hour to get into town from there via public transport. 

So we're a bit torn: 

Option A) Take the job for just a year, dealing with the downsides, make a ton of money and get the heck out. 

Option B) Take the job, make a ton of money, and maybe stay in China with a shitty commute but live in a good neighborhood. 

Option C) Take a different job with a lower salary in a different country and have to work longer to save up. 

I guess there are a ton more options but I just don't know what to do.  Is it worth it to suffer a bit in terms of location to make a lot of money? Should we just pick a place that we really want to live ?

He has a habit of inviting his friends late at night, and into the morning hours while I'm trying to sleep for my morning job, and then letting said friends stay the night. They are loud and, as such with typical college-aged adults, alcohol is involved, with a lot of laughing, music, etc. When I moved in at the beginning of this year, I gave my roommate my first month's rent. I gave an application to my landlord, however I never signed any lease, so my guess is that I am currently in a sub situation? Anyways, he has been neglectful of cleaning up the place and has not even thought of me with his habits like a good roommate should do.

542,"Hey all,

Foreword: I realise this is very much a first world problem, but a problem it remains, so I need advice.

Context: 28, Brexit refugee in Germany, been here since Feb 2019. I have been working as a PM on 30k EUR at a translation company for the past year. I don't like my boss and my business has the terribly rated score on online employer ratings sites for various reasons and basically all negative feedback is to do with the CEO. She has never specifically been awful to me but that's because I've been in a position which doesn't require interaction, and I'm pretty damn good at the whole 'manage your manager' thing. I have her respect for sure.

About 6 months ago, I realised my career prospects at the business were not great as my old career (social housing) doesn't exist in Germany to the same extend and a lot of Brexit uncertainty.

I therefore founded a business on the side, running gardening related workshops in my local city. The response was unbelievable. I sold out my first workshop within 24 hours and 2 further ones after that. My plan was to apply for a start up grant for new businesses through the local job centre and a bursary through another gov body (these can only be applied for when a contract ends, aka very soon), as I was almost sure my contract wouldn't be extended due to various factors. I have been steadily preparing to go freelance upon my contract expiring.

It should be known here that I do not enjoy my job, at all. I thoroughly enjoy my workshops and after 8 months of planning and its initial start, I am confident that it could be a huge earner with big prospects - it also fits with my social principles unlike my job, as I want to make it a non-profit one day.

The 'Problem': My boss just offered me a pay rise and a managerial position to 50k EUR p/year on a 1 year contract. I am at a loss of what to do. I have been planning this business for 8 months now and am almost ready to go, but realistically the start up grant isn't a given, nor is the bursary, and I don't have enough money in savings, nor is my business yet big enough to sustain myself whilst my business grows. After a year of saving and sporadic workshops I could comfortably have saved 20k, which puts me in a much better position to start the business next year. 

The caveats are that in that 12 months someone could steal my business idea (there's only room for 1 of us tbh), and also I'll be working in a job that I hate for 12 months purely for the cash.

I cannot stress enough how first world problem this is, I know, but I do have a decision to make and I'm just not sure what to do. Do I follow my head and work for a year in a job I'm going to hate but stable in the knowledge of an income, or follow my heart, say fuck it and leave to start my business?",17Jan2020,1

He is also trying to make his son a room in his appartmant all on his own, is struggling financially because he has to fix his cafe but trying his best to make things work and is in general under A LOT of stress. 

I(20F) live in a different city and came to his city around 10 days before the New years and ever since, his behaviour towards me completely changed.
 He doesnt communicate his feelings well, so I was really upset at how he was treating me because I did not understand why things suddenly changed. He kept ignoring all of my needs, saying insensitive jokes that hurt very much, i always felt degraded because every time i tried to tell him how i felt about hurtful things he is doing, he made me feel like my feelings arent valid and im just overreacting and saying im sucking out his energy by being emotional.

I felt completely neglected emotionally, therefore

 I told him I want to leave and go back home because I feel horrible next to him right now, but he told me to please stay and explained he is struggling and feels better when Im next to him. I said okay. 
Now, a few days later our relationship is worse than ever. 
He doesnt feel like I understand what he is going through, I dont feel like he respects me or my feelings, we are both extremely unhappy and had quite a few fights. Every time we fight and I cry because he hurts my feelings with being disrespectful towards me or because Im scared of where our relationship is going, Im told Im overreacting and told that Im just sucking out his will to live because he doesnt understand why Im crying. He has never been an empathetic person or understanding towards emotions.

 So many things have happened in the last 3 weeks where I felt completely disregarded and unloved. He was talking to some woman on the phone and agreed to meet up, and i got confused because i know all of his friends or at least something about them if i havent met them and he didnt tell me who it is, and also he always invites me along when he has to do something even if its work related, so this evolved into a fight because he believed this is me being jealous because i just asked who he is talking to. I have never acted jealous I just wanted to know who it is. 

My father who i love dearly fell extremely sick and my boyfriend didnt even ask if I was okay because he felt there was no need to because ""I didnt seem upset"", he didnt show in any single way in the last 3 weeks that he cares for me. I react to it poorly and emotionally because it hurts.
We sat down to talk and he told me that I expect too much from him when ALL im asking for is some respect of my emotions and a simple once a day ""how are you feeling today"" or ""hey are you hungry"" which he feels is too much to ask for and that he cant balance his problems and think about me too and that he would rather break up if I cant understand that Im being too needy. 

I told him that in that case, I wont expect absolutely anything from him until he fixes things in his own life because i understand that he is under stress even though im very hurt. And again this morning, he brought things up from last night saying how things between us must change and I said I agree because neither of us feels understanded or supported. 
At that point i turned around hugged my pillow and started crying silently, which he still heard because of me sniffling, and said ""Oh What the hell are you crying about now"" and told me again that im sucking out all of his energy and that I obviously dont understand him and his struggles since Im crying again. 
I tried to explain that I cant control it and that Im crying because im scared of losing him, and that if i didnt understand his struggles I wouldnt have stayed here for him or have agreed not to expect anything from him until he fixes things. He just disagreed with me and said I still dont understand and that if its going to be like this that we should break up. That im too needy and too jealous(what the fuck?)

I’m told my boss I may need to take off a day next week for my friends dads funeral. He made a comment about how he may not give me time off in the future because I’m running through it so quickly into my contract.

Or I'll be with my friends and not message her for a few hours and shell get upset because shes worried. She says she gets angry because she was worried and had anxiety even though it doesnt make sense to me and I dont believe that I should have to message her when I get places or every couple hours.
I feel like shes manipulated me because when she was angry I didnt text her she would sometimes turn things around on me and make me feel bad. She says when she gets like that it's her anxiety controlling her and even if she wants to stop arguing she cant, which I dont really understand.
We did fight quite a bit because she would get angry but I also didnt do a good job at keeping her updated which she said she needed. I just dont see it as a problem or that I should or that I need to do that stuff. It seems controlling. 
Shes also lied to me about quite a few things. She claims shes had a shitty past and really bad past relationships that have really hurt her and she claims some of the defenses and lies comes from anxiety and ptsd from the things that have happened to her and claims that it's her anxiety making her do it with the inability to stop. 

As an example she lied about having money, I have borrowed quite a bit from her and she tended to make me feel bad that I never got her anything when we were out meanwhile i saw she did have some money and lied that she didnt. She claims that one of her exs, she lent over 3 thousand dollars too and when she had absolutely no more money left to her name he up left and disappeared moving to pa with another girl. He left her with nothing and struggling. and she never heard from him again. She claims that she was triggered by how much she lent me that the same thing would happen again. Even though she knows that it wont she claims that her anxiety and ptsd of that past relationship made her panic and feel as if she needed to protect some of her money. It hurts me because I was struggling and she was pretending. I just dont see how anxiety and ptsd could cause her to do that to me. However everytime I did say I was short rent or whatever she did lend me the money. Am I wrong, is that a thing? Or is she wrong for being that way and just crazy?
She thinks that the reason we fought was because I didn't understand and try to do anything to help with her anxiety and worries which led her to do dumb shit she regrets

551," 

Hi, new Reddit user here. My ex (22, M) and I (22, F) just split after a little more than two years together and I was completely blindsided. About a year ago, we had a fight about being together after we graduate undergrad (we are graduating this spring). I was ready to be long-distance, but he said that he didn't want to be with me after college. We talked later and he gave a really good reason for why he said that (it's a bit private, but I'm a skeptic so it was a really sound reason). We stayed together and for the past year he has been subtly alluding to our lives together once we graduate-- we'll visit each other, etc. It made me really happy and so when we finally had The Talk last week, I was floored when he said that he couldn't see himself with me in the long run.

It turns out that he's been lying to me our entire relationship. He said that he thought I was amazing when he asked me out, but he could tell that I'd had a rough life (I had a pretty tumultuous childhood and kind of toxic parents) and he said that at the time he thought that I was someone he could take care of. He said being with me gave him purpose and that real love meant that you just continuously gave to your partner. This whole time, he has been doing anything and everything to ensure my happiness to the extent that it eventually weighed him down because he felt responsible for my feelings. He said that this whole time he felt like a caretaker rather than a partner. He said he was scared to be in a relationship and to be vulnerable; and he thought that love was just giving but he eventually realized he was wrong. He realized a few months in to our relationship that he didn't want to keep up the pretenses, but he was scared to talk to me.  He also told me that at the time of our fight a year ago, he wasn't ready to break-up with me, even though he knew I wanted long-term commitment. He just wanted to be with me for a little while longer and it was much easier than any confrontation. I was always so serious about keeping open lines of communication because my parents divorced after about 25 years of being together. But it didn't work. So all the times he said he loved me, it turns out he didn't mean it. All the times he alluded to the future were lies, too. He knew how much I loved him, but he didn't tell me the truth early on to spare me this heartbreak I am feeling now.

When I found out I was stunned and I still am. For a bit of background, I have struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression for a long time (because of said childhood) and I threw myself into that relationship with everything I had. I wanted to be a part of something healthy and incredible and I think between the two of us, we ruined that. Reflecting, I can see unhealthy patterns in our relationship. We were co-dependent (last year, we essentially spent every spare minute of our time together), he was never vulnerable and always placed my needs/wants before his, and I focused too much on him because it made it easier to ignore my own issues I need to work through. But I was so serious. I thought I was working so hard and being a great girlfriend and crushing the relationship game.  Even after everything I've been through, I made the decision to put myself out there and trust him, because that's what you're supposed to do. True trust comes through vulnerability. But he lied, never told me how he was feeling, and basically controlled our entire relationship. I thought I had it good because we got along so well and literally never fought, but now I realize it was just because he never told me what he was thinking. I put my heart out there and now I feel lost and alone. Because I lost my best friend and the man I thought was going to be with me for the rest of my life.

So I guess I am looking for answers. I'm so hurt because he lied. We ended up talking seriously about why we split and I know that he is dealing with guilt and pain and shame, but that is it. Everyone makes mistakes and it sucks that I had to be his, but I really believe that he is the sweetest, gentlest boy out there. He struggles because he thinks that people don't like him, but he has no idea how much people like him. I told him I loved him, how amazing he was, but maybe it wasn't enough. He made me feel good, but treated me terribly, but I still love him because I gave him my heart. Is it wrong of me to still love him? Do I really even love him or is just a serious case of attachment? I know without a doubt that I care so much about him, because he treats people so well. I feel like an idiot because I look back on these last two years and I wonder if they were a waste. Every single thing was a lie; can I even count this relationship as real or worth it?  Nothing he did was out of malice, but every mistake he made, I have to suffer for and I am so angry, humiliated, hurt, and betrayed because of it. I feel like an idiot because I treated this like a real relationship; I put my heart on the line while he hid his feelings and played it safe. He lost a burden and maybe a friend. I lost my partner, my best friend (because even if he wasn't honest, I was always so vulnerable with him), and a future with him. It hurts so much because I love him, and at the time I believed I was in a healthy, committed relationship. Any advice would greatly help.

560,"A year back I started talking to this guy from my classes and we became friends. We would study and hang out a lot just the two of us and over time I developed feelings. Eventually one time after hanging out I asked him if it meant anything and he said that it shouldn't because the timing wasn't right (To be fair, I was going to be moving out of the city a few months later for school so it would have been hard to have anything real). I figured that was a rejection and we stopped seeing each other as much.

That happened around April last year and we've only talked about 3 times since then. At some point last month I decided to delete him as a contact since I figured we don't even live in the same city and he rejected me anyway so what am I even holding onto? I didn't delete our convo though. Idk why I just didn't feel ready I guess so I figured I would leave it for now and delete it later.

So then the actual question is, I got a call from an unknown number earlier this week which I rejected cause it was unknown and I'm not about to answer that. Yesterday for some reason I remembered this guy and how I deleted his contact, and on a hunch I checked that unknown call and it was his number. 

It's been almost a week already. He probably thinks I've cut him out. Is it worth it to message him now to ask what it was about?

Before anyone brings this up, I'm very aware that it probably wasn't a personal call, that it could have been a butt dial or he had some question about work or something. I'm just curious and I don't know what the best choice is.",17Jan2020,1
561,"So let me start with some happiness; I'm in love with creating things again! I ended up being forced to take a break from it earlier this year when my previous job sapped all my time and energy and pulled me away from art. Now I'm back to it and I feel so much better about it between that and therapy!

Anyways. The other day we had a coworker leave our ranks, and we really liked him so I decided to make this cute little portrait of him and it was very well received and we gave it to him as a farewell gift and stuff. It was an awesome feeling. Fast forward a few days to yesterday afternoon and the Office Manager (who's not my boss in pretty much any way. She's just in charge of keeping the office up- I'm a developer in the office) asked me what could she do to get something like that made for the finance team.

So my first thought was, oh, cool, I was just telling *my* manager how I wanted to find more artistic things to do while I learn to develop better and actually use my best and most honed talents around the job even if it wasn't particularly what I was brought on for, which she loved. I'm thinking this is my way to kinda get to making stuff for the office culture I love so much. 

But here's the catch. The coworker picture was a one-off thing. I never planned a series, a set, a procedure or anything. It was just for this one guy who was great. I'm totally not against making more things for the office, but there's a difference between ""I want to"" and ""I've been asked to"". Especially considering I just got off this really bad art burn. That's like jogging for fun after a double knee surgery, and someone comes up to you and says, ""hey wanna run this marathon with me?"". Like of course I do, but am I ready? Can I handle it? What about payment? Artistic freedom? Do I even bring this up with her, or just tell her I'm not interested?

566,"Today i decided i wanted to go to my local park and play some basketball, i'm a bit of a younger guy here and i started training playing it about 6 months ago i have a great passion for the sport but for the first time in 3 years i decided fuck it i will go by myself and play ball alone, i think a little bit of alone time would be cool since you don't have to wait for the other person to finish hooping so you can throw a few in and give it back, your court, your rules. So basically it's winter time right? Most basketball stadiums are covered in snow but it didn't snow enough so it's a very small layer, by some change. on my favorite court there was no snow all the way to the 3pt line, every other court was filled. I decided let's go there again because yesterday i went out with my two mates, i am like 3 thousand times better then them so much so that they stopped playing 1v2 with me cause it's boring, i love it. Now we just shoot, that's the reason i wanted to go out myself. As i am walking to the park i notice 4 teens my age most likely playing football. No bigge, the only problem is the only doors to the basketball court are located by the football court, so you have to pass the football court to get to the basketball court. They are playing on the front side right by the doors so when i enter i will pass them and they will see my presence. As i am walking towards the doors i get this nerve wracking feeling that drifts me to go past the doors, not going inside the park. I am a pretty shy person, but i am not the type that you can see visibly uncomfortable, even in the worst case scenarios i keep a straight faces unlike so many people i know. My heart goes to 170bpm but you can't see it by my stature. I can initiate conversations with strangers and easily reply even in a joking manner. If i were to be put 1v1 with a stranger i could talk as long as they don't show visible discomfort because that would be a clusterfuck. I have no problems like that, just this low tier shyness. Yet his baffled me, i made 2 circles around these buildings maybe 100m from the park and i decided to come back to see them there. I looked at 2 other parks in the region but both were covered in snow... i felt betrayed and dissapointed in myself. My friday already started with me bawling out for the first time in 2 months because i heard my cousin wouldn't come to ski with me this year at all and i haven't seen him since the start of 2019. I am not so religious but i believe we are put on this Earth as a test. The window of the 15-story flat i live in has a view of the front part of the football court. Somehow one trees leave didn't die they covered the view of the mates playing football. I don't believe it to be a coincedence because if i were one floor up i would see the court properly. Anyways what do you think do i have anxiety or was i just shy?",17Jan2020,1
567,"Hi, I'm a 14-year-old high school freshman in the US.

Recently I've acquired some insights from others that have led me to thinking about potentially pursuing an early graduation from high school and entering college or university early. I saw some inspiration elsewhere on Reddit about people who have done this at an early age, e.g. graduating university around age 17 or 18. I realize that I'm most likely too late already for something as early as that to occur, but I remain optimistic about other possible ventures.

I've realized that since I'm not challenged by any of my classes, I'm probably not in the right place academically. I'm taking AP classes for the most part whenever possible, but those are just *okay* to me. It's not that I already *know* the content taught — it's just that I learn it quickly whereas it's expected that others my age cannot and it gets dragged out for a while. AP classes are generally portrayed as difficult and thus not ideal for taking too many simultaneously, however I that all of the non-AP classes I have are genuinely frustrating to be in. Everyone is disruptive, the class is show, the content is shallow, etc. Besides that, the amount of time dedicated to practice is also frustrating in my opinion — you're supposed to be at school to learn, which isn't happening much for me. Quite a few students have also commented on my ""fancy"" vocabulary, which I consider normal.

I've spent maybe 10 minutes combined studying for tests throughout the entire school year so far — I don't need to study to do well on them. I currently have an A in all of my classes while not investing much effort in them. Most days I have no homework left to do at home, and it's practically never more than about 10 minutes on a very bad day. The work is sufficiently trivial that it, while I hear others talking about how it takes anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes. I'm not trying to disparage them by any means, since that appears to be normal — rather, I believe this further emphasizes how my placement is suboptimal.

The Reddit threads I've read from people with similar experiences also told me that I'll need studying skills for the future, since life comes with inevitable challenges. I believe this statement is worth commending despite my lack of experience. The issue is that I currently don't have any studying skills because I've never had a need for them, and it doesn't seem like I will at this rate.

I also have a hard time making friends at school — I'm not interested in games, sports, etc. Usually most people are your peers in school and thus it's easier to create friendships, but I lack peers that are at a level of maturity/intellect to be considered my ""peers"". I find myself mentally disapproving of all the ""childish"" things that happen at school, instead taking a more rational approach of looking at them. I believe this is hurting me overall as I'm only really able to make friends online where there are others with somewhat similar skillsets who are older.

I'm not exactly sure *how* early/fast I want things to go, but I just want to get ahead. I also have no idea how to execute this or bring it up to my counselors, parents, etc. Is it even possible/feasible, or should I hold back and ""deal with it""? I'd also like to transfer the one non-AP class I have to AP if possible since it's almost the end of the semester, but they seem to be at completely different topics at the moment and they're yearlong classes so I'm not so sure that's practical.

**TLDR: I find school too easy, even the AP classes, and want to get done with it faster so i can attend higher education earlier. I don't have peers at this level — there are comflicts in both intellect/knowledge and maturity.**

Please inform me if there's another sub better suited for this. Thanks in advance!",17Jan2020,1
568,"My boyfriend of 4 years and I lived in an apartment for two years and this past summer wanted to buy a house and set the groundwork to building a life. We plan to eventually get married and start a family, but not necessarily at this house (this is just a starter house that he hopes to maybe make some money on). 

I was in no financial position to buy a house so he did, as he makes over double my salary and has a good job. I’ve already put a lot of money into buying decorations and smaller items like paint and appliances. I also pay him almost half of the mortgage. 

He wants to redo the kitchen and asked that I start putting some money aside and we budget to pay for it together... but I’m kind of taken aback since it’s not my house and he is the one who would be making money off the house - I’m technically a renter. 

I do plan to marry him one day so should I just already consider “what’s his is mine” and help pay for it, or is he wrong for even asking me to without making that commitment?",17Jan2020,1

This all started after me (F15) and my ex boyfriend (16) broke up a couple weeks ago. I was pretty upset about it all but I’m all good now. This girl (let’s call her R) messaged me asking if I liked her boyfriend. This was completely out of the blue as me and this boy have been close friends longer than she’s ever known him, and I’ve never saw him in any other way. She told me that people were coming up to her and telling her that I keep talking about him, etc when that’s completely false. Then a day or so later i find out that one of R’s friends, let’s call her P, thinks that I ALSO like this boy she is involved with, as I posted a selfie with him on my private story( that he asked me to post). Again I’ve been friends with this guy for ages and don’t like him in that way whatsoever. I was pretty close to P so I decide to ask her about it, to try clear things up because I obviously don’t want things going around about me. She takes it the complete wrong way and tells all her friends, including R, that I was yelling at her, etc. She told me that basically everyone including the boys think I like them all, and that I was being a slut, etc. Then today a group of them came up to me and started arguing with me about it, saying I keep trying to get involved with peoples boyfriends and calling me a slag, etc, I stood my ground and told them it was all bullshit etc but they obviously didn’t care. I just don’t understand where this has all came from. I haven’t treated my guy friends any different from how I have treated them in the past, when I was with my ex, etc. My other friends think it’s people trying to jump on the bandwagon, as i keep hearing about how I like even more guys and I just don’t get it all, I’ve only recently came out of a long term relationship, and I’m happy being single right now, I’ve also only did stuff with 2 people in my life so I didn’t have a reputation before, and I don’t want one now.

I didnt know his past that well and didnt really know anything until a mutual friend found a website with a photo of him and the following information. I have re-named him Will for anonymity.

&gt; Will pleaded guilty to 20 charges of making and possessing almost 1,800 indecent images of children [over 4 years until 2013 when will was 21-25] including one extreme picture portraying intercourse or oral sex with a dead or live animal.

&gt;An officer posing as a parent [and Will] engaged in discussions about going to sexually abuse the 10 and six-year-old, ""children"" of the officer

&gt;Chat logs found on Will’s computer also showed he’d spoken to a 13-year-old girl about kissing and said it was a shame she didn’t live closer as they could’ve met.

&gt; At Court on Tuesday he admitted downloading the images and sharing them with other web users and, as some of them were of the highest level of indecency.

&gt;He was released on unconditional bail. 

I met him under two years later.

This information will destroy my small friendship circle. We are all close friends and I dont think everyone can move past this. Ome of us has recently moved abroad and that alone was a strain.

583,"Hi reddit.

I’m a 19 year old Lithuanian guy living in Northern Ireland. I just heard news of me being selected for conscription. 

I am really against violence, and see no point in war. Call me naive, but we’re not on earth to kill each other. I find that the dumbest way to go about things. On top of this, I can barely speak, read or write Lithuanian. I genuinely don’t think, even if I was forced to go, I would be of any help.

After reading up on it, LGBT rights in Lithuania are non existent, and only 24% of Lithuanians supported same-sex marriage and similar issues - whereas the Europe average was 61%. There are only 3 other countries which had a lower percentage across the entirety of the EU. These are statistics from 2015. I am gay. I’m not openly gay, but I am gay. 

I have spent the last 4 years trying to improve myself and overcome severe anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. I have finally conquered all of these. Anxiety doesn’t plague me, depression plagues me from time to time but nowhere near as badly, and I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. I have dealt with all of these issues by myself. No one - apart from my close friends - knows about any of this. Not my parents, not my doctor, I never had a psychologist - no one. There is no record of me having any of these issues. I even got denied housing support in the past because I wasn’t diagnosed with depression, even though I still had it. 

I have no record of anything. I am currently assistant manager at a retail store, and when I applied I did not state my sexuality as gay. My bank doesn’t know I’m gay. My parents don’t know I’m gay. On top of this, I am pretty much forced into a contract over the next year as assistant manager which I can’t really get out of, but I’m sure conscription will be able to drag me out. There’s no record of past mental illness, no record of suicidal tendencies. How would I be able to prove that these things still affect me? How can I prove that I can barely communicate with any Lithuanians? It’s so overwhelming.

I was considering university, but since I haven’t studied anything in 4 years (I finished my HS education and left) it would be very hard to find a university to accept me. Plus, this only delays it - so once university is completed I’d be forced to do another degree or have a different excuse. 

I don’t even know how to go about this. Things were just only starting to get good and I was feeling like myself for the first time since I was a child. What can I do to avoid this? There are fines if I avoid it, I don’t know how much they are but I don’t want to be forced to pay a tax just for being against violence and this entire situation. I have almost no relation to Lithuania apart from the fact I was born there and I hold a Lithuanian passport. I could care less about the country.",17Jan2020,1
584,"So, my partner of 6 years and I are having a tough time right now. She has diabetes, and her doctors have recommended she doesn't get pregnant until her sugar levels are normalized. She has been on birth control pills for a while, but was asked to stop taking them for 2 months about 1 month a go while she was getting bloodwork done to diagnose her type of diabetes.   


She started taking the pill again about a month ago, and yes, we've been having sex like we've always done. However, she is going nuts because her period has been late for about 3 days. We do want to have kids, but she is currently dealing with the pressure of diabetes, school, school debt, we are looking for a house to buy, and working on our trip to Europe to celebrate her getting graduated (has taken her a while due to a previous financial issue).   


We've had a pregnancy scare 4 years ago because we were stupid and weren't consistent with birth control. But right now she is scared and confused as hell because she has plans that could be affected if a baby comes, is a firm believer that a baby has to take priority over everything else, plus she is scared about it being high risk because of what doctors said. And I have to say that part of me not knowing how I should support her is because there are so many factors which are also making things confusing for me:   


1.- I don't know how I feel about her taking 5 years to finish a degree that was supposed to take 3 years to complete, and then have her consider not finishing anymore if she is indeed pregnant.   
2.- I don't know if this is due a combination of getting back to the pill after cutting it for 2 months, and is making her irregular.   
3.- I don't know what to say to her because she is going crazy over symptoms which can also be due to her diabetes and the strong medication she is taking.   


Some questions I think you might have:   


1.- She hasn't taken a pregnancy test because it's only been 3 days, and her mind's racing so she know she ma be exaggerating. I don't want to buy her one and give it to her, as it may be pushing her boundaries and see it as pressure or as me also being anxious.   


2.- We haven't used a condom because, well just because. We've never used them unless she wasn't on the pill, or she was taking antibiotics, and her diabetes medication does not interfere with the birth control pills.",17Jan2020,1
586,"I met someone on Grindr and went over to his place. We smoked a joint, but didn’t do anything sexual. It was immediately apparent (at least to me) that it wasn’t going anywhere, so we just chatted about music for a minute or two and then I bounced. That was months ago and since then through some sleuthing he has attempted to add me on every social media channel, sent me messages, emailed me, and this morning he called me at 4am. I haven’t responded to any of these attempts because I’m not interested in the dude and I was hoping he would get the hint, but seeing his name come up on my phone this morning creeped me out to the point where I’m a little scared. Am I being ridiculous, or are my feelings justified?

587,"A few hours ago today I started getting this episode and it lasted about 3 hours give or take

I have really bad concentration problems. I've missed many busses because I keep daydreaming while I'm waiting at the bus stop. Reading books is nearly impossible for me because I can't concentrate no matter what I do. 

It's usually manageable but for the 2nd time in my entire life for a few hours it felt like I was going insane. I kept getting stuck in my thoughts no matter what I did always repeating the same thoughts about going to the therapist as an emergency talking about the episode I'm having. It felt like I wasn't even awake and almost having a sleep paralysis while awake. When I had to start doing stuff I had a hard time as if I was drunk and I was using way more force than I had to for example accidentally slamming the car door shut really hard. 

At school I usually start dreaming the instant I have to listen without doing anything. I miss up so much stuff each class.

This is happening 24/7 but this is the 2nd time when it was insanely bad for a few hours.

I suspect it's ADD or ADHD but I only have the not being able to concentrate thing. I'm also 17 and it's less common in adults. I'm also male and ADD is more common in girls so either I'm just fucked or I'm 1 in a million or something.",17Jan2020,1

589,"I'm not sure where to start with this. I \[27M\] need to find a way to help my best friend (B) before he \[27M\] accidentally kills himself, or someone else. This is a lot - please bare with me. 

Just to preface this, B's father is a master manipulator, who has mentally tortured his family for years. He's emotionally abusive, physically abusive, and a severe alcoholic. However, when he's not intoxicated, he's a ""great"" father and husband. He is also the breadwinner, running his own business, while his wife cares for their youngest son \[14\]. When he's drunk and/or on a concoction of pills, he verbally berates his wife, physically engages her (I'm not sure the extent of this), and has choked my best friend close to death for intervening. His family fears him but loves him, however, it is **destroying** them.  

As a result of this, my best friend has also become a severe alcoholic, dabbling in pills to cope with anxiety and depression. His alcoholism is used as a coping mechanism, burying B's anger for his father, and the pain he has caused. About a year ago B was doing really well, he had his girlfriend who he loved dearly, he was in excellent shape, and though drinking and smoking quite a bit of weed, he had his life generally in order. 

About 8 months ago, B broke up with his girlfriend over a misunderstanding, which led to him feeling guilty, and her snooping through his FB messages, where she found some very private and admittedly troublesome things B had admitted to me about his personal life via message. I won't go into details, but I don't believe what she found is an accurate reflection of his character. However, her knowledge of this led her to a confrontation, where she called him names that haunt him to this day. They haven't spoken since. 

After this event, B moved closer to my home town to work for his father's business. Immediately this worsened his stressful state of mind. He began eating and drinking to cope with the pain, shame, and pressure he was feeling. Since then he has gained about 70 pounds and now cannot break a severe drinking habit. Recently his drinking landed him in a crisis center, which didn't help, and it has gotten so bad, multiple times in the last month he's woken up in a pool of his own vomit. He drives himself to the liquor store while intoxicated and becomes semi-suicidal while under the influence. 

I do not know how to help him, it's like watching a friend die... he used to be SO charismatic, charming, happy, healthy, and full of energy. I've watched his father drain him of all of these things. His guilt over his past relationship has caused B to emotionally isolate himself. He self-sabotages new relationships with unreasonable expectations and a compulsion to immediately over-share his feelings and personal issues. I can't watch him go on like this, and I fear that if I cant find a way to help him, I'm going to lose him one way or the other. Additionally, his drunk driving is a danger to others around him. He cannot control his own actions, which adds to the guilt he punishes himself for. 

B has helped me through everything, I've known him for almost 10 years, he's my best friend and confidant, we'd do anything for each other. The post feels awful to write, he's such a kind and caring person, but he's been broken by life, and I don't know how to help him recover. I want my best friend back. 

If you have any experience with a situation similar to mine or his, please offer your advice. I'll do my best to respond to any comments with more info that might be relevant. 

Thanks in advance.",17Jan2020,1
590,"Sorry if this isn't the right thread I haven't really posted on this site before. 

So I’m living with my ex which is a long story to begin with, but maybe explaining the situation can fill in the gaps as to why. I moved out of state to escape abusive family to one where cannabis is legal, and my roommates smoke up to a gram a day between them. Before I moved in they would hotbox the entire apartment, even when the cat was in the room (I’m sure it already has permanent motor issues because of this). I cannot afford rent anywhere else in town, I already have plans to move into a car they’re so cruel to be around. I need help before that happens, because they’ve more or less admitted that they have no issue kicking me out when I don’t have a place to go. I’m legally on the lease but if I stay here I know they will force me out, they did with the previous tenant. That tenant abused them (I can confirm witness to that) and had safe/free housing options so I didn’t question it. 

I’ve explained to them that the cannabis is causing harm to the cat and I don’t want to constantly be high against my consent. They close the door, hotbox their room, and then leave the door wide open and get it into the common area (with the cat) and it eventually gets to me in my room. I explained this to them multiple times and they still do it. One of them made the excuse “you knew I was a selfish asshole before you came here” but that is simply not true. They were reasonable and accommodating but something changed after I moved in and now I’m afraid of them. To sum up my ex admitted to treating me terribly because I broke up with them for not respecting me. 

I want to go to management about this but smoking cannabis is a terminable offense and I’d be sleeping in an uninsulated car and its below freezing outside (meanwhile they have other housing options). If I tell them I’ll go to management I fear they’ll start breaking my possessions. The other ways they’ve treated me has me suicidal. I’d have to choose between a lawyer and a future car to live in. I'm juggling this and college and it's overwhelming. 

I’ve tried using supportive language and they did nothing, I’ve tried being blunt and things got worse. Talking to them is literally impossible but I need something to change so I'm not afraid to sleep at night. I’m also scared for the safety of the cat after I move out. Am I obligated to contact proper authorities if the cat’s safety is at risk when I'm not around? The last thing I want to do is separate a cat from an owner it loves very much, but that owner is hurting it.",17Jan2020,1
591,M17 here so I met this girl 6 months ago and ok she was pretty and all but I fell in love with her personality but she had a boyfriend so I was like  I have to get over her. I did when she broke up after some time I don't know how much we started texting and I got attached again but she would always avoid to go out with me so after realizing the situation I did what I think was the best thing I found her and told her straight up that I like her but because I know she is not over her ex we should stop talking as I view her differently and not being able to have her consumes me in a bad way and she agreed before leaving I told her if she wants help with anything just to tell me. Over the next days and weeks she would call me to check on me or text me with a shitty excuse. Anyways months pass and I have been with other girls and shit but still have her in the back on my mind and a friend of mine met her by accident and the conversation brought me up and she admitted to him that she likes me and he told me. I texted her straight away and told her we should go out to discuss some things she agreed. We went out 2 times together nothing happened the first time because something happened which I'm bored to write about and the second time we had some moments but I chickened out and I don't know why I'm a pretty attractive guy or so I'm told and I have no problem with girls I am successful all the time and never chicken out but with her it's different I don't know.

593,"I don’t know what to do. I’m 16 and i’ve never had a job. I like kids and I usually play with them and keep them busy at neighbourhood get togethers because I like it. My neighbour owns a gymnastics club. Last summer every time we saw each other she would ask me if I wanted to work there because I am good with kids and she wanted me to be a coach for the 3 year olds and help at parties and camps. Me not having any gymnastics background except for when i was little said no every time. At the end of summer she asked me and my other neighbour to shadow some other coaches for a summer camp to see how we like it and I said why not. I hated it because I’m very shy and have trouble breaking out of my shell and I was very uncomfortable. The last day I went I cried when I got home and agreed that my personality and lack of gymnastics wasn’t suited for it and that’s what I told her. She told me she thought I would be amazing and should try shadowing during the fall session. I again thought why not (worst decision i’ve ever made) I really enjoyed helping with the littler kids like my neighbour said i would but I have no control over them. Then in november they asked me if I wanted to do the coach training course which was $300 dollars everyone said I would do it because it was in town and it has never been in town and I would be dumb if i didn’t (not exactly their words) so me being too much of a pushover agreed and thought i would be more comfortable if i did it. It was the biggest mistake i’ve ever made. It was a course for coaches of kids 6+ which isn’t even what my neighbour asked me if I could do.  There was a lot of gymnastics things in there (obviously) so I embarrassed myself not knowing how to do anything. I passed anyways but now I’m in all the group chats but realized I really don’t want to do this but i’ve already invested money. I’m now helping with the winter session and i’m supposed to take on my own class in a couple weeks. Ive takin a shift for a friend of 2hours but I didn’t get paid. Some people who just joined are already being paid but since I don’t know what i’m doing its taking me more time to train and so after 6 months of time i’m still not getting paid. Ive been promised to have a job after the winter session but I don’t think I want it. I’ve been shadowing for several months and i’m trained but I don’t feel comptable at all in this job. I know it’s a better job then working in retail but I feel so out of place. I cant control a group, I don’t know much about gymnastics and I’m trained but not for the kids i’m supposed to take on. If i quit, I embarrass myself, possibly ruin my relationship with my neighbour and waste $300 dollars and all the months of training. I really hate going there and feel sooo uncomfortable and out of place I cry every time I have a shift. I’ve also heard the coaches bad mouthing some of the other new coaches and they probably do it to me too. I cant believe I got myself into it I should’ve trusted my intuition from the beginning back in summer. I just feel like it’s too late to go back now and I just need to stick to it for a couple more months-a year. Please help",17Jan2020,1

597,"One of my best friends that I’ve known for years has recently been doing weed. He’s  only 14 and I’m worried it’s going to spiral out of control. 

We’re both 14 but a while ago he started (jokingly) smoking paper and grass cigarettes. This quickly turned into vaping and has now evolved into edibles. Soon I think he’ll turn to smoking weed, and possibly more hardcore drugs. He’s smart for his age but I’m worried his future is going down the drain. As far as I know his home life is normal and he has lots of friends. I’m worried it’s because of these people he’s been hanging around with. They’re his age, slightly younger, and go to our school. They do however obtain drugs like this, and my friend ‘apparently’ knows someone who deals in class A drugs. 

What can I do to stop this? He’s only been doing edibles for about a week, but I want it to stop before it gets more serious. I don’t want to involve police or his mother (she’s unbelievably strict (kind but fair sorta thing)). Any help will go a long way. Thank you in advance.",17Jan2020,1

603,"I'm 23 yo (yeah, i married too early, it was because we need to move to a big city to get better jobs and life), i'm married for 7 months by now, and yesterday i had the first seriously fight over my wife.

This is what happened: we had dated for 1 year and a couple of months before we got married, in the begging's of 2019 i met a girl on discord, in a server of brawl stars (a game that i didn't play too much), but she was a moderator there, and we started talk and eventually we got friends, in the same day we met we started a private server, that only me and her was the members, we did this 'cause once in a while someone entered the room, to ask her help out. We matched in a lot of stuff's, same gender of music, games, movies, etc, we even were the same religion, but for me, for the second a ""met"" her, was only a virtual friendship, and stayed like that until we never talked again. The thing is, this girl told me that for her entire live she struggled with a diseases that altered her all immunity system, leading her to have overweight during the entire adolescence. Gathering all the things we became very close in this virtual relationship, resulting in very suspicious nicknames (now i have to explain this, 'cause you may noticed, but i'm no native american, actually i'm brazilian, and this is important over the nicknames, we used others one that can relate with the follow one's next), such as: ""honey""; ""dear""; ""sweetheart"". Inside my head i had a normal relationship with her, as friends. But she was single for a while, and i get it, women has a perspective of the world that is different  than us, so probably she started to create an affection. We used to talk a lot, 99% of the time in the discord, in calls or text. And i kept this server, we never leave, me and her, even we didn't catch up anymore. And yesterday my wife saw the server. We argued. A lot. I was studying in my pc when suddenly she was quiet in the bedroom, so i asked her what happened, and she told me: ""You'll see in a moment"". Right a way i went to see it, and there it was my cell with the conversations in the server. The worst thing was that the last message, a song, that it is christian, but judge by yourself the quote i wrote there:

""I can not see

I don't know where you are

I feel lonely

And I start waiting for the worst""

My first reaction, as always, i left the room and got back to the pc (i don't like to argue when me or the other person is out of ourselves). When i was going to bed, she started arguing, she cried, yelled at me. I tried to explain that nothing except friendship was there. Even even though we never met each other, and that i never wanted to. Later on, passed 1:30 am, i admitted that i kind knew that she didn't see that as only a friendship, that she developed a certain affection, and that she was right to be mad at me, but i don't consider that i was unfaithful, i never said that liked her, and didn't felt this way as well.

In my perspective she is right to be mad about the way i used to call and treat her, that passed a way the friendship zone. But again, i didn't feel anything for her, because i love my wife, and i wouldn't never cheat on her. I'm a distant person with regard to show affection in public, it's have been my defense since i can remember, to protect myself to be sad about other girls, when i was a teenager and no girl noticed me. That went through even when i was dating and now, that i'm older and got married. I never cheated in my previously relationships, but at the same time i was never the best boyfriend and partner to show affection, i do it, but in my on way, it doesn't mean that i don't love my wife, i do, a lot, but it's the way i am. But i want to change this for her, she tries to hard to be a perfect spouse to not expect this affectionate side of me, but at the same time she feels like i'm starting to not love her the way i used to. She's young as well, just turned 20 in the begging of the year. Can you suggest something to me to do? thanks for reading.

604,"I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now but what he has done about a minute ago pushed me to find some help.
Before I tell you what he has most recently done, I just want to say a few thing he has done throughout our lives. He has made my childhood miserable by constantly insulting and teasing me. I am 15 now and I feel like what he has done to me back then really affected me mentally. He is 17 years old today and he hasn’t changed. He’s doing what he did to me back then except to my baby brother but worse. He became more “mature” and is constantly defying what my parents (or mother) tell him. He constantly gets scolded but he just never backs down he just fights back. There has been times where he does back down, but he leaves insult messages on messenger. (Happened to my uncle twice, my mom now)
He is also very, very narcissistic and prideful. I suspect due to him joining a lot of pageants and winning.
Today he gave a bottle of expensive cologne we got all the way from Europe to one of his friends he wasn’t really close with. Mom got very angry and told him in a high tone of voice to get it back from them. We were recording his drumming for my school music project at that time and he got irritated. He yelled back at mom and things escalated. He then proceeded to throw his drumsticks in the floor, started yelling and in the end, he backed down. A few minutes later he sent a message to mom saying that (translated from Tagalog)we should all just drink cyanide to fix your cologne problem. This made mom go into his room and get a little physical. A few hits and a lot of very loud yelling. Later she sat on the bed, phoned dad and told everything while crying. This made me and my little brother really just concerned for her. This isn’t the first time they fought. We fought a few times. And all those time he was the one who escalated the fights. I think he likes it. I also noticed that he never had anything like this with his friends. He has a lot of friends. He constantly invites them to hang out in various places. I almost guarantee he likes them more than his family. Not only do I need serious help for this, but also for my family. Please help",17Jan2020,1
605," Hello Redditors, today i am home alone and I haven’t masturbated for 2 days and im a 20 year old virgin, for weeks if not months I was thinking of just “fuck it lets try it with an escort” , I have been checking various websites and found some girls that I would like to try, however even if today more than ever im very tempted to do it I still have some few doubts, im mostly scared from the HIV point of view and if I wont regret this in the future as my first experience even if an other part of me says I wont because usually the first time having sex for men is shitty so why not try it with a professional ? Plus I wonder if this would boost my confidence with women to flirt (I haven’t got problems talking but I got problems to flirting and basically being confident with women).

Also I want to clarify in my home country prostitution is illegal! (im from Italy) But ofc on the internet there are plenty of escort websites. Today I also called 2 hot latina girls one of them had many positive reviews but during the phone called and told me to be “quick” and started to be a bit rude, the other one was less expensive and closer to my location but she sounded more kinder even if she also said “im sorry I haven’t a lot of time to talk” the problem with her is she literally has 1 review from today (most likely a new girl on that website which is among the most common escort websites and I didn’t see her profile yesterday). I officially didn’t set up an appointment but remained a bit vague.

What should I do? And got any tips regarding escorts ? should I try it ? should I instead go downtown tonight and find a bar and try to pick up girls ? (most likely I will fail and I cant stay up all night since im Housesitting), are massage parlors maybe better for the first experience ?

606,"I live in a really, really small town. There's a gas station I go to a couple times a week and for the past few months, the same guy is always working. I've never had any problems with him aside from the general unease that comes with feeling like he's staring holes in me. Last night was different. I got gas and went to the register to pay, and the dude points his phone straight at me and gets this weird smile on his face. I'm almost completely positive he was recording me or on facetime with someone and showing me. The only doubt I have is that I couldn't see the screen of his phone, other than that it was blatantly obvious.

 The guy is usually talking on his phone in another language so him already having his phone in his hand when I got there wasn't that unusual. I feel really uncomfortable about it and being the paranoid person I have I'm playing through all the scenarios in my head where some sex traffickers try to kidnap me. Again, I have absolutely no evidence that this incident is in any way related to sex trafficking, I'm just paranoid. I tried calling the store this morning to get in touch with the owner. I'm not sure if the dude who answered  was the same guy who recorded me, but I just asked for the owners phone number or when they would be in the store. He said he doesn't know when they'll be in but he would call the owner and see if it was okay to give me their number. So I have to wait a bit and call again. I just don't want this to happen to anyone else. It's no so much the fact that I was recorded that bothers me, but what the reasons for it were. None of the reasons that I can think of would excuse the fact that he did it, and without asking. Use your imagination on what they could be. I would have said no if he had asked if it was okay. 

Unfortunately I didn't call him out on it when it happened. I wasn't feeling well at all and once I saw what he was doing I was sort of shocked and just sorta clammed up. I did try to hide my face with my hair, because at this point I was waiting for my card to approve. Once it did I got the hell out of there. What should I do about this? I'm really not trying to be a cunt, but I don't want someone else to have this problem. It made me really uncomfortable and it's not okay to record someone like that.",17Jan2020,1
608,"I'll make this short!

Recently, I've been hearing occasional noises in my attic other than the usual creaks and bumps that happen due to wood expanding etc. It sounds as if someone is dropping a heavy marble. It bounces a few times, and stops. This happens maybe 2-3 times a day/night at random times. 

The last time we had an attic inspection was nearly 10 years ago, when we bought the house. At that time, the inspector said that ""there is evidence that an animal has been in here, but nothing to worry about."" And we didn't do anything about it since we weren't told to. 

I'm just super paranoid about what might be going on there. I've watched one too many videos of people living secretly in attics and I want to address the issue immediately, if there even is an issue.

Anyway, our conversations are always normal topics and for some reason lately he always starts talking about how beautiful some woman is that he knows, or that he’s hooked up with before, or that some girl has a crush on him.  Sometimes he will even send me a picture of them.  

I don’t care, but honestly I’m not a guy so I’m not interested in hearing how hot some girl is that I don’t even know, and I never know what to say back to him.  For some reason the more he does this, the more I start feeling ugly myself and I don’t know why since there’s no romantic feelings there.  What is the point of this?  I guess I’m just not enjoying our friendship anymore because we use to talk about our mutual interests, so now our conversations sort of just stop because I don’t know what he wants me to say in regards to women.  I’m fine with giving relationship advice, but that’s not what he’s asking for.  

I’m sort of bummed because I feel like our friendship has basically changed into him just having someone to brag to, and there’s no longer anything I’m gaining from this friendship and keeping in touch.

I’m on mobile so forgive me for any formatting issues. I live in a house with 4 other girls in college, we had fun and I liked them all, until one of them decided to go behind all of our backs and sign our lease for 4 new people for next year.

My other roommates are awesome and we’re all solid together, it’s just the one that completely flipped on us.

pros:

\-can work at my own pace and schedule

\-can take breaks whenever

\-can work in quiet with no distractions

\-more free time for traveling

\-can work anywhere because it's online

\-no constant shaking/sweating for 8 hrs

cons:

\-won't get 10th grade high school experience

\-might regret it when I'm older 

\-won't have that many friends

\-anxiety might get worse

A little backstory I guess: So I have a sliiiight problem with digestion (nothing diagnosed, but I know it isn't normal be farting all day because of one meal), and it causes me to fart excessively. It's really embarrassing for multiple reasons, but the main reason is because they stink. No one wants to be around the girl who stinks all the time. Especially not in lectures and classes. 

What do I do if I excessively fart and I'm stuck in class? 
I can't get up all the time because I fart like every 3 minutes. That'll be distracting I think.

Here are things I tried:

- Sitting near the door
- Changing my diet (didn't work too well since my stomach is pretty sensitive, and even things that I'm normally okay with upsets it)
-Getting out my big farts before class (not always reliable but sometimes works)
-Holding them in (works a bit. But it's really uncomfortable and sometimes if I sneeze it may all come out as one big noisy fart)

624,"I spent years doing cold approach. I found there was no major benefit because 95% (19/20) girls I would try to talk to wouldn't even talk back. Uncomfortable facial expressions. One word answers. ""I have a boyfriend.""

But if the wingman was not tall/handsome or white, I'd be back to square one. This was when I was using routines so my approach and body language was identical every time. It just worked completely different based on only that.

My experience was the threshold was around 5'9"", white, and 6-7/10. If I had a wingman like that or above, virtually every set would open well. If I had a wingman who fell below those cutoffs or I was alone I was back to at most 5% that would talk to me.

626,"""In a tizzy"" best describes my current mental state regarding what I'm about to pose. I'm changing a lot of details and leaving some similar at random because privacy. This is a doozy and I'm still flabbergasted. 

In essence, I work at the executive level at a major non-profit in my country. This non-profit has a high level of national attention and works with government and other major stakeholders very consistently. So relationships and reputations are important. 

Despite being an exec staffer, I'm a Junior staffer. Young but with a good amount of experience and years under my belt. Last year, there was drama surrounding the firing of a senior employee who was very manipulative. The woman has been my direct report for a few years before they were promoted out, and I can verify that she was a bad faith actor on many occasions. When she got promoted and our VP became aware of her tactics, she was told to fix her shit. She didn't, after multiple talks, and eventually was fired. 

Important context. Her husband and her divorced around this time as well. Shortly thereafter her husband tried to chat me up on a dating app/fb, but I always made a point to completely ignore and avoid contact, as I genuinely fear flying anywhere near my former boss's circle. She's already got a decent job somewhere else and I think that she will accrue power once more and still pose a threat. So despite my abhorrence of her, I play nice and neutral, friendly at any and all occasion of encountering her. 

Last week I was out for happy hour with some friends and colleagues when one colleague (not really a close friend, but we know each other well and spend time with a lot of the same people) came up to me and said, almost giddily:

""So is it true? Did you really fuck ""ex-boss""'s ex husband? I heard that was part of why she left!""

I literally didn't absorb what the fuck she was saying, so I asked her to repeat. Sure enough, she asked again. I'm stunned but eventually recover and say ""No! Why the hell would you think that? Where did you hear that?""

To my friends who were around me's credit, they began to laugh and say how ludicrous that claim was. But I'm not laughing. I've made a point to play nice and stay away because of who I know ex boss to be. The most talking I've ever had with her ex-husband was the exchanging of pleasantries at work events where they both attended. Never even had a private conversation. So I'm fucking stunned. 

When the colleague gauges my and my friends' reaction, she begins to backpedal. ""It's just what I heard, I don't know, I was wearing headphones,"" and in general stuttering over her words.""

But I'm now so shocked I'm in heat-seeking missile mode. I ask where she heard this, who was saying this, pretty much anything I can think of to determine where the dick this came from and what it's scope is. She clams up and reiterates her claim that she's not sure what she heard, it's probably nothing, to which I get upset and say ""For you to even think or assume something like that you had to have heard SOMETHING decently enough from someone."" 

She's obviously visibly shaken and starts to say she doesn't believe it now, etc. But I still feel I need to know. So I say ""Listen, you know where we work and how important it is to be viewed as a good faith actor. Whatever you heard is blatantly false and potentially damaging to me, and your refusal to give me the insight I need to address this and get to the bottom of this is absolutely an indicator of your person.""

Might have been too intense but I was still in a state of shock and panic. And I think it was righteous. But my tone and intensity may have scared her, and she stood there stuttering and said ""It's nothing, I'm not even sure I heard that, blah blah blah."" 

I realize I'm about to escalate so I cooly say ""come to me when you're ready to help me here"" and leave it at that, turn to my friends who are also dumbfounded. I'm angry and also scared because I genuinely have no clue how this can even be a thing that is allegedly ""out there."" There's nothing even relatively close to that that happened, that could have been misinterpreted as what she heard. 

So now I don't know what to do. I don't know the scope of this rumor, where it's coming from, nor the full extent of what is claimed. And as I said working relationships being imoportant I fear that this could be spread and actually have an impact on me professionally. 

So I feel like I'm walking a razor's edge. Do I report to HR? Do I let it go and hope that it's not actually a thing? Do I try to find a source? I'm calm enough now that I can do it diplomatically and try to get the girl to understand where I'm coming from, and that I'm not going to drag her in to this as the alleged messenger. Further I do believe that the people I have already worked with know my ethic enough to know that this is false if it ever got to them, but others may not know better and may perpetuate the rumor. 

This truly came out of absolutely nowhere and has no basis of truth. Not even the slightest. You're just going to have to trust me on that fact. I'm still wondering what the fuck happened here.",17Jan2020,1

So first few sessions with him we dealt with my personal stuff. Big improvement. Then we had a session where I'd talk about this nihilism and phislohpical issues. He's been a therapist for decades and is well versed on philosophy.

Now I don’t disagree with the idea of firing someone over that. The thing here though is that the precedent has been set that they don’t fire people. I very rarely show up late, compared to someone else on my team who shows up 30 minutes to an hour late 3+ times a week. There was someone else on my team that just didn’t do work. He’d play Pokémon on his phone all day, nap, etc. those two still work there at the moment.

The real reason he fired me is because they asked for feedback and I spoke honestly. Fuck me right?

637,"I've spoken to a few people about this but I still would like one or two more perspectives. 

I am nearing the end of my degree. I have 9 elective courses left to take, 5 of which I am signed up for this semester. However, I don't know if it's lack of motivation or feelings I'm trying to push down but I really feel like taking the semester off and starting fresh in the Fall or even back in Spring/Summer. 

I know it sounds silly that I'm so close to graduating and of all times, it's now that I feel like this is not worth it anymore. I guess it comes back to it being my fault because I applied and I decided to give university a shot. The degree itself will not offer me a higher pay or any sort of other benefits other than a stamp on my forehead that I made it through university.

 I also realize taking a semester off is normal and not that big of a deal as long as you're committed to go back and finish up. 

The thing that is stopping me is my family's expectations. I have spoken to 2 family members about it who I really trust and while one was understanding, one just made me feel like shit for even thinking of taking time off. In a nutshell, if I go through with this decision, I will be seen as a 'failure'. 

Don't get me wrong, I have thought this through and I know the first thing someone might think is 'she is just being lazy'. But I have a secured job that I can work during the time I'm off. I just feel in the past two weeks.. I zoned out in classes. I don't keep focus. Maybe for the first 10 minutes but then I can't listen. I try to take notes but end up scribbling. I try to do the readings but it takes me hours to get through a page or two because I don't care enough to do it. 

And worst of all, I've seen a change in myself and my habits. I sleep too much or not at all. I eat too much or not at all. I'm constantly crying when I'm alone. I could stare at a wall for hours and not feel a thing. I try my best to not let it show but it's becoming hard to fake a smile and look lively. 

I don't want to let myself down or my family but I fear that if I continue this semester, either my grades will suffer or I'm going to fuck myself over. And I rather take time off and avoid that from happening. But explaining that to people who have NEVER seen me at a low point, I don't know if I'll be able to go through it.

642,"Hello,  
I have a student loan, and i am wondering if their is any advice to work towards a forgiveness. I feel forgiveness is off the table so general advice/Info would be appreciated.

  
Some info:  
\-I've had this Loan for about 4 years now.   
\-Started at $5,500.   
\-I have never had a late/missed payment.  
\-I also do not fully understand the interest for Student Loans   
\-Not exact Numbers: Iv been paying for 50+ Months at around $57 a month, $2850 - $5,500 = $2,650 but my Loan Amount is still ""$3,513.57"".   
\-I emailed Navient (the people i am paying the loan back to) about a forgiveness with mostly the same info below, but i believe i already know the answer is going to be ""Touch luck"". + Also asked about interest, but last time i called they did not help much to explain and instead insisted i should pay right then.

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a sob story of mine. I know this is generally my fault, and has no merit in terms of forgiveness. Specially 4 years later but if i may vent/tell a story about WHY i have this loan.

Basically i applied for my second year of college and attended ONLY 1-3 classes (It was one class on different days, rest of them started later in the week) After i realized i would not be able to keep going this semester i called the schools office and told them i would not be able to attend anymore (this year i had to commute without a car - would of been at the college from 7am to 9pm most days while also trying to work) i asked the lady at the office if i their was anything i could do / had to do with my loan, figured since it was the very first week of the semester that something could be done. I was told nothing could be done and i would need to pay that back. Well i was bum'd out, i did not think much of it after that. A few weeks later i learned if i called/went to a different office in the college (they were no more then 100 feet away from one another, that in fact i could have had my Loans nulled (not only that even if i missed the first dead line they still would of cut the loan by 75%, then after that 50%, 25%, then eventually tough luck)",17Jan2020,1
643,"I am 15M and a freshman in highschool. I have a writing disability called disgraphia. Basically, I write slower than most, sloppier than most, and I make small mistakes subconsciously even though I know the correct form. I use a macbook air for most of my classes but my spanish teacher gave us the entire trimester's work at the beginning and it's almost all short sentences and one word answers so I'm fine with that however, we have an assignment do every friday where we have to write 4 repetitions of each word in spanish and four in english. As you could guess, this is essentially hell when paired with the fact that if you dont do it, then you sit outside of the classroom (I'm 1st period so it's cold af) while everyone else is studying for the quiz that is the same day. So I asked my teacher if I could just type it or at least forfeit my grade and just not turn it in for no credit. But he said that if I typed it, I could just copy paste it and made me sit outside the class doing repetitive writing which is so against me 504 plan. So I sent him an email about it and he was just being the most condescending prick and he kept saying that since I always finished my regular work quickly (I wanted it over with and not even I could read it afterwards) and I wasn't using my computer in his class that I must not actually have a writing disability and QUOTED MY OWN WORDS FROM FROM MY EMAIL IN HIS OWN AND QUOTED THE PAGE I SENT EXPLAINING WHAT DYSGRAPHIA IS! Does anyone have any advice for what I should do about this? I want him to learn not to take people who have disabilities that aren't visible easily for granted.",17Jan2020,1
644,"**Preamble**

I live in a new neighborhood in my city where houses are stacked closely together. We also happen to get a shit ton of snow every winter. 

We have lived here for 3 years now, so have they. At first we thought they were just shy, but as time went on it became almost rude. We could be 5 feet away and they refuse to acknowledge us. In fact the only time the female has said anything to either my wife or I is when she swore at me because my contractor stepped on her mulch. Her husband seems a bit more normal and occasionally will wave, if we wave first. 

We are friends with several couples that live around us and occasionally meet up for drinks. They all joke about getting the serial killer vibe from them due to their very odd behaviour. 

The very odd behaviour that everyone is referring to is that every single day the female will sweep her driveway twice. Once before 5am, and again in the early afternoon. This is just to remove dust from an already spotless driveway. If there are leaves blowing or snow falling, she will be out there every 15 minutes with her leaf blower. She treats her backyard the same. She mows, then leaf blows, then uses scissors to trim any pieces that bother her, then leaf blows again. This happens at least once per day, sometimes twice. 

This definitely seems like obsessive compulsive to me. 

Since we’ve been here, a few things have bothered me;

* when my contractor was moving lumber between the houses she stood on her driveway staring at us and mumbling “stay the fuck off my side”.

She never said it directly to me or even loud enough to hear. I just happen to have a security camera that has a really good microphone and picked that up. 

* she leaf blows and snow all leaves from her property directly onto mine. 

I thought it was just weird how my yard seemed to have so much more leaves. Then after checking my camera, sure enough she was blowing it all directly onto my property when she thought we weren’t looking. 

* she reported our truck abandoned when it was parked in front of our driveway. 

We went to Europe with some family for a month. My brother in law took care of our house and was using our truck during that time. He parked it mostly in front of our driveway with maybe a few feet in front of the shared lawn area. Bylaw was there one day writing a warning for an abandoned vehicle. I have a friend who works for the city so she told me who registered the complaint and it was my female neighbor. 

**Problem**

We have a narrow strip that runs between our houses. Our side is roughly 4 feet wide. This runs parallel with theirs, but near the driveway theirs  is about 8 feet because this is their front lawn. My lawn is on the other side of the driveway. 

Last year we noticed that they put all of their snow directly on the property line. This means that I now have only half of my property to put snow because their pile is half on each side with an unused 6 feet on their side. With amount of snow we get here, it doesn’t take long before that pile builds big enough that as they pile it on top it just rolls down the pile onto our driveway. 

A couple of days ago we had a huge dump of snow and we spent a good amount of time shoveling. I went to work and my wife came home and found a massive pile of snow taking up about 4 feet of our driveway. She threw it all back over the pile and onto the 6 feet of space where they aren’t piling snow for some reason. 

Yesterday we went out and once again the snow is piled up to almost the door of my truck. So we pushed it back onto their side of the pile. 

To make matters worse, they are also piling the snow from their patio onto the side of our house. I mean it is piled up about a foot above the bottom of the siding and completely covering the exposed part of the foundation. 

**Question**

What can we do? 

What would you do? 

We tried to talk to them, but they go inside the second we come outside. When we ring the doorbell they don’t answer. They are outside doing this at 4am and when I try to catch them, they stop mid job and go back inside. 

It’s weird. 

I get that they don’t like us for whatever reason they chose. We don’t like them either, really we don’t care about them. We just want this pettiness to end and for them to start respecting our property the way everyone should.",17Jan2020,1
645,"A little bit of background information: 

I’ve only worked there for about 4 months, and was planning on quitting soon anyways, because it was always more of a temporary job until I could find something better. 

In those 4 months I have had to call out multiple times due to a lot of being sick and other random emergencies. I am currently sick and called out the last few days and have a doctor’s note to corroborate that. 

However, yesterday I was trying to go to work and ended up having a massive panic attack and depressive episode (due to unrelated events), which led me to no call no show. I’m supposed to work today and haven’t heard from any of my managers or coworkers. 

Should I try contacting my manager? Should I even bother trying to save this job? (Due to my calling out my manager only scheduled me to work 3 days next week.) If I do lose this job I’m going to be extremely tight on money until I get another one. 

Any and all advice welcome, I just don’t know what to do here. 

TLDR: Worked at this job for 4 months, have had to call out more than normal due to illness. Accidentally no call no showed yesterday due to mental illness after being sick for days before. Haven’t heard from anyone at my job. What do I do now?",17Jan2020,1
646,"I (30F) met my boyfriend (39M) through an online gaming platform about two months ago; I had just broken up with my long time boyfriend of 5 years so I was NOT looking to start a new relationship, but when he and I got to talking it was an instant connection. He really pursued me at first, and we seemed to have a ton in common. Finally after a week or two of talking I agreed to be exclusive with him even though at the time I honestly just wanted to take a break from men and maybe date around a little after a while...not get into another serious relationship right away. But he seemed so great that I thought it was worth a shot.

The first couple of weeks was constant texting all day, video chats, phone calls, etc. After about a month, however, things REALLY slowed down on his end. He has a demanding job and a kid from a previous relationship, so I get that he is busy. I also get that it's natural for things to slow down after the initial excitement has passed. I don't need or want constant texts and attention, and consider myself to be pretty chill when it comes to giving him his space and not being demanding for attention. But there will be a whole day that goes by where he doesn't text me at all....or I can see that he has seen my text but then 6-8 hours pass without a response. He always seems to have a reason why he didn't contact me, but it's getting old. We have plans to meet up next month for the first time.

He was the one who wanted to be exclusive and I'm now kicking myself because I feel like I'm committed to someone who doesn't seem to be that interested anymore. I really like him a lot so on one hand, I want to give this a chance and see where it goes, but on the other hand, this doesn't even feel like a real relationship anymore, and I fear I may be wasting my time. I would like to say something to him about it but I don't want to come across as clingy; that's not who I am and it's not my style...I'm just not feeling like much of a priority.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and any advice you have, thanks.

PS Also want to add that I'm not sitting around anxiously awaiting communication from him. I have my own life and things I'm passionate about; I'm secure in who I am and I don't need his validation. This is just something that has been bothering me. Thanks! :)",17Jan2020,1

648,"I just need to know if these are thoughts everyone has or it's just me.

For the past year I've noticed that I'm so scared of dying. It's gotten to the point were I feel like me growing up is just a countdown to my death and it scares the hell out of me. I'm literally only 20 years old and I'm terrified of dying.

Do you know when you like a girl and have butterflies in your stomach when you talk to her. I get the same feeling when thinking about death but it's a dreadful version of that feeling. I don't know how to word it but if I was claustrophobia I bet it would feel the same as what I feel when I have these thoughts

I'm not afraid to leave my house or anything. I live my life normally and I'm chasing my goal to be a photographer so it's not like the fear has taken over my life. But the fear is still there and I want to get it away from me. I want to talk to friends about it but I feel like somethings are just to deep to get in.

I'm not an emotional person, I think the last time I cried was over 2 years ago. Things usually dont get to me, the only thing that has ever come close to making me cry is when I think about dying. Trying to imagine how it would be feel not be alive makes me feel scared.

649,"Hi everyone,

I am currently seeing a therapist and have spoken with her about these issues, but I also just wanted to post here to find some other people who may have experienced something similar.

I grew up with strict religious parents. In my teenage years my mom used my anixety to manipulate me regarding a lot of medical/sexual decisions. For example, she daily told me about all the people she knew growing up who got pregnant by accident, and when I told her I wanted to get my HPV vaccine she told me it would make me have daily panic attacks for the rest of my life. 

I moved out last year and have felt a lot more confident and happy mentally. I still struggle with mental illness, but my anxiety isn't brought up daily anymore. I am in a long term relationship and have so much support from my boyfriend and his family.

Since leaving, I do not see my family as much anymore. Barely at all. I text them and stuff, but it's all mostly meaningless converstaions. My mom insists she wants me to live my own life and doesn't want to pry into my deciisons, but the damage has already been done. I find it hard to make decisions without thinking how my mom really feels and how she is talking about me to her religious friends and my dad. I feel guilty as I progress in my life by moving in with my boyfriend, and not wanting to get married in the catholic church. 

My dad has taken this particularly hard. I did not spend a lot of time with them over the holidays because there is usually a lot of fighting and judging between my mom and her family. She doesn't like my dads side at all, so my dad doesn't get to see his family over the holidays and has to deal with my mom's family's issues. I know my dad was really sad I spent most of my time with my boyfriend's family, but every minute I spent with my mom and her family I felt so drained and sad.

My dad doesn't really get my mental health and never experienced that type of anxiety. I can't talk to him about my feeling towards mom because he loves her and would never say anything negative about her parenting style or moral beliefs. I feel so sad I am hurting my dad as I am an only child, but I want to do what is best for me. I go for lunch with my dad monthly-ish, but when I do see him he seems so sad.

tl;dr I want to avoid my mom, but in doing so I am breaking my dads heart.",17Jan2020,1

654,"I dont usually post on reddit but decided to give it a shot cause I need some nonbiased advice.

I started working at a restaurant chain as a server a few months ago and starting getting attention from a guy there. It started off as friendly and chill but turned sour within a few months. I will say he is the type to just be outlandish and say really bizzare and weird, often innapropiate things, so most people I've talked to shrugged these instances off but I cant.

It started off as suggestive comments about me and how I'm foolish for getting engaged so young (I'm 18.) Just general sexual comments about no one were made which I ignored until I was brought into the mix. One such comment was about me 'deepthroating' him while my fiance watched. Others about me sitting on his face and all that jazz.

I kept being weary of the guy but always put it off as him just being vulgar- that was until the bastard starting sending me porn and even went as far as wrapping his hand around my neck (two occasions) and squeezing the sides of my neck with a lot of force. No reason-just did it to do it. This was in the middle of my workplace nonetheless.

I kept letting things go as I didnt want to cause any drama at the workplace till this guy tells me months prior when I first starting working, when he asked me to hang out, his intentions were to get me drunk so he would try and have sex with me. Maybe its just me but that sounds wayyyy too much like incapacitated rape. He knows i would say no so the fact he thinks he needs to get me intoxicated to get his way solidifies that he didnt intent it to be consent.

I told my fiance and a few pthers and they all got me to report to my boss. And when I did-he did nothing. He claimed he talked to him and told me never to speak to him-which I dont- yet the guy still tried to talk to me like nothing happened. To male matters worse my boss even tried making me work together with this guy. Its like he forgotten everyrhing.

I told one of my other managers and she seemed to take it more seriously, yet the next day she seemed to forget about it too and even try to make me work on a party with this sicko! Eventually I told him to never talk to me and now he just mopes around and sent me some bs apology. I ignored and blocked his number (I forgot he had it or I would of done it beforehand).

He still makes dirty comments to others and I hear them on occassion and I doubt I'm the only girl hes been this vulgar to.

I'm scared to walk to my car alone now cause he seems like the unpredictable type and being in the same room as him makes me sick.

I'm not sure what to do now. I dont want to quit but it seems no one is taking anything I say seriously. Should I be concerned or should I just let this go? Maybe im taking it more seriously than it is but this dude gives me bad vibes.",17Jan2020,1

I've been with my spouse for almost 10 years, we are not married but we live together and have 3 young children. I was 19 when I got with him and he was 26. Now I'm almost 30. 
Anyway, last night we were having a few beers and just playing games at home when the beers ran out he said he wanted to go get more, so I said ""Why? You have to work tomorrow, let's just watch a movie and go to bed"" he said ""I'll call in to work and we'll get more beer"" 
That's when I said ""okay, but you're not calling (my step dad who is 75 years old) for a ride, it's late and hes sleeping"" 
that's when he went and sat on the couch all pissed off and I said ""so you're mad at me for not waking up an elderly man to give you a ride?"" 
He started yelling at me saying hes not happy with me anymore. So I said I was leaving to go for a walk and we can talk about it when hes sober. (The 3 kids were all upstairs sleeping) I went for a walk (not long because it was freezing out) I came back and tried to talk and explain that I did nothing wrong and that he has a drinking problem, he said ""you knew what I was like when you got with me"" I said ""i was 19, i didnt know any better!"" 
Then he said he was gonna leave, I still had my coat and boots on so I said ""no you can stay and I'll just leave"" so I left again and went around the block when he called me and said ""you better get home to your kids because I left"" (they're his kids too)

I'm a girl myself and I just can't feel anything but disappointment at my face/physical appearance whenever I see a girl at school or a shop. I'm like 'damn they're so pretty! Look at that blonde beautiful hair and those green eyes!' or 'oh my gosh! She's  a literal goddess-I bet every boy would be begging to ask her out--she's literal perfection whit that tan skin, caramel hair and long legs and skinniness'.

671,"Hope this is the right sub, if not, sorry. I’ll delete and move on. 

So I’ve worked at [well known fast food delivery service] for a year and a half now. I’m due to leave in September 2020 to move for university. 

The plan was to work there at in increased ish rate of pay (a bit shy of £3 more per hour than my age’s minimum wage) as a bottom line manager. I took a training course in October, and the stipulation for this was that I have to work for the company for at minimum one year after the course, or else I’ll owe them the cost of the course (approx £600). 

On paper, staying at my current job is logically the best thing for me to do. It pays fine, my commute is extremely short, and I know it well. 

However; I hate it. With a passion. 

I no longer enjoy where I work. It’s gone from “I’ll put up with it for a few months” to “I’d rather die than stay in this building 5 more minutes”. Today I found out my store manager, who I looked up to greatly, is leaving... and he’s been talking smack about my quality of work to his girlfriend (who does not work at our place, and also- I have a problem with my hand, making the physical process somewhat trickier for me right now). 

I work stupid hours (7-14 per shift, 5-6 shifts per week) with only 10 minutes to stop and eat in the middle of the 9+ hour shifts. I get covered in food and mess and muck. I don’t have free time anymore, I barely have time to wash ffs. Only to be yelled at by higher ups who’s bonuses are affected. 

so it’s a bit of a catch 22. If I leave, I’ll be happier, but I’ll also have to work somewhere for less money (finding a job is an issue too obviously, plus I could come to hate wherever I find just as much as well), with a longer commute, and I’ll owe this job £600ish for my training course.

My dad wasn’t working from friday to saturday and we had a great time but on sunday he was at work and it was only me and my stepmom. We didn’t speak to each other that day or anything but as I was about to leave at around 12 she told me that she won’t let any of my dad’s ”bastards” in anymore and told me to give my keys that dad had given me to her . I refused to give them and decided go just leave. 


She has never been like this before and I don’t know what to do. Should I tell mom or dad or both? They are married so half of the house is technically hers. Can she refuse to let me inside? I don’t want to stop visiting my dad. I’m 15 and my dad is 41 and my mom is 36 and my stepmom is 32.",17Jan2020,1

This happens with everything, and I know it’s not mentally healthy. Every time I get home, I grab some wet towels and clean everything I was using that day, phone, wallet, headphones, etc.

682,"What is a good alternative to RSS or News Sites (other than the reddit for World News, which often posts older things/things out of order and a LOT of editorialized content (while there seems to be a center point, a lot of articles that range too far right or left tend to show up (which is to say, there's a LOT of posts, and I want something succinct)) to see multiple World News headlines (&amp; perhaps small blurbs) only, w/o pictures?  Something like a curated version of the reddit for World News might be good.

I'm tired of feeling like sites are trying to manipulate with their headlines. All of the big sites (Google especially, which seems to keep giving me old news and really warped 'For You' sections) seem to have ulterior motives in how they curate. I don't want ads. I don't want suggestions from the news organizations. I don't want weird memes or entertainment news. I don't want active content. I want tiny bandwidth and no fluff. If there's just a feed something like Reuter's 'The Wire' without all of the stuff surrounding it and the active content, that'd be sufficient. I'd like to be able to remove certain subjects (eg, sports, entertainment, remove news about certain things/places at times) and add them back at will, too, if possible (not just scroll past them).

686,"This started several years ago. It started off as just cursing, disobeying parents, not coming home on time, missing school, and here we are, he's doing drugs in front our mother, drinking.. He beated my mother twice and me once. And after that I left to live with my father, now, he and mom live alone. I just couldn't take it anymore. Soon, he will turn 18 and probably go in jail.

Biggest problem is that he acts like he's some kind of lord. Doesn't listen to anyone, does what he wants... Besides that, he drop out of highschool, doesn't have a job. 

He talked to psychologists, social workers, police, parents, me. And doesn't want to listen to anyone.

I think he's mad at our parents because we had issues in family. Our parents fought a lot, father has a drinking problem, and many other stuff was happening back then. I endured all of that and I still have some mental problems, and him, he kinda got lost in all of that, maybe that's his way to cope.

It’s not even in a BDSM way my brain wants it, it’s just like I always seek out men who are more likely to hit me or force me for honestly I don’t know the reason. 

This is really troubling for me because I have this weird moral dilemma now. I’m with a guy and he doesn’t know I’m okay if he does that stuff to me but he does it anyways. Does that not just make him a bad person. Just because he does it to me and I end up liking it what if I was a different girl and didn’t that would be so bad. Then it’s like I’m with a guy that’s technically a bad person morally. But the solution of telling someone before hand is so unappealing to me because I don’t want a BDSM situation I’m not a fan of those at all.

689,"Hi all, I'm 18 male. At first I'd like to say that english isn't my mothertongue and if I make mistakes I'd love to hear about them so I can become better. :D I read recently about trauma bonding which led me here.  


So Im in relationship for 3 years with girl same age as me. We started at fall of summer 2016 (I am her first boyfriend) and it continues to this day. At the start I didn't know about issues at her home which was alcoholism and some kind of other disorders which led to fights between her parents. So the problems started about month later when I found out about one of her parent abuse and about her complexes related to her apperance. There were many arguements about jealousy. There was one which led me to psychologist. I was 16 and had one problem with health and I wanted to talk with her. Unfortunately we went to our chemistry teacher first (She was like 30ish having abit provocative outfits basically all the time.) she had cleavage and of course my gf had problem about that. She told me about that screaming (all happend at school during break on stairs to basement where basically no one was around) then the bell rang and I kinda lost control over myself and started pounding my head against the wall. Later it led me to cutting my wrists and finnaly I landed at psychologist. Then my parents decided to fly me over to England where my dad was working for past few years. (I was basically raised by mom only and that made me more serious on many things.) That was like the biggest arguement we ever had and she apologized many times for that but it never fixed her jealousy. And I also promissed myself to never do such things again. Well except some cases when I thought about suicide. I also quit sessions before going to England.  


During my stay at England I texted my long time best friend (it was girl who was hated by my gf) and we were just talking about normal stuff nothing else. It helped me get through bad memories and when my girlfriend heard about that she was furious she threaten to kill herself and all other stuff. I decided to cut the contact with friend for my own and her good. Later on my gf was talking how untrustworthy I am and how disappointed she is. Later on I fall out with my best friend and I am left with nobody to talk about that. When I came back from England I started first year of High School. We were at the same school but not in the same class. She had problems finding new friends and also was jealous about other girls that were in my class aswell. After talking with her educator and even her parents she found few friends. Then it was calm until summer where we went to Ireland to my godmother to earn some money. She couldn't say a word in english due to her shame created by her best friend. During our 8 week stay there I decided to break up with her because she started to check my phone for messages, lying about how shes doing at work (later my godmother got phoned from her friend who gave my gf the job saying that she doesn't speak at all, that's why I'm sure about lies) and also endless arguements about that we don't go for walks (because I was tired after work with children at the amusement park.). She was also jealous about girls I've been talking in work when there was no people around. Well we came back from Ireland and I did break up with her about month later in September or at the beginning of October. I lasted one week without her and after that we were together again.   


Valentine's Day. We went on a movie where there was some kind of striptease scene and of course there was another sort of ""big"" arguements about that, but she admitted that her attitude is bad and she started seeing psychologist which helped her with issues at home and abit with jealousy. During summer break she moved away from her mother. Then I can't really recall whether there were any bigger fights or not but I decided to write this in some sort of time order so I'll write about stuff i remember outside that.   


Year later (it's 2019 summer break aswell) I started texting with friend of my girlfriend. It started quickly to look I want to cheat on my gf so she told her about that and that ruined ""trust"" I earned over years. Truth is I wanted to earn trust of that other girl and talk to her about my issues. My girlfriend never believed in that. And this leads to more present days where I had fight over being online on Instagram which I claimed earlier I stopped using (reason: I just stopped caring about other peoples lives and started using reddit more frequently) It basically was something like this: came back with tea in my hand she was sitting in my room and she asked how the hell I was online on Instagram like 7h ago when I claim at the same time that I'm not using that. I tried to explain to her that it's a bug and I really don't use it, also tried to reassure her and wanted to show her my dm's there and on facebook to end the fight but she refused to. She told me after that she just hates being lied to and she can't understand how this could happen that I was online. (earlier when I told her I'm going to stop using Instagram she encouraged me to use it anyway.)   


During those three years she always cared for me (except the fights) always helped me with problems (such as my mothers cancer which was cured later but) and was always feeling guilty after the fights (or at least that's my feeling). I've always thought that it's because she never had boyfriend before and she'll learn. Also that it's because issues related with her mother and example she had at home. But with my in born attitude to help anyone I feel it's worthy to care about I stayed and decided to help her but it doesn't seem to work with constant fights. But still I have hope I guess that someday it will be usual.",17Jan2020,1

You can't tell her this is annoying because she'll go full victim complex and act like we hate her. And act like because she's just trying her best to be loving we're rejecting her love or something.

696,"Okay. Buckle up, this is going to read like a shitty sitcom. Do keep in mind this is my actual life so please, be somewhat nice. Also, throwaway for obvious reasons.

Not too long ago I slept with my ex. No big deal, happens all the time. A few days later i found out my IUD got dislodged and tadaaaam, baby.

After a calm, logic-based conversation he told me that not only he would ""support"" the route of abortion, he also told me in very clear terms he did not want to know, let along be involved.
Obviously, I was pretty gutted about this but I strongly believe men should have the same out women do so I respected his decision and started considering my options. A few days later, he blocked me everywhere and that was that.

Now, i ended up in the hospital for reasons i don't feel comfortable disclosing and ended up being in a coma, that's where my parents were told that the only thing that was keeping me going was the life support I was on. They decided to let the doctors turn it off and harvest whatever could help other people. For this, I am incredibly proud of them.

(During all of this, my father reached out to the people i frequently talked to, only a few got back to him, my ex however did not up until the point my dad told him I was about to be taken off of lifesupport and die. That's where he decided to pop up)
I obviously didn't die, my heart kept going after Life support was switched off, and here I am! 

So, after being in a coma, having an organ removed and being dead, I figured there was no way in hell or heaven that the baby would be still alive. Again, tadaaam. During one of my bloodtests after I woke up they found HCG in my blood. Not a big deal, it's normal this close after being pregnant. Cue me falling out of bed when the next test revealed RISING LEVELS of HCG, indicating I am indeed, still pregnant.
 (Worth inserting here that my ex had expressed shock/dissapointment about me not telling him I was pregnant) So I confronted him. I've asked him if given another chance, would he hold the same viewpoint. Again, his answer was abort/don't want to be involved/ don't want to know.

I told him regardless and he was rightfully shocked. Tempers got slightly heated and I decided to leave him to think things trough.
This all lead up to me flat out asking him why on earth he was still around. He answered ""i'm not sure"" and that was that.

Now, i am massively conflicted.
I'm very lucky to be in a position in life where I don't need the support of the father (emotionally, financially or any other way) and I can truly say I do not need him.
BUT, when I talk about having a lawyer draw up the paperwork for him to sign his rights over, he throws a fit. When I tell him we should go our seperate ways he brushes over it, etc.

I will NOT be held responsible for cutting this tie and ""blocking him out"", I need him to actively make the decision to dissapear again, i will not be held accountable for him not being involved in this childs life, so I can't just block, delete and move on wich I would do under different circumstances.

What do I do here. The man doesn't handle confrontation well and tends to just dissapear whzn I attempt one (worth noting here we were in an LDR so just meeting up for a drink isn't possible).
I don't want to push him/this in any direction, if anything i'd want to move forward and do it alone. But, my biggest concern is the well being of this baby, the second biggest is him being accountable for him not being involved. It was HIS decision, i gave him all the options. How do I go about this in a civil and mature manner.",17Jan2020,1
697,"So I work in a laboratory on second shift but due to the benches I'm trained on I can't work the second shift weekend rotation. So I was put on the day shift weekend rotation (whole other can of worms honestly)

now I'm one of 2 people trained on molecular testing on second shift so if my other evening shift coworker needs off for any reason I kind of have to work it if no one on day shift is able to work it. (also another can of worms honestly)

day shift weekends are essentially set up where one person receives and prepares samples for molecular testing  and helps with molecular and the other person performs the brunt of molecular testing.

Saturday of the first weekend I worked was what I considered split very evenly with molecular tech with them helping in morning to prepare samples for the morning molecular run. That person sonewhat explained what is expected of each bench but kind of warned me ""now tomorrow you are with this person and they will probably expect you to do a lot more but it shouldnt be too bad"" 

Sunday of that first weekend was with that person who I will now refer to as ""Phone addict"". it felt very uneven which was further complicated by my bench being extremely busy with a lot of samples and they did not help out like the tech yesterday and when I'd go back to give them samples they would be on their phone texting (which kind of proves they had free time to help out and honestly it is against our policy to be on your phone in the lab anyway) 
At the end of the day I was so backlogged with samples I started to put some in the fridge for day shift the next day so I could leave at my correct time. She was talking with another coworker for about 20 minutes while I worked and told them ""well I'm already on overtime I better get going"" . then she saw the few samples in the fridge and told me it's not allowed to leave samples from the weekend for the next day and I need to process them"" then she kind of just left soon after. so I had to stay about 45 minutes extra to process them.  (people came to the window with questions so that backed me up too was probably more like 20 minutes of actual work to process the samples)

then the next day my evening shift coworkers told me that's not correct what she told me about staying late because that's not what they have seen on other weekends they have seen with day shift. And they noted that Phone Addict was scheduled to be the person on Monday to process samples so they think she just told me that because she didn't want extra work. They told me I needed to email the supervisors because she is also very well known for being lazy like that and it's not right.


so I sent an email to the day shift supervisor and the night shift supervisor about that Sunday and I also included it felt very unequal and that I had to go to break very late too because it was so unequal and I did not have time.

Later that week the day shift supervisor told me he talked to her and everything should be ok. 

now flash forward to a couple weekends ago I worked with her both days. I had to work Friday evening shift until 11 and clock in the next day Saturday at 7:30. So honestly I'm not up to par. There wasn't that many samples so I processed everything for molecular and started processing non molecular samples. Phone Addict walks by scoffing at me saying I am supposed to help her set up her machines for molecular. (Saturdays are slower and the other saturday i worked the molecular tech had set up all her machines herself) I go over and she just starts plating samples without setting up any of her machines so I have to kind of rush to set them all up. 
Then I have to prepare reagents for the machines too. For GI samples you need a special additive for them to PCR correctly basically. So I forgot to add it (I'm on like 4 or 5 hours of sleep)

then as far as I know everything is on and I go back up front. 
Phone Addict comes up front and starts yelling at me how I ""used the wrong kit and all the GI samples will now need to be thrown out and reextracted"" (was 3 samples and we keep extra samples so it's really not a big deal)

I start apologizing and say I'm sorry but I'm running on like 5 hours of sleep

she tells me ""yea well I didn't go to sleep until 1am and you don't hear me complaining"" (she wasnt working tho I was up working not by my choice)

I start getting a little chocked up but I'm trying to stay calm and one of my coworkers notices and asks if I'm ok. Then Phone Addict comes over and says ""you know what go on break"" and she turns to my other coworker and goes ""you can hear me right? I'm telling her to go on break"" 
I go on break and start crying a bit because I'm like ""oh my God she is really going to take it out on me all weekend because she is mad that the supervisors talked to her and mentioned I had to go to break late"" my other nice coworker finds me and tells me I really shouldn't have to deal with that and she spoke to me so inappropriately and it made her feel very uncomfortable too and she will tell the supervisors about this too. 

I go back into the lab and Phone Addict is there and I hear her mutter ""it's always nice to have a good cry huh :)""

I then re do the extraction for the GI samples and when it's around lunch time I go to ask her what are we doing for lunch times she tells me ""you know what go now I don't want any emails to the supervisors about you missing a lunch""

next day I go in (Sunday's are the heavy work day because there's no molecular Saturday night like there is on Friday night) it's about 25 samples.

Phone Addict comes in and she just walks past me to set up her machines and doesn't even offer to help. Instead she pointingly asks a different coworker if she needs help while I'm here struggling.

but fine I essentially do all the work perfect and I ask if it's ok for me to go to break and she sarcastically tells me ""oh yea sure, it's so important to get those breaks in on the weekend""

then at the end of the day she tells me she wants to talk to me and says(I memorized this quote)

""I just wanted to ask you if you are going to be sending any emails to the supervisors about this weekend? I was just really blindsided by you emailing them last weekend and I wanted to make sure you won't be emailing them again. Because I think I've been really fair with making sure you have breaks"" (she was kind of narrowing her eyes as she said this so I personally took it as a threat) I told her no this weekend was fine.

698,"Last week I went to a party with my classmates from highschool, and there was a girl that was kind of into me, we spent most of the night together and made out a little bit. I'm quite introverted, so it probably wasn't great, even though I tried. It's worth to mention that both of us were a little bit drunk.

I talked with her after, asked her how she was and asked her out, she said she was doing fine and that we could go out on Thursday or Friday, I asked her what time would be fine for her and didn't get a response. I was expecting she would tell me an hour some of this days but she didn't reply anymore.

Should I take that as a negative response, like she just doesn't want to go out or should I remind her that she said we could go out. I was thinking about moving on since she didn't reply.

I just remembered that some years ago a girl asked me out, we said we would go out on Saturday and that she would tell me the details that day, she didn't. Sometime later I talked with her about that and she told me that I should've reminded her about the date.

Now I'm a little bit confused if should remind this girl or if I should just take that as a no and move on.",17Jan2020,1

707,"So here's the facts:

1. I work in banking on account processing. Our department is getting shut down within the next 6 months so management is generally pretty relaxed.

2. Due to our being shut down soon, there is very low volume of work. At least once a week now we run out of work so I just get on a computer to learn coding in the slate time that I have. Point is, me calling off wont screw anyone else over.

3. In STL there is bad weather on the way, bad enough for some schools to shut down. Freezing rain starts at 2pm (when I'm due to leave) and turns into snow and then sleet and then normal rain by the time I get off at 11pm.

4. I am out of sick hours and have no other PTO to use. So inwouodnt get paid for the day.  My friend has done this twice recently and got no flak so I think management will let it fly esp with the bad weather.

5. This is the kicker. On monday I switch from 2nd shift to 3rd shift. So today would be my last day on 2nd shift. The way the schedules work, I'll never see my 2nd shift people again. I want to say goodbye but I was pretty quiet so not super close to any of them anyway.

I work in shifts, and usually eat late at night because I'm too unorganised to pack a lunch. My main food is noodles and pretty much nothing else.

I do everything normally and there has been no change to my routine but I do not feel anything and it’s starting to concern me as much as I can be concerned. I’m not even concerned for myself just my family. If something happens to me I don’t care, but I know my brother will.

So how do you start feeling again? I want to laugh again. I want to cry again. I want to care about myself and not just feel like a shell anymore.

I don’t even think that’s the right word, because I don’t feel any type of way. I just feel bored really. Not feeling anything is boring, and its starting to take a toll on my relationships.

In our small Indigenous (Native American) community on campus, everybody is connected. My bf and I are a part of this. So is my coworker, let’s call her Betty.

2 years ago they meet (before him and I knew eachother): Betty has expressed interest in him since the day she met him. He was never interested. After a couple months, he was lonely and started hooking up with her. He was clear with her and told her he wasn’t interested in anything more than a friends with benefits situation. She eventually told him she couldn’t see him anymore because her feelings were too strong. They don’t talk or see each other for months.

1 year ago: I come into the picture. It is obvious that Betty is jealous, there are constantly daggers in the back of my head, eyes on us whenever we’re together etc. etc. I ignore it. Betty and bf are on OK terms, “friends”

4 months ago: Betty and I become coworkers on campus. She is my superior. We never work together as i am only relief work, but she starts to talk to me around school. It became obvious that she was wanting information on me, conversations were not genuine. I notice little annoying things, whenever she sees me, she starts looking around to see if bf is with me somewhere. I’m nice but standoffish. Not interested in participating in that bs.

3 months ago: My bf and Betty have a run-in while studying in the same building. They have a full conversation for the first time in months. 
That night she messages him, “I really meant it when I said we should hang out :)”
He doesn’t respond, she deletes him on all social media and won’t talk to him when she sees him.
Oh hell no! I’m done being nice to that b*#%h was my reaction. If I ever see her, which I hardly do, I completely ignore her.

Fast forward to now: now we are full time coworkers :) I need to clear the air with her because I cannot function with the tension between us. 

What I need from you guys is help with what exactly I should say. I don’t want to start an argument with her but I also want to be clear. Any ideas?",17Jan2020,1

According to him, the neighbors upstairs always follow him the same direction he goes, in his apartment. He also said that he did an experiment to see for himself that the neighbors are really following him throughout his apartment. When he went to the bathroom, he heard the same footsteps follow him there, so he went back to his bedroom and the same footsteps followed him there. He continued doing this for a total of three or four times from what I remember when he was telling me this.

He also told me that when he was trying to sleep, he heard the neighbors say loudly, ""Is he asleep?"" One day he got sick of it and went to the living room and he told me, throughout the night, he heard loud footsteps as if they were trying to look for where he was at. He thinks the neighbors have some sort of device that can see through walls. In my opinion, I don't think people can get a device that lets you see through walls unless you're in the military but I could be wrong on that.

Can you people help me out here? I'm not that tech-savvy myself and my friend is even worse than me. Do any of you know any devices they might be using to spy on my friend?

So where I have to turn on my street, there is duel  left turn lane with three lanes to turn into. The leftmost lane turns into the number one lane and the other left has both the center and right lanes as an option.

The right lane becomes a turn only lane and many people fail the duel lane and cross into the lane I use - lane two.

725,"My problems are so ""first-world"" that it becomes absurd to me to even write and ask advice about them. 

I am a privileged only-child single 30 year-old male who has been living with his parents for the last 2 years, after I broke up with my Japanese girlfriend whom I had met while working in Australia. I had a 1 year relationship with her, during which we lived together in Melbourne and after that the plan was for me to go live with her in Japan and probably make babies. However, after arriving in Japan I quickly realized the language barrier and cultural differences were overwhelming. Adding to that, she was part of some sect which she had never mentioned before to me and her parents were very involved in it. On her side, she didn't know where she stood towards the sect, but it was obvious that her sectarian friends were trying to bring her back to meetings.

Obviously, I should've been ready for anything, especially after spending lots of time traveling Asia before meeting her and going to Japan. I wasn't. Between trying to quickly find a job, trying to learn Japanese and her going back to working 10-hour days, my whole mind was crushed down. After 10 days there, I fled. I just took some of my belongings with me and booked the first flight I could find to come back here. It was tough, I was depressed and heartbroken, by my own fault. Now, thinking back, I think she was madly obsessed with me, unless I have no fucking clue what love means...

Anyway, back in the spring of 2018, I found an ok job driving forklifts on a shitty 4am-12pm shift, but also the same summer, I got stuck on the idea of becoming a plane pilot, my childhood, and probably only dream. My dad accepted to finance me. Since then, in August of last year, I obtained my private pilot's license, a big accomplishment for me. Now tough, I am trying to continue on to commercial, but l am struggling, socially and mentally. 

Last June, I quit that 4am job and found an other closer to home on a regular schedule. I do data entry for a small hardware store that plans on opening a new website this coming spring. The pay is good, but I am a complete outcast, since I don't work on the floor like the other retail employees. I am stuck in this small office where only an other employee works, so I don't get to talk much with others except at lunch time. Somehow, I think I made a mistake by even mentioning that I was following flight lessons, people know how much it costs and I work part-time which probably means I am filthy rich to them... I feel guilty of working there.

Also, I don't see my old friends as much, since I am busy flying and I don't really want to invite them flying because it's not my own money, it's my dad's money. I don't have many friends, but they're all struggling financially, having their own place and girlfriends. We can't share much together anymore...

As for my parents, they are in their early 60s and in relatively good health, but they don't do much with their lives, my mom gambles and my dad finds retirement challenging.

Why am I writing this wall of text? Because with all this, I have to choose if I continue with the lessons, or go on working full-time and move out to my own place... I have just this feeling that I am way too comfortable, that everything is just too easy and that's why I can't meet new people, that I can't find a girlfriend.

Here’s the thing, we’re both living at my parents house and we’re planning to move out and start school for 2 years then move to Arizona. My biggest issues is, the first 2 years of our relationship has been surrounded by people, we never get our personal space. If we have her move in, she won’t move out till we’re in Arizona. That’s another 2 years without our personal space.

My girlfriend is gravely concerned her mom is going to either kill herself or OD and that we need to help her before she does. In my eyes, she’s a 42 year old woman who needs to figure out her shit and not make her daughter feel like she’s responsible. 

I’m afraid it’s going to put a strain on our relationship, and their relationship. I’m afraid she won’t have motivation to move out, I’m afraid we’re going to lose 2 years we could have together because her mom can’t figure it the fuck out.

 I'm 22 years old and I still live with my parents. This weekend I'll be going on a vacation for the first time without them. My stepmother is extremely overprotective and I felt the need to make it seem like my friends and I were going when in reality, it's me and a guy. 

 I've never been able to go away for days at a time before. I don't want anything messing it up- like her judgement about me going on vacation with someone I haven't been dating ""long enough"" (think, 1-2 years.) I've catered my free time to her a lot in the past and this year I've decided to do what makes me happy. This is one of them. I'm really excited but she's already getting into my head and bothering the hell out of me. 

 She's insisting I give her the address even though we don't have one until check in. She wants my friends and my friends mom's phone number. I'm afraid she will call my friends mom and well, I'll already be gone so it doesn't matter, but I still don't want to hear her use this against me for years because it means she ""can't trust me."" She also wants me to turn life 360 back on right now which isn't a problem tomorrow, but tonight I won't be where I said I would be. 

 While the mistrust is not exactly untrue, I don't believe at 22 I should have to lie to go on vacation anyways, so. 

 Am I entirely wrong? Should I let her know what's going on at all or see if maybe she never finds out? I don't want her blowing up my phone my entire vacation. I just want to finally experience life without her breathing down my neck and it seems like I can't.

Me and the other 2 girls (let's call them Katie and Jane, not their real names for privacy purposes) went to lunch with the other 2. They didn't like the food at the cafeteria, so they went to get a snack from the Cafe in front of our school. Me, Katie and Jane went to our usual spot in the school (these large stairs in our common area) and started playing Heads up because we were bored and we wanted to do something that included everyone.
The other 2 came back and they sat down on the other end of the stairs. They weren't talking to us, but because they were eating, we didn't think nothing of it. We asked if they wanted to play and they said no. We kept playing for a little bit longer but we ended up chatting instead. All of a sudden they leave and go to one of the windows without a word.
At this point we knew something was wrong, but sometimes they just come back from the Cafe a bit glum so we thought it was weird, but not totally unusual. A few minutes later, they pass by us, grab their backpacks and head off to the classroom building without saying a word.
We were dumbfounded and didn't know what to do. We eventually had to go to class too and Jane has classes with them (me and Katie are in a different class) so she was in charge of asking if they are mad. Turns out they are and when asked why, the response was : ""Well you should know"" and they completely ignored us from that moment on.
Now me, Katie and Jane think we did nothing wrong, we acted perfectly normal and we think they are being childish by just acting like that and not wanting to say why they are mad and stuff.

737,"TL:DR: My cousin wants to pull his 15yo daughter out of a private, somewhat harder school and send her back to a public country, somewhat rough, poor academics school because she's having difficulty in school and is currently without any type of academic tutoring or help. How can/should I help?

My cousin's 15yo daughter (9th grade) is having a hard time in school. August of last year, she transferred from a small public country school to a small private college prep school. She's struggling in school for 2 reasons: family issues, and her old school was very lax academically, whereas her new school is more challenging. Since my cousin and his family live half an hour away, I spend time with his family and I'm pretty close with his daughters.

Anyhow, my cousin's daughter has been wanting to go back to her old school for 2 reasons: she's having a hard time academically, and she's having a hard time adjusting to the student body. She has a few pretty good friends, but she's not very popular. She has some teachers she likes, and some are just whatever/somewhat frustrating. I was just talking to her dad a few minutes ago and he was talking about sending her back to her old school, but he said several times he wants what's best for her. I told him that while he's her parent and it's ultimately his decision, I think it would be good for her to atleast finish up the school year at the private college prep school. I said that it would be good for her to learn how to find her way through a struggle, in part to learn how to face it, and in part to gain confidence in 'I can do this,' and that I can and will meet with her to tutor her as much as needed to help her. Right now, even she's not sure if she plans to go to college, but I want her to get a good education. Her old school isn't that bad, it's just pretty poor academically.

She's capable of doing well in school - she has A's in everything but 3 classes, where she has a C, a D, and an F that's just a few points from being a D. Just like her dad, I want what's best for her, and if it were my child in this situation, I would want them to finish out the year and try to help them as much as possible.

I know I may have been out of line in giving my opinion, and I don't know if it helped that I told my cousin that ultimately, it's his decision, but my opinion is just that - an opinion. What can or should I do to help?",17Jan2020,1

To get back to the point, whenever I'm overwhelmed with work and stress, I seem to get scared of failure and just freeze up and my mood drops quite a bit because I know I have a lot of work to do, and I'm not doing it because I'm overwhelmed, and all that together makes me feel like crap. 

In what ways can I cope better with stress, and develop better work/time management skills? Thank you in advance.",17Jan2020,1
739,"So people usually just say 'just get out there' but the thing is, what am i supposed to do? Just go up to a random group of people asking if i can join? Follow random girls on instagram and try to initiate a conversation? I've already tried enlisting myself in an art club (which is actually a hobby of mine) but that didn't work since the people there are mostly old people, tried a sports club, also didn't work since most of the time, i only saw guys, only on matchday were there girls etc...

740,"Hi Everyone. New here and so glad this community exists! I need some unbiased advice. Here’s some background:

➖My husband and I had our first baby recently
➖We met and live in Portland, OR but from different midwest states
➖We both don’t have family here aside from my husbands sister and brother in law
➖We bought a house in Portland less than a year ago 
➖We both work remotely from home

We both love living in Portland despite a few pitfalls. However, since the birth of our child I’m feeling this strong desire to be closer to my family and they all live in MO where I’m from. My husband has made it clear that he absolutely does not want to move back to the midwest due to many factors (weather, different culture and political views, landlocked, the need for a vehicle, 420 criminalization etc). He is from WI and was bullied a lot in school. He would like for our child to be raised among more open mindedness. While I agree with him, my family doesn’t live in the middle of nowhere USA. Kansas City is where I’m from and I happen to really love the culture, the arts, and all the diversity. He hasn’t gotten a chance to visit the city and has only visited the surrounding suburbs so maybe he would like the city? In my opinion there are more pros than cons to relocating closer to family, but how do I express this to my husband? The last time I brought it up it sparked a very counter-productive conversation. I considered doing a ton of research, coming up with potential schooling options for our child, showing him the cost of living is so much more affordable than Portland, pros/cons list... basically a vision board of my vision. But is it worth it? Am I pushing this on him? I’m trying to see from his perspective. Am I putting too much emotion into my thoughts? I miss my family but is that enough to disrupt our life here? Thanks for reading and for any advice.",17Jan2020,1
741,"I've had a crazy sequence of events the past 6 years, basically I started out as a very driven and hardworking student at a top 10 university, I got sick from a medication after my sophomore year to the point I had to leave school and was basically sick for 3 years straight. (I'd rather not go into detail about the medication but yes, this really happened and it was traumatic and horrible and all that). Now I'm 24 years old, without a degree or experience, despite working my ass off the first 20 years of my life. The thing is I went to school for something artistic knowing that my degree wasn't actually going to help me in the career I wanted at all, I just went for the education/experience. I already feel like I missed a lot of time to actually get into the field I want to be, and if I go back to school I'm going to 'lose' even more time. Also, the cost of school has gone up SO much even in the short amount of time I left, I am going to end up in way more debt than I originally was. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn because the field I love is very competitive, and now I feel like if I go back to school I really will have missed my chance, since it's better to get started young (plus I'm just antsy to start making my way in the world). On the other hand, I don't want to be stressed out my whole life or lost because I don't have a degree as a sort of fallback. I'm the kind of person who really believes one should go all out for what their greatest dreams are in life, but I'm also worried about the time I lost and what that means. I know no one can tell me for sure what will be best, I guess I'm just looking for support in a time where I feel no one close to me has anything helpful to say and I'm feeling a little lost and alone. The thought of going back to school and not being able to really focus on my career until I'm 26 makes me super upset. But I feel equally upset at not having my degree if in the future it turns out I need it to make a living. On a smaller note, I do think I look a little younger than I am but I also fear that I'll just be seen as weird and old and not make any friends and feel isolated and weird if I go back.",17Jan2020,1

743,"i discovered last december that i might have been infected with hpv and got genital warts. i was 17 when i had unprotected sex with a guy for the first time, we've been together around sept 2016-feb 2017 but i've only allowed him to have vaginal sex with me in january 2017. we stopped seeing each other around february 2017. i only found out he's had sex with other girls when we stopped seeing each other. i was naive back then and i don't know about the risks of getting hpv, std/sti etc. so now i was thinking maybe he was the one who had it.

i only had unprotected sex again on october to november 2019. this guy had sex with other girls too, 5 to be specific. i think i'm the fifth girl? not sure though. i wanted him to use condom when we were having sex for the first time but he insisted that he's not comfortable so the dumb person that i am just allowed him to stop wearing it. he was uncomfortable wearing condoms so i thought... maybe when he had sex with those 4 girls he never used a condom. 

we stopped having sex in november 2019 too. november 12 was the last time we had sex. after that we never had any sexual contact again. around december 2019, i got home from somewhere, so i went straight to the bathroom and i was washing my vagina when i noticed there's a weird bump near my anus. it's near there but it's nearer to my vaginal opening. so it's somewhere in between the two. i did some research and i'm convinced it's genital warts. i think it's spreading because there's a rough part around my vulva, on the inner lip. 

i informed the guy i had sex last oct-nov 2019 about it. he told me he was more scared (of me) because he doesn't have genital warts. so he was thinking i might have infected him. these genital warts only became visible to me almost 2 months after we stopped having sex. i googled it and in some cases, people might only notice genital warts from weeks to months, or months to years. some people get infected with HPV but doesn't have genital warts. i've never noticed anything weird in my vagina until december 2019. i might have had the virus from the time i had my first unprotected sex?? i read an article too and it's says that genital warts symptoms probably appear 2 to 3 months after infection, but symptoms might occur from 3 weeks to many years after infection. also, it said that ""visible genital warts appear only during active infection"". if i had unprotected sex in 2017 could it be possible that i've only had symptoms of genital warts in dec 2019...? 

in oct-nov 2019 i had sex with someone who had more than 2 sexual partners back then. so i don't know whom i got it from.. i don't know anymore. what if he gets infected and he blames me for it? i was the one who told him to wear condoms but he insisted not wearing it. my dumbass shouldn't have had sex with him like. ever. i went to a gynecologist but i haven't told her about the fact that i had unprotected sex in 2017 so i will tell her on my follow-up check up.",17Jan2020,1

753,"Ever so often, my mind goes into this ""Lets take trivial things and blow them out of proportion and constantly freak out about them to whatever degree"". More often than not, it seems to be about how other people perceive me. I don't really know where to start with this, but over the past couple years, I've become really concerned about whether or not certain people like me, at least people that I'm acquainted with, etc. I've noticed that some people that I've been friends with, or rather claim to be my friend, never really seem to act like it. For example, I'll see a friend doing something for another person that they rarely ever do with me, such as asking them to play a game, etc. I'll text them or message them or whatever, and I'll rarely ever get a response back. I just feel like I'm a friend in title alone. It's happened with a couple other people, too. I don't pester anybody, since that's another fear I have, but If I haven't heard from someone in a couple days, I might say ""What's up?"" or something like that. No matter who I become friends with or whatever, I always feel like I'm an outsider. Like I'm someone staring through a glass window and I can never truly form a connection with people or something.

I know I'm not the most outwardly friendly person around. I tend to be a aloof sometimes because it seems like whenever I get too friendly with someone, I get taken advantage of. Plus I just have this... weird thing about showing more... idk... 'mushy' emotions. I just don't like to expose myself emotionally, I guess. It just makes me upset when I feel like there's this barrier between me and other people, and they go off and have fun with their other friends and I just feel like I'm some sort of tag-along or third wheel. Is it because I'm not emotionally open to people? I'm not exactly the best conversationalist around, but I think I can hold a somewhat decent one if I'm given enough to work off of. Obviously I can be a little grating sometimes because of the occasional difference in opinion on something, etc. 

I don't know. Maybe I just think too much about what others think. But I can't just flip it off. I just don't like feeling like I'm by myself, and it makes me wonder what I'm doing wrong. I want to try and fix it. Any advice would be appreciated.",17Jan2020,1

760,"**warning:** contains disturbing mentions of self-harm (cutting), depression, and suicide.

It is also very long, so I have bolded the most important part towards the bottom.

**TLDR:  Went to work black out drunk &amp; passed out in the locker room. Manager found me unconscious with self-inflicted cuts on my arms from before work and called an ambulance. Got stuck in psych ward for 2 weeks without access to my phone to call in, explain, or apologize. Got  discharged from hospital and have not been contacted by my workplace about what happened.**

I’m a  21 y/o college student working at a restaurant on campus. I live in an apartment with 4 other students. All of my roommates and pretty much  everyone else I know left for winter break, but I didn’t because my relationship with my family is terrible. The restaurant where I work was  closed for a lot of the break, so I was just alone in my apartment most of the time getting increasingly depressed and lonely (I hate being  alone, even for a short time). I was off work for about a week from Christmas through New Year’s, returning to work on January 2nd. This was  the longest period without at least a few hours out of the apartment and with other people. Loneliness and depression are pretty common  feelings for me anyway, and being alone in my apartment for so long especially during the holidays made it a lot worse.

I  started drinking more and more to deal with it, telling myself I was “celebrating” the holidays. But for some reason on New Year’s eve I was less depressed and actually kind of happy. I started drinking that  night, but I really was just celebrating this time as I watched the ball  drop on TV like I do every year and was actually having a good time, right up until exactly midnight. Then out of nowhere I just started sobbing. I didn’t even fully know why at first, but seeing all those  people on TV, happy and smiling with people that love them and knowing I don’t have any of that just broke something inside of me.

I  don’t remember a lot after that, but I kept drinking for a while and  then went to bed. I couldn’t fall asleep so I got up and kept drinking and I just didn’t stop. I was drunk all of New Year’s day and kept  drinking all night again. If I slept that night it was only a couple hours. I have been self-harming and suicidal off and on since middle school, never getting help for it, and in the morning on January 2nd, I  cut my arms with a razor blade. I had been doing a lot of painting during the break, a more healthy way I sometimes deal with my emotions, and I started another painting that morning, but this time I painted with my own blood. And I was still drunk, for the third day, and I kept  drinking, and suddenly it was time to go to work.

I  blacked out and only remember parts of what happened next. I remember realizing it was time to go to work and getting ready. I brought more alcohol with me, but I don’t remember actually drinking once I was at  work. I don’t remember leaving my apartment or the trip to work, but I  do remember when I first got to work. I clocked in and started working  for a bit and then went to the bathroom. I may have passed out in the  bathroom for a while but I don’t remember for sure. The last thing I  remember is deciding to go get my pocket knife from my coat pocket in  the locker room and continue cutting in the bathroom. Then suddenly I  woke up on a stretcher; I don’t know if I was still at work or somewhere  in the hospital. Someone asked me, “Do you know where you are?” and I  shook my head no. They then asked, “What’s the last thing you remember?” and I responded, “I was painting.” I asked who called them, confused about who could have found me when I was alone in my apartment.

**They explained that my manager found me unconscious in the locker room with cuts on my arm and that I had alcohol with me, and then I remembered that I had been at work. I said some nonsense about my brother, and then woke up somewhere else, in the hospital in restraints. I ended up getting sent to the psych ward for about two weeks, and wasn’t allowed  to use my cell phone or the internet while there. I was supposed to have another shift on the 3rd that I missed since I was in the hospital. I  got discharged from the psych ward yesterday and have had no calls, voicemails, or emails from any of my managers about this. What should I say to them? How do I apologize/explain and ask about the status of my job? I am not taking classes this semester, which started this week, because I have to do an internship instead as a graduation requirement, so I wouldn’t be working there this semester anyway, but I would like to  return after my internship is over. I didn’t realize how much I liked this job and the people there until now. I hate that I made such a stupid decision and possibly lost not only the job but the respect and trust of my managers and coworkers.**",17Jan2020,1

Since I told him about the diagnosis he disclosed to me that he was thinking maybe he has bipolar disorder because he has bursts of productivity where he just walks around his room and does everything he needs to do for work and school. 

I told him that from my background and experience that’s okay and if he’s not experiencing negative side effects about the moods he’s experiencing he’s probably okay, but if he thinks that somethings off he should talk to a doctor. 

Afterwards he has continued to mention how he thinks he has ADHD or other disorders.

770,"Hope this is the right place for a question like this! If someone else has a better idea, shoot me a DM

**Background**: growing up my family never had much money. We scraped by, but my mom could never teach me about etiquette or anything when she didn't know how to do anything like that herself. After highschool, I got a scholarship to a really good school for college and in my last year I met a guy who I will call Jeff. We were originally just casual friends. We didn't hang out a ton, but when we did he seemed to live like a normal college guy (microwave meals, tshirts, roommates etc.) 

Flash foward 6ish years and I move to the city he lives in and we reconnect and end up hitting it off. We've been dating ""officially"" now for around 6 months and everything is great. He is caring, compassionate, funny, etc. etc. etc. 

My one issue is that I have realised that Jeff comes from a very, very different background than I do. His family is very well off. Not like Bezos or Saudi Prince rich, but very much the old money, extended trips to Martha's Vinyard, several homes kind of wealthy. Most of Jeff's friends are from similar backgrounds, and while they are all very kind to me I can't help but feel like fumbling white trash around them. It's in random little things like thinking that rose wine is pronounced like the flower or a family member of his telling me that it's great that I ""dont care too much about how I look."" (Also what a bitch)

I don't want to completely change who I am, but I would like to know how to just feel more put together and collected, stick out less, and feel less coarse and tacky. Are there books I can read? Are there videos I can watch? Not looking for suggestions like ""watch Pretty Woman"" but any real tips are really appreciated.

771,"So me, being a black male, kinda disheartening to hear this. I've always kinda known (my gf and her sister have told me multiple times) but he seems generally relaxed and cool with me. We work out together occasionally, he's always really nice and respectful and feeds me and everything just seems like it's normal. 

To keep the story short, this morning my girlfriend told me she woke up to him screaming about black people. Apparently there were racial slurs and it got down to basically black people are inferior and he hates them. 

Not to justify anything he's done, but he is a little older (50ish) and he does have PTSD so factor that into this.

How should I go through with continuing this relationship? I have no personal problems with him, and I'm not holding anything against him, he has major brain issues. However I can't help but feel uncomfortable those things came out of his mouth.

tl;dr: GFs father is racist and has PTSD. No aggression towards me specifically, but I don't know how to carry out our relationship.",17Jan2020,1

776,Recently I was let go from my job and am in the process of looking for a new job. The reason I was let go was for business reasons not performance reasons. I have been very emotional and scared about what is going to happen next in my life. I am not sure I’m in the profession for me but I don’t know how to go about changing careers. I just got a phone call I was rejected from a job as an entry level graphic designer (I’ve been doing graphic design at my current job) and called my boyfriend to talk about it and started Crying. Recently I’ve been very emotional and having panic attacks and random breakdowns where I just cry. I’m scared to make moves in my life and I over think and just think in circles then end up doing nothing to change myself. My confidence in my abilities is horrible and I don’t know how to improve them. Like people tell me you need to have more confidence but how? It doesn’t happen over night. How can I also control my crying? I’ve cried in front of my manager several times and cried when I met with a career advisor last week. I just feel out of control and helpless.,17Jan2020,1

780,"To provide some background I am 31m living in North Carolina, my long time girlfriend is 42 currently living in California (as a sex offender due to her previous boyfriend physically abusing her and sexually abusing her daughter). I met this amazing woman online about 10 years ago and we began dating 8 years ago (only 1 year of that time we actually spent together). Unfortunately, as good of a person as she really is, she had a lapse in judgement and could not leave the relationship before things got to the point they did because she felt its all she deserved. The state of CA pursued charges against her, in conjunction with the douche bag bf. When we met it took some time before she confided in me the details of what had happened, but growing to know her after helping her leave the situation, I know she isn't the monster the system made her out to be. 

While all of this has occurred, I also am responsible for helping care for my mother who is a diabetic and had 2 strokes which left her basically paralyzed on the right side of her body. I have been by my girlfriends side all through the process from arrest, extradition, prison time, and now parole through constant communication (text, calls, letters) from here in NC, as I have felt I can not leave my parents as they need my assistance. After 7 years apart, I cant help but feel like things are unraveling in my relationship as her parole end date nears. 

Recently we have discussed the possibility of me moving there, as it is easiest for her, but I am so unsure of that decision I don't know what to do! Below is a few more things that are issues we are facing in our relation ship. 

 Any advice to help me decide if I should stay with this woman, who i really do love and just want the best for, or do we finally make the choice to move in our own directions (which she says is my choice and she will respect).  

&amp;#x200B;

Problems I feel between me and my partner -

* lack of trust (due to her past relationships she has issues with me interacting with other women)
* she has past relationships to base experiences on, compare to, and build and positively compliment me, but this is my first relationship so I cant do the same - emotionally and sexually
* her restrictions will limit her ability to travel and experience nature, parks, museums, etc... (which we both enjoy)
* she cant have kids - I am unsure if I would want them in the future
* she would live in a card board box with me, but i wasn't willing to do the same for her (even when she found a place because of the life changes to move from NC to CA)
* I feel i am required to help my parents ( dad works 2 jobs to pay for moms medical bills, leaving me to take care of mom bc they cant afford nursing assistance)
* When we are together, things are PERFECT. Yeah she may not be a bombshell photo model- but neither am I. 
* I am emotionally attracted to her, but the sexual attraction has faded.",17Jan2020,1

But recently I have been getting worse at work I had overdone myself climbing the inside of the rock wall. Then after a few days I started to hurt all over, the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep even for a hour. Eventually it got so much worse, I felt like my body was shutting down everything was blurry, my muscles ached especially my back, even all my joints would pop from any kind of movement, the one thing that go me was I couldn't even write or hold my tea my hands just gave out. 
I called my mom because of the pain and asked if I can wait until February, which I begged her crying because I was so scared. We went to the doctor and he gave me steroids and muscle relaxers, but he wants to run blood work because he believes it could be something more serious. My mother almost immediately said no.
We left and got the medicine, I begged that I get checked like the doctor said. Once again she wouldn't budge, I can't pay for the labs because I'm only 18 and had to leave my job due to the injuries.

I was an 18 year old making 12 an hour at a department store. Anyway, our relationship gradually deteriorated until we broke up. She was adamant the whole time about wanting to pay me back. She was able to get a job shortly after we broke up and was in the process of paying me back. After she gave me 100 dollars back (this included a couple payments, not a one time payment) I decided that the breakup was really doing a number on me, and it was best that I stop accepting her money so I could move on in my life.

786,"As the title says, I'm afraid that I'm going to get in trouble with cheating. My friend (A) and I are both sophomores in high school. We both have the same teacher for Algebra 2, but we aren't in the same class. Usually, our homework is checked for completion. However, once in a while, we have an assignment that is graded for accuracy. Usually, we get some time to do the homework in class and the teacher says something along the lines of, ""You can work together, I don't care."" This time, I don't recall her saying that, but everybody in my class was working with their friends and the teacher doesn't really seem to care.

A and I sometimes compare answers we're unsure about. Today was one of those days. She asked what I got on a problem, and I texted her a picture of the answer, and only the answer (not the actual work involved). Right before her math class, I saw A outside of the class, so I went over to talk to her. She was looking at my answer that I had texted her and was fixing a mistake. We were talking a little bit. Then, the teacher came over and said something like, ""Is this/this is academic dishonesty. I am very upset."" (The picture of my answer was on A's phone still) A kind of stammered out that she wasn't cheating, she was fixing a mistake and that she wasn't copying my work, that we just didn't get the same answer at first. The teacher said that she saw that there was no work at all on the photo, only the answer. I'm not sure if the teacher connected me to the possible cheating, but I was there when the teacher ""caught"" A, so she probably thinks I'm involved.

For us to get credit on a problem, we have to show work. Because I didn't send A the actual work I did to get the answer, she was doing the actual problem by herself. 

Some things on my school's Code of Conduct about cheating that are relevant are: 

\-Copying any work assigned to be done independently or letting others copy one’s work (It is the responsibility of the individual teacher to clarify expectations about homework and projects with their classes, preferably in writing on their course syllabi.) 

\-Using any electronic device to give, receive or copy information before, during, or after an assignment, exam, test, or quiz 

\-Collaborating on an exam, test, quiz or assignment with any other person without prior approval from the teacher 

Also, it says that "" The teacher will confer with the student and contact the parent/guardian by phone to review the academic integrity violation within one school day of becoming aware of the incident. "" However, during my friend's class, the teacher didn't pull her aside and talk about any possible academic dishonesty. But, the teacher did warn to the entire class about academic dishonesty.

I personally think that I did nothing wrong (although everyone probably says that) but I can see why the teacher might think so.

TL;DR: Friend and I compared an answer on a homework, teacher saw, we might get reported for academic dishonesty.

Do you think that we were being academically dishonest? (although this point of view is probably biased). Do you think I'm going to be reported? What can I do? Thanks. I apologize for how long this post is.",17Jan2020,1
787,"I have my first jiu jitsu competition tomorrow and I had to drop out because for the past 5 days I’ve had a cold and haven’t been sleeping great from the runny nose and coughing.

790,"I work at a small toystore in a busy suburb of Chicago. I started here in May 2019 and briefly became friends with my coworker, Jessica. She introduced me to my significant other, her neighbor, and I've even lived with this person in Jessica's apartment building on and off since we met. She and I are no longer friends because her alcoholism and self-destructive behaviors were really detrimental to me and my own struggle with alcoholism and similar behaviors. (One night, in the middle of a bender, she declared she was suicidal and I called the cops because it sounded serious. We went to a crisis unit and she talked her way out of it. She ghosted our workplace for a week, blaming me and calling me daily while she was drunk to tell me I was a piece of shit for calling the police on her. This was pretty much the final straw for our friendship and I haven't had much contact with her since.)
She works at the sister store (a block away, same owners) to where I work now and there's a ton of crossover. I see her almost every day and have to speak with her. It hasn't been a problem until this week, because I'm working alone in the store. All of her comments are aggressive. I recently asked her to return a phone I had lent her when she lost her's. She laughed in my face and told me that she would need to look for it, but looking for it will never move up her list of priorities. Today she didn't mince words to tell me she knows I'm bad at putting display together, which is part of my job. I've never retaliated against her or said anything rude to her that I know of. I don't mind working with her because I dont have a problem being professional in a work environment and I always want my job to come first.

792,"I'm 19 years old and I've known this guy who's currently 18 since we both met in 6th grade. We've known each other since middle school and really started bonding in middle school. Well, after middle school, he switched schools and we lost touch until a year later when we were both in 10th grade. We quickly reconnected and things became a whirlwind of emotions and hormones. I grew up in a home with a controlling, narcissistic mother who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I didn't get to see him for fear that she would find out that I was interested in a \*gasp\* boy. But that didn't seem to matter as he understanding, we talked from sun up to sundown every day. 

Fast forward to the end of junior year, my mom threatened to kick me out, and in my frustration, I managed to blame all my frustration on this boy and stopped talking with him for about 3 months. After those 3 months, I was settled in a completely new city in a new state (i moved from the south to LA). I decided to reach out to him and found out he was dating someone from his school. I was very hurt so we talked on and off (as friends) and his girlfriend ended up breaking up with him at the end of the year (I still don't know why... he was embarrassed and didn't want to bring it up) and he turned to me at the end of that. I gave it some time (a few weeks) and decided to keep talking with him since he was technically single and it wasn't ""wrong."" 

Fast forward some more, it's the summer and I had something to drink and I ended up drunk texting him that I loved him and a bunch of nonsense. The next day, he tried talking about it but I brushed it off because I was too embarrassed. Well, I gave a lot of thought to what I had said and I began thinking we were soulmates. 

For reference, we both grew up as the awkward ducks in school. We both have high functioning autism and hold a lot of similar interests and beliefs. It seemed like it was meant to be. 

Well, I began joking about it and then became more and more serious about it as time went on. He noticed and brought it up and said he felt uncomfortable. Over the course of a weekend, I blew up. I felt that the years we spent talking with each other were wasted as he didn't seem to share the feelings. I became very very mean and told him I didn't want to talk with him ever again. That was September 30, 2019. 

Last week was one of the most miserable weeks ever. I talked with a friend and opened up about what happened and realized I had been really really toxic in the relationship and I went kind of psycho when I told him I didn't want to talk anymore. I was really mean and I recognized I employed some manipulation tactics that I had learned from my mother. This scared me so I drafted a message of apology (sent it to my friend to proofread for grammar and stupidity first) and sent it to him. 

Well, he responded well and was grateful for the apology. He also said he was dating someone now. And he also said he would like to stay friends as he felt we did connect in a special way in the past. My friend thinks he wants me around for emotional support but doesn't want to commit. Honestly, I can't blame him. But, I think I want to stay friends if that's possible. It feels like this is my second chance to treat him well now that I am aware of what I am capable of.

His siblings are pretty normal kids and can be a bit bold but nothing out of the ordinary. I have three siblings so I know pretty much the jist. This family doesn’t watch violent movies or television and are very in control of the content their kids watch.

I want to tell the mum but he acts so sweet around her, except for a being a bit cheeky at times. I don’t know what to do at all.

800,"So the other day I (21F) was talking to my friend (22F) on the phone for almost two hours. During most of this time I was outside taking a walk. My friend is black and I am white so we often trade stories and ideas surrounding racial issues to get to understand a different view. Most of this phone call we were discussing our childhood homes and the prejudice towards black people we saw growing up. We had talked about systemic racism, horrible laws, desegregation, and all kind of similar topics. 

Towards the end of the phone call I had reached my apartment building so I sat in the lobby area. I was telling a story about a school I had attended and said, ""There were a lot a black people. A lot of them were poor."" To which my friend said, ""More systemic racism."" And I replied by saying, ""You see the connection."" I barely continued my story when a woman was asking for my attention. She asked me to repeat what I had said so I told her that I was talking with a friend and I was telling her a story about my school which had a lot of black people who were also poor. Before I could continue my explanation she asked me if I thought all black people were poor. I responded by saying that I did not but I did think that there is a lot of systemic problems that negatively impact the black community. She told me to watch what I say because I never know who could be listening and then walked away and left.

At first I was very confused but then I realized that if you only heard that little bit of conversation (and had not heard what my friend said or the rest of the phone call) that it would sound exactly like what she assumed. I was disappointed that I was unable to explain everything to her. Ultimately, I would like advice for how I should have handled the situation so I can improve for next time. Should I not talk about these topics in public anymore? Should I be more conscious of my end of a phone call and how it might come across to others? Should I learn how to better describe a conversation I was having?

Also, this woman works at my apartment building. How should I handle future interactions with her? Should I bring it up? Should I only acknowledge it if she does? Any advice would be helpful.",17Jan2020,1

In 2019 I lost 4 friends. Everything from suicide to car crashes. Kids I grew up with, playing sports with, laughing and joking with. Now gone. In November I almost died as a passenger in my buddies car when we t-boned a tractor going 75mph. That buddy moved to Cali. In December 2019... I lost my best friend since day one. That kid you do everything with. That kid you hit up when you’re bored. He overdosed on a Percocet. A line we all agreed never to cross. His new girlfriend got them laced Percocets for his first time. My other 3 best friends got deployed, and moved to across the country and another across the ocean. I have a decent full time job, but my parents want me out. I don’t want a random as a roommate so I might get my own place. But even when I’m out, I feel debilitatingly lonely.

806,"So last year I claimed my daughter on my taxes because I really needed to get a new car, my babys mother (I dont like the baby momma term lol) who was my girlfriend at the time, let me claim her but wants to claim her next year. Well now the time has come where it's time to do taxes. 

Now I'm not going to get super personal about things but we are not together anymore. We split about 5 months ago. We switch every night with our daughter, so we are supposed to have her an equal amount of time. That's not always the case though. My mom babysits while we work. I come home from work and take care of my daughter on my day and her day unless, she gets off before me. I have weekends off, so I tend to have her Saturday mornings until my baby mother's mom comes and gets her so she can spend time with her grand daughter. And I go and pick my daughter up on sunday mornings. 

Now what im getting at is that I do have my daughter more than my baby mother does. She is 19 and I'm 22. I got a new job last year (mid 2019)  that pays me almost double what I was making in 2018.  


Would it be wrong for me to ask to take back the deal we made last year, and ask to claim my daughter on my taxes considering I have my daughter more, I do tend to buy more of the baby supplies that we need. And considering shes young, likes to party, I'm afraid she would use it irresponsibly. I would give her some of the money obviously, but I honestly dont think she'd let me see a penny of what she gets from claiming our daughter. 

Now I'm not asking if im an asshole or if shes an asshole. Just want to know if itd be wrong for me to ask her if I can claim my daughter. Thank you.",17Jan2020,1

**Tl;dr** There's a job I would love to have. I'm afraid I'm not good enough.

I'm a student at the moment. I quit my former job in September. I had had a gapyear, school started again and I wanted to focus on that.  Since a few months I've been looking for a new parttime job.

My friend recently texted me that the place she works at is in need of new employees. It's in the café of a library. I know the place and I would love to work there. 

At the moment I'm not sure what's holding me back from applying. I've started making a CV and motivation letter, but everytime I write something I think 'No I shouldn't say that' or 'I worded that weirdly', and I've put off finishing them for a few days now. 

I think I'm just afraid of being turned down. I'm kind and very customer friendly, but I know I'm not always the best at smalltalk, and I'd hate that to get that in the way of things.

We were chatting on our business communication tool, and I made him laugh about something. He said I was funny, and in addition said: “See, you have a cute sense of humor :)”

I'm currently having an existential crisis because the program ends April 30th and I have no idea what I'll do after it. I'm open to anything. I'm from California and was living with my parents and working before this, so this was kind of my first step into  actual ""adulthood"" since I live here on my own and am pretty much completely independent.

Anyway I really don't know what path to take. I've considered a couple things, maybe doing a Workaway and living somewhere tropical (lol) so I can improve surfing a lot since I've gotten into that. I'm also considering moving to San Diego since there's surfing there but I know it's very expensive so I'm not completely sure. I'm indecisive by nature and can be capricious sometimes with my choices (like how I came to France lol).

I pretty much have no life plan or direction and feel like I should maybe try to find a real job after I get back to the U.S., but part of me feels like I want to do something crazy too. Like move to Costa Rica for 6 months and become a really great surfer. lol.

817,"I have a friend. We are very close and have known each other for over a decade. She is closer to me than my actual sister, and most of the rest of my family. I am very money savvy. Friend is not. When we met friend was raising teenagers on her own and living in a rough situation. 

Husband and I decided back in 2014 that we could help friend out. We have no children and had already paid off our home, and had very little debt. We decided that we would buy a home for friend to finish raising her children and she would pay us rent. We went into this knowing we were not trying to make money, just trying to help a friend out. 

We found a pretty cheap house to buy that would suit the needs of this family. The mortgage payment was small. The agreement we made was that she would pay us enough to cover the mortgage and utilities each month and we would keep all those in our name and pay on her behalf. It worked out pretty good really. Now she has been able to build good credit for herself while living there and raise her kids. The kids are now adults and have moved out on their own. Since friend is so close, we ended up deciding that she could move in with us instead of staying in the rental house alone. 

Now, we are getting ready to sell the house. The market value of the home has increased considerably since when we bought it so we might actually turn a profit. This is where our dispute occurs. 

I feel that since friend paid the mortgage payments through us, she should get some benefit of the profits once we take out all of our expenses from purchasing and repairs over the years. I don’t mean that she should get all the profits or even all of what she paid in. I just think that if we were to make a profit, we should share a portion of it with her because we would have never bought the house in the first place without her. Husband feels that we should keep all profits because we took the risk of buying the house and have been responsible for repairs. 

Now, I don’t know if I am being too generous and he doesn’t know if he is being too greedy.

Other then these incidences, he is the most chill and kind person. He only ever does it when hes by himself and hes never shown any other kind of violence at all. 

He will punch himself multiple times in the head and face and will be covered in bruises. Hes used other things lying around to smash himself with too. Once he even cut his eye open and now has a scar. He says that while it's happening he is saying out loud no.stop.dont. but he cant stop himself. Then he gets mad that he did it and just keeps going. 

Last night he had an episode and hes had a brutal migraine all day, and has vomited 5 times. He cant see straight and hes not himself. 

Obviously he has a concussion and this is not the first time hes had one from these fits. I told him he needs to go see the doctor. He needs to get checked. And he needs help to not be doing this to himself. 

He agrees but he wants to just pretend it never happened and says he will man up and stop. 

But it keeps happening. 

He cant even sit up right now without feeling intense pain in his head or vomiting. I'm worried this is going to kill him. 

What can I do? Do I make him go? Hes trying to downplay it. He think he needs to ""just be a man and figure it out""

No one has brought it up but the atmosphere of the chat has become uncomfortable and awkward. The aforementioned friend is very sweet, but most of the people in the group chat don’t really know her. Some of the things people send in this group chat are very personal, and it’s also sometimes used to discuss plans that she wasn’t originally invited to. 

She rarely sends anything in the group chat, and it just comes across as a very uncomfortable situation for everyone involved. I wish she had never been added to the chat, even though I love her dearly she isn’t really a part of this specific group. 

I tried voicing my concerns with the person who added her to the group chat, but they didn’t respond. 

Should I talk to this friend and ask her how she feels about having been added to the group?

831,"I've been at my current job 13 weeks now. And the first 12 weeks have been great.

One of my coworkers gets the bus with me and on Monday she showed me the changes the bus company will be implementing as of the 27th.
Basically, they're merging two routes together and changing up the times. Our current bus times are perfect. Most people on our bus work a standard 9 to 5 job and the times work.

Well the new times they've got planned are ridiculous. We'd have to catch a bus 35 minutes earlier than the current one and we'd get to work 45 minutes early.

Unless we can get our hours changed, but we could potentially only change them to 8:30 to 16:30. That works for her.
 
However, it puts me in a tricky spot. The next bus into town after 16:30 is 16:55. This will mean I get into town at 17:15-17:20. The chance that I will make the 17:15 bus to my area is very unlikely.
The next bus to my area is at 17:45 but that one rarely turns up. After that is's 18:15, the bus I currently catch. So that means, I'll be leaving the house 30 mins earlier every day and getting home at the same time.

I know it doesn't seem like a huge difference, but I already live a decent distance from my job (compared to many of my coworkers) and I think it's kind of ridiculous that it'll take me 2 hrs 15 minutes to get home from work.

I'll try to make this as short as possible; I had my first relationship almost a year ago, it was amazing, she was amazing, she was super beautiful, very kind, and was into a lot of the same things I was. I had my first kiss with her. I lost my virginity to her. She fulfilled my every dream and fantasy. I didn't know what happiness was until I met her. *I know I'm a teenager.* But I felt what I felt and nothing could change that. 4-5 months later, she leaves for a trip, and she ends up ghosting me. I wait a month thinking maybe she lost connection or was busy or some bullshit excuse I made up in my head, no answer, I keep waiting, no answer, but she reads all my texts. After months and months, I had enough, my over-dramatic self felt like nothing without this girl, so I attempt suicide. End up in inpatient for 2 weeks. She still has nothing to say. I go into treatment, getting worse and worse everyday, I'm so terribly suicidal, but don't have the guts to make any actions on it. 

I have 1 friend that I have a complicated relationship with, she does give me some happiness but she has such a busy schedule I'd be super lucky to even get a text from her in a day.

Basically, I'm at a point where everything I try or have tried hasn't worked to cope with the pain I still somehow can't get over, nothing motivates me, my parents have told me I suck energy out of the whole household, I'm a tumor that takes up space and money.  I go to school just to go to school, being successful doesn't motivate me, even the thought of getting better doesn't motivate me.

How do I find motivation? I feel broken beyond repair. Life doesn't seem worth living.",17Jan2020,1
841,"I'm 26. About 6 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend is loving, caring, the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. He's 30 and wants kids. I don't know if I do. 

I have a few concerns. Firstly, I have no idea if I'm going to be a good mother. I babysat for neighbors throughout my teens and while I absolutely cared for those kids, I never got the feeling of ""I cant wait to do this with kids of my own someday."" I don't know if I have the motherly ""gene."" I think forward to having this baby and raising it, and I only feel trepidation right now. I dont know if I want or am ready for a child, but everyone in my life is so excited for us, and abortion is not an option unless it threatens my health (I was pregnant once before, and knew I was going to terminate even before it caused major bleeding and a constant fever. I terminated at 10 weeks.)

Secondly, I have pretty bad scoliosis. This is what I'm most concerned about, call me selfish if you want. A couple people in my life already have. I am TERRIFIED of how much pregnancy will exacerbate the pain I'm already in all the time, with the added detriment of not being able to take pain medication for it. 

I dont know what to do. I'm so, so scared and in so much pain already.",17Jan2020,1

844,"So I'm in a class where we need 4 people for a capstone group project. We had 3. We were trying to figure out who our last member could be during class yesterday. We realized that our team isn't very balanced (we're all designers) so we wanted a 4th member who'd focus on research.

The class was using an online discussion board to figure out team members and we discovered that basically all the research-focused people were already on teams. There weren't many people left still looking for teams and I noticed quite a few were slackers who never go to class.

My team was discussing this in our Messenger group chat, when a girl sitting in front of us mentioned she's still looking for a team... but she's also a designer. We realized that we needed to stop being picky and pick a fellow designer who's also diligent. So we added her to our group.

I just checked our group chat and saw that the new girl was added. But fuck, I said something insensitive right before we added her that she might misinterpret.

The messages go:

Member #1: ...there's not a lot of ppl that are really good team mates left. I would be down working with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Me: Me too!  
Me: I agree that we can't be picky now

Member #2: same

""Member #1 added \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the group"" (5pm yesterday)

I know I'm probably over thinking this since it's not *that* bad, but I don't want this girl to think we only asked her to join our group because we were being picky. She genuinely seems like a nice person and hard worker, I just haven't had the chance to talk to her in previous classes

What can I say to make her feel welcome? It's too late to delete that message and Messenger also shows ""\_\_\_\_ removed a message"" when someone deletes something, which would be awk",17Jan2020,1

848,"Hello,  
As I write this, I'm sitting in my college cafeteria, attempting to focus on this assignment. I walked into this semester with high hopes of changing my life. I just don't want to lose it all again.

I think its time I admit to myself that the life I'm living right now is not one I want to continue, but I'm a little lost on how to start. 

Since 2014, I've been on this never ending roller coaster that seems like it may be getting better, but then it dips again, and soon enough I'm covered in puke and crapping myself all the way down.   
I may be making it sound terrible, but I feel like my situation is so simple, its just where to begin in my first steps to actually doing something about it, is what confuses me. 

I love college. I do. I was an (almost) straight A student in highschool, and started off my first semester in 2014 college on the Dean's list.  
Thats when I started gaming again. I don't know why.  
I used to game as a kid. A lot. I always chalked it down to parents divorce, blah blah, wanted to get away from it all. 

But I don't know why I started up. I don't. I just took my things to the 7th floor and gamed for 12 hours every school day. Skipped classes, etc.   
Cut to a year later, I'm sitting on 4 F's , crying on my bedroom floor (maybe a bit of a dramatic overload but I felt lost..).   
So guess what I did, I joined the Air Force. (Almost joined Marines as a sniper but dad talked me out of it, thank heavens.)  
I don't regret the time I spent in the Air Force. I've made so many connections, and have a lot of marketable skills now (IT type skills), heck they're paying for my school in full...

I came back thinking I could conquer anything, without floaties. I was wrong. I came to this community college 2 years ago. In that total time I received 7 more F's.... 

7 F's. I'm currently, in my academic career, sitting on 11 F's. Let that sink in.

Now, this summer I decided I would say screw the games, screw all of it, I'm sitting down and studying my butt off, and I did it, I pulled 2 As for the first time since I left for the military back in 2016.  
Last semester went okay, I pulled mostly Bs and a C. Not my best but better than F's.

I don't want to keep this as an essay because im sure everyone's on their phones, but I need help now.   
I'm sitting at an all time low GPA, where my chances of transferring back to my 4 year college are almost none, my chances of being an engineer there are basically over (raised GPA requirement).

I feel lost. I have 1 semester after this before I get my associates (which is my small milestone I've set for myself, yay me I suppose). But... then what?  
I don't know what my next steps are. I want to be an engineer more than anything. I want my 11F's to become a thing of the past, to be a reminder of how far I've come. I want to be able to look back and think ""How the hell was I making it so difficult for myself?"". I want to be able to tell people that even 11 F's aren't the end of the world, that theres still hope. But I need to figure that out for myself first. 

Is there still hope?

I want to succeed, but I don't know how to move forward once this part is over.",17Jan2020,1
849,"I have a little bit of a situation here. 

My mum is about to retire in a few months.  she’s kind of a workaholic so I know for a fact that she’s gonna be bored out of her mind.
I’m leaving for college in September so she’s gonna be on her own and I’m afraid that she’ll get depressed. 

So... I decided to get her a puppy since she’s in love with my cousin’s Pomeranian. She says she doesn’t like keeping a dog in the house but I know her and I know she’ll gonna love having a dog after a couple of months.

850,"So to keep it short, from age 12 to 19 I struggled with anxiety but it didn't become unmanageable until I was around 19 years old. The stress of adjusting to college as well as worrying about how to pay for college really triggered my anxiety to the point where I decided that I needed to go on medication. So I went on fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It helped but eventually two years in around 2017, I started to develop suicidal thoughts and admitted myself to a psych facility at a hospital. 

The dose of the fluoxetine was upped and a mood stabilizer was added to my regimen. Then, I started to gain 25 pounds, become lethargic, and emotionally numb virtually every day. In May of 2019, I talked to my PA about tapering off the medications to see how well I can manage without them. She agreed and she started my taper. Currently I am only on 10 mg of fluoxetine, and she plans to discontinue it when I see her in a couple of weeks approximately.

I just want to vent and ask for some personal advice about my concerns.


I was browsing Google and read some disturbing things about mental illness, psychiatric hospitalizations, and psychiatric medications. I saw some things that employers can use mental health issues as a means to not hire or to terminate an employment usually using something else as a scapegoat excuse.

Also I saw some information about side effects of the fluoxetine I was on that can be permanent. I talked to my primary care physician, and three psychiatric physician assistants about this and they all told me that they have never encountered that case in their experience as healthcare providers and that ""Dr. Google can be malevolent and inaccurate"". However, I have strong doubts of this because a common trend online about medication is that ""everyone reacts differently"" and ""doctors don't know what they are doing often times"".

I really don't know who to trust. The web or my doctors.

1. Do I have to worry about employers avoiding or dumping me for my past mental health history?

2. Should I trust the advice of four medical professionals over what I read online?

3. Is there a chance that I can get a good life back for the foreseeable future after my PA stops my treatment?",17Jan2020,1
851,"I moved in with 2 close friends from high school into Brooklyn, NY in August. We've remained close even during college and I still consider them some of my best friends. We're all 26 now, a few years out of college. As far as roommates I've had, they're far from the worst. But these two guys have lived with each other for a year before I moved in with them and it shows, leaving me feeling like a 3rd wheel.

I'm introverted with a pinch of social anxiety and definitely prefer to spend more time alone than with other people. My two roommates are more on the extroverted side of the scale.

They've got similar interests and tastes and usually spend down time watching a show or movie together in the living room. I do my best to spend time and bond with them, but I have different interests. Playing video games is my biggest hobby right now, so I'll spend most nights in my room playing games with my headphones on. Meanwhile they usually blast their show/movie in the living room, so I usually have to put headphones on with the door closed to play video games how I want to. 

I know a simple solution would be to play multiplayer or party games with them, but they're not into gaming. I had Smash Bros Ultimate &amp; Mario Kart 8 Deluxe set up in the living room for a bit and they both weren't interested, so it went back in my room. Plus, I like playing single player campaign games the most. The Last of Us and Breath of the Wild are some games I've been playing recently to give you some context. Nothing makes me happier than diving into these games for an hour or two after a long day at work to decompress.

I'd like to spend time with them, but the stuff they watch really doesn't interest me. We're on a different wavelengths when it comes to interests and how we spend free time. Sometimes I'll check out what they're watching or music they're listening to and I actually get a visceral reaction because I dislike it that much. 

I feel that after days and eventually months of this being a reoccurring theme, there's starting to be a divide between us, where I'm looked at almost as the black sheep of the apartment. This similar situation of me being preferring to be alone has affected my friendships in general, just on a lesser scale compared to my roommates. And don't get me started on how being introverted has affected my outlook on dating!

Ultimately, I'd like to keep my relationships with my roommates/friends alive and fruitful while not losing sight of who I am and what I'm interested in. Reddit, will you be my therapist?

**TL;DR:** Me and my roommates/friends don't align in interests like we used to and is causing a rift between us. How do I keep these relationships healthy while not caving into doing things that don't interest me?",17Jan2020,1
852," I've struggled with sleeping my entire life, but after consistent traumatic events at young ages, my depression formed and has developed into severe sleep deprivation, on going for 4 years now.

I've done everything people say. No screen two hours ahead. Take melatonin. Listen to some calming music.  None of it works. Every single night I lay with my eyes closed, one hour passes. Another passes. I glance at my phone to check. I at most sleep 2 hours a night and the rest of the night is my body just resting. I've functioned decently off of it, sometimes my body gets weak and shakey if I went too many nights with total sleep deprivation (or insomnia?), but I'm just so sick of it. I'm sick of my dark circles being actual 5 shades darker, and having NO energy to do anything or even do my makeup and go out with my fiancé. I look like trash all the time because I'm so tired. 

I've gotten so desperate for real sleep that lately I've been taking Nyquil and Zzquil despite not being sick because this makes me pass out for hours and when I wake up I feel so good. Sometimes I feel like it even makes my depression symptoms lessen. I'm less irritable and angry and negative. 

My fiancé brought it up to me that I can't down these cold meds every single night even though he knows it means I finally get sleep. Does anyone know any medications or sleep aids that actually work? I have gotten up and cried myself in the bathroom at 3am on a 8am work day while my fiancé passes out within ten minutes of laying down.

For example after him not responding or talking to me for a few days he randomly sends me a snapchat message “Damn I broke my mouse and cant get a new one :(“ or something like that, at first I’m like yea I have an extra one, but then realize after all these years oh shoot he’s using me.

This person and I started commenting on each other's entries about a year ago and been commenting to each other at least weekly ever since. Giving advice, boosting morale, or just letting each other know we've read each other's entries (Being there to ""just listen""). They've been a great friend in that regard.

Recently I've been posting about having to take on my SO's (20-something) part of the rent, the food, and the utilities. I make enough to not be drowning, but they also have been having health issues and have no health insurance (We're in the USA). I'm looking at several hundreds of dollars in medical bills to get my SO back to health. I can do it, but it will put a serious dent in my pocket.

They mention they're worried about me and the pressure I'm under, and have offered to send me some money in any way I deem fit.

Not to mention I have a penchant for trying to prove that I can take care of myself (and others).

859,"There's nothing about not allowing this in the rules so, im gonna ask it here.

Im 16, and I don't entirely know what to do about a girl.
Im in this newspaper thing with a bunch of other school people and I met this girl through it. We both do photography so we somewhat work together. 
I used to email her, but in the end I followed her on Instagram so now I just message. She is a year above me. I'm year 11 and she's year 12. I don't see her unless it's at meetings on Tuesday lunches. That's the only time I can see her.

We've talked quite a bit over the while I've known her. Not a huge amount, but way more than a little. Anyway, I started liking her around the time we started talking. In my opinion, I've felt like she hasnt really wanted to message me.

It feels like I make most of the conversation, but she does sometimes too.
I usually get left on read when I ask her how she is, she replies with ""you?"" and i tell her and she leaves me on read.
I was thinking about asking her if she could help me with a shoot for photography one time, after i got to know her, however, I can't really get to know her since I feel as though she doesn't really want to message, and that our last conversation left me on read, meaning I can't ask her another question or another hey, since I'm on read.

I stopped messaging after a while (this was a bit ago, perhaps a month) and decided it was time to stop trying to message her, get to know her etc.

I need next steps. My GPA is crap, but my motivation to succeed is more than its ever been. For the first time in summer of 2019 I  got 2 A's, and then last semester I received mostly B's (and 1 C cause I did terribly on a final, all nighters suck).

866,"So, a few months ago someone had quit at my work place and she trained me for her position in two days. My manager said she would get me a promotion and a new title in a few weeks as I deserved it.

We have recently merged with another company (basically the company I work for overtook the new company)and there will be a new director coming over and I will have a new manger who is also coming over (my current manager is going to be in a new role). The new director and new manager had met up with my current manager for a meeting one day last month with the door wide open, and I over heard the new director asking my current manager who had replaced the person who quit. My manager told them that I did and the new director stated, “Oh, I had someone in mind for that position...”. My current manager told them that the person they wanted in the position was already hired to do another role within the company in IT and went on to explain to the new director and new manager why she gave me the position as I was very deserving of it and she explained to them everything that I did before I took over new position, which was not much at all!
Later after their meeting, we all had lunch together with another team in the company to meet them and the new director brought up the person they wanted to hire name again and explained that the person had been working the role that I was being promoted to at their company  and said she had been fired by the previous director from their company and came back doing another role in IT once the director who had fired her left and that she would like to come back to the position that I was promoted to within our company. My current manager explained to the new director again that the person they wanted was hired on to our company working the in the IT department as they needed someone in that role &amp; that I am taking over the girl who quit position.
After the lunch meeting, my current manager walked the new director and new manager through what I was hired on to do and they finally understood why I was promoted to do the girl who quit position as well.

869,"I’m 19F.

In high school I was a mess to put it lightly. I struggled with my weight, self esteem, anxiety, and depression. I definitely isolated myself and the reason I only had a couple friends was at least partially my fault. I was standoffish and I didn’t know how to talk to people I didn’t know. I did have good friends but since high school we either ended on bad terms, or I still do talk to them but we’ve definitely drifted apart. 

And that is partially my fault too, since I got a boyfriend in my first year of college and did everything with him and would purposefully only hang out with my two remaining high school friends when he was back home. I was a shitty friend and I own that. But it’s not like they were all over me to hang out either. One friend in particular, I ALWAYS have to ask her to hang out and if I didn’t it wouldn’t happen. I know that for a fact. I try to take it in stride but sometimes it hurts especially when she’s posting all over Instagram and takes days to text me back.

Anyway.... I was extremely socially awkward and I have a lack in social skills due to this isolation in high school. I can now proudly talk to anyone thanks to working in customer service. Yet I still don’t really know how to approach people in anything aside from “hey, did you need anything else today?”

Now I’m no longer with my boyfriend, definitely for the better but not the issue. I’ve realized my mistakes in all my past relationships but I don’t know what to do now. I still have no friends. And it’s not for lack of trying. I have two acquaintances that I work with, one of which that I went out with (I asked her to go see a movie) and it was a good time and we still talk and it’s nothing awkward but she never asked me to go anywhere and it’s been over a month. I also started talking to this regular who came in (which, ok, I wanted to date him and ok, I found him on social media first, I would’ve never just talked to him face to face) but we never hung out either. Although that could be for reasons personal to him I won’t get into here.

So what is it about me that makes me so unapproachable and why does no one want to hang out with me? I switched majors in college to nursing and the girls are nice, I made acquaintances and I’ve been to study groups. And it’s nice to have people acknowledge my presence in the hallway when in high school no one did ever... but I want more. I want a best friend. I want someone in my life besides my parents, you know? I’ve been alone for months now, since august. And I’m not sad, I’m just lonely. I get along with myself well enough now that I’m not wallowing in depression anymore and I have enough solitary hobbies to entertain myself (and nursing school takes up a LOT of my time and I’m very passionate about it). But after being hostile for so long and pissed off at the world in high school... I’m done with that. But right now I feel like I’m on the outside looking in on life and I want to make friends at least. 

Also, any advice for what the hell fo do with people? I’m thinking I should just ask that work acquaintance to go out again but to be quite honest I hate going to the movies but that was all I could think of that wouldn’t sound like a date? Idk. My mom keeps telling me that I should ask people to go to lunch or to go for a walk. And I’d love a hiking buddy! I love being outside. But I don’t know if a girl would think of it as a date? Maybe this is just me being paranoid because I’m bi or at least questioning and I don’t want to alienate potential female friends.

So for the record, I can talk to anyone. Anxiety is not my problem in that regard until it gets to the point of actually asking them to go somewhere, then I freeze up and get afraid they’d decline. I don’t know what to do but I feel like my life is at a standstill and I keep waiting for someone to walk in my life and they never do. I don’t want to be alone forever :/",17Jan2020,1

I spent most of life trying to fit in as a Mexican immigrant, that's another story. After 30 years or more working in the “music” industry as a technician and recording engineer, I have nothing. No home, no 401K, no savings, none of those normal things. I did raise a family and survived. Needless to say, I'm not retired I have lived my whole life hand to mouth to this day.  I have no substantial debt except for school loans and one auto.     
  I do have a lot of technical experience and music recording credits to keep me working. Recently I have started to work with some local unions and getting all of the normal things a working human in the USA should get, this is good.   
  My conundrum; In my attempt to avoid 100% homelessness I applied for assisted living and after a year's worth of paperwork I have an apartment with fixed rent based on my income. My problem is that I have to NOT make more than 40K. If I do my housing will be assessed and will lose assistance. Were I live and work is one of the most expensive placed to live these days. My rent will almost double. Just to have the same housing I would have to pay double, we are looking at $1500 vs $3000. I would have to double my income to afford that. We are talking about a one-bedroom apt. not even a house. There is a huge gray area between getting help or not.   I am a creative person and also do some personal artwork. It has potential for income but I can't sell it because it adds to my income. I am sure that this is a very common situation.     
  One thing that occurred to me is to do some “under the table” work that puts me back in the underground where I will get exploited again while my employer so to speak gets the extra benefits due to me and I am doing something illegal. The other thing that occurred to me was to have a trust fund in were I give all of my artwork to one of my sons and have him sell them and just gift me as needed.     
  I know you guys have some answers. I want to play fair and not be exploited, I won't contribute and have the satisfaction of doing meaningful things for myself and those around me. Please help.

I went from a quiff to tying it back at the top when it got too long, but the sides have pretty much stayed under half an inch the whole time. Now, however, I'm considering growing the sides out to about the same length as the top so I can tie the whole thing, but I probably can't keep the top tied back while letting the sides flop down. The hair on the top is long enough to lie backwards with a little product, but I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions on hairstyles I could wear while growing it out.

875,"So ... there is this girl in my church who I always used to exchange pleasantries and greetings with, but all that stopped all of a sudden, as I noticed her attitude towards me changed. 

She is not a friend but more of an acquaintance.

The change in her attitude started after she found out I was dating my boyfriend, who is now my fiancé. Shortly after she found out I was engaged, it’s like that added more fuel to the fire as now she avoids me completely, and gets irritated when she see’s me all lovey dovey with my man.

We never had any sort of disagreement/clash for her to be acting this way. We were not friends to start with, just two people who would greet each other and have a little small talk and go about our business. 

Now I always feel her eyes on me during church sermons like she is giving me evil stares, and as soon as I look over in her direction she turns away. 

I have spoken to my fiancé about this but all he says is that I should ignore her. Well it’s been really hard but I have just about managed to do that, even when she makes it so obvious she is whispering or giggling about me.

All I am doing is living my life I have done nothing wrong to her for this sort of treatment.  

Her sudden change in behaviour SCREAMS jealousy to me, is she JEALOUS or NAH?

I've struggled with bouts of depression due to constant rejection from jobs and I'm started I'm starting to wonder: Is this really what I want to base my happiness around? Working?

The big trigger for bringing all this one is that my lease is up and I'll need to resign by the end of the month or move.

But that just hasn't happened, especially since getting hired from out of state is apparently really difficult.

878," My father died of cancer almost 10 years ago. When his family found out about his diagnosis, they didn't show up for him. They only showed up once or twice before he was put on hospice. This was mostly due to resentment they had with my father for a multitude of reasons but they knew my dad loved them. Once he passed, no one checked on my young brother, me (just starting college) or mother. We were left with no income and my mother had to start her life over in her mid 40s.

My grandmother was around during my childhood I remember her being fun at times but as I grew up, I realized she was a very critical person. Even my dad would go for months not speaking to her. She also did not like my mother and was very cruel to her at times. This always bothered me because my mom went through a lot of issues with my father. She even decided to be his caregiver because he was the father of her children. My gma blamed my mother for his cancer because she should've gotten him checked out earlier. My dad didn't want to go and ignored his symptoms; I don't think it was my mom's fault.

After he passed, I never heard from my grandmother (almost 8 years). I thought about it for years and decided to call her finally. I decided to be the bigger person because I did love her. Once I did, she pretended she didn't know who I was. She said she didn't have a son or a granddaughter with my name.

We finally reconnected a year later after the loss of a family friend and I confronted her about the call, she said that wasn't her on the phone and that I had the wrong number.

She called me last fall, months later, and complained about how I never called her all those years, basically guilt tripping me. I expressed that I was dealing with the loss of my father and asked why she didn't reach out to me. She couldn't give me a answer. I was a teen when my dad died and left in a vulnerable state. The fact that I had to be the mature one and call her after all those years and she pretended not to know me, really hurt me.

She died a few days ago. My brother and I weren't invited to come by her place to look through her stuff, but her other grandchildren were. My father had children before he married my mother and they also have resentment toward me and my brother because we were raised by my dad and they weren't. They never invite us anywhere. They were only around when my dad was alive.

I'm not interested in going because I feel as if none of them actually love me or my family now that my dad is gone. They haven't shown that but my mom, myself and my brother have tried to reach out throughout the years and no one followed up or showed any concern.

TDLR: My grandmother, who went 7 years without communicating with me or my family after the loss of my dad (her son), died and I don't want to attend the funeral due to emotional trauma she's indirectly/directly caused me and my family.

A while back ago my girlfriend broke up with me to be with someone else. Later on she came back to my life and since I was stupid I agreed to be friends with benefits. The thing is she was still dating the other guy, basically cheating. They broke up eventually and she wanted to try to make it work again with me and me being stupid I gave her another chance but I told her to not speak to the guy because that when she started to talk to the guy she started to have feelings for him. One day I find out she’s talking to him again and I asked her if she is talking to him even though I know she is. I just wanted hear it for her and to see if I can trust her. She then said no but then I told her I know you are and she admitted it. I told her I’m willing to help her because she said she was just scared. Later on the guy come over to her place because she blocked him from social media. She ended up crying and the next day she said she doesn’t want to be together anymore. It was all too much for her

Like asking if I could sit by one of my old friends at lunch she just said no.

883,"So my grandmother died almost a month ago and its been a crazy insane time in my life. She got sick very quickly and had to be removed from a breathing tube. I went with my husband to be with my mom and aunt (and aunt's husband and cousin) while it happened. It was probably the worse day of my life to date. 

An important note, on the day she died my mom and I talked (about a lot of what needs to happen next stuff) and I came up with the idea of asking my three cousins to talk about if they wanted me to set aside items at my grandmother's house that they might want. 

Christmas Eve (almost a week after she died and the day after the funeral) my aunt sent a message to my mom asking for the keys to my grandmother's house and my grandmother's estate documents. My mom freaked tf out and started calling a lawyer she was planning to start asking for legal advice (before my grandmother died, she was going to stay in a nursing home permanently so my mom needed help in terms of how to help manage my grandmother's finances and sell her house). Then, a couple days later, my aunt sent this passive aggressive email to my mom, me and my cousins and an attorney in our family saying that she and my mom had a fiduciary responsibility to tell us we were beneficiaries and that we needed to settle her estate and oh by the way, if you (me) still want to live in her house (second property) we need to talk about that. I was freaking out because that made it seem like she was going to kick us out. We have been living there with extremely reduced rent (the house is paid off) but we basically were managing the property ourselves and its not in the greatest shape and we pay for utilities on the floor we don't actually occupy (but our washer/dryer is down there and we use for storage). We want to move out in 6 months to buy a house and are in the process of doing that, plus paying off my student loans so we have more money for a mortgage payment. 

I completely forgot to mention to my cousins in person at the wake about getting items at my grandmother's house so I sent a group facebook message. All of a sudden (after my aunt sends that email), they start saying they want to go to the house to reminisce and look through things together. 

All this put me super on edge so I blocked all the numbers of my aunt and my cousins as well as them on social media (my mom also strongly suggested I do this.) I realize now this might have been not the greatest idea. I unblocked at least my cousins and tried to re-add them on Facebook but of course they won't respond. I feel bad that we are all caught in the middle of this. We were really close as children but drifted apart a long time ago. I have a brother but he is disabled and nonverbal and has low functioning autism. I don't really have any friends to talk to about this. What do I do? Can I fix this in any way? 

Important note: My mom is mostly getting legal representation to protect me (from being evicted and possibly raising my rent) and also to make sure that any money my brother gets is put in his special needs trust (from my understanding, people with disabilities can't get more than a certain mount of money or they will take away any government assistance). My aunt is not talking to my mom and literally sent her an email asking her to mail her the keys (this is extremely unnecessary as they live in the same area) and my mom said she emailed her back and asked if they could come up with a plan on what to do with my grandmother's house (not where I live). My aunt is not responding and refuses to talk to my mom. We think she wants as much money as possible and as fast as possible. If it matters, mom and aunt are both co-executors and co-trustees.  

TL;DR: Grandmother died. Mom and aunt are fighting regarding the estate, aunt wants as much money as possible as fast as possible. Aunt is also not talking to mom. I feel like I messed up by blocking my cousins and we are in the middle of it. What do I do?",17Jan2020,1
884,"I have a lot on my plate right now and feel out of control. 


My boyfriend of two years recently got a place with me across the country (we were in a long distance relationship; he moved to my state). Very shortly after moving in together, a lot of the things I was unhappy with in the relationship never changed despite communication. He was unwilling to make sacrifices or changes to himself. I felt stifled and like I was carrying the relationship. We were both extremely independent of each other and the sex was gone entirely. Mentally, I’d checked out of the relationship, expressed it to him, but I continued to fulfill my duties around the house per our agreement.


A month after, I met someone at work that turned out to be everything I wanted in a man. Even while in the relationship with (ex)boyfriend, I had an idea of a dream man, and this person I met is exactly him. We started out as very good friends that could talk about anything under the sun, but there are a few concerns. He is 17 years older than I am. I’m in my mid 20’s. He is also just getting out of a divorce by an abusive spouse and trying to get some kind of custody over 3 kids. He is my coworker. We both engage in very toxic behavior that we both acknowledge but is taking a lot of energy to work through. Sometimes it makes me question if he’s the right man afterall, or if it’s my own toxic behavior to immediately run away from things that require work (I dropped out of college, I can’t get myself to get another job even though I hate mine, etc). Everything else about him is absolutely perfect. He is very loving and sensitive, reliable, and highly intelligent. 


Lastly, my family. My dad is the sole breadwinner for a household of 6 people. Two mentally ill sons (don’t collect SS because they refuse to go to the doctors to get a diagnosis) and two children, then housewife. His work truck broke down and he’s been forced to take the family car to do handyman work. He’s older and has been working 7 days straight to put food on the table. It’s proven that he can’t afford rent on his own in this big city so we’ve had talks about me moving back in to help again. It works out because I’m going through the breakup and I’ve been taking the kids to school every morning (I get off work at 2:30 so I sleep at their place anyway). Living with them, although stressful, is cheaper for me and I dropped out of school after I moved in with ex. Before that, I went to school consistently. 
Now, new boyfriend is recently homeless and staying in a room with my parents and I at their house. He wishes I could be open with them about our relationship, but even after telling them I’m over with my ex, they keep asking about him and making me feel guilty for leaving him all on his own. 



My issues are:
Am I wrong for falling in love with the new man? Am I handling this wrong? I feel really guilty for ditching my ex in this city on his own. He’s a sweet guy who didn’t do anything wrong except not know how to love me. What would you do in my situation?

Las year around April I guess she was trying to make amends after I got arrested and get me a job she was also bringing me food etc. After the job interview we got into an argument she started talking over me(I believe this is why I stuttered when I was younger) and making fun of my now concurred speech impediment. I said she sucks as a mother and called her a bitch. After this she punched me in the face and it took everything in me not to fight here (I just got out of jail for battery on my SO). When she dropped me back off to my house she followed me to the door instigating me to put my hands on her after I got in the house she reached in the door and tried to grab me. I then snapped and told her if she gives my grandmother a heart attack I would kill her (she was trying to diffuse the issue). I decided to call the police on her and prevent her from leaving the scene, she tried to run me over with the car and when I grabbed the door she kept driving ( trying to drag me with the car) the police came and I decided not to press charges as I didnt want her to go through what I was going through. I haven't talked to her in a year my grandmother (from her side of the family) keeps trying to get me to talk to her saying she's my mother and we need to get along.

Her best friend before this, who we'll call L, ditched her once she was diagnosed. So, a half a year after going into remission, she started getting texts from a text-now number. These texts are filled with some of the most genuinely horrible things I've ever read said to someone; that she faked her cancer and is a lying bitch, that she has rotting teeth that she should get ""pulled out of her skull"", and saying horrible lies that me and my siblings are telling everyone she faked cancer. This is making me sick. It's been happening for 2 months now, and my mother has a history of mental health issues, so she's been horribly depressed from these daily paragraphs of terrible shit.

887,"Last spring during sex with my fwb At a party I was raped. I was on drugs(molly specifically) and we decided to have sex. He was having trouble cumming and so he wanted to keep going. He is fairly endowed so after a few hours I told him I wanted to stop. Instead of stopping he was like “I’ll only be a minute” and did not get off me. After tell him a few more times to stop he finally got off me. But even then as I was trying to sleep he kept masturbating and would trying to re-initiate. I couldn’t leave because I was on drugs and I also was in shock. 

This was particularly devastating because we had developed a close friendship and I made many friends within his circle including other people he was dating(he is poly). I was so hurt I didn’t know what to do and eventually I realized we needed to talk about it. I knew he was aware of what he did because he had offered a half ass apology for taking so long. When I brought it up he acknowledged what happened and apologized but then got a little dismissive. After that we tried remaining friends. For me this was a difficult thing to do because sometimes I would feel triggered or remember what had happened and I didn’t know who I could talk about it to. 

Recently I made the decision to actually leave that circle of friends slowly - because I did not want to be an ally to someone like him in case he did it to someone else. I had a plan in place and I talked to someone I trusted about what happened. At that point I had kept it a close secret only telling my therapist and a friend who lives in another town. I made the decision to tell someone else what was happening who I didn’t think would tell anyone because I desperately needed support but did not want to burn any bridges 

A few days later my rapist called me and said someone was spreading a rumor about him raping someone. Apparently he didn’t have a name but because he had raped me he suspected it was me. My friend admitted to telling someone(without my name attached) and it somehow got spread around. 

At this point I’m at a loss of what to do. I know some people reading this might think it’s silly that I’m panicked but I really didn’t want any of our friends to know about this. He has a lot of authority and if anyone found out it was me that this happened to I would face a lot of backlash.

But I'm looking to try it now because I need to try anything to boost my attractiveness. I just ordered a D&amp;G and Emporio Armani shirt online. Do you think this will actually matter? Eg. In online dating or a nightclub? If so which brands should I try that would be most impressive?

I have no money of my own, and I am living with him until we get enough income to allow me to move out.

My stepfather has been ""hiding out"" in his bedroom or avoiding being home altogether, and talking to him during this meltdown seems impossible. I confronted my mother about it, trying to get her to talk to him or at least admit that she set him off. She basically refused.

Every time I try and get a free tutor through my state, I get started and I fall behind really fast (I last about 2 months with a tutor).

I have depression and anxiety, money is constantly an issue and I'm trying to get higher paying jobs but they all require a GED.  If I could just have one job and make enough with that I would be fine, I could relax and focus better on studying.

I need to pick up a second job again and I'll  have to be working 7 days again just to make enough for basic bills and paying off debt. 

I'm always so exhausted I can't focus cause I have little time for sleeping and when I do it's poor sleep because I'm so anxious I wake multiple times, have nightmares/weird dreams.

I'm so, so frustrated. I get overwhelmed so easily, I dont know how to balance learning, work, eating/sleeping, gym and a social life while not spiraling down into depression even more.

895,"My post was removed from r/legal advice and was told to post over here instead. 

I left my position at an insurance agent’s office and I reported her to the company compliance hotline. Honestly, the compliance/ethical issues were a big reason I left, but what sent me over the edge was when she told me (a bi woman) that she wouldn’t ever want to hire a gay person. I don’t have any proof of that though (besides an email saying I was taking it out of context). 

She had me make non-approved marketing materials (which I have pictures of), edit signed documents in MS paint (on company computers), and I watched her pre-notarized a bank loan before sending it to the customer with instructions for how to make it look like they sent it from the office. 

She had us rate people at the wrong garaging address all the time (and often also gave them renters policies at the correct address). I already reported it to the company hotline now that I’m gone. We also put “sign here” stickers on the documents that customers had to sign (I have pictures of the documents and a letter to the customer asking them to remove the stickers before they send the docs back). 

She would often tell people she would call them right back and purposefully not do so. I can’t prove that and I don’t think it’s illegal, but she did a lot of unethical things and that’s why I want to blow the whistle. I don’t think that she’s competent to handle insurance tbqh and she would regularly pay her employees a day late. Generally trash. But! I do want to know if anyone has any idea how severe of trouble she may be in or if I need to lawyer up or contact the DOI?

He loves to golf every weekend with his friends. He used to be in a boy band in the 1930’s and he played the drums. Even at 82 he stands an imposing 6ft. He has this dignified southern Tennessee accent. When he speaks he sounds like he would be in an old time-y movie. Seeing him lie there, not able to move is killing me. His whole left side of his body is numb and he can barely speak. They say his brain is bleeding and they can’t stop it. The medicine he’s on prevents clots.

906,"Without going into details, the job offer should not come as a surprise to anyone in upper management. This is a situation that they definitely should have anticipated.

I'm in an hourly/non-contract position, and in an at-will employment state.

My perspective on the situation: my current company has its flaws of course, but overall, they have been good to me. Prior to this, I was not actively seeking other opportunities. However, when approached by a different company, I willingly entertained a conversation with them. I figured that if they could offer me something better, it would be in my best interest to take it. I'm getting by on my current income, but I'm not able to put money into a retirement account or into savings. There just isn't enough left over after I pay bills.

And that's what happened - the other company made a really good offer. Nothing is on paper yet, but if everything they have offered is put on paper, I absolutely will be accepting it. This will put me in a much better position financially, and I don't feel guilty about it. I have to look out for myself.

I just don't want to burn any bridges or inadvertently say something that would create an issue. As I said, my current company has been generally good to me. I want to leave on a good note.

\- I would love to meet up at some point (and wish that I wasn't as shy and introverted at work in school so that we \*could\* have been closer there)

908,"20M here and I started dating this girl since the past 6 months.

Let me give you a quick rundown about my body, if you click on my profile, you'll see on r/progress pics  how my body looks currently. 

Since childhood I was a fat child, I had this addiction to food and I ate it until I choked on it and this went on for years. Later on I lost the weight.

When I met my girlfriend for the first time back in July, I was hefty since I was on a ""bulk"" and didn't have a small waist or proper definition. Back then she used to taunt me saying that her EX used to have abs, and also her past guys, since then the constant taunts and comparisons crushed me, but when I took a look at her ex's pics, those guys were skinny and just had abs, no chest, no big shoulders....nothing....... Just a skinny guy with visible abs which kinda pissed me off because I'm a big guy and the only thing I lack is abs. Then for 2 months I kept working my ass off for the abs and use it for fuel my workouts but I didn't get a wash board abs, the diet and the strain was too much so I started to bulk again since I lost quite a lot of muscle during the cut.

For the second thing, my GF cheated on me in the past (no sex just sexting) with a skinny guy, who had no abs lol. I used to think the dude must be having a big dick but the dick pic says otherwise.

I just can't understand, I am in much better shape than them, have a much bigger dick but why still do that to me??..... What did I lack????

I keep asking this everyday and I use the guys pictures in front of me while i workout, it fuels my workouts and I go in hard and rough but I end up in a bad mood for the rest of the day. I keep thinking ""what did I lack, what did I lack?"" While working out but in the end, I get really drained.

I told my GF about this and she told me that this is not healthly and I am much better than those guys, that she was just pulling my leg.

I even told my mom about it and she was pretty concerned since I always had anger issues and adding this is putting petrol in the fire.

I don't need constant validation, I just need appreciation which she messed it up for me, now when she compliments me, I think it's just because she feels sorry for me. Idk what I should do, I shouldn't feel this way about myself. I need help.",17Jan2020,1

910,"My roommate is a really friendly guy but not very considerate of his actions and how they affect me in our dorm space.

He bashes snooze over and over and over. He wakes up at 8 on the 8:30 days and 9 on the 10:30 days essentially after bashing it over and over.

I told him can you change it because it wakes me up and he was like ""oh shoot my bad yeah I got you"" but what he did was change the snooze duration to 30 min instead of 10 so it still goes off over and over... not sure he understood what I meant.

920," 

I’ve been in a long-distance relationship for nearly a year now, i’m in my late twenties (female) and my significant other (male) is a year older than i am. We live about 10 hours away from one another (driving wise), and are in the same time zone. We had known one another for over 10 years, however, we kind of lost touch when we started college.

We met again when i visited his city with my family at the end of 2017. Since then, we both knew we were into one another. I’d never felt that attracted to anyone, and he felt the same (or so he said). He was dealing with some personal things then and i was there for him as a friend through those times. We got to know one another again. We would talk 4-5 hours everyday while juggling my graduate degree and life. He was switching career paths and it was giving him a lot of anxiety, he felt behind in his life and i wanted to be there to support him through it. It was organic and just felt right. He would always check up on me and be there to support me through my worries about assignments and thesis and problems in life. It was amazing, the world to me was a magical place, we would constantly update each other about our days, activities, whathaveyou .

Then this fall came, and  he went back to college while I was in the midst of writing my final research paper that i’ve worked on for two years. i still made time for him, but i felt that the effort was lacking from his end. I understand that professional school gives him a lot of anxiety since he has dropped out in the past and has dealt with bad experiences in relation to school, but I started to feel that maybe he didn’t want this anymore. I voiced my concerns, that people in relationships should be in touch everyday, even if it’s for just 10-15 mins. The issue is that when we talk over the phone, the conversation is endless and goes on for two hours. He said he cant talk for two hours everyday. I get that, and  it’s also not feasible on my end to spend that much time on the phone. We both arent great at texting, and our conversations are very dry on texts. I didn’t know how else to remain in touch. I told him, i shouldn’t be the one always trying to reach you and his reply was that he doesn’t wanna bother me when i’m busy researching and at the culminating part of my degree. He said i can call him whenever but he won’t bother me. I kept telling him it’s not bothering me, but it didn’t make sense to him as he thinks he might ruin my career by wasting my time. I think his viewpoint is based on his own bad experiences with college so i was trying to be understanding.

In the midst of all this, i felt distant from him so i decided to take a break for a week and flew down to spend time with him. It was great, despite one argument. We were able to reconnect on many levels. Things were great for two months after meeting. However, now i feel that this relationship is one sided again and I deserve some happiness too. I cant keep trying to nurture someone without having even half of it reciprocated back. I told him i wanna end things (i feel hurt and unappreciated) but he broke down and told me he wants to die. He told me he wants to marry me but i am unhappy with how things are between us. He doesn’t think its normal to communicate everyday, and i strongly disagree with that. I just wish he would understand. I think i wanna be friends at this point as our communication as of now is of that nature. The last time he told me he loved me was two weeks ago, he hasn’t showed any affection since then. I have stopped calling him completely for the past week, then he messaged me yesterday. I am very confused and hurt. I can’t even focus of my academics. Please tell me what to do.

Fyi, this is our first relationship and he suffers from bipolar personality disorder.

TL;DR i am unsure of whether i wanna continue with this or not. i love him but i am unhappy with how things have been. **What is the best way to proceed in this instance? I am very confused and mentally exhausted. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!**",17Jan2020,1

924,"So, my great grandmother just passed away and I'm debating on going to the funeral. Me personally, I'm on the fence about going. It would be nice to see some family that I haven't seen in a while; however there will be other family members there that I would like to avoid. Also, money is kind of tight right now. When it comes to closure however, I mentally accepted her death when her health started declining so I, myself, am doing fine emotionally.

I live about a two hour flight and a 90 minute car ride away from where the funeral is taking place I'd rather not rent a car due to lack of funds. I asked my mom if she could pick me up from and take me back to the airport if I flew in. She said she could pick me up, but couldn't take me back and suggested I ask my grandmother, the daughter of the deceased, to drive me an hour and a half back to the airport the day after the funeral.

Personally, I feel kind of wierd about asking. I feel like her mother just passed away and she's probably having a hard time right now and is busy handling her mother's affairs. I don't really want to be asking favors like that of her at the moment even though I know she would say yes if I asked. 

My grandmother already said that it's okay if I cannot make it, that my great grandmother would understand.

What should I do?

TD;DR: Should I ask my grieving grandmother to drive me an hour and a half back to the airport the day after her mother's funeral?",17Jan2020,1
925,"Ok so first of I’ll say I’m 20 and have been doing these things since I can remember. Idk what’s wrong with me but Im addicted to biting my nails, biting the insides of my lips, picking at my skin anywhere on my body if there are any bumps or scabs and I also have Tourette’s and anxiety that I can control pretty well so most people never notice. I’ve had good self control except when it comes to these habits I do not like these habits and even scarred parts on my body and lips from just picking and biting for so long. I do know that stress can cause this and my life is very stressful so I always blamed it on that but I’m starting to think maybe I have deeper problems because it seems my brains dosnt work like other peoples and I live in my thought idk if that’s from lack of friends or maybe a mental problem idk.

927,"TLDR: My math teacher has been bullying me and other students for a long time- and jumps to conclusions/won't mind his own damn business.

Cast: Me 14F, Math teacher (T), Friend 14M (F)

So my math teacher is known for being extremely rude to his students, going so far as to make his students cry. To give some context, I've had a horrible week. I haven't been able to get much sleep due to a recurring flashback/nightmare of my great grandfather dying in front of me. Because of this, I wasn't able to get my last two homework assignments turned in.

I arrived to class today extremely tired, but functioning nonetheless. T comes around and is looking at all our math assignments. He gets to me and this conversation occurs.

T: ""No homework again? Not surprised.""

Me: ""Sorry, I didn't have enough time. I promise I'll have my late work in by Monday.""

T: ""Did you turn in Wednesday's assignment?""

Me: ""Yes I did.""

T: ""No you didn't.""

Me: ""I'm pretty sure I did.""

T: ""Don't lie. It says here you didn't."" (He says this VERY aggressively and points to his iPad.)

Me: ""Oh... I didn't realize. I'll get that one in too."" (By the way I checked when I got home and I DID turn it in.)

T: ""You are getting lazy. Why are you just not doing them anymore? You need to pay attention.""

Me: ""Okay... sorry?""

Teacher walks away.

After we finished our work for the day, I asked if I could get a start on a test that I had been absent for. He agreed and gave me the test, as well as telling me I could use my notes. I quickly breezed through the first part before T screams in my ear ""HEY NO USING CALCULATORS ON THE TEST!"" This made me jump massively. He then snapped at me for using one, even though I had been gone and had no clue I couldn't use it (on 99% of our other tests we could).

After a few more classes I headed to lunch, happy to have a break. I explained the whole situation to my friend, and I told him basically that the teacher was being extremely rude, and that I didn't want to finish test that day because I knew he would yell at me again. After around 6-7 minutes, T comes up to me.

T: ""You didn't finish your test.""

Me: ""I know, but I'm starving and I planned on going up to your room to finish after I eat.""

T: ""I'm not going to be in my room so just take your test. And put it in the basket when you finish.""

Me: ""Oh... okay.""

I then go and get in line for food, and after I get my food and head back to my table. He called me over to where he was standing.

T: ""I know you are upset and mad about the homework.""

Me: \*Nods\*

T: ""And the test.""

Me: \*Says nothing\*

T: ""I know you aren't okay are you?"" (He said this in a VERY smart-ass tone, not kindly as it may seem. Its hard to convey tone over Reddit.)

Me: ""I'm fine.""

I was pissed at this point that he just wouldn't leave me alone, even during my only break. I started tearing up while sitting and eating (I angry cry. I know, real intimidating). He left me alone for the rest of the day.

I'm afraid he is going to tell me to stay after class on Monday, so I asked a friend to stay with me if he does. I don't want to be alone with him. 

I'm also afraid he will email my parents and lie about whats happening. What do I do?",17Jan2020,1
928,"About a year ago, my boyfriend (who we'll call P) of 3 years and I broke up. I (21F) realize this isn't that long of a time span, but we were high school sweethearts, had been together for most of college, and were best friends long before we dated. Right after we broke up, he got together with a close friend of mine, W. P and W have have been dating a little over a year now, and they moved in together. When I found out months later from a mutual friend they were dating, I was naturally angry and hurt, especially because I feel like W broke the ""girl code,"" especially by not giving any warning. I don't care if P and W date, I'm glad they're happy, but I also don't really want anything to do with either of them. 

Today,  W messaged me with random pictures from us in high school, and she eventually confessed to me that she didn't know how to tell me, and that she wouldn't mind re-connecting. Here's where the advice comes in. I still feel a little hurt by W, but I'm also in a place right now where I don't have many friends at all, and maybe this was ""meant to be."" So should I put aside my pride and re-connect, or completely cut her out, like I have been for the last year? P, W, and I all live in the same town, but I could definitely avoid seeing her if I wanted.

TLDR: Ex's girlfriend wants to be friends with me again, I don't know if I should.",17Jan2020,1
929,"I can sense that I am falling into a depression. I am normally a person that loves going out with friends, but lately I find myself turning down any and all invitations to go out even though I then come home just to be sad and think that I don’t have friends or anyone who cares about me. I have been going through a breakup that I can’t seem to get over for months and months now (way too long) and I think this is probably contributing to my depression. My self confidence has been shot to shit, so I don’t even want to go out on dates because I feel like I’m not worthy of anyone’s attention. I know all of this is in my head, but how I can I get out of my head and into reality???!",17Jan2020,1
930,"I am pretty fed up with mind games and hints. I do physics, computer science, Calculus, programming and I have never not understood something as much as I don't texting women. I girl text me in the middle of fucking summer telling me she likes me. Never spoke to me in person not once but apparently was in my class. This is after I moved HOME for the holidays.

Girls see I'm fucking shy and oblivious yet indirectly flirt with me by asking me if I'd date them instead of just being straight and making things the other way around. Get mad at me and instead of saying why they drop a vague message saying they're angry. They will NEVER text me first but when I ""seen"" a one word reply they get mad.

The more I try the more bullshit this whole pursuit of a relationship seems. I can tell from experience I'll just get better at it the more I try but is it all like this? Should going after a girl feel like legit homework or a full-time job? 

I guess what I'm asking for is: when women play game is it ok to call them out on this bullshit? Because I only like to play games that are _actually_ fun.",17Jan2020,1
931,"Thanks for taking the time to cllick on this post. 

I'm a 21 y/o living with a parent currently, with no income or education past High School. I am currently in the process of getting a Driver's License, having failed my first test a few weeks ago. A family friend offered me a well-paying job, on the condition that I had a license. It may not work out, if that happens to be the case, and a lot of problems it would have solved are potential problems again. Saving for a car, getting out on my own, etc.

I have not worked in a few years, as I have been a caregiver for an elderly family member. I have applied for jobs here and there, but the pay I'd (understandably) be getting is among some of the lowest wages the States offer. It seems difficult to do anything independently earning so little. 

My reason for posting: I'm unsure of what to plan on doing. I'm currently just waiting to retake my driving test. However, I want to have some semblance of a plan afterwards. Moving to a different state with my other parent is an option. It would be better for me in general, as well as offer a higher minimum wage. The cost of living is a downside, and I'm unsure of how to approach that dilemma. Stay put, earn less with a lower cost of living or move, earn more with a higher cost. 

Going back to school is certainly an option, there are a few things I could see myself doing, but I think I should get on my feet a little more before doing so. Should I just focus on finding any job that pays? I figure any money in my pocket is better than none, though it severely lengthens the process. 

I'm trying to take things as they come, but I am a habitual overthinker. I felt posting here would help me get a different perspective or give me an idea of what to do. I appreciate any responses you may have to give me, and welcome any clarifying questions should you feel the need to ask them. Have a great day.",17Jan2020,1
932,"I’m in high school so it isn’t really that deep but I’m obviously rampant with emotions at this point in my life. It’s a minute detail but it could affect the factors that you base your decision on. 

The story goes like this:
My best friend is a very honest person. She really doesn’t care who hears what and how they react. Not that it’s necessarily a bad thing but it can get annoying at times.

Her candor comes with specific actions that could annoy a person not accustomed to them.

An certain instance of that would be when she invites herself over to my house without informing me. Not that I mind it, but sometimes I have to drop other plans for her.

Over time, the irritation builds up because I, as an emotional teen, have no good way to express my feelings; hence why I’m pouring everything out into a Reddit post.

This past Monday, I had plans to hang out with said best friend. These were plans that I had made with her last Friday. Plans that required me to get my parents to sign a note just so I could ride the bus with her.

The plan was for me to go over to her job and just chill while she worked. Something that she’s done to me before.

The issue with my version of the plan is that the note requires an administrator signature, which I managed to obtain from my principal. I tried to get this signature from one of my vice principals but she said that my friend needed a note, which I had asked her to get just in case. She didn’t have the note, and she didn’t answer when I tried to text her about it.

School had ended and I tried to find her to get on the bus, to which she called me saying that she “had to go to work early” and that she wanted to take a rain check. Thus begun my journey home, tipping me to my breaking point. 

I ended up shredding the note and just promised myself to not plan anything with her.

She’s done this before, changing the schedule last minute because she doesn’t feel like doing something.

Am I in the right for being mad? Or am I just overreacting?",17Jan2020,1
933,"I promise I tried to make this as short as possible but there's a lot in my head and I tend to ramble. General advice or for the specific situation I mention at the end would be so appreciated.

I graduated college in May and moved to a new city in August for a job. My senior year was hell due to depression that I've been dealing with for about 6 years now and general life issues and I almost didn't graduate but I did. I didn't do a good job at making friends in college due to again being very depressed at the beginning of freshman year and not establishing a friend group, or maybe that's me making excuses for myself, but in any case I had lots of acquaintances but overall felt very lonely and disappointed in myself at the end of my college career.

I've been in this city for about 5 months now and nothing has changed (my own fault). My apartment is finally just barely fully furnished and is usually a mess because the task of furnishing and maintaining an apartment by myself is too much. Getting out of bed and dressed and going to work takes all of my energy most days. I get home and... lay lethargically on the couch, I guess? I honestly don't even fucking know because I don't do anything and I still manage to stay up way too late every night.

So that's the general gist. A specific situation I'm dealing with is that I met a boy about two months ago and we'd been hanging out a few times a week, I really liked him and he seemed to really like me. He was usually the one to reach out to talk or ask me out so once we'd both been back in town for a while after getting back from the holidays and he hadn't asked to hang out, I asked him out. He said he was busy, how about later, wouldn't reply for a while, just very different to how he was acting before. Finally yesterday I hadn't seen him in almost a month and he hadn't replied for several days so I messaged something to the effect of ""okay, well hope you're well and nice meeting you"" and he apologized and explained that work and life had gotten much busier in the past couple of weeks and that he was not ready for a relationship, which is what I was anticipating at this point.

I thought that I had grown enough as a person or learned enough about myself and my mental struggles over the past several years that I could handle this tactfully and I almost did. I've been drinking a lot to cope since moving here and this night was no different and I ended up saying something extremely immature and petty and honestly just fucking stupid (a petty insult + something about how well fine then, he wasn't important to me either anyway! is the overview) I think because I was drunk and hurting a lot and wanted to try to hurt him even though that's a shitty terrible thing to do and he was being completely reasonable.

I want to apologize but 1) he might understandably have my number blocked and 2) I don't know if that's the right thing to do. I'm not trying to reconnect because he was clear he was too busy anyway, I don't think he should forgive me because I acted like an absolute dick and I don't forgive me, and I wouldn't try to contact him beyond sending this apology and leaving it at that. I don't know if he cares whether or not I apologize and it's not effectively going to change anything, I suppose. I'm just so, so disgusted and ashamed with myself and want to tell him I'm sorry, you didn't at all deserve that kind of treatment.

I guess I want to know, would it be selfish or wrong of me to try to send an apology? But also, I don't want him to forgive me, I don't think he should and I don't think he will, but how do I forgive myself? Do I deserve to? I'm honestly so disappointed and ashamed in myself. I regretted what I said immediately and don't even want to look in the mirror. I don't want to use mental health struggles, family/work/life struggles and stress, the drunkenness etc as excuses because it's absolutely 100% my own fault I acted the way I did, but I know they were contributing factors. I dumped out the vodka I had in my freezer when I got home today and I don't want to drink, indefinitely, because I don't think I would've acted the way I did if I'd been sober- I'd have been sad, sure, maybe my response still wouldn't have been the most perfect or mature thing in the world, but I would still feel so much better about myself if I hadn't acted so shitty and I wouldn't have acted so shitty if I wasn't in the middle of a sad drunk night. I guess part of me thinks the obvious solution is to try to be better (stop fucking drinking every night for one). But I just feel lower than I have in a very, very long time and like I don't even deserve to forgive myself let alone to ever try to be with anyone again if this is how I handle things. I don't know what to do.

As an aside, I'm sure some great advice would be ""go the fuck to therapy"" but I can't seem to find anywhere near me for less than $250 a session or that my insurance will help with at all, but I'm working on it.

Thank you if you read this, even if you just want to tell me what an obvious mess and an asshole I am and to be better that would be appreciated.",17Jan2020,1
