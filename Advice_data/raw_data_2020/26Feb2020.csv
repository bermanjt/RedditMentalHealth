0,"Before story starts. Let me get this straight. I have a tendency to overthink things when it comes to how others feel.

So I [19M] have been really cool with this girl for a while. We met in highschool, and she was my high school crush. Anyways for the past couple years. I been cool about things even though I have been hiding these massive feelings for her. Anyways. There have been periods of times throughout our relationship (as friends) where she just doesn‚Äôt respond to texts or whatever. It isn‚Äôt a huge thing for me with anybody, but has like got me in a state of thinking I messed up and we just eventually stop talking then she randomly pops up and I‚Äôm happy again. Then she tells me what happened and it‚Äôs usually just her going through stuff. Basically me just overthinking things and beating myself up thinking I fucked up our relationship. (I don‚Äôt tell her this btw. It‚Äôs all in my head)

Anyways we graduate, end up going our separate ways while still keeping touch occasionally, and just recently last month. She opens up to me about how she‚Äôs had the biggest crush on me, this that and the other so old feelings arise, but more intense. Anyways we start getting back on talking terms, but with a little more flirting and there‚Äôs this thought in my head that I shouldn‚Äôt take things too fast because she‚Äôs atm in a whole nother state having her fun (she tells me this) and basically I don‚Äôt wanna commit to this just yet, but my thoughts and my actions speak otherwise. Anyways you know. We‚Äôve been getting into much deeper talks past few weeks and all this through text because we‚Äôre both usually too busy to call (at least I have been lol) and that‚Äôs been our dynamic since we‚Äôve exchanged numbers. We usually communicate through text or in person. Anyways yeah as of last week. We‚Äôve started FaceTiming each other, and our first actual talk in almost a year went very well. The vibe was good, she was into it, I was into it and it was pretty great.
Then the next few days you know she‚Äôs texting me first which is a rarity, addressing me like I‚Äôm her boyfriend, and she just seemed so engaged with me that had me believe things would and should work as I‚Äôve thought in my head for the longest time except we‚Äôre over text and she won‚Äôt be back here until April for her spring break and may when she goes on her little break when we‚Äôve planned to meet up. Anyways the last time we talked (Saturday night into Sunday morning) was not a good vibe at all. I understand that yeah it was late night, and we were both tired. But it seemed from the get go that she was not in the mood to talk, and my dumbass thought it was a good idea to force a conversation with her. Like I felt so uncomfortable before even going to sleep because I felt like I might‚Äôve ruined my chance. Like I said. Maybe she was just tired and wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk, but did so because of me, but soon as she said she was ready to go to sleep. Hung up and didn‚Äôt say good bye or anything which also kind of messed me up. Since then I sent her 1 text saying ‚ÄúYou cool?‚Äù And haven‚Äôt got a response or nothing. 

I don‚Äôt want opinions on my situation. I just want to figure out how to stop things like this fucking with me because anything could be going on, but because of my POV of our last call session. I believe the reason she just went radio silent was because of me, and maybe not an outside situation I have no clue of, and it has been messing with me for a while to the point I‚Äôm not feeling normal or happy as of late.  I‚Äôm going to assume she‚Äôll pop up whenever the time‚Äôs right because I know her. If she truly disliked me. She would‚Äôve let me know by now

How can I get this girl out of my head because I haven‚Äôt been able to focus on anything the past few days? I just got back in rhythm for school due to skipping my first semester, but now I can‚Äôt even focus in any of those classes due to this girl being on my mind.",26Feb2020,1
1,Ok so I work with this girl who when she feels some type of way will ignore me and keep things short with me and I never know what I‚Äôve done . Then she comes back and want to be friends all of a sudden and act like she wasn‚Äôt giving me silent treatments. Embarrassingly when she is nice to me again I forgive her and we go back to being buddy buddy . But now she‚Äôs doing it again and I don‚Äôt want to be nice anymore but I work with her . Btw I never know what I‚Äôve done wrong and why I‚Äôm getting these treatments. So I need advice on how to keep a distance and keep it professional at work but not talk to this girl or joke around with her anymore . We have a great work relationship we make each other laugh a lot but she‚Äôs something else. She says all the time that she‚Äôs a bitch but I just shrug it off because you know a lot of people call them selves mean things not meaning it but I think she was telling me all along üòï so what now ?,26Feb2020,1
2,"Growing up in this age wasn't easy, at least it wasn't easy for me. Hi my name is John. I'm a 15 year old that lives in NYC. When I started school, specifically around 1st grade, I had a few friends. I don't really remember but I think I was shy but extroverted at the same time. I had a birthday party when I was 7. I invited everyone in my class, around 30 kids. No one came. I didn't take it hard and moved on pretty quick. Fast forward a few years, we're in 5th Grade. It was the first time I felt sadness. I was graduating elementary school, at this point I thought I'd be leaving my ""friends"". I cried for a few weeks and got over it like nothing. I entered Middle school, 2015. I struggled making friends because I was short for my age and had a high pitched voice. So I liked a girl, I thought she liked me so I told her. I got bullied and tormented. I was pushed, punched, spit on, humiliated and mentally destroyed. I cried every single day for almost half that school year. It wasn't because the girl had rejected me, it was because of the bullying. I found myself dealing with depression, I isolated myself. Got very low grades and I just sucked at life. In 7th grade, things kinda got better, I made by first REAL friend. Let's call him Harry. Him and I had many common interests. We watched the same shows and liked spending our free time editing videos. (Fan Made Trailers and stuff). Heading into 8th grade I found my peaceful space. I was beginning to feel happy again, Fortnite had been released so I had some close friends I'd made play with me. Those were some great memories. I graduated middle school feeling sad, but knowing that I'd been through a lot, so I moved on. 2018, now I'm in 9th grade. New life, new friends, same old me. I wasn't picked on much because everyone was more mature. I was for once happy. I got pretty decent grades, saw movies like Avengers Endgame with my new friends and I had feelings for another girl. I know, I was only 14 at this point. But my excuse is hormones üòÇ. Her and I got to know each other pretty well. Or that's just the way I read the situation, so I asked her for her number, and that's the final conversation we ever had. I'm in 10th now, I feel like I've gotten over her. I honestly don't know. I'm now starting to question the meaning of life because, I have no one at all that I can talk to. I don't trust even my parents because they are very stubborn and closed minded. So here we go again. (At this point I'm talking in present time). There's another girl. I don't really know her, but we have a few classes together and I think she's cute. The feelings from my past just come back and break me down. I am the most depressed I've ever been in my life, its not the fear of her not wanting to talk to me, it's just something I can't describe. I cry for no reason now, when my mom does things like move stuff from my room and opens the window shades, I just break down. I know I left A LOT of information out so idk if my story makes any sense, but I just need life advice. Thanks if you read all of this. Im a terrible person, I'm bullying people now and I'm a fake friend. I've become the one thing that I feared the most.",26Feb2020,1
4,"Hiya! Hope people are having a nice day :)

Context: I'm a 17 year old college student, and I'm autistic. This mostly affects my executive dysfunction, which results in me running out of time during tests. It also means I have a really bad time with doing homework. In addition to this, I have several mental health problems (generalised and social anxiety, and depression.) These also impact my life and my executive function negatively.

Now for the current problem: my mentor. She's supposed to have appointments with me every week for an hour, where we discuss how things are going for me and how any problems I have can be solved. This is meant to include mental health and other happenings in my life, like normal teenage topics, but her only focus has always been homework and revision.

However, I haven't had an actual appointment with her since November. I show up on time and in the right place for the meetings, because her main office is also the designated room for SEN students, and sit directly across from her. I've asked her several times why we haven't had an appointment in months, but have yet to get a response beyond ""I'll put you on my schedule"" (she hasn't.)

This wouldn't be so much of an issue if she didn't take every opportunity outside of this to torment me and my friends. She's banned physical contact (not just PDA, which I understand, but also stuff like high fives), swearing (this is COLLEGE) and even talking outside of break and lunchtime, saying that the room is for students doing work. (Except these rules doesn't apply to a large group of the students who use the room, they can do what they want.)

It is not just for working. It is meant to be an all-purpose space for any student, with or without special educational needs, to make friends, do homework, or just sit. She is the one who first said this, and she's worked in the department for the longest, and yet if any student is talking she will come up to them and ask them if they have work to do. If they say no, she will keep probing them. She will physically search their bag for work they can do. Like, she has genuinely taken my bag, opened it up, and gone through EVERYTHING in there. And if you do have something you haven't done, she will make you move from your seat to a different chair and watch you do the work to make sure you're not going off-task. This is one of the top colleges in the country, and it is meant to value students' independence. So being put in what is basically a high-school detention? Less than ideal.
If you haven't got any work left to do, you will sit quietly. Maybe engage with the group who don't have to follow the rules. But if you speak to someone who's Doing Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è you will be told off. Repeatedly. To the point where my friend has been completely kicked out except for breaktimes and lunchtimes. (Which is when you are allowed to talk, without swearing, vulgarity, or a volume above bored small talk.) A lot of us have nowhere to go other than this room, whether due to sensory issues with the loud Hall or just a lack of spaces around college, so we don't really have a choice but to follow these rules.

I don't think she realises what she's turned the room into. She has our best interests (at least as far as homework and revision goes) at heart, so I'm hoping I can talk to her one-to-one at some point to bring up the concerns I have about the use of the room and the rules' effect on mine and my friends' mental health (PLEASE JUST LET US TALK DAMMIT! STOPPING THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST TROUBLE WITH SOCIAL INTERACTION FROM BEING ALLOWED TO HAVE SOCIAL INTERACTION IS DUMB AS FUCK!!!!) and she'll let up on the rules a little bit. Hopefully. Maybe. 

Here's where I need advice. How do I explain this to her in a way that gets my opinion across without being disrespectful or rude? This issue has been on my mind for a long time, and as a result I am very emotional about it- unless I have it scripted out I will cry and/or yell at her- and then she'll just refuse to listen to me and quite possibly get angry back, maybe even resulting in me getting banned from the room. How do I confront her politely, and what's the best way to ensure that I get listened to? I'm not the only one in the room with these concerns, if that helps.

Thanks in advance for the help! :3",26Feb2020,1
5,"Until a few hours ago, I was pretty convinced I wouldn't ever find myself in the position to ask on this subreddit for advice on which steps to take after falling for a scam.. but here we are. I've been reading a lot of the posts on this subreddit and the advice that has been given, I hope you guys can also provide me with some advice and insights. I'm sorry for the long rant, I am still in state of.. shock I guess, forgive me if things are unclear.

I've been looking for an apartment for myself for a few months, signed up for a couple of sites and have been responding to a lot of advertisements hoping something would work out. It has been a terribly frustrating time, the responses were very sparse, bit eventually I was contacted via email by this guy from Sweden (I am from the Netherlands), claiming he's looking for a more permanent tenant for his second apartment, since he and his wife are no longer using it and want to establish some income through it. They had been renting it out through AirBnB, so it was fully furnished, it had some very nice ratings online.. everything was looking fine! We had been mailing back and forth, I was sent the draft of the contract, he sent me a picture of his passport, I didn't have a single doubt in my mind that there was anything wrong, no alarm bells were going of during any of this. Since he lived in Sweden, he couldn't show me the apartment, but offered to put the apartment up on AirBnB again, so I could book it for a month, and if I liked the apartment we could sign the final contract and settle everything. I made the reservation, paid the stay for a month and a deposit of 1600 euros (this amount was previously already mentioned in his emails). 

You guys.. after this long ass search for an apartment, I was just over the moon.. I texted everyone I knew, I brought cake into work to celebrate, walked by the apartment to see the neighborhood. Literally overjoyed.

This morning, after not having had contact for a few weeks, I mailed him asking about the AirBnB broker who should provide me with the key, should I get into contact with him? Was everything still working out as we had plannen? After not getting a response for just a few hours I started to feel anxious, now, nearly 12 hours later, I see all the red flags I've missed and a dear friend of mine also got suspicious and started digging. Looks like it's a textbook example of an AirBnB scam, I'm not the first who has fallen for this, I wanted to share with you the red flags I've missed, hoping it might prevent someone from falling for this, also I wanted to ask if you might have other things to be aware of during a house hunt, since mine will be up to speed again soon.

The red flags in my case:
- Paying upfront without having seen the apartment, it sounds so logical in hindsight.. 
- I got send a link to the AirBnB site, now that I have opened it again, it was not the official site, but a very realistic looking copy of the site. The site was named Airbnb-rental.com.. also, when searching the apartment on the official site it would never come up, I always had to use the sent link
- It was not possible to pay through iDeal or a credit card directly to the site, I got sent a payment request, I had to transfer the money myself to a bank account in Spain, the account was also in name of an individual instead of the company.
- Last but not least, this person didn't contact me via any website I was signed up to, he mailed me directly. I have responded to hundreds of ads all over the web, which is why it didn't necessarily surprised me that the apartment didn't look familiar at all.. at this point I don't know where exactly he plucked my email adres from, but I am convinced I have not seen an ad for this apartment and thus have not responded to it on a site.

If there are any other red flags to you please let me know, other tips are also welcome. I mentioned how I wanted to create some awareness for this scam, hopefully it can prevent at least someone from falling for it like I did. I will walk by the police station tomorrow and file a report on this, I have yet to dive into the research on other steps I could take, please let me know if you have any experience with this!

Thanks for reading all of this!",26Feb2020,1
6,Hi. I'm going to get straight to the point. My family and I have recently move in to a new home. It is located by a public park that goes in to a forest. Due to this we get a lot of raccoons. We have called animal service multiple times. They have said they can't do anything about. We have talked to the old owner about the problem . He said that since he had a dog they would stay away and told us to look in to getting a dog.  For certain reason we can not have one in our home. Does anyone know if cats will have the same affect? If so is there a specific breed we have to get and how old does the cat have to be?,26Feb2020,1
7,"For the past week I‚Äôve mostly been sleeping all day, like around 12-15 hours a day. I‚Äôm usually more sleepy when it‚Äôs my period but it‚Äôs been over for a few days now and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. It impedes me doing work around the house, taking my medicine, and being almost late for work a couple of times. I just lose the whole day and it‚Äôs making me upset and sad.

I do have depression and anxiety but nothing much has changed, I‚Äôve only accidentally missed one day in like the past two months of my anti depressant medication. Nothing new has changed really, but I‚Äôve been working evenings more, from like 5-10.

8,"I (20) am an exchange student in Spain (Las Palmas) and I really do not know what to do. I made friends in the first two weeks but like every other, I couldn't click with anyone except one. I am not a very social person but I am trying to be more open to new things. I am shy at first but when I get comfortable around people I like, you cannot stop me. I am thinking that people here are not like me in terms of humor, music, etc. so I just do not put effort to meet them because I know that we are not so compatible. For that reason, even if I am friends with them, I won't feel comfortable after all. I am currently friends with a french girl and we are so similar so it is good for now, but I think that we can expand our friend cycle. The other erasmus students are all the same like they all wanna party all the time and drink or smoke etc. At some point, it gets really overwhelming to me because I really don't like partying with people I do not know. I know it will not make me feel the same as I am with my friends. I also participated in events for exchange students but no one seem interesting to me, I hate myself for that. I am thinking about participating regular events like here there is vegeuta night for exchange students but on the other hand I think that I will meet some people, maybe I will have a good night but their friendship will be just for the night. So, it seems really pointless at some point. I know I cannot know what will happen but it is just my gut. I am here for only 1 months now and I have 4 months ahead. I think I will have friend cycle sometime but I do not know how or when. It feels like one day I will wake up and here they are. Like I am waiting for the impossible. So, do you have any advice for meeting new people when studying abroad? I feel like everybody will say ''JUST GO AND MEET THEM, TRY TO TALK TO EVERYBODY!'' It is not that easy for me, I have anxiety dude, in my head a voice tells me that people think I am weird and they are making fun of me, so please be reasonable.Also it is my first time getting out of my home and leave my parents and start to live by myself. I feel really desperate, even thinking about coming back. I know that it is a chance to take care of myself or discover new things and take time for myself, but also it is good to have a good time with good friends, right?",26Feb2020,1
9,"So I'm in town after 20 years (I'm 29/m) and never having talked to my grandmother. She been hospitalized and VERY sick for 3 months, but is now in rehab. She's expected to be amother year before she can come home. My mother has been taking ""care"" of her house. I came out here one day to see the house and it's deplorable! Dishes and trash everywhere, dog shit everywhere. The dogs nails so long they can't walk. I trimmed the one yorkies hair, and probably took off a basketball size ball worth of hair. 5 dogs mind you. This is when me and my mom got into a fight and I moved into my grandmas house to clean and store things. I have cleaned and trimmed all 5 dogs hair and nails. I am moving every piece of furniture and sweeping and mopping, dusting everything and draping sheets over everything. doing the 5 loads of dishes. the million loads of clothes. Fixing everything in her house that is broken, or missing. Wiping all the nicotine off the walls and pictures and everything else from my mom smoking in here. And she starts yelling at me because I need to leave everything alone because it needs to look like a ""home."" Coming from my mother who said she's only going to see her mom ""because nobody else will."" I told my grandma I'm leaving when I'm done because this family is a cesspool of thieving evil toxic people. My thought is when she gets home, all she has to do is pull the sheets off and wash them, and put like 20 things back on the walls. I'm basically coming here for validation or to be told if I'm doing something wrong...

To keep a long story short. My mom admittedly drinks regularly. I wouldn‚Äôt say she drinks to excess. She‚Äôs not a drunk or sloppy. But when she drinks she becomes very irritable. I know this because I get the same way. I have a rage problem because the dis-functionality of my life and my relationship with me family. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cautious of alcohol. It frightens me. I smoke small amounts of marijuana instead.

My mom drank two glasses of wine and a sidecar tonight. She was telling me how much she loves me and how important I am to her and how everything will work out fine. My Dad on the other hand is a little more emotionally unaware so he let the dogs in from outside and started the dishes while my mom and I talked.

Out of thin air, my mom started bugging out on my dad. Nothing over the top, but still uncomfortable. She was shaming him over washing the dishes instead of sharing this sentiment with us. I said she was acting out of line and that things were fine, and she then started sniping at me about my Dad. 

I removed myself from the situation so they can hash it out amongst themselves. It just makes me sad hearing my dad apologize to my furious mom for simply washing the dishes. I don‚Äôt like the way she treats him when she‚Äôs mad. She bullies him into submission. It‚Äôs hard to respect your father when he‚Äôs constantly the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry honey‚Äù type. If the roles were reversed, it‚Äôd be considered verbal abuse. If my mom was always apologizing to my dad for trivial shit, I‚Äôd feel the same way. 

He retired on Valentine‚Äôs Day from his job of 30 years. I want to make this time in his life easier and exciting, but it‚Äôs hard to have a good time when we‚Äôre paranoid that my mom will bug out at any point past 5:00. 

How do I handle this situation while I‚Äôm still living here. Admittedly it gets hard to find a job with this kind of stress.

I said to her that I didn't believe in ""energy"" because what she  brings up is anecdotal and is not tested and proven. She later got  annoyed saying that if I didn't believe in energy because it was  anecdotal, then I was saying that her experiences weren't real. She sent  me these sources as evidence and said that astral projectors can feel and control energy too, though I'm still unconvinced.

16,"Hello everyone,

I'm on my 5th year stuying architecture (the Bachelor is only 3 years, but really nobody gets it in 3 years here). I should be done this summer. Or at least that is what I told my parents. Since 2 years ago, I started lying to them and telling them I passed some Tests that I really hadn't. I guess I thought I could catch up whit the courses in the near future and I hadn't pass a few exams and didn't want to disapoint my parents.

My parents think this will be finally my last semester, but I'm not sure if I will pass everything I need to pass to be done this semester (it's very difficult, but I think doable). I feel terrible about lying to my wonderful and supportive parents. Should I keep the lies and try to finish this semester or should I tell them the reallity now?

I know lies usually catch up, but thinking about telling this to my parents... They would be extremly dissappointed and maybe stop trusting me. I know it's my mistakes and I should deal with them and my parents. But is it really the best option to tell them? Has someone had a similar experience?",26Feb2020,1

 Ive been told it's mostly a cash market and the items I'm selling are mostly with in the $5-$10 range with some smaller things being around $3. I'm running various deals for sets of three that usually come out to be around $25. Sorry if that's a lot of unnecessary info. 

My thought was to bring between $100-$200 dollars for change but I'm uncertain of the break down.  Like how many 1's, 2's, 5's, 10's, etc.

My horniness is completely jacked up and at certain points I find it immensely difficult to focus on anything else other than sex. I have had to take bathroom breaks during quizzes at school just to get one off and I find myself at the very least stimulating myself, even if not to orgasm, about a dozen times a day. Most importantly to me at least is that I fear I‚Äôm starting to objectify women, which is a big source of guilt for me especially since Im afab and I know the experience. I try to be considerate but it‚Äôs getting hard for me to not just think about them as a potential sexual partner, even my closest female friends. I get aroused very easily whenever a friend I find attractive touches me in any way, and it makes me really flustered and it gets hard to talk to them.

24,"Here's the story. It's long and fool of stupidity, but it's 100% honest.   


I'm a bisexual man, 21. January of last year.

One day, I was driving home and noticed a car by my apartment stuck in the middle of the road, so I got out to help move it out of the way. The guy who's car it was (Joe) turned out to be a drug dealer, and told me ""if you need ANYTHING just hit me up"" and gave me his number. I, in my horny way, wanted to give this guy a blowjob, which is exactly what I texted him asking to do. He said if I could take him to get some weed, we could go back to his place and I could. When I met up with him later, he had a friend with him that he didn't tell me about, who ended up staying with us for the whole night. I took his friend back home after we smoked and went back to Joe's. ""FINALLY!"" I'm thinking to myself, but when we got there we both crashed.   


I woke up before he did, and I thought it'd be fun to wake him up with that blowjob, so I unzipped his pants and started blowing him. He woke up and told me to stop, and I did. He said I had to wait if I wanted to do it again, so we ended up ""hanging out"", and by that I mean I was basically his ride while he made a few deals and stuff. After spending like more than half the day with him and getting nowhere, I was getting frustrated. We ended up going to a pawn shop where he saw a friend of his, and asked me if I could take them across town, to which I said no. I took him home, and that's where the story would end...

HOWEVER, I realized my vape was missing. I texted Joe asking if he saw it, to which he replied no. An hour later, he posts a video to his snapchat of him smoking out of that same vape, so I rushed over to his house in a rage trying to get it back. He brought out a knife and tried to stab me with it. He cut my thumb pretty bad but I managed to get him to calm down and thought ""fuck it let him keep the vape this shit ain't worth it."" But he told me to come back maybe an hour later and I said fine. I came back, he told me he was upset because he found out his grandfather died earlier that day, and he told me he'll call the cops on me for raping him if I don't do what he asked, and although I knew he was bluffing, I said sure. He wanted to drive my car (with me in it of course) to a few houses around town, then come back to the apartment, where he would THEN give me my vape back and even let me blow him forreal this time. I said fine, he smoked a whole bunch of heroine, and we hit the road.  


We got to someone's house, and Joe went inside with my keys while I waited in the car. A few minutes later, he was getting his ass beat by the homeowner and broke my vape in the process. I finally said fuck it, grabbed my keys, took him home so i could cut off the ring that was choking his finger, patch him up, and get the fuck out of there. We ended up talking all night and into the morning which was actually kind of nice. We smoked a lot of stupid shit (heroine, meth, etc.) throughout the night, which I've NEVER done before, and eventually he said we'd go for a couple more rides, I'D drive, then go back to his place, where he would dress me up as a woman (complete with wig and makeup) and have sex with me. When we got back to his place, I realized it was almost noon and had to go to school, so I left. I haven't seen him since.   


It's been over a year since all this went down, and regardless of what anyone says here I know there were a lot of mistakes I made over the course of these 3 days that could've prevented a lot of this stuff from happening: not giving him rides in the first place, not going back for my vape when I found out he had it, and finally, not blowing him when he was asleep.

Hello Reddit. 
Before saying anything, I want to let yall know that I‚Äôve wanted to post this for a while, but had to think a thousand times because I know Reddit can be rough sometimes. But I‚Äôve also thought maybe it‚Äôd inspire somebody or be relatable to who knows. So les start.

Resuming it all, I‚Äôve never wanted or thought about being a model for most of my life. I was a very ugly kid/teen, to the point I‚Äôd get bullied at school and stuff. 

I‚Äôd say I had a few mental health issues when I was younger, pretty much around the age of 12, when I used to do these self harm cuts. I‚Äôve had depression for a few years mixed with bipolarity and even anxiety. But time passed and things changed and I don‚Äôt even find therapy really necessary for me nowadays. Memories from then are a little blurred and honestly are better off forgotten.

Good news is 10 years later my body did this magical thing in which I got, I‚Äôd say, pretty attractive. Around 80% of people I meet ask if I‚Äôm a model. It kinda seems like a rough thing to work with because of all the judgements that come from being one. And I thought It would be especially rougher for me because of these scars. But I‚Äôve really started to consider it due to past occurrences.. heh

They‚Äôre not that visible, not even from close. But if you work on/do something on my body, you can clearly notice them. They‚Äôre also not very similar or symmetrical so I got away with saying it was a ‚Äúchildhood accident‚Äù with a few people I guess. But I‚Äôm still scared to try and be a model when there‚Äôs already so much judgment related to model‚Äôs bodies. 

If any of you can give me any advice related to it... especially if you‚Äôve worked as a model before or know someone who did. I‚Äôm having a lot of second thoughts in this but can‚Äôt find anything else I‚Äôd like to work with.",26Feb2020,1
33,"For some context I live in public housing meaning there are a lot of people suffering from mental illness living in my project.

I usually walk 4-5 times a week around our block and the neighboring project block. I NEVER go on a consistent time basis. It's always at a random time. 

I've had an instance of being followed on foot by a man from another street outside if the project. But thankfully my neighbor's dogs have prevented anything from happening. (I live in the south so this neighbor lives past the 2nd block)

Another instance where my creepy neighbor would stare at me through his window as I'd round the corner of my mini block. This is a very common occurrence.

Today I was taking my usual walk and was approached by my neighbor's dog who was off of her leash again. I took her back home and put her back on her leash. Unfortunately I got covered in mud in the process. I decided to head home the short way instead of finishing the whole walk.

On my way home I happened to catch my creepy neighbor (potentially mentally Ill) go out on his porch to have a smoke. I always have headphones in and I heard him call out to me, asking if I was on my walk. I said yeah. He let's me know he sees me often which is fine. But what he said next makes me extremely unnerved. He said I start ""down there"" and pointed in the exact direction of my apartment. Which would be fine if he didn't live 1000 ft away from me. How does this man know where I am staying? 

To add on to my suspicions every day at the end of my walks I see this same green truck drive by about 5-10 minutes later. The speed limit is 25 mph on my street and it goes about 10 mph by my house. I've seen a truck that is a similar color and model at you guessed it. My creepy neighbor's house. 

I don't know what to do about this. I have serious anxiety and I have been preyed on before. This has an eerily similar feeling to it. I might be just be paranoid but there are too many weird happenings going on. 

I feel as if I reach out to my local police they will say nothing about the situation because I've never been approached by him before. 

My housing authority will tell me to reach out to police as we've attempted this in the past to report potential crimes in the past. The neighborhood I live in is quite sketchy so please understand crime is everyday life.

So what should I do? I plan on carrying self defense when I go from now on but I do feel incredibly uncomfortable about the while situation.",26Feb2020,1

So he's going to this house party with a friend that is supposed to be 100+ people. 
Hasn't even bothered inviting me. 

I don't own him and irs up to him what he does but this isn't what he was like at first and he's becoming more distant and to me, being in a relationship unless it was a girls or boys night id invite him because its polite and I think of him and it's be nice to have him there. Esp if it was a house party? 
Just feel like he's acting like he's single to be honest. 

He's saying about going and getting hammered etc and I just don't really get it. Like he can do whatever he wants, as I say, I don't own him and he can do what he wants... But it feels like he wants a single life?

37,"On Saturday my friends and I decided to drink by ourselves. I had two shots of watered down white rum on a full stomach and can't remember anything after(for some context, I've drank tons of alcohol in the past and have never experienced anything like this before. Two shots is definitely not enough to make me blackout). It's like someone just erased hours worth of memory. I woke up a few hours later on a bed, still feeling REALLY drunk .I really believed I drank a ton then . One of my friends(the dude who served us our drinks) was with me on the bed, and he had his hands around me and while I was crying to him about someone I was seeing. I tried to sit up and everything SPUN. I threw up everywhere, and he helped me to the bathroom where I threw up again. I changed into different clothes and walked back out. We were back on the bed again, I still couldn't sit up, and I remember him playing with my breasts and me not being able to move.  Sometime after he proceeds to undress me and touch me, and I let him. I was too drunk to care and too tired to move.He wanted to have sex but I remember stopping him and he obliged. I'm willing to take full accountability for this, simply because I did consent. 

When I woke up the next day though my entire body felt off, it felt sore. I still felt drunk and could barely sit up. Apparently the dude who served the drinks (we'll call him S for convenience) went out with another friend to get more liquor and a different dude, someone  I was actually making out when I was aware of things, took me to the bedroom when I had blacked out during this time. The dude, we'll call him Z, told me we cuddled and made out and ""touched"" but we didn't proceed to have sex. 
Now I'm not sure if S raped me when he came back or if Z is lying, or if anyone raped me at all, but I almost a hundred sure that my drink was spiked .

S told me I had 4 shots(still not enough to get me to blackout), Z told me I had 2 before I could even tell him that was where the memory ended, the only other girl at the party just told me Z only took me to the room and came back out almost immediately (Z DID tell me we were in the bed together)

It took me several hours to figure out that I was probably spiked and maybe even raped.  This happened on Saturday, it's Tuesday now. I''ve tried getting my blood tested yesterday but after 12 hours of waiting in the emergency room, I didn't get to. It's been over 76 hours and I doubt there's traces of the drug anymore. I washed my clothes(except maybe my bra) when I got back home because they had vomit all over them. Do i still go to the police? I want to know what happened that night but I have no evidence and it's so frustrating. 
Any advice would help .",26Feb2020,1
38,"My GF and I are renting a house in one of the worst neighborhoods in town. Unlike many of our neighbors we are clean, quiet, keep up with our trash and yardwork. When we rented this place the Landlord had just finished a renovation which he left incomplete when we moved in. Part of what we discussed was our finishing some small projects on the property in exchange for a month off rent.

This included fixing some trim, wiring, replacing lights and setting up recycling service. We did these things. We also cleaned the gutters on both levels and extracted at least 10 40 gallon bags of leaves from the backyard.

On the contrary our AC unit hasn't worked since last fall and my GF blew her tires out when we first moved in because the landlord left screws on the floor of our garage. Our fridge was missing shelves because his wife stole them for hers of the same model. Our basement leaks.

Anyway, on Saturday he asked one of us to be here for an appraiser to come over. I suspect from the kind of junk mail he gets sent to our address he is either in heavy debt or debt consolidation. Anyway, I told him its fine and to have his guy come out. Landlord texts me at 11pm last night to tell me the appraiser will come at 9am and to ask me if he should come too with a key to let him in.

This woke me up because you know I work in the mornings at 8am... but I digress.

Appraiser gets here and is weird as fuck. Doesn't shake my hand introduce himself or regard us at all. Just walks in and starts taking photos of our home. My partner is a rape survivor so of course this gets her PTSD going a bit. Having no choice I leave for work.

Then it gets good.

Landlord comes over unannounced at the end of the visit and walks through with the appraiser. This bothers me because he is always texting me trying to be friendly and inviting us to do things with his family. I politely refuse all the time because frankly we aren't friends and his wife always has something demeaning to say to us about being a gay couple whenever she's here.

Anyway, after his impromptu walkthrough he stands on the porch to talk to the appraiser.

I have a Ring doorbell.

First he tells the appraiser about all the renovation he did and then says that ""we haven't kept up the property and that we don't really clean the outside""

Bitch, I have personally climbed a 20 ft ladder to clean this fucking house and I hired a gardner to mow the lawn every 2 weeks. Did you forget I set up all the recycling and trash accounts?

On top of that he fires off another insult to my partner. ""Thanks for waking up this AM to let us in I know it must have been a challenge""

Are you for fucking real dude? My partner spends 4 hours a day in training a gym and 7 hours a night studying, practicing to perform or actually performing. Right now they're training for an audition with an international touring company.

I originally posted this on revenge advice asking for petty revenge, but I thought I'd throw it in here to see what people said.

TL;DR: Creepy disingenuous landlord tries to be friends with my partner and me but talks shit on us behind our back. For good measure he implies my partner is an unemployed loser.",26Feb2020,1
39,"I was kind of a brat to my parents when I was rebelling from them during my college years. They were a bit strict and I guess i was lashing out. I wish I hadn‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt take it back. 

Maybe it was that, maybe it was the fact that my parents want me home so I can take care of all their emotional needs that aren‚Äôt being met in their marriage. Their marriage situation is messed up. 

I planned to go home with them once, but they were making me so uncomfortable, treating me like a doll for their emotional needs. I couldn‚Äôt put up with it, so I told them I‚Äôd be going back to my apartment. They got pissed, followed me to a store, then called the ambulance and police on me. Then they urged me to go to a doctor because I‚Äôm ‚Äúsick‚Äù. My mom was sobbing and sobbing and telling me how sad I was. 

I was living with a family friend at the time. She got uncomfortable with the situation and told me to have them pick me up. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I didn‚Äôt feel I had a choice. It would‚Äôve been too weird to get a moving truck and then not go home with them. 

So my parents picked me up. But they were making me feel unsafe. My dad was making me feel like he could barge into my room at any minute. I was being treated like a doll for their emotional needs. I stayed because I didn‚Äôt want my mom to get sad again. But I was getting too uncomfortable at home. 

On Monday I planned to leave. My mom must‚Äôve sensed it. She stayed home from work that day.

42,"Her and I met at a youth shelter when we were fairly young (I was 18 and she was 16, I'm now 24 and shes 22), we were both without our families, and not exactly the typical type of kids in that situation. We were both focused on our success, and we wanted to grow with eachother and make a life for ourselves. We grew very close very quickly and soon were living together. We did everything together. We were best friends.

I suffered from severe social anxiety due to some of my younger years and some of the stuff I went through. She always helped me work through my emotions and helped me become brave enough to handle my shit. She bent over backwards for me, and I guess that I was so focused on just getting through each day without having a panic attack that I was always too exhausted mentally and physically to give back that same effort. 

Last December after our relationship became rocky due to my own mental issues she decided that she wanted to break up. I cant blame her for leaving me, I'm probably a burden for any partner to be around. I have my own issues with social anxiety that I'm starting to believe will never go away. 

But now shes moved on to another guy who's way more successful and able to treat her the way I wish I did. It's great that shes doing so well but I just cant stop myself from missing her. My mind always finds a way back to the memories of the time we spent together, and then I slip into feeling guilty for being the way I am, anxious and a piece of shit. 

She was my best friend and now it feels like I'm in this world alone, and it's so exhausting and truthfully it's really scary. I know that the healthy thing to do is to keep myself occupied but it's impossible to be occupied 24/7 and as soon as I try to sleep I start thinking about her.

48,"Firstly, English isn't my native language, so sorry if there are any mistakes or if anything is unclear. Secondly, sorry for the long post, but thank you for deciding to read my story.

I'm currently 21 years old and have just completed a bachelor's degree in Business Administration in one of the best colleges in my country. Last July, when looking for internships, I decided that I want to fufill my childhood dream of studying computer engineering that I didn't manage to pursue when 17 due to personal issues at the time. I ended up with an internship in something that I thought that I didn't like and decided that I would take the remaining months till December to study for the entrance exams.

Long story short, I ended up liking a lot my work at the internship, but I didn't end up getting hired due to internal politics. I also ended up getting admitted to computer engineering at the college I wanted. However, at the time, I thought that I still wanted to work and I was applying for trainee positions at some very well known companies.

The semester at the college starts in February and I immediately take to the course like a duck to water. I'm seriously in love with the subjects and enjoying it vastly more than the BA degree I had just completed. However, friday I got the call that I got the job at one of the very well known companies that I had applied to.

The issue is that I don't know whether to give up studying and start building up my career now, or wait the 5 years it's going to take to graduate engineering to begin working again. I have till thursday morning to make the decision and I'm stuck.

Things to consider:

* The job pays very little compared to the market average and the hours are long, but the learning opportunities are very vast and it will look great on my resum√© for the future
* Money for me is not an issue; I can support myself debt free whether I continue studying or decide to work
* The job is in an area that I'm not too fond of, but the type of work I'll do appears to be something I'm interested in (mathematical and statistical modelling for the financial sector)
* If I decide to pursue engineering, I'm going to be 26 when I graduate and will have to start building my career only in 5 years time, as the college doesn't allow students to work whilst studying, and I'm worried that this will be too late to begin my career and manage to scale a company (one of my life goals is to reach the same living standards that my father managed to give me, which would require a lot of ascension in a company)
* I really wanna work with data manipulation and business intelligence and whilst it is possible to work in the area with a BA degree, it's much easier to do so with a computer engineering degree and it pays much better too.

My parents are ok with whatever I choose, but I'm just worried about the missed opportunity of not taking the job offer or if I'm going to be happier, but guiltier, pursing the engineering degree.

Please help me. What should I choose?

I was accepting of it, though at times he would do it in malls and playgrounds, which attracted unwanted attention.

I volunteered for the next Pride with Z and another group of people, including a girl F. All was good, but when out drinking one night with F (Z was late and I didn't want to wait for someone an hour away), F revealed that she had strong reservations about Z and was upset at his behavior.

F had a FWB at the time and Z hung out with them once. The FWB told F that Z was loud, obnoxious and dismissive, furthering F's feelings of hatred towards Z. Z had also made snide remarks about F's size and girth, deepening the cracks. Our senior in the new Pride group got wind of it and had a sit-down talk with Z. He attempted to talk some sense into Z as to why F and I were pissed off at his bahaviour (I had mild grievances too) and to get Z to change for the better. Z thanked the senior for being honest and seemed to take it well.

Or so I thought. The next day, he posted subtle, p-aggro messages on his social media and played the victim card, claiming that we bullied him. He refused to iron out his differences to this day. Next thing I knew, he cut off everyone involved, including the innocent people in our group. We were upset but I was more hurt as Z and I had gone through hell and high water together. He would definitely tell everyone else that we hurt him when he dug the foundation stone for his own calling out.

It hurts more than a breakup, and I don't really know how to move forward.",26Feb2020,1
51,"Hi everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read this and assist me.

I paid $1400 for a certification course. The trainer is someone who has worked with my parents and while the course was discounted 50% ‚Äî it‚Äôs STILL $1400 of my hard earned money. 

The problem I‚Äôm having is I feel like he‚Äôs treating it as if it‚Äôs a free course. 

- He keeps saying we should play our one-on-one‚Äôs by ear

- We are in two different time zones and he‚Äôs not cognitive of it when giving me times. Then when I ask for clarification he just says ‚Äú10am eastern‚Äù (I‚Äôm cst). I‚Äôm well aware that for a regular client he would make sure all information is given in THEIR time zone. 

- He doesn‚Äôt have a full outline of what chapters to study and on each call he just says ‚Äúwhere are you at now‚Äù.

53,"So, really weird. I have this friend that I made when I moved into college. We'll call him L. We were really good friends and hung out all the time. Positive and bubbly guy. 

Within the past month he has gone off the rails. It took him a WEEK to change his entire personality completely. I don't know what happened to him. Changed his hair color. Wears completely different clothes. Talks totally different. Listens to completely different music. Eats different. Hobbies are completely different. Its like the L I once knew was erased and replaced with a brand new person. I still talk to him from time to time, but ever since this happened we've barely talked. Here's why. 

L calls himself a ""White Witch"". Has never made mentions of this in the months I've known him. I once went to dinner with him at the dining hall and he stared me dead in my eyes and said ""you give off very positive energy. You're in tap with your emotions and you'd make a great White Witch"". I thought he was joking but he was dead serious. I was like... Dude what? 

He made a website dedicated to being a medium. L charges people insane amounts of money for him to read their palms, gives ""readings"", give them rituals with crystals ??? I don't understand it so I'm sorry if I'm not explaining it well. He says he can hear spirits on our campus and explains who they are. He made up these backstories and everything. He constantly burns sage in the buildings and has made several RA's and roommates angry. 

 He once didn't show up to class and I asked him why. He said ""the spirits really drained me today"". I literally don't know how to comprehend this at all. I'm at a loss for words. 

I caught L sleeping on a couch in the library and took a video because I thought it was funny and posted it on Snapchat. He swiped up and said ""I was meditating. Fully aware of my surroundings. I wasn't sleeping"". You were meditating in a library? In the public? You were laying down clearly sleeping. 

Recently he's been attempting to exploit my mental health in an attempt to make money on his readings. I've been expressing feeling depressed to a few people in my friend group lately and every single time he hears it, the only thing he has to say is ""a reading from me is $3 a minute! I can read your spirit"". That's all you have to say? I'm not here for you to use for your scam business. 

Does anyone know what the hell is going on? I can't recognize my friend. It's like a completely different person. He never ever mentioned any of this spirituality crap before in my time of knowing him. Does he have a mental issue that none of us are aware of? Is it just a phase? Is it an attention seeking thing? I have no idea what to do or what to think. Maybe someone can enlighten me because I'm ignorant on this topic.",26Feb2020,1

60,"A recruiter reached out to me a few weeks before my year end review because he read my LinkedIn and thought I was a good fit for a job opportunity. Unlike most recruiters who reach out to me, this one call the hotline of my employment and proceed to pitch a job opportunity. I told him that the time wasn‚Äôt good and he offered to send me the details over LinkedIn. After reviewing the job description I told him I was not looking, but the opportunity interested me and we set up a call for later on that evening. During our call, he informed me that this new company had an unconventional compensation structure in which every employee gets paid that same base salary. This base salary was a 142% greater then my current salary. I told the recruiter that I wanted to proceed, met him in person, and he submitted my CV. At the end, the recruiter informed me that my application was rejected because I lacked to meet the number of years of experience the new company was looking for. 


At my year end review, the upper management of the firm I am at now tells me that he has been getting calls from recruiters telling him that a member of the team I am a part of is looking and that the recruiter is looking to fill that position. After conversations with the recruiter, the upper management tells me that the recruiter eventually divulges my name.

Background: 

‚Ä¢ I work at a small broker dealer (50 people or less) and there are only 3 people on my team. 

‚Ä¢ When I met the recruiter in person, he told me that he actually knows members of the trading desk personally.

‚Ä¢ I have been at my firm for less then 1 year and since the beginning, ever since the beginning, they have asked me if I was happy because they did not believe I was.

‚Ä¢ After my year end review meeting, My direct manager and I have a meeting. I ask him about the things said in my year end review and he says that during the interview process I was a different person that what I am on the trading floor ( The reason he says this is because I am not very social on the floor, I don‚Äôt speaks and try to make relationships because I honestly am on a medication that makes me less social and I am focused on getting my daily task do)

Questions:

If the recruiter knew how many years experience I had before he reached out to me, why would he even pitch the job?

My question is does it seem that my employers potentially hired this recruiter to offer me a position that pays significantly above my pay scale to ultimately determine if I want to leaver the firm? If so, how should I go about this?",26Feb2020,1

63,"	So. I am going to give some back story here because it is importants. 
	I am a teenage female. I have struggled with pain my whole life, I‚Äôve gone to endless chiropractors and paediatricians. I‚Äôm very tall for my age, much taller than most women in my country, i am 5‚Äô9. And my parents are both 5‚Äô11. So naturally as a child i grew A LOT. Everyone always told me it was growing pains, but this time-ish last year i got a really bad case of Influenza or something that resembled a flu. I had never in my life gotten one this bad, even though i have a very poor immune system. After i recovered, my pain got substantially worse. There have been some days where i couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed. And my energy levels, which have always been so low, got so much worse. I would have to fight through such bad brain fog due to my extreme fatigue. I got a massive range of symptoms, like strangely developing photosensitivity, where i get hives and sometimes burns from UV rays. I live in quite a cold area so it didn‚Äôt bother me until summer. I have never really complained, but i started too and my parents took notice. Also! My parents were in a car wreck together when they were about 20. This crushed both their femurs and left both with huge back injury‚Äôs, none of these ever healed properly so they both suffer in the cold weather from pains. 

	So i started to complain to my parents about my pain and they took me to my family doctor. This doctor advised we run some tests on me to see if i could be suffering form an autoimmune disease, or Lyme disease (there are lots of ticks where i live, can you guess yet? Lol), inflammation markers, or something else entirely. I did these all. And all of them came back as negatives. I was clear of everything. So i was sent away. six months later i was still having symptoms and had to quit swimming, which i wasn‚Äôt that happy about, because it was causing me so much pain and fatigue. So i was sent next for an MRI. This was to see if i had MS, or a tumour. It came back negative also. My doctor agreed that this was abnormal, and most likely wasn‚Äôt caused by growing pains. I am at a place now where there are very little tests they can do, and I‚Äôm still suffering greatly. 
	
	I‚Äôve shut up more about my pain, seeing as my parents are strained and there is nothing they can do to help. They have taken this as a sign that it has gotten better, even though I‚Äôve clearly expressed that it has not. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôve self diagnosed, since that is my bets option. I‚Äôm at fibromyalgia or hEDS, both of which run in the family. 
	
	The other month, my parents and i were at a family dinner, they told everyone about my MRI, and they all asked me about it. I replied that it was clear. Everyone said, ‚ÄúOh, its just growing pains then, you know. We all had them too!‚Äù That was whatever, they dont see the days i struggle to get myself out of bed, or the days i can barely function due to fatigue. But my parents didn‚Äôt back me up. And recently,my parents have started to ask me to do simple things, like ‚ÄúCan you run downstairs and grab me soup‚Äù and i say, sorry mom, i cant do stairs today. As i am laying on the floor. ‚ÄúBut ill watch your cooking from here if you want to run down‚Äù. I get that being selfish or whatever. But then they bearded me for a half hour about how i was a selfish girl and how i cant just oblige my hurt parents. They ALWAYS bring up their car accident too. It‚Äôs not the same thing, I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt hurt them, I‚Äôm just saying its not the same thing. Also, when i came home from my drama class, where we had played a gene where you need to be able to sit stand and lay down quickly, i told my mom i had to forego that game, but found a way to play due to my knees being sore. She just rolled her eyes at me. My Mom also constantly tries to convince me to re-join swimming becuse its ‚Äúgood for me‚Äù. But i have to tell her that it causes me more pain and brain fog than i can handle right now, but when I‚Äôm better i will join again, and she signs me up anyways! They clearly dont believe my pain! 
	
	What am i supposed to say to them. How do i tell them that my pain is real? How can i cope? 

	Thanks for the advice
	~A sad teen.",26Feb2020,1
64," 

I just wanted to say thank you for everyone who commented on my original post giving me tips and tricks on how to shake nervousness. I had a panel style interview this morning and yes, I was nervous but not as nervous as a thought I would be.

I printed off a Word document yesterday that I made with potential questions that may be asked, as well as my response to those questions. It was about 10 questions, and in the interview they asked me 7/10 of those. During the beginning of the interview, I was nervous and my voice was shaking a bit but as the interview went on, I was able to calm down quite a bit. (It was an IT interview). I guess I worried about that they were thinking of me, which is why I was a bit nervous.

One of the questions I was asked that I did't prepare for was the greatest weakness question. I said that my biggest weakness was public speaking, but I told them that I am working on overcoming this, and was specifically I was doing to work on that. Do you think this question was to throw me off on purpose ? Also, I honestly didn't think this question was asked anymore. I fear my response wasn't the right response to give even though I was being honest. Does anyone have any opinion on my response?",26Feb2020,1

67,"I asked a girl to my school‚Äôs banquet (basically watered down prom) and she said yes. 

However, I‚Äôm now unsure what to do now, mainly on how to get conversation going.

I‚Äôm an outgoing guy when I‚Äôm around people I‚Äôm comfortable with, and I typically am talkative with other people, however, I am horrible at initiating conversation. I do talk to the girl that I asked, but not as much as I‚Äôd like to. When we talk, we usually have decent conversations, she‚Äôll crack jokes a lot and I will as well, but I‚Äôm still not to the point where I am frequently initiating conversation.

Part of the issue too is that I have a bit of a thing for her. People have in the past alluded that she may have liked me as well, but I don‚Äôt know if that is based off of anything other than speculation. I don‚Äôt want to initiate conversation with her the wrong way as I don‚Äôt want her to catch on until I feel the time is right, because I want a solid friendship first. I have a bit of a somewhat irrational fear of accidentally making a girl think I like them and scaring them, which inhibits my ability to talk to them in the first place. While a relationship would be nice, I‚Äôm very content with just being good friends.

How should I initiate conversation with her (both now and the night of the event)? I don‚Äôt want to come off too strong and make her suspect something, but I also want to make sure that we‚Äôre not just sitting at a table without speaking and having a miserable time.",26Feb2020,1

70,"Okay. I know it sounds really bad, but he's applying to transfer from a community college to a pretty prestigious state university. He's super smart, talented, and responsible now, but he was an idiot in high school. He got bad grades, made bad decisions, etc. When he was 17, he got convicted of reckless driving. He was speeding (20 over, which is reckless). He hired a lawyer, and thought it was reduced to speeding after he did a drivers' improvement course and paid his fine. However, he only recently found out that his lawyer lied to him and the charge was never actually reduced. So he has a misdemeanor on his record. 

I guess my question is whether or not he should lie on the application. I know it's fucked up, but I really want him to get into this school. It would change his entire life and he really has grown so much as a person. Would the university even be able to find out about it if he didn't disclose it? Does anyone know how heavily this will affect his chances of admission? He otherwise has grades within the average for accepted students, and has a pretty good application.

since i met him i knew he was the one and that‚Äôs what really got me thinking about kids and stuff seriously. i‚Äôm only 21 and i *know* i‚Äôm still so so so young but this is really weighing on me. i plan on talking it though with my boyfriend of course but i need to sort out my own thoughts first. i don‚Äôt have a therapist - can‚Äôt afford one even on a sliding scale - and i can‚Äôt utilize school services because i graduate in a few months. my family isn‚Äôt a good support system, i was thinking maybe eventually i could talk to my bfs mom? she‚Äôs very motherly and lovely but not yet. anyway that‚Äôs just why i‚Äôm coming to reddit for advice on how to process my feelings on the subject. 

my first instinct is that i want a biological kid with my bf. i love him so much and it‚Äôd be so amazing and special to have a child that we made together. it just makes me so happy to think about that. i‚Äôm also adopted and i didn‚Äôt really bond with/attach to my bio mom even tho i was adopted very young so i have this desire to have a biological kid for that reason. *i know adopted kids and parents are very capable of having a loving relationship and can be very close. my personal experience makes me have somewhat irrational hesitations.*

however the process of childbirth sounds terrible. i have an eating disorder so seeing myself blow up will probably be detrimental to my mental health. i hate hate hate throwing up so morning sickness scares me. i can‚Äôt even handle IVs for bloodwork 2x a year, i can‚Äôt imagine all the poking and prodding i‚Äôll have to deal with if i‚Äôm pregnant. don‚Äôt even get me started on the actual birth. epidurals?? shitting myself?? tearing my vagina all the way to my asshole?? all the blood? and the baby comes out all waxy and it freaks me out.....

then i‚Äôve heard about all the complications that can come with the pregnancy. i‚Äôm terrified of my dr fucking me over with the husband stitch. and postpartum shit like pissing myself all the time? my vagina being all fucky afterwards? **milk** coming out of my tits???! i can‚Äôt even handle my bf touching my nipples how will i deal with a baby latching on?? and diapers. diapers freak me out. baby poop is gross. and baby throw up. and baby food. wtf.

adoption...definitely has its pros given all the cons of childbirth i‚Äôve listed below. but again the bonding hesitations, all the waiting and the expenses, and i feel so selfish saying this but i still want a child me and my bf made together. IVF is so expensive too. 

it‚Äôs on my mind every day and i don‚Äôt know how to process it. how do i even start? mothers who were hesitant, what did you end up doing? what subs can i post to for more specific advice??",26Feb2020,1

I need advice to stop the mental breakdowns from happening and to stay calm. The last few months of 2019 really messed me up. Thank you if you're reading this and have a nice day.",26Feb2020,1
87,"I think the best place to start is the following. 

* I know i'm a piece of shit
* i will not give you any advice in any way on how to access this horrible stuff or where it is, dont ask
* i will not go into details about the things i have seen or where i saw them. This stuff is disgusting and no human should be looking at them.
* no i probably wont kill myself, i have responsibilitys i cant abandon.
* My spelling and grammar sucks so sorry about that

So i guess i'll just start. I'm a 30s ish year old man who's been struggling with this for many years. I've never actually done anything physically with anyone under age and i truly think i wouldn't but i have accessed this horrible content on the web. A number of years ago i got caught with it and ended up having to register as a sex offender so theirs that.

It didn't always start like this. In high school there was some attraction to girls my age so i went looking for it on the net. I remember it being an attraction to it being my age rather than it was taboo. I didn't have problems with it for a long time afterwards.

I had a lot of negative stuff happen in my late 20s that sent me off the deep end and my way of dealing was looking as horrible and gross shit on the internet. As well as increasingly more nasty porn and hookers. I think i messed up my head during that time and because of it I'm no longer able to watch gory movies or play violent computer games without remembering the stuff I've seen. That lead to meeting someone who showed me how to access the dark web and all the places i could go. That went downhill very quickly. 

Before i got caught i realized what i was doing and wiped everything. I hated myself and what i had seen. I still do. When i got caught it wasn't as bad as it could have been because of this. So i guess im lucky to not have been killed in prison.

Now here i am many years later, unhappy, ashamed, and no way to move forward. The sex offender thing is a huge source of shame for me. My whole family is weird around me. I have to tell anyone that i might get into a serious relationship with about it before we could ever get into the move in stage. Yearly registration on my birthday. This is all stuff I've accepted. I made my mistakes and i have to live with them. 

I still get urges to go and look at this stuff. I want to stop. I want to not have the feelings at all. I want to think its as disgusting at the time as i do afterwards. Its like being two people, one wants to look, and one is so grossed out by it they get sick. I go months without thinking about it and then it comes back. Creeps into my mind. 

I want to be normal.

I don't know what to do anymore. Therapy doesn't help. Any advice anyone could have would be appreciated. 

I'm a monster. 

if you need clarification please ask me.

If theirs a better place for this or somewhere to cross post i'd appreciate some guidance in that respect also. 

Help me please.",26Feb2020,1

I feel awful now, I genuinely misread what was going on, I thought she was interested again, and now I am disgusted with my self. I feel like a pig, and all that is wrong with men.

90,"I have been at my job for almost 2 years now. There is a girl who at one point I thought I was becoming friends with. She was a difficult person to get along with for most people so I thought it was nice that I was able to get along with her. 

I started doing things for her that I thought were helpful. One day this backfired. We had an awards ceremony in our group chat and she was visibly upset that she lost an award. People make fun of her for overreacting to stuff so I started joking about how she deserves the award and everyone else is nothing compared to her so people would make fun of me instead. Well she decided to attack me for saying that and that somehow led to her saying she doesn't care about me and never will. 

So after that I went silent and I did not speak to her at work for weeks. One day my boss sat me down and said she had expressed concerns and wanted to have a positive work relationship with me. I told him what had happened and he said he knew she can be tough to be around and just to try to be less cold toward her. 

She suddenly starts hanging out with every other co-worker we have except for me and loudly discusses social plans I'm not part of within earshot of me after that. One day she talks to me again out of nowhere and then in the group chat invites us all to hang with her at a local concert. 

I go to the concert thinking we're going to be friendly again and I end up being the only one of my co-workers to go. She sees me and proceeds to ignore me the entire night. I sit around for a few hours because I don't want to go straight home after putting the effort into coming out, then I go home and I cry myself to sleep.

After that I ignore her again until one day I bring her a puzzle because she likes puzzles and I apologize for whatever I did to her. She accepts it but still acts weird toward me. 

Then last week she loudly said only pathetic losers are into her to someone while looking at me. I took this as an insult to me because she must think I'm into her romantically. I stupidly brought her coffee on valentine's day which she left and didn't take.

So a few days ago when she made a comment again I looked her dead in the eyes and said ""Why do you treat me like shit?"". She left without a word and then after that the rest of the day went okay. The following day we interact in the way that we used to interact and I thought that maybe I needed to blow up like that to get over everything. 

Cue today. I go into work and my bosses sit me down and say that while I'm one of their best and most loyal workers the girl told them the problems she had with me had escalated too far and she could not work with me anymore. 

So they told me I was no longer going to be working there and that was that. They offered to let me transfer to another location and after sobbing for 40 minutes told me to think about it for a few days as I gathered my things and left. 

I let everyone know I was let go and tell them I don't want to talk about the reasons why because I'm not here to drag someone else through the dirt. Minutes after that I'm kicked out of our group chat and someone shows me a screenshot of a supervisor saying to let them know anytime they feel harassed, indicating I'm the harasser, in the future. 

Am I just completely screwed here or is there some kind of action I should take? I emailed my boss and said I'd accept an offer to work at another location if I could. Just in case the original offer was bogus and they didn't expect me to take it.",26Feb2020,1

92,"I have been applying to countless fast food jobs lately, and after like 25 applications over 2 months I finally got a call back. 

Sadly, I got the call back from a job located one town over that only pays $10.00/hr, and has no other benefits.

I went to the interview, and the manager was very unprofessional. He asked me like two questions, and didn't give me a chance to ask him anything, and then just hired me on the spot. I have gone to my first couple days of work already, and the resteraunt is pretty fucking disgusting, and pretty shittily run.


So I was pretty relieved when today I just got another call from a job that is only 10 minutes away, pays $11.00/hr, and has lots of decent benefits advertised on their website.

My sister went to the same school as him and they actually went to junior prom together. When we first started dating I asked him if he has ever hooked up with her and they both denied. I‚Äôm not sure why it would bother me so much but it does. I believed them. Later after a few years of us being married a thought came to my head about whether they have hooked up. He denied again and then out of curiosity because it bothers me so much, I asked if he would take a lie detector test. He at first, said yes. Then I felt relieved and honestly started just looking up lie detector tests in my area and how they work (I was honestly curious since we were on that topic). He found out and became so triggered he started screaming at me that I‚Äôm crazy and I would never believe him and how would I ever even doubt him. I got confused because a few minutes earlier he said he wouldn‚Äôt mind. 

He later locked himself in the bathroom and stayed there a whole while. Maybe 20-30 minutes. He then came up to me very nervously trying to explain how he thinks that‚Äôs very wrong of me to make him do that. I‚Äôm confused and don‚Äôt know what to think.

When I spoke to him today, it went too far. He told me that with midterms coming up, I should really try Adderall. I said no, but he tried to pressure me.

He kept insisting how I should really give it a try, how my midterm grades are bound to improve, and how nothing bad is going to happen with a low dose. I continuously said no, and he continuously pressured me. He even texted me afterward saying how the opportunity is still open. I responded ""Adderall?"" And he said ""yea.""

This is almost a cookie cutter example of the kind of peer pressure teachers warn you about in those middle school life skills units.

The fact that he tried to pressure me after I said no is making me consider reporting him to the police. I have always believed in ""to each their own,"" but today Andrew tried pushing me to do something I had already said no to.

Simplified version of a long story: my wife and I separated a little over a year ago.  Throughout that time, she has still been on the health insurance plan I have through my work, because we are still legally married.

Not a huge disparity, but definitely more than 50%. Every friend I‚Äôve talked to about it has said that I should be asking her to chip in.

A couple weeks ago, her car got stolen, with her backpack inside it.  Yesterday she messaged me to ask if I could send her pictures of my insurance card.

122,"Need help with how to approach my boyfriend with my feelings or what my next step should be in the relationship!

This might be a long post, so please bear with me!

I met a guy on tinder in December of 2018, we hit it off pretty well and I deleted tinder right after because I had a weird feeling I wouldn't need it anymore. Months went by, we kept talking pretty consistently everyday, and I told him I didn't want a relationship with him yet at least and he was fine with waiting. He was 22 years old at that time, he had recently graduated from college and moved from alabama to texas. He had been in a 4 year relationship all of college but they broke up because he was talking to a few girls and apparently cheated on her. He never told me any specific details and I never really wanted to ask for details because I was kinda embarrassed. They broke up around september of 2018, according to what he told me. Fast forward to around feburary/march of 2019 I saw that he still had tinder downloaded on his phone, even though he had told me that he had deleted it. I didn't think of it much but then fast forward again, around May of 2019, I found out that he was talking to other girls and for some reason it made me feel really insecure and hurt but we weren't dating at that time yet I felt like we had this mutual understanding that we should be loyal to each other even if we were still just ""talking"" I guess we didn't...anyways he told me he would cut off communication with her because he was serious about me.

Then surprise, some time later we were out somewhere together and that girl he was talking to, called him twice, asking him if he wanted to go to a last minute concert together. Again, I was hurt by that but he said he didn't want to cut her off completely because that would be rude but she knew he wasn't interested in her. I don't know how much i believe of that still. Then in June of 2019 we started dating for real, it was pretty good for a while but then i realized he still had not deleted pictures of his ex from his real instagram account (he has another one for his photography/work) and not only that, ALL of his pictures are of him and her. On top of that, he still likes her pictures, even though she doesn't like his.

Also, most times I got drunk with him, especially when we both are heavily intoxicated, he has made me cry about something or the other which im not sure that's because of him being an asshole while he's drunk or i get really sensitive. Recently, I figured out that he had hooked up with another girl while we were talking and he still talks to her mostly everday since she was his bestfriend on snapchat for a while until i nagged him about it and is not anymore. Shouldn't I feel uncomfortable about that? Even better, I saw he had texted the other girl here and there too. In january, i confronted him about how he doesn't do the amount of things i do for him, for example gifts on anniversaries/birthday/christmas and driving over to come spend the night at the other's place. Most importantly, I asked him why he hasn't deleted any of the pics of his ex and he told me that they are memories and that it would look petty if he deleted them but he told me he would soon, its been two months now and not one has been deleted. I told him i understood he was stressed between getting a dog, changing jobs etc. and he assured me things would be different moving forward but they really haven't. I really love him a lot, and I know he loves me too but I am just not his first priority and it hurts a lot honestly.

I haven‚Äôt had that in a long time, as I was unemployed, down on my luck and had zero stability for awhile there. I don‚Äôt want to lose my stability, but I feel like a huge part of my life is given to this full time job and I can‚Äôt even relate to my coworkers or feel like a person because everyone‚Äôs so strange-fake. There are other factors that make this place suck, but the complaints aren‚Äôt the point so I‚Äôll spare you any more details. Suffice it to say, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a funny mirror house. But the boss is really nice and probably the only thing about this job that I like. He lets me go to my doctor‚Äôs appointments (they‚Äôre frequent because I have an autoimmune issue), he lets me navigate my own work/doesn‚Äôt micromanage. There‚Äôs good there. 

I found a job that was something I like, for ok hourly pay, but it‚Äôs seasonal and would be $100 more than the poverty line for annual income, so kiss stability goodbye because everything would depend on getting another job in the off season, which isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

I thought maybe I could go to a 3 or 4 day workweek here at the office and pick up 1-2 days at the other place, and make the best of it that way. Have a minor part time job I can feel human and happy in, and a major part time job that pays bills and lasts year-long. 

If I were to shoot for that goal, how would I approach the boss about it? Should I even do the second job at all? Should I swap jobs entirely?",26Feb2020,1

129,"Hey guys I am 19F and currently in college. I live in a suite with four other girls and one girl is just really bothering me. So my room is the room with the bathroom in it so everyone has to walk through my area in which I live with another girl. Hopefully this layout is making sense. Well one of the girls who lives in the other room is getting on my last fucking nerve. I am this close to fighting her and it's hard for me to contain my anger. 

So first of all whenever she walks into the room she just stares at me as she is walking past on her way to the bathroom. Every single time she makes it a point to stare about me and is just not ashamed about it. She doesn't it do it with the other roomate. Usually I'm just doing homework or watching Netflix or getting ready or some shit. THEN she accused me of not buying supplies for the bathroom the week I was assigned when I DID and it wasn't even my week. She also nit picks shit I do and I don't understand. 

I swear I am not weird. I honestly just keep to myself in the room and I am not asking for any shit. I don't know why she feels the need to stare at  me all the fucking time and cause trouble with me. I can admit I do have some pretty bad anger issues but no one would know since I keep myself pretty calm. My roomates have never seen me mad. Could anyone give me some reasons why she is acting like this towards me and how I can put squash this respectfully? Thank you in advance for any responses!",26Feb2020,1

so for some background, my SO(M18) has his own side business(fixing iphone screens etc), and makes pretty good money for a person his age.
he lives with his mother, and does not have to pay for the food, rent etc. he is neither ¬´broke¬ª or ¬´needs¬ª the money other than to buy a car and an apartment in the future.

he makes about 1500 and 500 dollars a month with this business, and orders new iphone screens for about 200 dollars twice a month. So either he makes over 1000 dollars, or 100.

this month, he has had his mind on other stuff, and i feel like he totally had forgotten that he had a business. this is very positive, because he has been very chill and more happy this month, than every other month the past year or so.

but the thing is, he recently started thinking about it again, and i see that it affects his energy level, both fysically and mentally(not in a good way)
he stresses avout it because he wants to do things fast, and when he dosent get to save up atleast 800 dollars a month, he gets very upset.


so my final question; is there some way of calming him down, or planning ahead?

Okay so two years ago 2018 I was ‚Äúterminated‚Äù from a job that I held for 6 months. They let me go at my six month evaluation due to false clauses. (Although I was young and stupid I signed the termination letter with the false and incorrect statements because I just wanted to get up and leave and did not know I could refuse to sign. This was my first job out of college so I wasn‚Äôt well trained) so fast forward I picked up a job 2 months later and held it for a year and 1\2 and recently resigned on good terms with the company and my former boss. 

Now I am started with a new company and I found out that in two weeks we are having a meeting with my old company (the one that let me go) . I obviously omitted them from my resume for my current new job and previous job. (Due to the management being completely unprofessional and scared of outcomes if they called for reference it would not be positive due to the hostile work environment and me almost being a whistle blower because I reported two employees drinking on the clock I was let go 2 weeks later) ANYWAY. My new position informed me that they did a intense background check that would show previous employment and everything cleared. (I‚Äôm assuming they would show on my previous employment record) 

So here is my question. What do I do if crap hits the fan in two weeks when we have this meeting and I come face to face with my boss that fired me two years ago. I am sure she is gonna cause trouble and inform my supervisors that I was terminated and inform them of the false clauses. (Skipping the meeting is not an option I‚Äôve just been employed here at the new place for a week)

There's never been any evidence at all that anything like this will happen, in the 1.5years we've been together so far. But I'm worried my anxiety might sabotage it.

The truth is I don't know if I believe a relationship without cheating can truly exist. My parents and grandparents have been together all my life and have been faithful and good to each other for the entire time and I used to use those as my counter examples in my head to myself to fight the anxiety. But recently I've started questioning even that, wondering if my dad ever cheated on my mom.

I just want to know, hear it from the guys themselves that are in good, long term and faithful relationships, that it exists. That guys can want that. That they are truly happy and really want nothing else but to be with their other half for the long haul and don't have eyes for anyone else. My family might have reason to lie to me if they cheated, but randomers on the internet don't as much.

I'm 90% sure my dad is slowly trying to block my internet access, because I can't access the internet on my tablet at all, reddit seems to be blocked. Other apps like tik tok suddenly started to load a lot slower than before (though that might be unrelated). Discord doesn't load some of the time, and that's what I use to talk to friends. Which keeps me sane at some points. 

I talked to my dad about this, and he said he didn't know anything about it. But the thing is, it's only on our home wifi that this happens. Anywhere else everything loads fine. I'm using data right now because reddit won't load otherwise. My dad is the only one who has access to the firewall, so it's not my brothers playing a prank or anything like that. It would be one ting if he would just tell me, but he denies everything. This all started after he read an article about how someone put porn on a Roblox game.

Hes kind of a low key piece of shit. Like hes a very cool and nice and like-able guy but hes very cheap selfish and useless to be frank! Hes screwed me over before on about $300 in a very petty way not by stealing it but by promising it to me and not giving it to me like a grimy business man and hes just not a favorable guy when it comes to money! Not only that, hes also brainwashed by his religion and the way he was raised! The way he argues is by changing the subject enough to the point where the original thing we were arguing about will be forgotten and he never admits the truth he masks the truth with something that sounds more morally right than what the actual truth is! I dont want to be surrounded by people like this! Ignorant people that cant argue from their own actual view point that bring up that theyre older than you to win arguments, thats what stupid people who have no actually thoughts on their own arguments!

And these are the everyday type of people i want to stay away from because they know what they want but their brainwashed into thinking its wrong so theyll never really get what they want that way!

Recently, I was given an opportunity to move across the country to assist with an event promotion company. This has always been a huge dream of mine, but as of recently I‚Äôm wondering if moving my whole life was a terrible mistake. 

In my home state, I had a pretty good job and had worked my way up to a management position. I also had my whole family around, which is more than most people can say, so I would consider myself lucky in that aspect. 

When I was presented with the opportunity to move and assist the company, I had no second thoughts, as I wanted to chase my dreams. Everyone around me applauded me for being brave, as the job I‚Äôd be doing was not going to pay almost anything to start.

I can't make my own decisions and when I do I still dont feel happy because of the eminence guilt. I could turn down a relationship and still feel awful because I have a bunch of empathy towards them. And if I do go out with them I will still obviously not be happy.

I'm trying not to sound overly stereotypical, and not to just rant here.


My parents are educated. They're atheists - which, for Bengali immigrants, is a big deal. They've ""assimilated"" to American culture of their own volition, and that's cool - but recently I've been noticing something. I uh, don't agree with them on a lot. They're really family-oriented, pseudo-academic and weirdly semi-conservative. I'm not a fan of family, I'm majoring in the sciences and I'm a progressive liberal. I don't know how much info to put here, but the point is - we really don't and arguably shouldn't get along. I've been really passive for the last.. forever. But that's changing.

I have an internet curfew, a back-before-dark curfew. I have to speak Bengali at home and drink weird herbal tea that he loves. It was fine back when I was like ten years old and he'd say fucked up stuff like ""I'm gonna take you out of school, if you don't behave."" and ""Don't make me kick you out onto the street."" But I'm done. He cuts off funding, I jump off a fucking bridge. 


I have a tendency to exaggerate but to be clear, he hasn't said those things in a while. 


 I know it sounds selfish and childish and stupid - but if he asks me to come ""live in the living room!"" one more time - I'm gonna stab a pen into my throat. 



Also, I was suicidal for a spell. That's overdramatic. Rather, I was obsessed with suicide for a week or two and started writing my note. 


I'm not handling this well, and I don't think I can move out anytime soon. So if anyone with brown parents has a secret sauce to make them bearable - I'm all ears.",26Feb2020,1
162,"Friend not close anymore

So I have a friend who I‚Äôve known for 3 years and we work together. We were close in 2018 but since the start of 2019 we‚Äôve been growing apart, fizzling out if you will. I myself have been trying to keep the friendship going but it seems she doesn‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt hang out anymore like before and she‚Äôs faked so many times or given me excuses that I just stopped trying. But she has time to hang out with other friends and people and such. We text, but barely and when we do she takes long time between texts and ends up leaving me on read a lot now. I try to even initiate but the same thing happens and the same result of being left on read. I don‚Äôt see it getting any better tbh, in fact it‚Äôs just been worse as time goes by.

I know one of then the other I've only seen at bus stops and I know nothing of her. At one point I thought she might e been into me. I know I've got pretty good looks and ice seen her many times looking at me. I want to intimate a conversation with her sometime but there's always so many people around it's makes it even worse.

The other one is a pretty good friend of mine. We play cards practically every lunch, when she doesn't bring a lunch I often give her something that I have. Her birthday's coming up and I got a small thing for her.

170,"(15 y/o male homo sapiens)

I feel as though my parents just don't understand or don't want to understand how I think I might be able to function and won't let me to try to do things according to my own needs. I haven't been doing too great recently, and I think if I could just be allowed to figure out how I want to do things on my own I would be able to not only accomplish whatever I have to do, but also do it well or even sometimes exceptionally well. They do at least appear to care about me and try to help me with things, but I don't want help: what I think I need is to be able to perform tasks at my own pace when I feel like doing them so that I can actually do them. (Being forced to do something, especially things like the paper they're trying to help me write for school, makes me basically not able to do it.)

My mom told me that she is worried about that she thinks I'm ""clinically depressed,"" which I do not believe I am at all. I have told her that I think she shouldn't be telling me that because I might start unconsciously trying to fill that role, which obviously isn't healthy.

They notice that I'm up late, and yet they haven't been allowing me to go to bed when I start to feel tired (which has recently been around 7 PM, coinciding with the darkness outside), and when I ask why I have to stay at the dinner table when I'm not even hungry rather than do what I know I should be doing at night (sleeping), they don't give me satisfactory answers that aren't just social nonsense (ex: that it's somehow disrespectful to my mother that I don't want to eat the food she cooked and sit at the table).

172,"This is pretty loaded, if there's a better sub for this please let me know. Basically, I'm sixteen, depressed, severe anxiety, you know the drill. I'm a 4.0 senior at my high school, and everything is going to shit. For backstory; for the past four years, I've been a part of Dual Enrollment, in which I take college courses for college and high school credit. It's a pretty sweet deal, and as a result, I'm a junior in college because of it. I've been focusing on majoring in Psychology for a while now, and I've only got around ten classes until I get my B.S. I'm also a part of a program at my school that enables me to get a head start in the IT program. 

First problem is, I have no idea what I want to do with my life, and I feel like I have to make a choice very soon. I'm scared of being tied down, but when I tell people that, all they say is that I'm sixteen, and I don't need to worry about it now, which I think is absurd. I want to pick a career that allows for me be independent, and it's been my dream ever since I was little to become a private detective, but that's obviously not going to be an option here. I love psychology, but I don't know if a degree in it can take me anywhere, and I feel like I'm too deep in to stop.

My second problem is that, I missed out on Early Action at my college, along with all the scholarships and grants or whatever comes with it, so I'm not getting any financial aid. Because of my altered bell schedule, no one informed me of the entire application process; I missed a single document that I learned existed from my counselor, and turned it in on December 2nd instead of the 1st. This has been the main source of most of my stress, and it's all I think about, all the time. I've filled out my FAFSA, am applying for multiple scholarships, and I'm still waiting for my college to get back with me, but my family can't afford to pay for college. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. I've contacted my high school counselor and college admissions adviser but none of them have gotten back with me. This is severely affecting my academic performance and I don't know how to calm down, and I'm just getting emotionally volatile as I feel more and more helpless. 

My third problem is that, I think there's something wrong with my tone, but I don't know how to fix it. Now, I don't live in a particularly bad household, but it's one of those homes that have been under a renovation we can't afford to complete for around a solid five years now. My mother is one of those people that's really, *really* good when she's happy, and really, *really* bad when she's pissed. I suspect bipolar disorder, and she agrees, but refuses to go on medication because she's afraid of any side affects that may come with it. The constant state of my home doesn't help her much.

She's been very helpful with this entire ordeal, but I guess I snapped at her over something meaningless and she just went off about how much of a bitch I was, and how she didn't need me and that she could leave if she wanted. We're barely on speaking terms again. Weird thing is, I still don't know what I did wrong, but she doesn't believe me. She wouldn't even tell me what I did wrong, let alone speak to me, until we went to a restaurant together, and I basically forced her to tell me. To me, I pulled her aside and told her what made me uncomfortable, and she just left the building and took a walk in the rain. 

I guess that wasn't the case. I want to work on my 'tone' but I don't know how to work on something when I don't know what the problem is. My mother has idealized leaving my dad and I in the past, and my dad has done the same, so I'm always terrified of upsetting either of them in fear that one day they might leave and just never come back. 

This had been the worst few months of my life and I have no idea what I should do anymore. I try to tell people how I feel but apparently it's become trendy enough to be depressed that people laugh at me as if I was joking. Honestly, not to be dramatic, but all I feel like I can do is sleep and hope and I don't wake up. I'm not going to kill myself, but being dead sounds frighteningly better than being alive right now.

173," I have been in medical school since October &amp; around  the beginning of January I‚Äôve just started hating it, I‚Äôve started getting drained &amp; kept thinking that this isn‚Äôt for me and I don‚Äôt want to work and live this 9 to 5 lifestyle. I don‚Äôt want to work for these messed up healthcare companies, the teachers are terrible and we don‚Äôt get taught shit. But anyways today was really tough, I was fighting with myself for the past 30 minutes contemplating if I should just walk out and leave. I took the test we were taking that day and then started to walk out after that. The teacher then asked me why am I leaving and I just said I had to go and rolled her eyes at me. I walked out and wanted to cry, (ps I‚Äôm 18 years old) &amp; I was just thinking do I go back tomorrow? And what my mom was going to say. I‚Äôve recently started my journey in photography at the end of January &amp; it brings me so much more joy than medical school.

I'm only 13, and while I cant ""fail"" per say, I may have failed to make it to a certain high school. I applied to a high school program which requires a certain height of grades to make it in. I was well over the requirements and sent in my application in video form, just explaining why i wanted to go and all that. I applied 2 days before the dead line. A few other students in my class also applied. The results came in today and they all made it in. I however, never even received an email and am left hanging here. Now in my best hopes I want to believe that they still have to roll out the replies and haven't told me yet. 


The other part of the story is this girl I absolutely hate. She is whiny, constantly doing ""TikTok"" dances and stuff like that when she knows I'm nearby and knows I hate them. She also always puts me down in some way. Now she made it into the high school program and received the email today. He family threw her a big party and she got lots of gifts from classmates, friends and family. She made sure I knew and that everyone else knew I didn't get the email. 


I need advice on what to do. I hate this girl and she always makes sure of that. I probably didn't make it into this program and the only other high school is full of drugs. I really have no drive in school anymore. At this point its not like it matters what i do for the rest of the year in just gonna end up in this crappy school and hate every second of it.",26Feb2020,1

I‚Äôm currently a junior in HS, I started dating this girl in 8th grade and we just broke up 2 days ago. I know that doesn‚Äôt sound significant at all but this girl helped me grow, changed me as a person. Before I was dating her I was a pest in school, I was rude to everyone and now I have really good morals and I tend to be really nice to people, almost too nice sometimes but that‚Äôs besides the point. But the problem is that I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for a pretty long time... I really try and hide everything and bottle it up because I‚Äôm a guy, not to sound conceded but I‚Äôm pretty muscular and I play football so I can‚Äôt really express my emotions without getting shit for it, but I could talk to this girl about it, atleast I thought. As our relationship went on I went to her with every problem, and me constantly being sad became a burden on her and it made our relationship toxic.. but she‚Äôs all that I had. We were starting to see eachother less and argue more, and then this rumor came out of her cheating on me with one of her best friends (a guy), and all my friends tried to convince me to break up with her but it was so hard.. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. And we just argued and argued for months until recently when I decided to end things. I feel terrible for this but I ended up doing it over Instagram DMs, because we had eachother blocked on Snapchat and iMessage for a day or so because of a big fight, I don‚Äôt drive yet (I have my permit) so I can‚Äôt go to her house to tell her, I couldn‚Äôt take her out just to tell her I thought we should break up, and I couldn‚Äôt do it in school because she‚Äôd have even more pain because she‚Äôd have to shield her emotions. I didn‚Äôt even consider the cheating rumour when I broke up with her, I just thought we wouldn‚Äôt work together because we were so toxic, we were both depressed and I just wanted us to be happy, it‚Äôs not the fact I didn‚Äôt love this girl, I wanted to marry her man but I didn‚Äôt want to make her sad anymore. But now she doesn‚Äôt even want to be friends ever when we settle, which tears me apart. Her mom hates me now, and this hurts especially bad because she was like my mother... my mom and I have a very bad relationship and her family gave me an escape and I can‚Äôt even thank them for all that they did for me... I just feel like a horrible person and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I don‚Äôt know whether to start talking to new girls right away and look for a rebound, I don‚Äôt know to look for something serious again, or just to take a long break from girls for a while.

i have someone i used to be close with at the beginning of college (we are both freshman). i‚Äôll call her rosemary. rosemary and i had a flirty relationship, but we never dated/intended to date. however, in a series of poor decisions, me, rosemary, and my kind of boyfriend had a threesome. this ended up going poorly, and it was almost entirely because of communication between them. i‚Äôm still not sure what they really said to each other, as they‚Äôve both given me extremely conflicting accounts of their conversation afterwards. 

nevertheless, after the fact, rosemary started being really hostile towards me, to the point where other people began to notice. during this time, i started to realize how vindictive and untruthful she can be, how often she lies, etc. we made up, but there was a huge rift in our friendship after that. 

from then on, i saw how rosemary manipulated people, including my at the time boyfriend, some of our other friends, and my roommate. i started to realize that she‚Äôs really immature, and we started distancing. 

cut to now, and rosemary got into a fight with a mutual friend, and her group. mutual friend is magenta. magenta is someone i considered a close friend, and after the original fight with rosemary, i confided some information to her in the heat of the moment. this was back in early november. however, when rosemary and magenta fought, magenta brought up a lot of this personal information, as well as implying things i didn‚Äôt say/think. 

here‚Äôs my dilemma; i think that rosemary is an immature, toxic person. i think she is a liar and a manipulator, and i think she is often cruel to people i care about. however, i see her a lot of times a week. we run in the same circles. i know that she knows the information from the argument came from me, and i‚Äôm not sure if i regret it getting out. on the one hand, she was deserving of magenta and her friends being mean, as they were mean in defense. however, i both don‚Äôt want rosemary on my bad side, and i don‚Äôt want misinformation tied to my name.

In fact, after all I wanted with this guy was a fwb because I loved hanging out with him and I trust him loads- but I was way too scared at the time to say anything

188,"I need all the help I can get to deal with this situation and so, please, if you even skim this post and have ANY advice at all, please share it. This is honestly this biggest dilemma I've ever been in.

Almost 2 years ago, my best friend announced that when he went in to get some swelling checked out, the doctors discovered he had a Stage 4 cancer called soft tissue sarcoma that started in his hand and had spread to his lymph nodes and lungs. He said the docs gave him 9-12 mos and weren't going to pursue any aggressive treatments like amputation/ chemo since he was a dead man walking. All of the literature I read about his particular type of cancer (and I read everything I could find) corroborated that-- at that stage there was nothing they could do, so the typical treatment was just to make the patient comfortable and wait for the inevitable. With this kind of cancer, docs typically only pursued treatment if the patient was at Stage 1 or 2.

His parents lived in another state and he soon announced he was moving to live with them. We all figured he wanted to die surrounded by family. Before he left, he did a GoFundMe and raised over $50,000 to cover ""alternative medical treatments, moving costs, and general life expenses"" (since he would no longer be able to work.)

But after he moved in with his folks, he announced within days that his new doctors WERE going to amputate his hand and start chemo, and insurance was covering all of it. I thought that was kind of strange, but of course I didn't question it because I wanted them to do everything possible to save his life.

I've visited him many times since then, so I have seen with my own eyes that his hand was removed and he had an intravenous port. I also know he had no hair for about six months-- but while he was supposedly on chemo he got a part-time retail job, continued to attend college classes via Skype (and graduated a few months later), got involved in local events, partied with new friends...and took frequent vacations to New York City, Seattle and California.

Every so often he'd make a scary announcement, like that the masses in his lungs were becoming ""innumerable"" (the # changed, by the way-- sometimes he would say it was 1 or 2 and they were too small to see, othertimes he said there was too many to count and they were large) or that his insurance was withholding life-saving treatment and without it he would die, followed by another solicitation for donations. By my estimation, he probably collected over $100,000.

Let me be clear-- I'm certain that he currently has/did have a serious disease.  I have spoken privately with his parents, who went with him to a few appts (until he told them they weren't allowed to come anymore because they ""stressed him out"") and we discussed his prognosis (I found out later that the only person who was actually with him when he received the news was his then-girlfriend, who has since broken up with him.) He also introduced to me to people he said were his oncology nurses. But while he was claiming to have end-stage lung cancer, I never saw him cough or vomit or get short of breath or fatigued. He smokes weed like a chimney, and since the amputation he's only been in the hospital once for a few days when he developed the flu. After one course of chemo, he announced the masses in his lungs were shrunk to almost nothing, but docs would be monitoring him closely so he'd be staying with his parents indefinitely. That was almost a year ago.

After he finished chemo shit really started getting crazy. He took a trip to NYC and bought front row seats to a bunch of Broadway shows using donations. (When I called him on it he said ""well, people gave it to me for treatment, and taking a trip IS treatment."") When he came back he announced he wanted to be a professional playwright despite never having done any writing or showing interest in theater before that moment. He wanted to write a play about cancer to ""share his journey"" and ""open hearts and minds"", etc. And of course he needed $$ to make that happen, so the soliciting started again. Every day for weeks he was on FB asking for something. $2000 for the theater rental. More to pay actors and crew, print programs, buy costumes, and hire a videographer to film the show. I was finding the whole thing more ridiculous with each passing day and suggested he keep costs down but he insisted ""no, this is my vision, it has to be perfect.""

Well, he got all the money he needed and then some. I should point out that the town he moved to is extremely rural and conservative, and his parents are well-known and liked. The good people in this little town opened their hearts and wallets to him without a second thought. So he put on the play-- and he pocketed the profit.

Then. One day he let slip that he was in $50,000 in student loan debt. I looked up the price of tuition at the school he went to, and it was $50,000 a YEAR. He went there for 4 years. I had never given it much thought, but I realized--- there was no way he could have paid off $150,000 by himself, and I know his parents didn't have the means to help him. Where did the money come from?

The alarm bells started to go off, but I ignored them for months. How can you possibly defend your suspicions without looking like an jerk? But things weren't adding up. His otherwise perfect health, the constant asking for money, the debt.... the only person I confided in was my boyfriend, who'd been at my side ever since the diagnosis. He refused to believe my friend could be that shitty-- he thought I was grieving/in denial and this was my way of dealing with it.

Two weeks ago I finally snapped. My friend announced that he'd been accepted into a writing school on the East Coast. The length? 3 years. The cost? About $40,000.

*The same person who was given 12 months to live, who HAD to seek treatment in the state where his parents lived because no other doctors would treat him, and was fifty grand in debt...is moving across the country for 3 years to attend an expensive school.*

I tried to question him. I asked about his treatment plan. I asked about the many thousands he had received under the auspices of being at death's door-- doesn't he feel weird about making an expensive, long-term commitment and splashing it all over Facebook? Won't his parents take on his huge debt when he passes away? He started yelling that I had no idea what it was like because my ""rich parents"" had ""paid for college"" for me (neither of which is remotely true and he knows that), so I ended the conversation and haven't talked to him since.

My boyfriend is now convinced something fishy is going on. I finally confided in a couple of mutual friends of my friend and I, and they admitted to having the same suspicions for a while now. Nobody knows what the real truth is, but it seems clear to everyone that SOMETHING isn't right.

Here's what I think is the most likely scenario. I think the cancer was less serious than he portrayed it to be. I think he saw an opportunity to get his loans paid off, but when he realized how generous people would be he got greedy, and now he isn't thinking straight. He doesn't realize his behavior is raising red flags because all he sees now is that he can have his every whim bankrolled.

The other explanation, the one that's somehow easier to digest, is that he's living this way because he knows his time is running short. He knows he won't be able to pay his debts or finish the program, but he doesn't care because he wants to pack in as much as he can in the time he has left. Conversely, he could also be doing this because he's in denial about how sick he really is.

But if that's true, how come he's never seemed sick? How come he claimed he would be dead 18 months ago? How come he was given aggressive treatments that would be pointless for someone at Stage 4-- but are the first course of action for someone at Stage 1 &amp; 2?

I haven't slept in days. All I can think is if he's been misleading people, I can NEVER forgive him for that. Not just the financial deception, but the fact that he led us to believe he was soon going to die and allowed us to live in unimaginable despair and fear.

I need to know the truth and I don't know how to get it.

Please, please help me.

**TL;DR: Friend claimed to be dying almost 2 yrs ago. He asked for, and received, huge donations for medical treatment. Since then he's been in fine health and spending money frivolously. He just announced he's leaving to attend school across the country for 3yrs. I don't know if he's misleading us, if he's in denial, or if he's living out his dreams while he has time, and I don't know how to find out the truth.**",26Feb2020,1
189,"So, I'll start with the question:  what would you do and why?

I am in sort of a tight pinch. Sorry for the long post and mobile formatting.

My friend and I own a small service business. We have been open about 18 months. In our first year, we did about 75k in revenue and netted about 32k. We basically did no marketing at all; only word of mouth and small scale neighborhood social media. 

Similar businesses can generate 12-20k/month. However, our busy season lasts about 7-8 months at the max (we have four seasons). The well runs completely dry in the down months. We are discussing adding all-year revenue streams to keep us afloat during these months, but whatever we do will take time to build a consistent clientele. 

Currently,  we are prepping our first series of advertisement (mailers, door hangers, etc). I think this will be a good year, with potential to hit 120k definitely in reach. However, we have not received any business as of yet this year due to weather. To add to that, I have been spending a large portion of my savings to keep myself afloat in the offseason. While I absolutely love having a small business, and my preferred work, removing financial constraints, is entrepreneurship, I am beginning to doubt myself and get antsy. My fear is that I will not grow my business enough to live in and grow a family in my current location.

On the flip side, I have a mid-scale international company (new operation in US) that has started to interview me. The job would be doing something that I am actually passionate about. They seem interested and would want to move pretty quickly if I continue to do well (onboarding by 4/1). They honestly have a lot of room to grow as a company and there will be plenty of opportunity to be promoted - this will already be a relatively high position, reporting directly to the VP and CEO. Additionally, it will come with the safety and benefits typical of working for a corporation.

I don't know what to do; my mind is conflicted as there are pros and cons of each situation. 

I currently live with my friends and would have to move away from them. Not to mention the lack of vacation days that typifies corporate life is a real drag. On the other side, it would be a relatively easy way to set myself up for a pretty cushy position down the road (lots of networking with other companies and massive growth potential for the company itself). Might even allow me to support a family on just one salary.

So, what am I missing here? What else should I ask myself? What are your thought processes?

Thank you!",26Feb2020,1

I'm beginning to feel like I'm cursed to be alone forever (yeah, ik edge-lord supreme overhere). I've literally done everything the literature would suggest: I exercise, dress well, and I even think I'm good-looking. I humbly think I am very intelligent and my academic record would support that claim. I have some nerdy hobbies: Music, Chess, Literature. I have started socializing with a group of people at uni, but honesty if I had a girlfriend I wouldn't care about socializing with people. I don't understand how I can be so alone. I find myself constantly falling into this pit of hating the entire world and women specifically for my sexual frustration and loneliness. Then I mindfully talk my mind through the logic-fallacies in that ideology and I always come to the conclusion that of all the children born into upper-middle class America I must have some of the most rotten luck. I thought my intelligence would let me figure out how to get into a girls pants but it seems approaching the world in a purely logical manner is something that turns women of. I used to be use Tinder, but I gave up because I've literally never met anybody with that app. I really believe I don't come across as a creep (maybe desperate at times though- years of loneliness will do that to you). I most likely come across as sexless and robotic. And when I try to change those elements of my person I feel so disgusted with myself, like I'm giving up who I am for something I don't know how to be. I'm average looking, but I guess I'm not hot enough to get laid on Tinder. Man I hate being a virgin at 20- I'm absolutely certain if I could just lose my virginity I would be a complete man. I've considered hiring a prostitute but I don't have enough money. Clearly I care more about the sex than the relationship, but I wouldn't mind a relationship. One day I'll be a rich doctor and then I'll be able to afford all the pussy I want- but that day is way too far away- I'm far more likely to kill myself than hire a prostitute as a 30 year old virgin. I honestly feel like I've given up in so many ways. I've done literally everything possible to get a girlfriend and I'm still alone . . . so I give up.",26Feb2020,1
194,"Warning: A bit long  
  
I am in my 30s and I have been working in hotels since 2009. I have worked multiple positions within hotels - pretty much everything but maintenance and upper management. I have generally worked at larger hotels that have a lot of rooms, restaurants, conference centers, etc. I know how to do my job and I do it very well. I have even learned a 2nd language to help me in my career, and I am currently working on a 3rd.  
  
I was hired at a much smaller property than I am used to in October of last year. My experience made me a shoo-in and I was hired on the spot by my Front Office manager. This is my FOM's very first role as a manager, and she has quite literally less than half of the experience that I do. FOM was being mentored at the time by the hotel's Housekeeping manager, who also does not have the same amount of experience that I do. The two of them are thick as thieves, having worked together for the past couple of years. This causes them to act very clique-y.  
  
The first couple of weeks at my new property are fine. I work diligently trying to prove myself - during my interview, FOM did not grant me the pay rate I had asked, saying 'The General Manager likes to see people prove themselves first'. Fair enough.  
  
As time goes on, things change. FOM and HSKPG manager's true colors show. I see them gossiping about other employees, huddling outside the General Manager's door listening in on his phone conversations, blatantly avoiding their own responsibilities and passing them off on others, passing the buck, blaming other people for their own mistakes, etc. When this behavior ends up being aimed at me, I immediately put my foot down and stand up for myself. I question their tactics, deny their accusations of any wrongdoing they try to pin on me....obviously I ended up on their bad side.  
  
More time passes, and things get a bit worse. Micro-management, blame culture, 'Kiss-up, Kick-down' strategy (basically means acting like the teachers pet with the GM, so when you try to tell GM what they're up to, he doesn't believe anything because he already has a biased opinion). I finally grow tired of it and corner the GM alone one day to discuss the issues. GM hears me out, but offers up really unprofessional feedback. ""Oh, that's just how they ARE. You have to build up a relationship with them. Are you sure they aren't just teasing?"" ....... RLY? Yes, GM, I am sure. Gm says he will speak to them about it.  
  
A few days later, and about every other week thereafter, FOM comes to me with 'Verbal warnings' (that were typed on papers with the title 'disciplinary notice') for things I had done or had not done - but all of which were based off of mismanagement. Example: FOM orders us as Front Desk Agents to stay behind the desk unless guests need us, but then we get written up when HSKPG manager called the front desk and we weren't there because we were off fulfilling a guests' request - contradictory assignment delegation. HSKPG manager wants Front desk agents to start taking on more housekeeping responsibilities, so she starts adding more tasks to our workload, but we then end up getting spoken to by FOM for not being at the desk or not being able to finish our own tasks. Everything was very confusing and frustrating.  
  
I start getting nervous for my job when these 'verbal warnings' start coming regularly. I try to talk to FOM and HSKPG manager about it with no results. Once again, I speak with my GM. He assures me he will talk to them again.  
  
The next day, I come into work and within the first 5 minutes, HSKPG manager starts making nasty remarks toward me, directly quoting the phrases I had used when I spoke with GM - indication to me that he HAD spoken with them. The negative treatment continues.  
  
It becomes apparent that GM has no control over these girls. I decide to email our Corporate HR rep, CCing my GM. This is when things became VERY bad. GM starts acting like my FOM and HSKPG manager. FOM writes me up over something trivial that would never have happened if HSKPG manager had followed proper procedure and had done her job correctly. I point this out to GM and GM gets irritated, saying that I 'don't even care about what I did' and I am 'just going to do what I want'. GM ends up having FOM and HSKPG manager's backs.  
  
A couple of days later, GM and I meet at the corporate office for the meeting I had requested. For this meeting, I bring a folder full of documented proof of FOM and HSKPG manager's bullying, along with literature on workplace bullying for education purposes. The meeting did not go well AT ALL. GM interrupted me repeatedly, argues almost everything I said, tried poking holes in every story I tried telling Corporate HR rep. GM and HR rep also have been working at the company together for several years. HR rep notices how exasperated I am becoming with GM's behavior and points it out, comparing me to her own daughter. It felt very condescending.  
  
I walk out of the meeting feeling defeated, and I am still stuck in the same rut I was trying to get out of. Meanwhile, I notice things at work - files with my name on them written up by FOM and saved to folders on the desktop that I have access to. One file in particular was titled 'FOM's Poetry about AvengedCenterfold' - it was a word document that outlined every single note they had ever written to the front desk agents in our 'pass down log' (a little journal we write in to keep each other informed of happenings and changes), except the document was worded in a way that seemed that the notes were only meant for ME. This document made it seem as though they found me incompetent and were building up a case against me.   
  
I now feel as though there is a target on my back and I'm not sure what to do. Workplace bullying IS NOT illegal. It makes me so angry that these girls are getting away with treating me this way. I have been keeping track of their own mistakes and their blatant bullying, thinking I can use it to show HR if they DO find an excuse to fire me. I have printed negative reviews from guests, documented proof of them lying about me or what I have done (example: Document said money was missing from the cash drawer and I had been working the previous shift - which was an absolute lie and I have the time punch sheet to prove it), and have just tried to keep my nose clean and focus on my job.  
  
There HAS to be something I can do. I really love this job. I truly believe that if given the opportunity, I could whip this property into shape. The problem is, I believe they see that too and are somehow threatened by it.  
  
Any advice?

200,"Hello everyone. This one is gonna be kind of a long read and I definitely need some advice here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I had a scenario at my vocational tech school that resulted in me getting sent to the office and meeting with the principal. 

First, some background information about what happened:

I fell asleep in class because my teacher was talking about some things that didn't apply to my attendance or schoolwork or anything. She was talking about a career expo that I won't be attending and also an open house during the weekend that I also won't be attending. After I woke up, my teacher tried to send me down to the nurse's office because I fell asleep. I said that I felt fine and was just tired. I didn't need to go to the nurse's office. She insisted that I go and I refused to do so because it would have been a waste of my work time. She wrote me up for being disobedient.

I am not being accused of being under the influence of marijuana and vaping on school property. I told them that I don't have an issue with them searching me yesterday (day of occurrence) and today. I am now getting called down to the principal's office multiple times a day and getting questioned constantly. 

Now here's where I need the advice. I have a feeling that they are going to try and search me on Thursday without probable cause. I am not going to let them because I feel that its unjust and harassment because I gave them the option 2 days to do so. If they do try to search me this Thursday, I am planning on walking out of the building and off school property and accepting the out of suspension.  

I was wondering if there is any other way I can get in trouble other than with the school. Would my walk-out quietly and peacefully cause me to get into legal trouble? Is there anything else I should worry about and or know before anything else happens? Any advice is appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: I feel that my school is unjustly harassing me and will search me with no proper suspicions or reason, and I plan on walking out of school if they try to do so. need advice.",26Feb2020,2
201,"So, long story short, I quit my previous job for a new employer who let me know a few days before my start date that they no longer needed the position. This put me in a very bad spot. I immediately started applying for things and landed a job within two weeks which I should count myself lucky.   


The problem is, doubling the experience and well outdoing the education requirements, they still hired me at the minimum salary that was advertised. Being unemployed I took it.   


Well, after a few days at the new place I already hate it. There were so many red flags up during the interview process that I knew this company would be an absolute nightmare (EX: Forgetting that I had an interview and leaving me hanging for over an hour before I left.)   


Now that I'm a few days in I'm already looking into jobs that could at least somewhat come up to my previous salary (I'm down by 23% annually). I'm not 100% sure what I should tell any employer who I might apply for. It looks bad that I am applying for jobs the week that I started.

212,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a 23 year old girl living in Michigan. Long story short, I have a lifelong history of depression I'm assuming partially due to genetics and partially due to the shitty environment I was brought up in. I've always told myself I was disgusting and going to die alone, cried myself to sleep every night, etc, and I could be happy if I could just find someone to love me and move away from my family. Well, after meeting the love of my life and moving into our first place together about 2 hours away from home, I still want to kill myself. Now more than ever. 

I hate my job. It's wonderful coming home to my own space and my partner and our dogs and being able to just relax and decompress without having to worry about my abusive step mother. It's everything I've ever asked for. However, my new job I took after moving out here makes me want to kill myself more than I ever have. I've been working there for about 4 months, and every single day is torture. I do nothing but stare at the clock and pray time goes by faster, and daydream about ways of hurting myself or self-destructive ways to get out of work. 

I finally have everything I want, a nice apartment, a brand new car, a wonderful partner, two perfect dogs and no debt. But I'm still miserable. And I hate it. I'm tired of waking up every morning wishing nobody cared about me so it would just be easier to end it.

So I've decided I want to pursue my dream career of being a dog groomer. The kicker? I have no savings to fall back on (I was just in a car accident and used majority of my savings to get a new vehicle, the rest went towards some hefty emergency vet bills), and I'm assuming a dog grooming apprenticeship is not going to make as much as I am working at a Ford/Lincoln dealership. Plus, it looks like I wouldn't even make the amount of money I would need to pay my bills until at least a year or two into it. I wanted to tough it out at my current job to try and build some savings, but I'm quickly losing my mind working there. As in, if I don't get out soon I'm going to seriously hurt myself. 

I'm terrified of picking up a second job, worried that it will just further deteriorate my mental health, but at the same time I can't work at my current job for much longer. I'm really scared I'm going to do something I will regret if I have to keep going back there. 

My partner can afford all of the bills with just his income somewhat comfortably, but I feel almost ashamed asking if he would help support me while I get my life together. I have too much pride to not put in my fair half, and I know I won't be able to pay my whole share for at least a year if I pursue this. But I want to live, and I want to be happy.

So, the past 5 years, the child has mostly been with us. Her dad is always helping out with money, helping get her into school, and provide anything she needs and she always goes to him on his days off. So, in a sense we are co parenting with him. 

As we all know, sometimes you and your child have disagreements. Well, it seems every time she has one with her dad, she runs away to be with her mom. So she leaves school, her home, and everything over an argument and I have absolutely no say in if she goes or doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just seen as her babysitter apparently. 

Every time this child goes to her moms, she comes back so ill mannered and brainwashed. Her mom lives with random people she does drugs with. She‚Äôs never in the same place. She brings her child around these drug addicts and tells her about what she does. 
Her mom is also ALWAYS in an abusive relationship. Every time this child comes back to me, she tells me how she‚Äôs seen her mom be abused, how she‚Äôs seen her with bloody noses and tells me she‚Äôs scared her moms going to die. She never can deal with her daughter for too long, she‚Äôll have her for about 3-4 months, and not have her in any schooling, and once she‚Äôs done, she‚Äôs dropped off right back to me. 

She now is back with me, but her mom is constantly texting her telling the child how she‚Äôs getting an RV and she‚Äôs going to come get the child and they‚Äôre going to go live coast to coast with her FUCKING ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND! 

It‚Äôs a constant cycle. I have no fucking guardianship, I have no control over this child yet she‚Äôs with me most of her life. Any life decision that‚Äôs made about her, I‚Äôm never informed even though I parent their fucking kid. They expect me to be fine with it, and I‚Äôm not. I can‚Äôt keep letting this happen, a 9 year old shouldn‚Äôt be living a life like this. Her parents are in their 40‚Äôs-50‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm 23 trying so hard to give this child a stable life. 

Please help me with some advice to what I can do, or really, what should I do?",26Feb2020,1

First and foremost, let me introduce myself. I am a university student from Indonesia currently studying in South Korea. And as most of you already know, Korea now has the highest number of COVID-19 patients outside of China. ( [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) )

I currently just got back in Korea from my hometown for the winter break. When I came back on Feb 8, the number of cases was only in their 20s but as of writing this post, the number has exceeded 1,100. 

As of now, life seems to proceed as normal. However, there have been concerns that the numbers are not going to down for quite some time. So, I have been thinking about whether I should go back home or stay where I am, or what other decision is best. With that said, I need to answer a few questions such as how do I continue university as winter break is almost over and etc.

230,"Hi all.

So I'm in need of some advice on how to make a conversation with someone.

My girlfriend from 3 years just admitted to me that she sometimes says something to get me riled up just so she can have my attention since most of our conversations just go like: she makes conversation, I respond with short sentences and react to her topics.

My problem mainly is that I've never been a very social person.  Before I met her I went through a hard phase in life breaking up with a woman who I was living with planning to make a family and such, she had 2 kids from a previous relationship, without getting into details she broke up with me because she was ""too young and beautiful to be in a serious relationship"" both of us being 21 years old.

So anyway after we broke up I went back to my parents house, was in my depressed bubble for a long time I was home in my room all the time and even told my parents that I didnt like talking to people even them so they'd just let me be alone in my room playing video games after coming back from my  night shift job. My depression still lingers somewhere in there just not as intense as it once was, the thing is that I havent gotten used to talking to people yet,  I'm kind of uncomfortable with it and I dont know how to articulate a fluid conversation and I tend to make a lot of stereotypes/offensive jokes just to say something, things I usually find funny.

So how can I learn to have a meaningful and lasting conversation with the woman I love without hurting her feelings or letting her feel that I'm not interested in having one because I am.

She knows I deal with all the depression stuff everyday by the way.",26Feb2020,1

232,"I'm a woman (23) who has never been in a relationship. Each time I tried to, the guy would always say they're not ready for one...and then get with someone else. 

I started talking to this guy from tinder and we had a first date that went really well. He told me that he had just gotten out of a longterm relationship, which I was fine with. I felt like everything just clicked with him. It was the first time I hooked up with a guy after knowing him for only a day.

We had since been seeing each other consistently for almost 2 months. I got really comfortable with him, and when I'd tell my friends (including the older ones in their 30s), they'd say we were doing relationship stuff.

Recently, I asked him if he was actively seeking out other women, to which he said yes. He said he wasn't ready to go into something new, he was still trying to find himself, etc. I dont need a relationship right away, but it bummed me out because I thought we were moving towards something at least. He said he couldn't say for sure one way or the other. 

Since then, my feelings kind of...drastically lessened. It scares me actually, because it normally takes a long time for me to get over guys. Maybe I'm just tired of it? Idk. Everyone seems to agree if a guy isnt sure how he feels about you and what he wants with you after 2 months, he just isnt that into you. It also bothers me that he hasnt asked me how I'm feeling. I can feel myself caring about him less and less as I see him actively looking for others, and it worries me partly because I really liked him and partly because I feel like I'm becoming jaded and bitter.

234,"I have always had an urge to write, ever since I was a little girl. I‚Äôve only ever written one full book, and that was when I was 11. Since then, I have been writing excerpts, short stories, intros, short passages, etc. in my free time, but still never really evolving that into much bc of other writing priorities (yearbook editing, newspaper editing, AP English courses) and being a high school student in general. I also think part of the reason I always end up deleting stuff is due to a lack of belief in myself and my writing‚Äôs worth, though I‚Äôve won statewide awards in competitive on demand writing twice.

I love telling stories, and I wish that I could have the chance to evolve my writing skills so that I could actually write complete projects with peer review and professor help. I haven‚Äôt shown my writing to other people (exception: I have people look at my academic papers a lot as example papers) and few people know I like writing creatively. I feel like if I had a quality creative writing education, I would blossom like crazy.

I‚Äôve become a bit more apprehensive about majoring in political science. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm suddenly getting cold feet. I‚Äôm an intern with my local political party, I‚Äôve been a student government president for years, and I genuinely like the subject matter. I even took a year-long independent study to study Iranian, Nigerian, British, Chinese, Mexican, and Russian political systems. I dislike the partisan bitterness, but would more consider going into lobbying, diplomacy, CIA, foreign service, political commentary, working for CNN, etc. I would love to do something along the lines of comedic journalism (I.E. working for a late night show, writing sketches with political overtones), but that‚Äôs not really a practical career. I‚Äôm a dreamer at heart, but I‚Äôm also not stupid.

For now, I‚Äôm considering only maybe minoring in creative writing, or maybe just taking it as an elective. I don‚Äôt want to end up majoring in something and waste $$ on my education just to end up broke. Deciding my career path is so overwhelming when I have so many interests.

243,"My coworker Jim has recently decided to look for work elsewhere, and I don‚Äôt blame him one bit. We are all overworked and underpaid, and I wish him the best. He has actually been fairly open about his search with me, so I know that he is very, very close to being ready to hand in his two weeks (as in, he‚Äôs deciding between a few offers he‚Äôs already been given as well as seeing what comes of a few more interviews he‚Äôs going on ‚Äì how management has not already caught on with all the work days he‚Äôs been missing, I‚Äôll never know.) I‚Äôm happy for him, but absolutely horrified for myself.

Thing is, we work on a very small team, and losing Jim would mean my workload would double, if not triple. I am already working at max capacity. We could easily double the size of our team and still have work to go around. Short of working through lunch every and starting to cut corners to get work done (which already happens on days when Jim calls out, such as on days when he‚Äôs out on interviews or if his kids are home sick from school), there is absolutely no way I could absorb Jim‚Äôs workload, still do my job, and also take on whatever new projects management expects out of us. Without significant adjustments, I would be constantly working in crisis mode all while still being paid the same amount I do now.

Jim is my senior, knows the ins and outs of the company in much more detail than I do, and is the person I troubleshoot my issues with. So I‚Äôd also be losing the resource and knowledge he has. Plus, if Jim gives his two weeks, that is absolutely not enough time for him to teach me everything I‚Äôd need to know to do his work, but there‚Äôs literally no one else that can fill that role so I expect to be asked. 

I would be so far up shits creek without a paddle the very thought of it makes me dread going to work. I‚Äôm not in a position to find another job right now without sacrificing a lot in my personal life, and even if I was I would still have to deal with several weeks of working at 300% capacity that I‚Äôd seriously be concerned for my mental well-being. 

Obviously Jim hasn‚Äôt told management about his plans to leave, and I‚Äôm one of the few coworkers to know. He told me he thought about telling management so they would have time to get their shit together and possibly do something to throw me a bone, but then he realized that if the company doesn‚Äôt care about him enough to compensate him fairly, he doesn‚Äôt want to do them any favors. That and, if for some reason his job search doesn‚Äôt work out, it‚Äôd leave him in an awkward position.

That being said, he‚Äôs clearly on his way out. I would be genuinely surprised if he is not ready to give his two weeks by the end of next week, if not sooner. Management will be caught unprepared, and I‚Äôm going to be doing way too much for way little pay. So I‚Äôve thought about going to management and telling them I know that Jim is halfway out the door ‚Äì a coworker of mine actually suggested it. 

My thoughts are that if I tell management, one of three things might happen. One) they might actually consider giving Jim more money and asking him to stay. I doubt this would happen, but they‚Äôd genuinely be losing one of their best employees. I think if they wait until he puts his two weeks in, it‚Äôll be too little too late and an obvious attempt to make him stay. I also don‚Äôt know if more money would even be enough to make him stay. 

Two) accepting the loss of Jim, I would set some demands of my own if they expect me to take on this work ‚Äì specifically I‚Äôd try to barter for better compensation and new staff that I can train to take some of the workload. Having more time to plan and rearrange things before Jim‚Äôs departure (lord knows he‚Äôs already checked out mentally, unfortunately) would help things go a lot easier.

Three) management shrugs, tells me I‚Äôm shit out of luck and that I better do what they expect out of me, and I have to reevaluate my own life and start making sacrifices so I can get the hell out of there, too, again giving me more time to do so. I don‚Äôt like to think my managers are completely unreasonable, but this might be when they show their true colors. 

Approaching management on my own feels very selfish of me though. Clearly this is working primarily to my own best intentions. It would also be beneficial to the company on the whole to not have the team suffer such a loss or at least try to provide a reasonable remedy for it, but given that I know where my line is and know that I would leave if they cross it, I can‚Äôt say I really care that much about the company itself. I don‚Äôt know what recourse they might have against Jim if I told them they should expect him to leave. I would not want to create any animosity between management and him, and in the event all of Jim‚Äôs prospects magically fall through, I‚Äôd expect he‚Äôd still stick around until he finds something rather than be jobless for a while. 

But, again, I absolutely cannot do the work I believe they‚Äôll expect me to do and telling management Jim will be gone by the middle of next month feels like my only shot at really protecting myself from what will happen if the team is not fully prepared. 

If someone could give me advice, I'd be super appreciative. I'm open to suggestions from all perspectives - what would you want if you were the manager in this position or the coworker trying to leave? Am I unreasonable in thinking I should or could protect myself in this case? Should I just cut my own losses and jump ship?

 Thanks so much in advance.",26Feb2020,1

250,"it‚Äôs my 4th semester in college &amp; i would probably say im an overachiever and i study frequently. so far i‚Äôve been doing well in my classes, except my regional geography course recently.
my professor gives us so much information and i feel so overwhelmed and the readings &amp; slides contain soo much information. 
we have a test next week and he briefly discussed what will be on the exam. but then he says there will be questions on the test we haven‚Äôt discussed and is in the many many pages of readings we‚Äôve done. 
how will i know what will be on the test &amp; what will not? how does he expect us to study all that material. i‚Äôm just really stressed and i need to do good. part of me wants to drop the course but the deadline is coming up soon and if i do drop, i‚Äôll only have 3 credits which won‚Äôt be good for the current program i‚Äôm in for my transfer university. has anyone had a professor like this before? if so, how have you passed the class &amp; studied for exams? 
i don‚Äôt talk so it‚Äôs too late to find a study friend in the class, as we meet only once a week. 
but any advice for passing a difficult course will be greatly appreciated. 

i also feel my depression has been making me lack in my productivity for the past 4-5 months so all i want to do is lay down. i just hope i can keep doing well bc it‚Äôs worth it. 
the bad feelings in my head combined with feeling overwhelmed‚Äî i feel like i‚Äôm fucked for this class.

251,"Hi everyone, I really hope you can help me!

I am 19m  from Germany however I will start studying here in Scotland later this year. 

Some months ago my father and I were looking at some apartments for me to stay during my study. He is a wealthy businessman in the real estate indust so nonetheless it was an investment for him even after I leave! My heart liked one at the west end in Glasgow. He purchased and I moved here officially just one week ago. 


Now this is my issue: even though it is classified as an apartment, it has three levels and it is huge for me. Too big, in fact. I am having scary and intrusive thoughts about someone breaking in and even attacking me. The master room that is my bedroom is located on the third floor.  I have thoughts of hearing some clattering downstairs and then somebody breaks in and they will hold me at knife point and beat me. I have these thoughts only during the night time and never daytime. 

Now I‚Äôm even getting some nightmares from these thoughts. 

Back home our house is rather large but it is populated with my family: my mother, father, siblings and dogs. This is my very first time living alone. 

I would love advice on how I can deal with the bad thoughts. Even just now as I type this on my phone I have my lights on because the darkness scares me more! I never thought that I will feel this way as I am somewhat an independent guy. 

How do you deal with living alone? How to deal with such a large space? Perhaps some of you are in the same situation!

Thank you for all responses.

252,"I'm a 23 year old male from a small town in southern Indiana. I've been struggling with mixed depressive anxiety disorder for over a year. Therapy has really helped, I'm lucky that its free on the college campus I attend.

I live with my parents. Except for some house sitting stays, I've never moved out. Their relationship has never really been very stable, neither ones emotional needs are met. I'm not very close with my father, but I'm I major portion of my mothers life. Neither of my parents really have friends and I provide a lot of emotional support for my mom.

I'm single. Always have been. I don't have much confidence. Up until recently I've always been really out of shape. I don't have much confidence in most things, but I'm learning to be confident in therapy.

My friends didn't go to school. They live on their own, have tons of money, and sleep around all the time. 

I don't make a lot of money, but I have a really fun job. I've traveled the world through college courses and love it. I've done well in school, I'm publishing my undergraduate research, my professors like me and tell me the skys the limit. 

All of this to say I don't know what to do. Or where to go. 

There's a part of me that wants to go. To apply for a research scholarship overseas, or join the peace core, or teach english in another country. To go to a far off place and learn a new language and meet new people and submerge in a new culture. Feel like I will never be content unless I do. But there's another part of me that also makes me sad to leave. All my friends are here. My sister and baby nephew are here. My mother would be heartbroken, how can I leave her? And the rest of my family. What happens if I leave and something happens to someone? What happens if something happens to me? I've never lived on my own...

I've just been floating here for a long time. In the same room I've had my whole life. But I'm graduating in a few months. Application deadlines will be coming up after that. A part of my is going to die. And I'm having trouble deciding which way to go.

What's it like to move? Out of the house? Far away? To be a small town guy living in a new country? How do you get over the fear of loosing people, or making the wrong decision?

I don't know if anyone will see this. It's a pretty long post. I've never done anything like this. One of my therapy goals is to stop lurking and try to start participating in conversations online. So here goes...",26Feb2020,1

259,"I have had many problems at my job recently. I'll keep this short by stating that this environment suffers from horrible culture. 

The shift lead (who is the highest position besides the site supervisor) bad mouths the subordinates  he does not favor.

 This in turn causes a promotion of drama, shit talking and lack of motivation in the work place.

There is a horrible problem with favoritism, my shift lead will openly talk about going out to eat with the other two people on shift when the shift ends right in front of me and leave me and one other employee completely out of it.

I believe this is an unfair allowance to the employees he likes to partake in the shifts culture, and build comradery while disallowing those who cannot come. 

This only bothered me before I realized I really dont like who I work with anyway, so when it started happening on a weekly basis, I was not bothered as much.

My shift lead also allowed another employee to take a shot of moonshine on shift to try it, but if I were to try the same thing I would be reported, he only reports who he doesn't like.

If I left any important information out please let me know and I'll gladly add it.

In summary, my boss promotes a negative work culture, filled with bad mouthing, leaving others out, and allowing certain people to break the rules while penalizing others. 

Has anyone else experienced this problem? 

Can anyone offer insight on how to repair an issue like this?",26Feb2020,1

261," 

I'm in my last year of high school and everyone loves me. I am friends with nearly the entirety of my graduating class, I'm constantly saying hi to everyone around me, staff included. I was prom king and everyone knows me as the nice and friendly guy I portray myself as. But the truth is I'm not just a good person, the thing that is constantly driving me to do everything is attention. So much of it is fabricated, the kind and funny things I do in class, the stories I tell, the interactions I have, all of it. I do it all in an effort to manipulate the way people view me. I am obsessed with validation, it feels like the only thing I truly care about. There are so many things I want, to be a good musician, a good artist, and a good student. But I know I just want it for the attention it brings and for what it will make people think.

I feel superficial and corrupted to my very core. I really dislike myself, maybe that's why I feel the constant want to be someone else. But sometimes it truly feels like I am completely driven by my appearance. It's the only thing that I want and I feel will make me content.

When I go on walks or when my mind wanders, I am constantly fantasizing about receiving attention. But it feels like it goes past the casual daydreaming about being a superhero. I build and live in fantasies in my head where I receive the thing I so desperately want, attention, sympathy, admiration, etc from the people around me. Usually, it's a specific person though. I just got out of a relationship, and for the entirety of my relationship and even now the thing I cared about most is how she viewed and felt about me. Beyond a healthy level. It has become my sense of value. It's gotten so bad that I will purposefully injure myself just in efforts for her to notice.

But I have achieved it, I won prom king, everyone loves me, people give me attention all day, I have reached the farthest extent of validation that everyone likes me that I can possibly get as an 18-year-old. It's still not enough. Now what?",26Feb2020,1

270,"Long post ahead TLDR on bottom‚Äî I need to talk about this as I don‚Äôt think I can share this with others in my life at this time since I just pulled the trigger on this decision. 

Like my title states, I recently quit my job a few days ago because my mental health was going down the drain and I am feeling regret. I was just about to hit a year at this job in a few days. I had been looking forward to that. But prior to that, i would cry before work, or on breaks, maybe lunch. I‚Äôd have to wipe away the tears, suck it up and go back to a job that was really pulling at me and making me lose myself. It had been this way for months. 

The job was tough initially but I shortly got over that and was actually having quite a good time. I fostered genuine friendships and met new people. I finally had a manager I felt was on my side and would support me no matter what. The pay was good. However, there had been a recent job shift change within the company that, I, personally feel left a lot of people in a similar predicament (of feeling like they also had to quit) The position was different, harder. 

I want to be the first to admit that I‚Äôm aware hardship is necessary, it is very essential to growing. Failing isn‚Äôt actually failing and is good for you, isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness, etc. I wasn‚Äôt prepared to have a harder position thrown into my lap, but as all adults, we have to do things we don‚Äôt want to do. But hell why make such a fuss when you are getting paid either way, right?

 I had so many people tell me ‚ÄúChill out! Stop stressing, you are taking this way too seriously‚Äù. They were right. I was taking this. too serious. I was doing all of those things because I care for my job and I may have some perfectionist tendencies, but I appreciate that. I tried to de-stress and to just have some more fun. I gave the new position a shot, got all the way through training and started having these awful panic attacks. Like, crying in the car can‚Äôt even imagine going in panic attacks. I‚Äôd walk in and have to leave because I just wasn‚Äôt mentally tough enough to stick it out. There was something in me telling me it‚Äôs time to leave. I had to trust my gut. 

After a 3 day weekend and 2 extra days of full blown panic attacks, I decided to go in and give it one last try. Didn‚Äôt last long as I went in and decided to pull the trigger. My bosses and peers were so understanding and sweet, were very sad to see me go. I left that day and haven‚Äôt been back since. The weight had been lifted and I felt and knew in my heart that day it was time. I am feeling very regretful because I loved my peers and bosses. The situation wasn‚Äôt always so bad. I find when I close my eyes, I start to miss all the good things about the job and tend to forget about all the pain it caused me. 

It makes me feel like I made the wrong decision. But, I made the decision I cannot take back and I have to live with it. I hope I don‚Äôt come to regret leaving forever and come to realize I deserve better, and that there are other jobs out there that can provide a good, safe and welcoming environment. I will be looking forward from here. Any advice about how to feel from here, if others have experienced anything similar or if these are normal feelings.

275,"Hi guys. This is my first ever reddit post. I just created an account because I am in dire need of advice. Let me explain. Ever since I was a young kid (10) my family has been divided. My older brother accused my father of molesting him as a child. For years they have had zero contact. My dad never received any charges or did jail time because of the fact there was no evidence to support my brothers claim. Growing up I never really knew what to believe. I loved my brother and didn‚Äôt want to believe he could lie about something so serious. I loved my dad and didn‚Äôt want to believe he could do something so horrible. So for years I have spilt my time with both my dad and brother (in separate households) trying to make everyone happy. However a majority of my time was spent with my mom and brother, as i had a rocky relationship with my dad growing up. Years later I am now 17 years old and a senior in high school. For the past year I have been struggling with the conflict between my dad and brother, and struggling with feelings of guilt over not knowing who to believe. My brother has been in jail for nearly six months for some mistakes he has made, and him being gone has made me think more on this subject. well recently I got my hands on a letter my dad gave to me. He wanted me to give the letter to my brother, but something in my gut told me I needed to look at it first. What I read in that letter made my stomach sink. Here is a sentence from the letter (From my dad, addressed to my brother). *‚ÄúAs for your anger for me I‚Äôve never understood. The only thing I can think of is that one night when I was dreaming, but I talked to you about it the next morning and I thought it was resolved. I never would‚Äôve imagined you would bring it back up years later. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could think I‚Äôd do that to my own son.‚Äù* To some that may sound like nothing, but to to me it sounds exactly like my dad is in denial over what he did. In my heart I know what my brother said happened is true.   


Now that I have given you some context, this is what I am currently dealing with. I have been depressed ever since I read that letter. Not only because of what my dad did, but because now I have to cut my dad off from my life, and I would have a hole in my heart. For the past couple years me and my dad have been building a relationship, it‚Äôs not perfect but he‚Äôs more of a dad now than he was when I was a little girl. He texts to see how I‚Äôm doing, he wants to see me, he gives me advice. This is all tiny stuff, but it all would make me very happy knowing that he was starting to change his ways and reach out to me. But now that has all come crashing down. It literally felt like he was dying, because everyone expects that he should be as good as dead to me. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot on this, and I decided that I still wanted to have some sort of relationship with my father. I am not ignorant. I know what he did is sick. My mom wants to pursue a case against him, and I won‚Äôt stop her. He needs to face the consequences for his actions. But in my heart I don‚Äôt think I can cut him off completely from my life. Me and mom have always talked and been honest with each other so I decided to tell her this.

&amp;#x200B;

i expected her to be disappointed and maybe angry, but she blew up in a way I did not expect. She told me she wouldn‚Äôt allow it, and if I tried to have any contact with my dad she would kick me out. I understand why she‚Äôs angry, but I am so conflicted and hurt. I have always been close with my mom and now she was telling me she wouldn‚Äôt want me around, that I was betraying my brother, and I would be lucky if my family still wanted to see me if I decide to stay in touch with my dad. This hurt so much to hear. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am angry and would leave if I could, but I am 17 years old and have no money saved, not even a car. Am I wrong here? Is him being my dad not a good enough reason to want him in my life, despite the bad that he‚Äôs done? I don‚Äôt know what to do. If you guys could give me any advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it. And if u managed to read through all this mess thank you. I hope you all are having a better day than me, and if you have your family around give them all a hug.",26Feb2020,1

281,"At work I went to throw the garbage away and double checked with another employee if I could open the door as it had ‚Äúemergency exit‚Äù and ‚Äúalarm will sound‚Äù stickers on it.  The employee walked away as the door shut and I was locked inside of room/hallway.  The door had no knob or anything on it‚Äîit was flat.  I tried to grip what I could and open it.  I could not.  I rang a door bell, and no answer.  I shouted a few times for help, I even yelled out for the person as they walked away but they had on headphones.  

I did not have my phone and began to worry, so I ended up exiting out of the hallway through another door that led me outside. Once back inside the store, I explained to the employee that I got locked in and they began to yell at me.  I defended myself because I was uncertain of how to enter and exit out of that area because no one showed me.  The door is usually always open so I put the trash in the bin and exit.

283,"So this is gonna be a weird question considering that ""opinionated"" tends to have a lot of negative connotations. But I really feel out of place a lot because I do not feel I am opinionated about anything really. The only really strong opinion I have is my position on having kids in the future.

But I really never have anything to contribute when people talk about politics, world events,  etc. It's not because I'm uninformed. I keep up with news regularly and get stories from several sources and not just one. But, the caveat is that I took philosophy classes in university and they taught me how to think...holistically. For any given major discussion topic I have this problem where I obsess over seeing both sides of an issue. Consequently, I cannot for the life of me develop strong opinions on just about anything because I'm always at a ""on the one hand, but  on the other hand"" type of situation where I cannot ""side"" on the majority of things because they both have valid points I could agree with.

Im not trying to sound entitled to anything but I just need help on what to say to her shes acting like my manager and Iam doing fine with creating opportunity for myself in toronto, and she says I should not count anyone out but I already have an agency im with and they are very good to me, but she just wants me to maximize my opportunity to the sky here and some agencies don't take well to being with  3 others, and she calls me pessimistic when I try and explain it",26Feb2020,1

291,"**This is a pretty long speech so if you're not interested in reading something long, it's okay**

As a high school male Asian student, I've been pressured every day to do more than I can. Today, for example, my ACT score came out and I did a little bit worse than my first test (From a 33 to a 32). My mom started yelling what was going in my head while taking it and she started comparing me with others who ""cut out the practice problems they got wrong to look at later"" or how ""everyone in this test got good scores"". Now, I know this is clearly my fault and I definitely could have done better, but I have trouble concentrating while taking a test, especially a four hour one. 

What angers me so much is that whenever my mom yells at me for doing something wrong, she repeats the same thing she said in a different way at least five to seven more times. She would take small breaks in between to. I understand what I did wrong the first time she said it, but the fact that she repeats it over and over again makes me want to break something, but I can't because I've had those scenarios in the past because I couldn't take it anymore and it ended with my dad grabbing me by the collar of my shirt, ready to punch me.

Now, the reason why I stay silent whenever my parents yell at me for something I'm doing wrong is because as soon as I speak, tears already start flowing down, my voice already begins to quiver, and I start stuttering frequently. In my mind, I want none of this to happen because it makes me look like a coward, when I actually want to look serious. 

Lastly comes me as a person in general. From time to time, I start to think if people will care if I suddenly disappeared one day. I'm a junior, yet I'm already overweight, I have REALLY bad eyesight that I can barely see without my eyes, and I have almost no charisma. With this in mind, I just start to wonder if people would care if I died one day. 

Sorry for making this a long speech, but I thought you would need this background info to give the advice. I recently took a quiz on this website ([https://depression.org.nz/is-it-depression-anxiety/self-test/depression-test/](https://depression.org.nz/is-it-depression-anxiety/self-test/depression-test/)) and I got a score of 20 out of 27, which I think is moderately severe depression. I never thought of myself of being moderately severely depressed, but now that I'm seeing this, I'm not sure what to do. I'm 100% sure my parents would not let me do counseling because they would just claim I'm not depressed in the first place and that it's a waste of money (we're also barely financially stable so paying for counseling is probably not going to work). So now I'm here with my soul literally crumbling into pieces without anyone knowing because I don't know who to tell or what to do. What should I do?",26Feb2020,1

294,"So Im a college student who just failed two exams in about the span of a week and because of this I think I honestly lost my will to do anything even living. I have expressed this feelings with my friends and families and they all keep brushing it off as ‚Äúyou will be fine you alway think you failed tests but ending up doing well on them‚Äù which is admittedly true, I have tendency to call failures before getting the grades and ended up being wrong but this time it‚Äôs different and I know it. I wouldn‚Äôt say that Im a model student but up until this semester I have been able to fulfill my responsibility adequately enough to have a decent GPA (3.4 GPA not that good but not terrible). But after these two exams I know without a doubt that I failed, and I have 2 more coming up soon but I don‚Äôt feel like studying for them.

And I think its not just because that I failed these exams that demotivated me but also the fact that I don‚Äôt know if any of this is worth it. Im from a lower income family (I wouldn‚Äôt characterize myself as poor but definitely on the lower end of the spectrum) and everyone has big expectations for me to so well to bring myself and the family into middle class when all I really want is to play video games. I already have a part time job as retails and I feel like I just want to do that instead and make money to buy video games. I know I sound like a lazy and spoil brat right now but these are my honest feelings. I don‚Äôt know if I can keep going and the thought of keep going give me so much depressions. Even right now the thing that I wanted to do the most is to sit in a corner and cry because I hate myself and hate the situations Im in right now. but unfortunately my apartment are too small that I can‚Äôt do that without people noticing.

 I've composed maybe 10 songs throughout my junior year but didn't release anything given A) having very little money to my name and B) just not knowing where to go. I know DistroKid and Bandcamp exist, but I'm not sure if the $20 is even worth it if I barely get any plays. Is it stupid to find an agent? I'm legally an adult now, so my folks can't keep the money at least! 

I'd prefer to stay as relatively anonymous as possible. I know people who have fame and it's not as glamorous as people make it out to be. If I can make some decent money.. like 3k/mo from my music, I'd be happy. That could give me some cushion and allow me to basically do whatever.. I just don't know if it's the best choice.

310,"So I‚Äôm a 19 year old guy, and I have a girl friend who‚Äôs also 19. We‚Äôve known each other legitimately longer than I can remember, and I never saw her as anything more than a friend until a couple years ago. I asked her out, I shit you not we had the most movie-esque date in history. We drove out to this frozen lake, I blasted some music from my car, and we went out and danced on the lake, obviously kissing eventually, everything about that night was perfect. The night ended after that and it ended up being a one off thing, which sucked for me because that night pretty much solidified the fact that I was massively into her.

Fast forward to today, we go to the same college, she‚Äôs been dating this guy for a little under a year now, I‚Äôm still head over heels for her for god knows why. She‚Äôs out of the blue started asking to come over and watch a movie or binge a show or go get dinner practically every day and I can‚Äôt really explain why.

The thing is, I‚Äôm not a piece of shit and I could never even imagine trying to get her to cheat, especially knowing the implications that would have if we ever dated.

So, my gf and I are both 18, she's a Christian girl and I'm an atheist. 

We've been together for about 10/11 months and there's all that pre-marital sex being considered a sin and wrongful, we have sex anyways, I couldn't care less about religion rules, but I care about my gf psique and well being.

She says that deep down she feels it's wrong, but I don't want to try to make her into an atheist or something like that, but I do t want her feeling bad about it either.

So I came up with a solution..

Everything is relative, and the words, meanings and conceptions of the world are made up by us.
What was considered marriage centuries ago or even in different cultures are not the same. 
In the Bible I don't see a definition, so we can make it ourselves, one that fits us.
If we dance in a circle, spit in the middle and call it marriage, then it is another way of looking at it, or even if we just agree that we're married, that should count, right?

I know it's not common to think that, but as everything is relative and simbolic, we can make our own significances.

322," My(25f) boyfriend(25m) broke up with me because I never wanted kids and now I'm confused about my life

To be honest, we only dated for 2 months. From the very beginning he told me he wanted a serious relationship but didn't mention about having kids or anything. One day, I told him I'd never wanted kids and he tried to ignore it at first but then several days ago he brought it up saying he felt like we were ignoring the elephant in the room. So, just like that, we broke up. As we only dated for 2 months, I'm more confused than I'm sad. We really really liked each other but I feel like we've been through a lot just for 2 months.

I felt it was pretty unfair at first, because even though I've never wanted to have kids, I also somehow was thinking if I find the right person, maybe yes one day, I'll have a kid with him maybe when I'm in my mid 30s, or maybe not. I thought I had not even been given enough time to get to know him better if he was actually the right person I could have a baby with, but me being really confused about it was surely not enough for him. He wants to start a family in 3 years and I do understand why he chose to break up with me now.

The reason I have never wanted kids is that, I just am never sure if I could mentally and financially support them. I'm so scared of me not being able to support them and I'm not so sure about my future career and stuff. I think I'm still far too young to think about it and.. I just simply can't imagine myself having kids and becoming someone's mother... and creating another human being is just so scary... and I know it might sound disrespectful to the women who have decided to have kids, but I feel like if I have a kid, I'd lose myself.. I don't know why, maybe because I was raised in a very patriarchal society (I would really appreciate if somebody out there explains to me about why it doesn't mean it's losing yourself because... I simply don't know, I've heard having kids doesn't me losing your values and everything and I respect their opinions towards having kids but it seems like I just simply don't get it)

on the other hand, he was different. He said having a family is the only thing he wants to do in life. He just wants family and kids and wants to start a family in 3 years.

Now, I'm really confused about my life. I've always thought not having a kid is my fate, but what if I keep losing these people I love or I might be in love just because I don't want kids? or at first I don't want kids at all then my husband agrees on it then get married and realise I actually want to have kids then he disagrees? what if I change my mind and it's already too late?.. He told me 25 is the age we should make our life decisions, but I feel like I'm still far too young for that. Is it really wrong not to want kids? what if I never change my mind or what if I change my mind but it's too late and regret?.. I just really need help because I'm paranoid...",26Feb2020,1

Well, first off my GM is in the hospital bcs she had a heart attack and was already doing a surgery or Operation ( i dont know the real details).

She is really old and strong but everyone in my family is scared and I plan to visit her today after school, just being with her and talking, maybe I can take my switch with me and play something with her or maybe chess if she knows how to play it.

Yeah... that's my problem

I have actually no idea how to use my time with her bcs it's rare that I do something with my family.

My father told me to buy something for her but I dont want, I am sure using time is more important than using money for someone u love and someone who is really old, so my question is just, how should I spend my time with my grandmother in the hospital and maybe after the hospital

327,So i am only 17 years old. (M) And i want to do big things with my life. For one i want to march for a college marching band. But i dont wanna actually attend the college. Because i don't know what i want to major in. Which is why i want to pursue acting/modeling gigs as well. I want to get paid to entertain people. But at the same time i want to share my singing voice with the world. On top of that i am currently unemployed. I had a seasonal job but it didn't last. I want a good job so i can travel the world. And i want to have fun and expand my mind and break out of this boxed in life. There is so much shit i want to do and i dont wanna miss a single opportunity. So my question is how do i balance and focus on these things without stressing too hard and having burn out???,26Feb2020,1
328,"Hi everyone, so my dad is wanting to get his GED so he can apply for a better job than the one has has. He hasn't been in school since the mid 80's and he never had to learn algebra so that part has him nervous regarding the GED test.

I have a bachelor's degree in Theatre, I'm currently in a masters program for Psychology and I'm a substitute teacher. I haven't necessarily had to do algebra in many years, and it's been so long since I first started learning it, I can't remember what techniques my teachers used to help me retain the info at the very beginning, or even what the first bits of material were.

I told my dad I would help him learn, but I'm not sure where to start. He has never had to do any kind of algebra at all in his life so I wouldn't want to accidentally start him with something that is kind of difficult just because it's easy for me.

Any advice on where to get started? Thank you in advance!",26Feb2020,1

I‚Äôve never Thought I might be depressed before but the way life is recently is causing me to visually see things different.

I‚Äôve tried to help myself by trying to be positive and productive and it works for a few days but eventually I go back to being pessimistic and self conscious. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where in class I cannot focus on the lectures because all that‚Äôs going through my head is thoughts like, ‚Äúam I sitting weird right now, I wonder if people are thinking about me right now, they‚Äôre probably thinking of how fidgety I am right now‚Äù
Even when I‚Äôm talking to someone normally and they say something that makes me laugh I immediately start thinking ‚Äúwas I supposed to laugh at that, does my face look sarcastic, they probably think I‚Äôm an asshole‚Äù

My boyfriend has a high earning remote job, and we don't have any debts and I own the house we live in.

It does sounds like a good idea for me, but I somehow feel this is wrong. There is a negative stigma over being a stay-at-home wife,  like I'm throwing away a good deal of feminist achievements.

353,"I (25F) live at home along with my brother while I wrap up nursing school because the cost of living is tragic where we live. 

Some back story: my parents divorced back in 2018 after 25 years of marriage. My mom bought a house. My younger brother, sister, and I chose to live with our mother. (My dad struggles with his mental health‚Äîthat and he wanted to charge us $900 a room to cover the cost of his alimony) so mom was the obvious choice.

Both parents immediately went on a dating rampage post-divorce. My dad has had like 10+ girlfriends, one of which he was engaged to after 2 weeks (which did not end up working out thankfully). My mom dated quite a few men, but ended up setting for the guy she‚Äôs with now. 

My moms boyfriend is nice. Granted, his own divorce is not finalized yet, he has a lot of debt and 6 children, (2 of which are still in grade school). He tries to respects my space and doesn‚Äôt push me or tell me his opinions‚Äîbonus points. I think he‚Äôs slightly intimidated by me tho, I can‚Äôt really tell.

The point is, I understand that people cope with divorce differently. I want my parents to move on, even if that means dating other people. 
What I don‚Äôt understand is their need to immediately jump into new relationships. 

I find it annoying that my mom and her bf can‚Äôt spend one day away from each other. If he‚Äôs not here, then she‚Äôs over there. I think it‚Äôs annoying that sends her flowers, buys her gifts, they rub each other‚Äôs backs and kiss in front of me (I literally cannot be in the same room when they do that. Blech.) It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre 16 again or something! I don‚Äôt understand how they‚Äôre so obsessed with each other!? It seriously seems so forced to me for some reason. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I have my own unacknowledged insecurities about dating. Or if I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still not quite over my parents divorce... I really hope it‚Äôs not either of those things. 

What I‚Äôve concluded is that, I struggle associating myself with disingenuous people. I used to have a lot of respect for my mom and her decisions, but the way she‚Äôs been acting, she‚Äôs a completely different person. My mom and I have always butt heads a bit, but can usually eventually get around it‚Äînot lately tho (and I can acknowledge that it‚Äôs probably my own fault).

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm justified in my feelings. Or if I‚Äôm not, how to get over them. I think I need to just move out, but that‚Äôs not really an option rn. I‚Äôve tried discussing things with my mom, we‚Äôre good at communicating, it‚Äôs just we both feel justified so what else is there to say? My mom does try to respect my feelings, but at the same time she tells me things like, ‚ÄòJohn and I are looking at rings. I want you (me and my siblings) and John to be friends and spend time together. I‚Äôm inviting John‚Äôs kids over so that we can spend time together.‚Äô 

Am I crazy? Can anyone else relate? Where do I go from here? Suck it up until I can move out? Blech.",26Feb2020,1
354,"My dad (61) and I (21F) got into a fight about some mundane shit but the only reason the argument arose was because he was talking to me so disrespectfully. I‚Äôve been verbally abused by my dad since I was a child and I have told him so many times that I‚Äôm much more receptive to what is said to me when it is said with respect. I don‚Äôt like being told to shut up, and that I‚Äôm stupid; especially by my dad. I have been going through a lot mentally and when he was calling me these things I just broke down; i don‚Äôt typically take words to heart but it stings when it comes from parents. I told him to not speak to me like that, that it hurts the most coming from him and said ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt realize till I‚Äôm dead motherfucker‚Äù. I said it almost as a cry for help, that his constant insults will lead me to a breaking point, but he then told me he didn‚Äôt want to ever see me again, and it‚Äôs been 3 months since I‚Äôve seen or spoken to him. 

He‚Äôs done this to me twice before, when I was in elementary and high school. I had to try to adapt living without him 3 times now and it just hurts. I want to reach out to him, and I just want to tell him that he would be so mad if I tolerated someone speaking to me the way he does. He is the primary role model of what a man/father/husband is to me. I don‚Äôt want to grow up tolerant of verbal abuse from my partner when I grow up. I don‚Äôt want to subconsciously seek comfort in the toxicity experienced as an adolescent. 

My dad is from Iran and moved here when he was 19, but was raised in a strict household where his dad was 10x more abusive than he was and although my dads parenting style isn‚Äôt one that I would implement with my children once I have them, but I also don‚Äôt blame him for how he is because of who he is. I‚Äôm empathetic of the extremely hard but successful life he‚Äôs built for himself and what I had said to him was fucked up, but i don‚Äôt think I deserve how he‚Äôs treating me. If this is is all just for a lesson it‚Äôs not the right way to do it, and if he meant it then I guess I need to try living on without him. 

My parents have been divorced since I was 2 and I had only seen him on the weekends, and I‚Äôm just not ready to lose my dad yet. For the last few months I‚Äôve been so sad, i feel so hopeless, worthless... any advice is appreciated and much needed",26Feb2020,1
355,"Let me preface this with: i very much know I am not perfect, however I know I am an all-star in my career and have actually told myself this will be the last role I take like this because I need something way more challenging. I have specialized in my last 2 companies and have stellar feedback from them. 

I started my current job 4 months ago. I have moved around our department to fully learn all roles within our team. My latest move has me sitting with someone in sort of a leadership roll and helping out since their counterpart is on vacation. This person treats me like I am helplessly stupid. He treats everyone on our team like they are incompetent, but I have noticed several gestures that make   him think I too am not worthy enough to be in his ranks (which is laughable because this is a junior role). Anyway, my manager also sits close by and she has started also treating me this way, as his attitude seems fairly contagious and he seems to have sway with her. 

I am noticing it is really messing with me and stroking my imposter syndrome. It puts me in a position where I dont want to own small mistakes or oversights, which I am totally ok with otherwise. Ex. Typos when coding something! Oops lol

Anyway, how do I get him to either a) stfu b) stop acting like i am dumb (ex. I asked a question about configuring an app our team uses, as it is fairly locked down and then he literally shoulder surfs me and gives me the newbiest of newb instructions that had literally nothing to do with what I asked, like as newb as typing into a word doc level).",26Feb2020,1

 A)  try RAM in every possible configuration ( 1 slot each card, both slots both cards ) with complete power offs in between 

B) Removed CMOS battery, power supply cord and any usb slot for extened periods of time

C )  Removed graphics card, sata ports, and 24 pin + 8 pin power supply to mobo

I have not checked my CPU as i feel like it hasn't been messed with, beside a couple nudges on my air cooler, and it seems evident my RAM or MOBO are at fault. PLEASE, does someone have any more troubleshooting or help, before I file for the warranty? Thanks in advance.

357,"It sounds bad but it isn't nearly as bad as you might think. I was out with a friend and had too much to drink. We got in the car and I started to back up, but turned too soon and scraped the car next to us. I immediately decided two things - I was too drunk to drive and we had to GTFO. We swapped seats real fast and got out of there. I know it was a shitty thing to do. We pulled over a few miles away and looked at the damage. We actually had to physically pop some things back in place, but after doing so it essentially amounts to a cracked bumper and some scrapes on the corner. The car next to us had a few long scrapes on the back side paneling. I feel shitty about it and regret doing that, but in the moment I was not prepared to stop and put my information on the windshield. I just felt like we had to get out as fast as possible. Now it's damage control. I don't want to take this to my insurance company and I definitely don't want my parents to find out (they essentially own the car but let me drive it as my own).

Long story short I am an underachieving student, I rarely ever dip below average of the class scores, but I'm not completely average in class either, I simply do what is enough and I am currently passing all my classes, and really do what is needed for the passing grade without any sort of effort. I just do what is instructed that will get me the passing grade and i won't go above it. I'm really not worth much at school.

I have a parent teacher meeting with my father in 2 days and this is the first one he has attended in 10 years, all those other years he avoided attending and my mother would go in his place. However during those times where he did not go to my Parent Teacher Meetings he would go to my younger brother's meetings (1 yr younger). Due to family circumstances over the past 2 months my father has returned home, and this is the first time ever since I was 12 my father has stayed at home for more then 2 weeks. My father has never reacted well to any sort of mistake or flaw in anything I would do, so really ever since I was kid I wasn't particularly allowed to make mistakes because no matter how big or small I would be punished intensely. He would also have a rule in the house where ""There are no such things as accidents"" where accidents and mistakes that I made would all entirely be my fault. I remember one vivid instance when I was around 7 or so and I bumped into my younger brother in the house while we were playing and he hurt himself, my parents were present when it happened and I tried explaining it was an accident but all I could remember is them saying there is no such things as accidents and they began shouting at me, I dont remember what was said when they started shouting but I so remember feeling really really scared of them. Funnily enough I remember when I was I kid I hurt myself and cut my leg on a sharp rock and I went to my parents and to my surprise they shouted at me for injuring myself, these weren't lectures of any sort meant to educate your child by any means, they were all just out right name calling and verbal degradation. I start to realise how messed up my family life was when I was a kid looking back on things I used to blame myself for when I was a kid since I used to believe and care about everything they said back then. I remember as a kid I was having trouble with some homework or something and I asked my mom for help and my father wasn't around so she started getting really frustrated and angry that I didn't understand it since there was a bit of a communication barrier and she started cursing at me in english and thai and I could understand both languages to some extent and I knew she was saying words she shouldn't have been saying to a 8 year old. I was a slow learner when I was a kid so I would still ask for help from my mom and a few verbally and physically violent sessions after the other I finally learned asking for help is not a good idea.

So after those incidents I would hide all my mistakes and would avoid getting hurt at any cost or when I did I would either try and fix myself up for just hide from my parent. This style of parenting translated into school aswell I remember not understanding a few things in school but I never asked for help due to past experiences with parents and asking for help, so eventually I stopped asking for help and just figured things on my own or I never told anyone I dont know something.

The story with my father is that no matter what I did or how hard I tried ever since I was a kid nothing was enough for him, he would always find some flaw or error in me, be it academic, physical or me as an individual, usually saying how stupid, or useless, or how helpless I was as a kid.

At school I eventually stopped trying, stopped caring, and that leads me to my current situation. This is the first time in years my father has come to my parent teacher meeting in years, and I'm already pretty stressed out about it since I know how my father is already going to react, and despite telling myself that i dont care a part of me does care but I know that it wont Matter since no matter how hard I can try or what I do he will always repeat the same stuff he calls me afterwards.

398,"Disclaimer: i am not asking for legal or medical advice here, i simply want to know what documents/steps i would need to do this (you need XYZ to apply for a PRC, then you need WXYZ123 to apply for citizenship); sorry if this is the wrong sub. if this IS the wrong sub, would someone be able to tell me the appropriate one. i am looking for serious answers only, no ""Easy: don't move there/here"" jokes.  


So as it says, we want to move to Canada. we've looked it up about the PRC, and stuff like that, but what are the steps/documents we'd need for all of that? it also says something about wanting a job in the list of demanded jobs in Canada. will we not get PRC/Citizenship if we don't want/have a job in one of those fields? would we have to fly there, or could we drive our car across the border? would a school/work visa count as PRC if we worked or went to school and lived there while we did so?  


Obviously, this isn't going to happen for a few years, and our reasons for wanting this are our own so I'd appreciate it if we got no rude or judgemental comments. as of writing this, we have a 5 year old husky/malamute mix whos fully vaxxed and gets all her annual and monthly (rabies, flea and tick, etc) medicines as needed. she may not be alive by the time we can get to Cananda, but i will mention it now for any future pets we may have. i will say, one of the BIGGEST reasons we chose Canada is because we really don't want to put whatever pet we might have through the trouble of a 14 or more/less hour flight stuck in the cargo hold of a plane in a pet carrier. we're HOPING we can just drive to Canada (to the border if nothing else) and make our way to our chosen spot instead of having to fly and fly all of our belongings there. Also English is our first language, but do you honestly recommend learning French?   


We're looking for any and all advice on how to do this (because we're serious about it), but most of what we want to know would be:  


\- what steps do we need to take to get a PRC (and presumably how to get  a job/house/license/vehicle in Canada)  


\- what exact documents will we need to get a PRC/Citizenship (Passport obviously, but like... school/ work records, Social security card/birth certificate? vaccination/medical records? police history?) we've looked it up but were confused about the wording of it. it said something about a police certificate?  


\- Assuming we have a pet by then (either our baby we have now or another one), what documents will we need for the pet? will they have to be cleared for the border to come into canada?  


I will note that i am female to male transgender. I know for a fact that i will start transitioning before we ever get to move to Canada, so if anyone has any knowledge about what i would need for that specifically (court documents for my name change, therapists records?) would also be a great help to us.

400,"So tonight we all went out to get drinks at a bar in town, my 22 is today so I‚Äôm pretty pumped. We get out and we‚Äôre all having a good time and apparently one of our friends thinks my roommate calls her a ‚Äútrashy bitch‚Äù which he did not do as I was with him
the whole time. They start to get into it and I‚Äôm basically like ‚Äúdude it‚Äôs not worth it we‚Äôre all drunk lets just get out of here‚Äù so we leave and get back to my place.

401,"
I'm going to change a few details referring to me and my family of this for my privacy's sake.
I apologise for my bad formatting I'm new to reddit and i'm on mobile so, yeah.
Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So, backstory: I am a minor under 16, mother and father have been split apart for years - almost all my life (never really had him in my life other then yearly visits for like 2 weeks and irregular phone calls). 
Recently my mother and my step-father have broke up after 4 years, very messy with a court case upcoming and me at the centre of it all (irrelevant just know it was bad). 
Anyway fast forward to where I am now, we've moved out of my ex-stepfather's house and are now living in a rental in the same state. Mom had organised a holiday a month or so after the court date in order to get away from everything and clear our heads. 
Now this is where my Father steps in, my Mother organised the holiday for the week after the school holidays finished(no other booking dates would work) without consulting him first at all, which I sort of understand because he virtually does nothing but pay child support and calls us once a week(as it's always been). However, what has happened has been quite traumatizing for me especially, and my Dad disagrees that we should be taking a holiday the month after court away from counselling, and (mainly) away from school for that short week or so - in the finish he refused to sign the passport papers unless we changed the date of this holiday to some time in the next school holidays. 

When Mom finds this out she is, furious. She pretty much hates my father. 
Dad was(understandably) angry finding out what happened (with my step father)and has apparently been quite abusive to her over messages, insensitive, and thinks what happened to me was her fault(from what I've heard) and this has resulted in her blocking him (which plays a part later).

Continuing, so my mother is v e r y angry with my father. She's also furious with my sister and I, for apparently not ""sticking up for her"" and telling him to ""fuck off"" and that we want this holiday to happen. 
I did say to him that it's just a week, and that it doesn't really matter that much when he first discussed with me that he disagreed to it. But, I figured when he'd told me (especially in the collected way he told me he's disagreeing with signing passport papers for us to go) they were going to talk it out like adults over email and that my Dad would come to understand that it was just a week and that we'd be fine and it would be beneficial for us.

So today, she gets home and I tell her about  messages I'd received from him (still reaffirming he disagreed with it and that he'd only sign the papers if she moved the holiday).
 The main problem here being, we can't.
We are already a bit tight on money right now but mom poured all our savings into this holiday so we could manage to get away from all the shit that's gone on, and in no way can you get this money back from the company now as it's all been paid for. 

So she explodes for the second time. She tells me that I specifically have to call him and tell him that he's being an asshole, we want to go on this holiday and that we can't get a refund so the money will be going down the drain and that we should be standing  up to him for this.
But I don't want to.
I feel like I - a minor who's stressed enough right now because of the whole ex-stepfather situation that I shouldn't be the messenger for their disagreements. They should be talking this and their disagreements out like adults instead of airing it out between us and arguing second hand. I feel like they should sort this out between them and only them.

My mother says there is no speaking with my father, but she has him blocked so they're currently sending lengthy and angry emails to eachother and speaking second hand between my brother and I.

I stood there, unsure of what to do for a few minutes after she went off at me, and then I said I'm going to go take a shower. 
She told me no, and that I am g o i n g to call him and I was going to do it now. I walked out of the loungeroom, stressed and overwhelmed and I just decided screw it and that I was going to shower to try and calm down and maybe I would give in and make the call when I'm done.

I love my mother way more then my father and I feel like she's gotten this idea into her head that I want to go live with him, and that because I dont want to get involved that somehow i agree with him and am on his side or something.

She left the house because I left the room and had a shower against what she said. Here I am now a few hours later, I have not heard from my Mom but my brother has and apparently she's coming home soon. I'm a bit angry with her for trying to make us argue with our own dad, but do I even have the right to be? I can certainly see where she's coming from but is she doing the right thing by trying to make us argue with him that we want the holiday? I want to go but I just don't want to argue with my Dad for my mom who wont even unblock him.

*TL;DR : Am I an asshole for not wanting to stand up for my mom?( who is almost forcefully making my sister and I argue with my dad who won't let us go on holiday for a week at the start of the school term after a traumatic few months)*

What do I do? Am I being an asshole? Should I have stuck up for my mother? Do I have the right to be angry? I think my Moms angry with me right now and I'm feeling like a really awful person. I want to go on this holiday and I'm stressed enough right now about others things 

Thanks for reading anyway",26Feb2020,1
402,"hi i‚Äôm 19 i still live with my parents and about a year ago they found out I was sexually active with my bf of one year. they reacted in a way I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around, they called me a whore and nasty names and told me that now any men (including my bf) isn‚Äôt going to want me because he got what he wanted. when in reality it was a choice we both made out of love for each other. they‚Äôre very christian and tell me that I am going to suffer the consequences of god etc. but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ones to talk because when they were together they didn‚Äôt save themselves (nothing wrong with that it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre being hypocritical about the whole situation). they went through my phone.

405,"I remember when I was a teenager, just a picture of a naked Pam Anderson was enough to get me going for days. The fact that she had big fake canonball tits didn't bother me at all. Nothing really did. Everything was exciting.

But as the years have gone on, I find I am impressed less and less. This has likely been exacerbated by my training and job as a doctor. I have now over the past 10 years seen and done things medically to so many people that likely go beyond the scope of what any normal person outside of my field or perhaps a sex worker would experience in their life span.

This goes for both men and women's bodies. 

There was a time giving a rectal/prostate exam to a man would make me mildly uncomfortable. Now I've stuck my finger in so many people's asses of both genders it's pretty much a completely neutral experience. Not much different than listening to a heartbeat.

I've seen thousands of people in various states of undress. 

I've done countless manual pelvic exams on women to feel for pelvic muscle dysfunction, infections, cervix abnormalities, and ovarian masses. I've done so many speculum exams for paps I couldn't begin to count. Ditto with breast exams.

I know what the spectrum of human anatomy looks and feels like inside and out from birth to 90 years old and everywhere between.

I know people would probably like to believe this isn't the case,  but when you start out in this type of field you're not machine-like. There was a time even the notion of doing a breast exam made my heart beat a bit faster. The first pap I did my heart was pounding so much just from nervousness and also I hadn't really seen many women naked at all at that time. Now it's literally just tissue to be sorted through and analyzed. The only nervousness I have now is if I will be making the person I'm examining uncomfortable or not.

The neutralization of the body in my mind probably makes me more ideal as a doctor. Most people would like a doctor who sees them as a neutral body. But I think it's changing my perspective on dating and sex too. Porn has become boring. Masturbation is boring. Dating is boring.

I was out at a club grinding with a girl and while my dick got hard from it, that was really just an involuntary response. I didn't really actually care the whole time. I kept thinking she needed to lose 10 lb as I felt her hips because (1) all I do all day is try to find and analyze physical flaws and what people can do to be healthier and (2) I've seen and been around so much it's almost impossible for anyone to really be impressive to me physically.

I remember when I was a resident working in a breast clinic, one of the husbands of a patient made a joking comment about how it must be an amazing job to just feel up women's breasts all day. I think that's how other men might see it. But that's not the reality at this point. For example, I calculated and I will have to do over 40 hours of paps (which often also include a breast exam as that is the most opportune time to screen both) in the next 2-3 months to catch up my patient population for the year. It's literally just a chore that will eat into the rest of my schedule and it's going to be a grind to get them all booked in and done.

How do you get excited about sex or dating when the human body has literally become just a chore to you?

It seems to me like you can't have it both ways. If the human body is exciting and new then you're not the objective and neutral doctor people want. And once you've seen so much it becomes boring then how do you excited about it again?

I guess maybe this is just an inevitable change that occurs from doing this sort of thing. I really don't know. I just know it's hard to get excited about dating or sex when almost nothing excites you anymore. I kind of miss the days when the body was an exciting and uneasy thing. That uneasiness is where sexual tension, fantasy, and desire comes from.

How do you have those things once the mystery is pretty much completely gone?",26Feb2020,1
406,"To elaborate, I (22f) went out for a drink with a teacher I had in high school and it turned inappropriate. He attended my brothers graduation party a few months back, as my brother and I graduated from the same HS and knew him from there, and struck up a conversation with my brothers friends and me. When it was all over the teacher asked me if I wanted to go get a drink with him and I said yes. 

At first, I felt kind of odd about it as I never even took a class with this guy but just knew of him because I went to such a small school. But still I trusted him because of his very good and cool reputation amongst students. When we got there he bought me hard liquor and beer, and mind you this is after he had seen me  drinking a good amount just a little while ago. Things began to get weird as he kept complimenting my looks and touching my shoulder or my leg. At that point I went to the bathroom and felt so utterly creeped out. 

It‚Äôs important to know too that he was saying some very damning things about the other teachers I had in hs, aka his coworkers. But one comment he made about one of the teachers was particularly vile. He basically said that certain female teacher needed violent sexual acts done to her in order to fix her attitude. I don‚Äôt want to say what he said specifically because I don‚Äôt want to reveal myself if I do decide to tell school administrators. He also said this to me multiple times throughout the night and even said it to my brothers friends, who were barely a month graduated from that school at that point. So you could see how that would freak me the fuck out to be intoxicated with someone 25 years older than me while he wishes sexual violence on another woman. Not to mention he‚Äôs married.

At the end of the night, he took me home and nothing further happened. I felt incredibly shaken but wanted to forget all about it because how could such a well-respected teacher and mentor, whom I really trusted, ever act so inappropriately towards me? But of course! I tried my best to justify it but a few days of not being able to get it out of my head I decided that  it was fucking wrong and unacceptable so I blocked him on every social media platform where I had him as a friend. 

Flash forward a few months and my brother tells me of his female friend who told him that this same teacher had also said some slightly inappropriate things to her while she was a student. He asked her personal questions about her boyfriend and stated that they would never last. He also had her as  a friend on Facebook while she was still in school with him. Which IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING AND NOT ALLOWED if you know anything about teacher/student boundaries regarding social media. When I heard this I thought wow that‚Äôs fucked up and was mad for a minute but then forgot about it.

A few days ago I was doing a mandated reporter training which taught me how to spot possible child molesters or abusers in an educational setting. And I couldn‚Äôt help but feel my heart sink and alarms were going off in my head and the first thing I thought of was that fuckin teacher.

Now I‚Äôm stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I want so badly to bring this up with the schools administrators to get some more eyes on him but on the other hand I am very scared of the repercussions and possible retaliation.",26Feb2020,1

410,"I've been thinking about this since my coworker is maybe a narcissist. He always puts some new acquaintance on a pedestal and then gets bored of them and is cold. He's very entitled, greedy but also kind of a people pleaser and wants everyone's attention. Very skilled with his words and people would instantly like him at first. What I don't get is that he's not that attractive and is slightly overweight. Yet he thinks he's a gift to the world. He serial dates average girls and thinks he can get anyone. He's also arrogant and gets angry easily. If someone disrespects him he will revenge. He's self aware that he has these bad sides but doesn't seem to care enough to change.

412,"   Backstory; my (25 F), older brother (31 M) is a sociopath. Clinically was diagnosed with other antisocial personality disorder. Has killed 2 of my cats growing up, ( I thought they both ran away until my mother told me the truth recently) and used me and my little brother (20 M) as personalized punching bags. 
 

   Concussions, broken ribs, and he drowned me and to the point where I had to be resuscitated by a lifeguard once.

  Needless to say, I moved out at 18, and haven‚Äôt visited home (even though I went to a local university) ever since. Not for Christmas. Not for birthdays. He almost killed me on 3 separate occasions. Stabbed my arm at the last one, where I finally (against my parents‚Äô wishes because ‚Äòhe‚Äôd get kicked out of his Ivy League grad school‚Äô) called the cops, and he was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. 

  He was in prison 2 weeks before my parents essentially coerced me into dropping the charges. 

   It‚Äôs been 3 years and the only family member I‚Äôve seen since then was my dad, who recently told me my brother was engaged. Has been for a year apparently, and getting married soon. I just found out today. 

  My dad sent me screenshots of his conversations with his fianc√©e. Apparently his fianc√©e thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous his family abused him his entire life, neglected him and don‚Äôt want any part of his wedding. She called my dad a shitty parent, even though he continues to pay for my brothers life. (Housing, food, etc.). 

   I‚Äôm furious. I asked for her number. I want to tell her I‚Äôve been in the hospital 7 times because of him. I‚Äôm in therapy for the rest of my life because of him....That when any male goes to high five me I flinch, because of him. 

  Not only to set her straight...but I‚Äôm scared for her. My brother is charming. He won prom king, homecoming king, and was extremely popular in my high school. Extremely charismatic. I‚Äôm scared that‚Äôs the illusion she sees. I feel I should warn her? I‚Äôm also scared to get involved because I‚Äôm still scared of the repercussions, even though I‚Äôm an adult now and he has no access to my address or phone number.

413,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am a 19 M, currently enrolled in college with the idea of taking a summer co-OP, as it is mandatory with my course. I have been suffering with depression and anxiety for about 2 1/2 years now. I didn't even realize it a first. Depression slowly seeps into you zapping out the drive to do anything. While in high school I used to do a lot of activities. Then I started cutting some and by college I dropped all of them. My anxiety grew worse as I isolated myself from friends and family. I truly have no friends and barely any aquitences. What people really don't tell you about depression is the toll it takes on your body and mind. I can't study, my memory is garbage. I feel like I'll read something and in a few minutes it's gone. I'm constantly exhausted, but can't sleep. My own thoughts and anxiety keep me awake. I'm afraid to go outside, to talk to others, to go to class. I have no idea how attractive I am. Theoretically I know that I am not completely ugly, yet I can't look at myself and name positive aspects objectively. 
Now to the actual situation. In the fall I opened up to my parents about my depression. They were supportive. I was set to get medication and start seeing a therapist. The medication, when I started to take it, did little to help? And it gave me migraines during the night. So intense I would press my head against the window and ice to cool it. The intail meeting with my first therapist didn't pan out, and somehow despite promising myself to find a new one I've successful not done that since I am an idiot. I know objectively that what I am doing is bad, and self destructive. Now my mother has noticed that there has been no bills to our medical insurance for the therapist, and I'm tired of lying to her. My grades are slipping. I can't being myself to do homework, to study, and to sometimes even go to class. 
I am asking for any advice on my situation. How do I tell my parents I've been lying to them? How do I keep myself from slipping further into depression? Should I take a break from college?",26Feb2020,1
414,"Ok so me and this girl have been friends for over a year now, and I‚Äôve had feelings for her for a while now. She found out a couple months back, like October time, and when she asked me about it, I told her that I didn‚Äôt want it to ruin the relationship we already had so we stayed friends. Now a couple weeks ago, she told me that I was her crush, but she didn‚Äôt wanna get into a relationship because she broke up with her bf of 2 months the day before New Year‚Äôs Eve, he dumped her.

Ok so now it‚Äôs the present, and I asked her if she still had feelings for me and she told me she didn‚Äôt because I was moving to fast and my feelings were a lot stronger than hers. I understood cause I had been thinking the same thing. Also, she told me a bit before that that one of her kinks is being dominated, like not beaten or degraded, just kinda like that daddy stuff and shit. She told me that I don‚Äôt have it in me to be like that and I‚Äôm more soft. I think I do cause I don‚Äôt wanna be the smaller one I‚Äôm a relationship and being dominant is one of my kinks as well I guess. She said it was mainly my lack of confidence but I‚Äôm only really like this cause I don‚Äôt wanna push her boundaries. 

But anyway, I asked her if there‚Äôs any chance she could get feelings for me again and she said she didn‚Äôt know. So I wanna ask her if we can start again, like if we can just go from a week ago when we both had feelings for each other and nothing bad had really happened. I don‚Äôt know when to do it though. If I do it tonight. It‚Äôll kinda seem desperate cause this happened on Monday. But it‚Äôs also good cause On Friday, I might be going round her house with 2 other friends, which means I might be able to stay a bit longer and we can cuddle or some shit.

If I do it on Friday though, it‚Äôll seem like I‚Äôve had more time to think about it. But I also probably won‚Äôt get to stay a bit longer. Either way it‚Äôll have to be over text cause we both go to same sex schools and are quite far away from each other. So I just need some advice on when to do it.

Any help is appreciated, thanks

Also, by more dominant, I mean like, making more decisions and choices cause before, I always asked for her opinion and shit and what she thinks, just to make her feel comfortable. I‚Äôm not gonna be a prick about it or anything, just kinda think for myself a bit more. But yeah thanks",26Feb2020,1

I remember being in a shitty mood that day when she showed me and told her I didn't like the house, so she passed on it. My mom really loved it though and tried to talk to me into it, and for whatever reason I was just like no I don't like it. It was higher than the price she was looking for anyways. I will call this House 1. 

Fast forward a couple months later she's still looking and becoming more desperate. We visit this house, 4 bed, 3 bath with a great view. It's definitely not as big as the first house I described, but it was in a nicer neighborhood. The bathrooms were older. Nonetheless, I personally thought it was still beautiful and told her I loved the house and she should act quickly since it was in a desirable area. She purchased it and has been living there for a year now. I will call this House 2. 

My mom recently told me my dad is going to move in with her and they are going to rent out my dad's house. Well, now I'm feeling guilty and regretful on the advice I gave her originally on which house to purchase. She really valued my opinion. I was looking through the listing again and can't help but lament my original take on House 1. It's considerably bigger, and it ended up selling for the same price that my mom purchased her current house. The bathrooms are also newer and remodeled, and it has a patio which her current house doesn't. I just feel like I was too rash and gave her poor advice. In the long term, we probably won't be able to fit both my sister and my own families in my mom's current house (House 2) whereas we definitely could in House 1. When I've gone to visit my mom or stay there, it does sometimes feel cramped just because we're bigger people. It was hard to anticipate that when just touring the house the first time. 

I didn't mention anything to my mom about this, it's just an internal, guilt-ridden struggle I'm having with myself. Neither of my parents want to move again anytime soon, so I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to reconcile this struggle within my own mind.",26Feb2020,1
421,"So small background to start, I‚Äôm Emma I‚Äôm 18 and was recently diagnosed with depression and put on antidepressants. I live with guardians, I was put on a guardianship order a good couple of years ago (I actually can‚Äôt remember when) I was put into care almost 11 years ago, just a couple months before my 8th birthday and I had contact with my birth parents three times a year. At 16 I was given permission by my guardians to send messages every now and again to my mother. 

I turned 18 last July, which by then you are out of the care system, you can stay on with your carers if you so wish, or you can move out. Since my birthday, I‚Äôve seen my parents out of contact arrangements about 5/6 times and since the last time, I‚Äôve struggled to cope, I just want to stay with them permanently, I had a massive breakdown two days after my last visit, I just wanted to pack up my stuff and go. But I have things stopping me. One, my guardians, guardian mum makes me feel guilty about wanting to spend time with my mum and dad and says I‚Äôm doing it to make them feel bad, and then two, my dog, I picked her up when I was 15 and didn‚Äôt know the problems it would cause now. If I move out, I have to take her with me, my birth parents have two cats that are scared of big dogs and then there‚Äôs where I am now with my guardians where they will get rid of her if i don‚Äôt take her which isn‚Äôt fair on the other dog that has been with her for the whole four years we‚Äôve had them.

Mentally. I want to get away from all this but I can‚Äôt. My guardians won‚Äôt keep the dog and make me feel guilty about doing anything that involves being with my birth parents. I really don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm really struggling. I can‚Äôt justify it, I‚Äôm always ‚Äúmaking up excuses‚Äù in their mind but really I‚Äôm depressed and can‚Äôt cope. Help please.",26Feb2020,1
422,"Hi everyone, hope you are all doing well. I don't know what is urging me to share such a post, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I know it's not exactly a question, but I would appreciate any insight. Thank you to everyone who reads it.

I am a 23 year old currently in medical school. Despite the never-ending exams and immense amount of information we learn, I am doing quite well! I can't ask for much more and I am truly blessed to be in the position I am as I worked very hard for it. Medical school has become seemingly more difficult and competitive to enter these days

However, I have many more ambitions. For example, call this an ambition or baggage, but I want to become fluent in my mother tongue. I wish to be able to communicate on a deeper level with my grandparents before its too late. I wish to be able to talk to my mother without having to hold back my exact feelings because of a language barrier. I am quite shameful when it comes to this, but I want to be in tune with my roots. With this, I just started allocating time into studying the language everyday.

But this is difficult as not only am I trying to do my best in school, but I am also preparing for one of the most important standardized exams of my career. This exam carries an enormous weight on which doctor I will become and it's looming just around the corner, 1.5 years from now. If I was putting in the same effort to studying the language, I bet I'd be fluent a lot quicker...

On top of this, I am trying to manage a 7 month relationship as it's been rocky and quite frankly a lot of time in limbo. Man... adult relationships are tough. All it takes is one emotional situation that leads to a lot of time spent and my whole schedule awry leading to some burnout as I catch up by sacrificing other factors whether it be sleep, exercise, etc... With my ambitions, I have to stick religiously to my schedule or I won't be able to fulfill my goals. How nice would it be if there was a tangible ""map"" or equation to relationships, just plug it in and see if it works

As I live by medicine now, I realize healthcare is becoming more and more political. I've accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt into my career path, I study hours on ends in a chair, and you're telling me that you want to make things more dramatic... I'm not gonna lie, but sometimes I question if I made the right choice. Sometimes my envisionment of becoming the ideal doctor becomes tainted

And there are times when I wish to just leave this high-stress and uptight environment. I wish I can buy a sailboat and just leave the system. Mom, dad, I'm sorry but I'm not kidding. This has also been a fantasy my entire life. I get a rush just thinking about it. A sense of freedom. I've been in school for 18 years and I'm about in it and married to a system even longer. I watch these youtube channels where this is their life. These people are physically exploring the world while I am mentally exploring, in a chair, for hours upon ends. I am so jealous. I feel restless, is it my youth? Maybe it isn't reality, but it could be, right? I wish to explore the beauty and horrors of the seas where there are no such rules. But when will that be? I won't officially become a doctor until my 4 years of schooling + maybe 4 years of residency, which is the bare minimum, are over. Then I'll be 31 years old and have just started to pay off my debt... is it possible then? Am I going to work for just a couple of years as a doctor before it becomes too late for me to sail? Will my health still be good for me to fulfill this dream? Will my goals and circumstances still be the same?

I guess I have many goals and ambitions, and it's just hard to weigh everything out. I know that one day I will become the best, genuine doctor for my patients. But I really really pray that my other dreams are also met. I just needed to let this out and I didn't know where to put it. Thank you so much for reading",26Feb2020,1
423,"Hi I am a 16 year old who lives in Ontario. So recently I've been getting into highschool life which consists of lots of parties. I enjoy them but it feels like people are getting into sex and relationships. I got rejected by my crush I‚Äôve had for a year around late December. I think I have moved on a good chunk even though some sadness is still there. I want to have a sexual experience and am open to having hookups and things like that. The problem is that I got an opportunity with a girl who‚Äôs willing to have sex with me who I met through a line of friends, she is moving too so I have a couple days to make a decision whether to see her or not. The thing is part of me is hesitant about not saving my first sexual encounter for someone who I really like and that if I do go through with it I might regret it later. So basically I want to, but I'm hesitant that I might regret it later.",26Feb2020,1
424,"Hi this year i started studying on a university and it wasn't the one I wanted to go to (now i study management). Since beginning of the academic year i've been rather unhappy. I hoped it would at least be easy to study here. Last month i failed almost all of my exams and I lost all motivation.  
To add to this when high school ended all my friends decided to study in different cities. I don't have friends here and feel lonely and unhappy I don't really like anything related to management and wolud like to quit but every time i feel like i made decision i feel guilty and weak I think to myself that maybe I want to leave because i failed and just want to run away.   
On the other hand if I wantad to change my major to something that interests me more (like sociology, language or art) I would probably have to write my high shool exams better and I can't do it this year. There is also option of going to some lower ranked university or private one (where I live public unis are free).   
This decision makes me stressed everyday and I've been looking for advice because I just don't know anymore what to do. Feel free to ask more questions and thank you in advace.",26Feb2020,1

426,"Posting at 4am since that‚Äôs when I woke up today, and at earlier times the last several nights. Sorry for formatting, I‚Äôm a mobile user. So about 2 weeks ago I got surgery on my back and this have been on recovery since. At this point I can head back to school Thursday and all is going well, it‚Äôs just I keep waking up at ungodly hours and I have no clue as to why. Initially, I thought it was because I wasn‚Äôt taking pain meds anymore since my prescription of oxycodone ended, but that ended a couple days before it started so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related. I also thought it was because I‚Äôd been taking a couple naps during the day since the whole thing is sorta exhausting, but yesterday I hadn‚Äôt taken an and here I am again. Realistically, I think it‚Äôs due to the incision itself since whenever I wake up its super itchy and that probably means it‚Äôs just healing around that time.

427,"I REALLY need some advice on some type of direction to take this, please!!!

Quick side info- I live in a fairly small town, and my neighborhood is outside of county lines, in a country type of area. Our property is even 2 acres and we have 2 dogs and 3 cats, which are all inside/outside animals. 

However, one of my cats is a hunter, who‚Äôs a little older, very loud and very stubborn, so it‚Äôs occasionally hard to get him inside at night. But our neighbor‚Äôs have this one cat that is just aggressive and even comes to our windows at night to start fights with another one of my cats through the screen. 

The past few months my older cat has come home with gashes near his neck, a bloody paw and a good sized (literal) hole in his chest, all of which had to be taken care of by a vet (which costs way too much money). Tonight I was woken up at 12:30 am to him and the neighbor‚Äôs cat fighting outside my window.

433,"I [16M] have this online friend [15F] that I met on reddit. We are really close, I care about her just as much as my IRL friends. 

She is going through some stuff and doesn‚Äôt want to turn to her family for help. She has had numerous suicidal episodes, however either me or one of her other online friends have managed to talk her out of them. 

I myself have dealt with depression and suicidal tendencies before, I have only recently come out of a really bad depressive period. I have talked with her about her problems a lot, and have tried to help her. I empathise a lot with her, and understand what she‚Äôs going through and that‚Äôs helped me get to her a few times. I thought she was getting better for a while, she seemed a lot happier and more optimistic when we spoke, and I was so happy that she seemed to be feeling better. 

But recently she told me that she had a really bad suicidal episode, and held a blade to her wrist. Luckily, another online friend of hers managed to talk her out of it. I feel guilty that I wasn‚Äôt there for her, as I was asleep because we live on opposite sides of the world. She told me that these episodes are getting worse, and the newfound optimism that I had begun to see in her has gone. The way she describes it, she seems to hate herself and her life completely and only seems to have any happiness when she talks to me.

I have suggested to her to go see a therapist, but she refuses to because she doesn‚Äôt want her family to find out about it. 

I have been through a lot recently, and am currently seeing a therapist. I‚Äôm not sure if I can keep helping her with her problems, when I can‚Äôt even really deal with mine. I feel like I‚Äôm caught between a rock and hard place: If I keep trying to help her, my own mental health will be negatively effected, while on the other hand if I don‚Äôt, and something happens I will never be able to forgive myself. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love my friend so much and I am terrified of losing her. What do I do? I desperately want to help, but I‚Äôm not sure how I can keep doing this. I‚Äôve helped her before, but it is extremely emotionally taxing, especially in my current state. What do I do?",26Feb2020,1

436,"On the 19th of last month the fabrication shop I was working at had a lay off, around 30 people (more the following two fridays after that as well.) unfortunately I got caught in this and have been unemployed since. I‚Äôve been applying to jobs nonstop since then with the only response being target, for which I went in for two interviews two weeks ago and heard nothing since. 

My friend is a supervisor in a kitchen and he needs a new server and told me to apply if I needed a job, he‚Äôd pretty much guarantee I get it. Pay is not great, only 10 an hour but it‚Äôs full time and a set schedule, any money is better than nothing. At this point I‚Äôve eaten through my savings because I had a pipe bust in my wall and I had to completely redo my bathroom and half of my bedroom walls. I go interview and he says the job is 95% mine, they just have one more interview to do tomorrow and then I‚Äôll get sent off for TB/drug test then start the following week. 

A few hours ago I got an email from target offering me a job. They pay 13 an hour, moving up to 15 by the end of the year. But will probably only get 25-30hrs a week and can work either morning or close shift changing every day/week. The kitchen job is 6a-2:30pm everyday with wed and thurs off. 

I actually used to work at target a few years ago and grew to dislike it a lot, and swapped the the fab shop.

458,"When i turned around 20 i came out with digestive problems, serious depression, drank 5-6nights a week heavily. I didn't work. I lied to all my ""friends"" that i ""do stuff online"". My last 10 years has been a complete waste doing pretty much the same stuff. I could tell you about being sectioned, sleeping rough with a knife and completely losing my head, i could tell you about lots of things that have happened but it doesn't matter now as i want to look FORWARD. I want to stop being such a waste of space.

In the past few years i found myself a girlfriend and shes great, we have a wonderful relationship. I have grown SO much emotionally the last 3 years. I deal with my emotions so much better, care much less about what  people think, i'm better with my word, i'm nicer, i'm no longer bitter, i'm more empathetic and overall just feel like i'm a hugely better person. I actually like myself now.

I cut down massively on drinking.  I've gone from 30-35 pints a week to just 4 or 5 on a Saturday night. I've quit smoking. I even go to the gym 4 times a week and managed to keep that up for a whole year.

I currently claim benefits and always pay equally in our household but she keeps up this lie that i work to everyone and it makes me feel ashamed. I still put up with digestion problems that no one seems to be able to figure out - i was hoping quitting drinking that things would miraculously get better but they haven't. Some days i have all the energy and other days i'm so short of breath and fatigued with it all, the foulest of tastes in my mouth and the feeling like my insides are bleeding. I'm currently going back to the GP trying to get things sorted again, or at least some sort of proper diagnosis. I'm more equipped to follow the doctors advice now my heads in a better place.

The next step for me seems to be getting a job but after 10 years out its so intimidating. I want to be a valuable part of the community for a change, i want to respect myself fully. There's still a LOT of days i don't feel well enough to work but can i really live like a waster for the rest of my life? I'm 30. I wish i could magic up some amazing online business but i'm all out of ideas. Coming off benefits scares the life out of me incase i just can't handle it and regress again.

480,"Hello.

This is my second post on reddit, last time You helped me to get through a problem.

I guess this one will be a bit more complicated.

Everything starts from a bad thing that happened almost month and a half back.

Out of nowhere my Dad died in the hospital....

I'm still trying to get over about this and its kind of hard when a day before death You were speaking to a person and told him that when I will come to pick him up from the hospital I will leave a bag in here so I can gather the things faster and leave with him asap.

But thats not about that...

I guess I just need time to stop thinking every few minutes about that but I think its pretty normal and natural thing.

The thing is about my girlfriend.

At start I didnt want to talk to anyone about anything so I just told her not to come so I can be alone and work it out alone - she was fine with it.

But everything started last week, last week my sister was going to come, she was not in my house from the time when we were on funeral...

She told me that we could take childs of my sisters and from hers family to a new opened playroom for kids.

I first missunderstood her and thought that she wants to do that on next weekend, she told me that its not for this weekend but we could do it on some other time, when I said ok fine then she just went furious on me.

First that we do not do any of her plans, which I responded to that its funny because we always consider both of us.

Then she replied that we do not do anything so I said because maybe its because I feel like shit and I barely hold myself?

She replied with just ok, I wont tell it kinda annoyed me and made me mad so I just said that I'm going back to work, after 5 minutes I recieve a message from her that Fuck this, I dont even have to talk to her and it would be best if I would do that.

After 2 days she came by to my work to give me some donuts, starting with thats not a sorry, she then proceeded to not talk to me till Sunday evening, when she wrote to me that I knew how important this weekend was for her and that she knew it will be like that (??) Then I replied with: She said last time that she is not sorry, I just waited for hers message because for me thats pretty normal that its been just a month and I still feel like shit and I dont want to go anywhere, and instead of understanding me she just went like its OK and then saying that I shouldnt even talk to her...

&amp;#x200B;

From that text from Sunday she doesnt speak to me at all for now.

483,"I'm just gonna preface this by saying that I was a really shitty, jealous kid with a lot of issues. I've worked through a lot of them into my adult life but now I'm looking back at my past actions and it's kinda eating me up...

(long-ish story ahead)

To sum it up, my grandmother used to run a babysitting type business and would often take care of 2-3 kindergarten aged kids at a time. Being the jealous kid I was, I always used to feel a lot of resentment towards these kids for stealing my grandmother's attention from mine, and this often manifested itself in me both verbally and physically attacking these kids (I was age 8-14, these kids were no older than 5). My sister would often do the same, but being around the same age as the young kids made it a lot less..brutal, I guess.

I was particularly mean to one kid, no idea why I hated that one in particular but I did a lot of terrible things to him (nothing sexual, let's not go there). I remember punching and biting him often but there's one particular incident I feel the most ashamed of. I wanted to see what he'd do if he genuinely thought I was gonna kill him, so I ran at him with a garden tool and pretended to swing at him with it. Obviously he got really upset, and I feel sick even typing this out. I can't imagine how traumatic that was for a child. My grandmother was inside cooking at this time and I'm not sure she was even aware of half the awful things I did.

Aside from that I'd also frequently do bad things and blame him for it, or say really degrading and mean things to him I'm not sure he even understood

I'm here because I wanna know if I should reach out to him and apologise for how truly awful I used to be? At this stage I don't even know if he remembers me or the horrible things I used to do. I caught back up with one other kid I used to be mean to (not nearly as bad though) and he said he remembers me being mean but not much else. I don't wanna accidentally bring back up some traumatic childhood repressed memories for him either.

485,"I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry in advance if there are formatting issues. It‚Äôs pretty long (I can get dramatic sometimes) so there‚Äôs a much smaller tldr above the last bit of text. 

I‚Äôm a teen from WA who moved to SC. During the same year, I moved I had to do online school because my parents' jobs had us moving around a lot. We finally found a house that‚Äôs perfect for us and I can fulfill the year and a half long dream of going back to public school and making friends my own age. Here‚Äôs the thing though, I have dyed hair, and that hair in the past has been blue, purple, and even faded to pink at one point. Right now and since April 2018 it‚Äôs been red. Not dark enough to be dark red, and not bright enough to be fire truck red. My school in WA was fine with it. It was even the norm for everyone to dye their hair at least once, natural or unnatural colors. My hair is my one stable *me* thing. I love my hair, it‚Äôs the one thing that makes me really confident, not like a crutch but more of a booster seat. I love experimenting with colors, and the love of both brought me to what I‚Äôm considering doing after high school, cosmetology. My dyed hair is part of me. I don‚Äôt care what other people think of me or what I look like, all that matters to me is that I feel good about myself, my dyed hair and doing my makeup helps me feel that way. Not that I‚Äôm covering up my natural beauty with chemicals and colors, but I‚Äôm letting my personality paint a self-portrait with the canvas that is my body. This is why during my leap of excitement on my future school's website I found myself with an endless pit in my stomach and even tiny pools welled in my eyes. ‚ÄúAll students are asked to refrain from any hairstyles/colors that are potentially distracting in a school setting(any action related to hairstyles/ colors is at the discretion of the administration).‚Äù I know all too well what this means. I‚Äôll come in with my confidence of a thousand soldiers only to be knocked down and shattered in one fell swoop. I‚Äôll be told I need to go back to blonde because my hair is inappropriate and distracting. It‚Äôs only distracting because no dares to question or test the authority figures who set the rules in the first place. And why is a teenage girl with ADD in charge of managing others' attention? Honestly, if my red hair is so distracting in your classroom filled to the brim with eager young minds that‚Äôs says something about the way you teach because there are people out there who could still maintain a crowds attention with their words alone even if there were millions of flashing lights in the sky. I‚Äôve had teachers with colored hair, that same teacher put tinsel in her hair because she could. That teacher could still be professional and a ‚Äúgood teacher‚Äù while having fun and embracing what makes her unique. 


TLDR: I‚Äôm a teen that is extremely emotionally attached to her colored hair (that she‚Äôs had dyed since February 2017 and dyed red since April 2018) who moved from WA to SC. My old school had plenty of people with dyed hair and had no hair color rules, but the school I will be going to in the coming fall basically says ‚Äúnope, only natural colors‚Äù.


With that being said, what can I do? Can they make me change something I‚Äôve had since before I was even old enough to be considered a freshman? I don‚Äôt want to have to mourn the loss of yet another thing I love. It‚Äôs inevitable though, really, I‚Äôll be distracting with red hair or not because the school is only 1.8 times the size of my middle school(the high school I would have gone to in WA is 3.4 times the size of my middle school), I‚Äôm from a different place, I say things different, and I dress different. I don‚Äôt wanna change who I am or how I look and feel comfortable so that I can blend in with their ideals. I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôll end up being told on the first day, if not then within the first week that I‚Äôll have to dye my hair a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù color.

I've grown close to him over the track and cross country seasons that have passed. He also wrote me a letter of recommendation earlier in the year. He views me very favorably. I'm just worried what he will think or say if I tell him I don't wanna do track. I wanna be on good terms with him and i think quitting will just not go well by him.


I just need some advice about this cause i don't know what to do. I'll probably get a job with the time I will get. I just want to end senior year stress free and have more time to hang out with friends instead of spending time with ppl I really don't like.",26Feb2020,1
497,I have no contact with her the last 5 years.,26Feb2020,1
498,So I have known this guy going on two years. When we hung out we usually drove around and talked or just listened to music. We did have oral sex occasionally. I hadn't seen him for 9 months so like a week or two ago I texted him and asked him what he was up to. He told me he was at a hotel for work three hours away. I went up there and we ended up having sex. A few days ago I went to his house to hangout and I ended up falling asleep for close to 8 hours on his bed instead of hanging out with him. When I woke up he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner and I told him I wasn't feeling well and went home. Last night he offered to take me out for dinner. I didn't want to go but I decided to anyway. When we got to the restaurant I told him I didn't want anything to eat and I basically just sat there and watched him eat while I drank soda and played on my phone. I just wasn't in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. When I said bye to him I just gave him a quick hug and walked away. We usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other. I really like him a lot but I just feel like I ruined everything. We are both in our twenties. What should I do?,26Feb2020,1
499,"this is going to sound like every 14 year old teenage girl ranting about her mom,,, but i really wanted to know how you guys objectively feel about the things my mom do!!! 

disclaimer; i love my mom lol, it's just sometimes i feel like she's controlled very easily by her emotions

i think the main reason why i find her abusive is b/c of how easily affected she is by her emotions. like ex if she's in a bad mood b/c she went in a fight with my dad (my mom and my dad have a very fragile relationship, they have admitted to me their marriage was loveless but stayed together b/c of me. usually these fights get violent, we have furniture thrown around, physical and verbal abuse on both sides, we had the police called once too but it's usually my mom who's abusive to my dad who's a very patient guy but he has his limits as well once she keeps provoking him. my mom and dad are very stubborn people regarding their own opinions but it's usually my mom who begins the verbal abuse.) then whatever i say to her (hello, how was your day, hi mom, etc) she gets pissed at me. She says things like ""why did i raise you like this?"" ""shut up"", or just goes on and on about her own problems without asking about my opinion. she also trash talks pretty much all of my dad-side family members, which is somewhat understandable b/c they forced her to live in a very restrictive patriarchal environment, but they're not at all terrible people.

I think the worst fight we've had was probably when I asked to hang out over at a friends when she was in one of her bad moods again and started screaming at me. It escalated into my mom saying I'm a mistake i'm a crazy bitch etc etc and she grabs a hairbrush and smacks it across my face. i got a big bruise on my face and at that point i was infuriated as well and told her to get out of the room or i would call the police. i locked my door (she's very talented at talking to herself) and she kept pounding on it, threatening that she'd break my door if i wouldn't let her in, etc and i'd just plug some earrbuds in and wait forr a few hours until she'd stop and come to apologize. (again when her own mood is better)

we've probably had worse fights before, it's just that I can't remember. 

she can also be a very sweet person when she's in a good mood. she really loves me and i can tell, but it's just when she gets ultra sensitive when she's in her bad moods and becomes abusive to my dad or myself whenever we have a slight disagreement.

500,"just jump into it. We live in germany. My mother is  working at this workplace for 35 years now, but recently someone has started to tell her boss that it's ""unfair that she gets such work conditions"" (My mother is 50+, so she can only work 4 days a week from 6:00-15:00, which is short for the job.)

 She always tries to be a nice person, and all of her co-workers are her friends, but only they know when she comes to/leaves work.

504,"I'm gonna make a very long story short - and hopefully get some insight from you great people.

I was really horny earlier and I never had sex with a guy before but had always fantasized about it - and sometimes chatted and would talk dirty and swap pics with some guys every now and then. 

So I got on grindr and started chatting with this very well endowed guy and I told him I wanted him to put his dick in my mouth (we're both clean) and he should come over.

So he ended up coming over and I was super nervous but since I had some liquid courage I was okay. I ended up on my knees and gagging more than I thought I would - but i still liked it. 

... then he tells me to turn around and get on all fours and I knew what he was gonna do but I said 

""I'm not sure"" 

and then he just replied 

""I'm gonna fuck that ass one way or another so just accept it. You'll thank me when I'm done.""

What I just heard had me reeling and I didn't really know what to think or say because I was just in shock and then I felt his hands push me down on hands and knees and then I said 

""I'm not ready"" 

Right as that happened his dick went inside me and he responded

""Don't worry you're gonna be begging for it soon. I know what's best for a faggot like you.""

Hearing that made me feel so weak and worthless but I felt even more shame because he was right... even after I told him basically no... after like 2-3 minutes of him fucking me it started to feel really good and I was telling him to fuck me harder and he laughed and said I was his little bitch. 

Idk how to feel about the whole situation. Was i abused/assaulted even though I enjoyed it?",26Feb2020,1

507,"Me and my gf bought our first house 4 months back. It‚Äôs a project, so it requires some love, attention and hard graft. Its also a terrace house, so we live close to our neighbours...

Our neighbours on one side are an older couple who have lived there since the houses were built, some 40 years.

Our stairs are directly against there wall and squeaky, they‚Äôve mentioned a few times that they can hear us going up and down and if we‚Äôd mind treading a little more carefully. Of course we said.

The weekend just gone we had a productive  time working on the upstairs after finally finishing decorating, we fitted shelves, pictures, put back furniture and vacuumed - all within reasonable hours! 

Last night we had some friends round for dinner (nothing crazy and again at a reasonable hour). After showing our friends our newly painted upstairs, there was loud banging on our door, our next door neighbour started going crazy at us and shouting that they‚Äôd never in there time being here had they lived next to such noisey people!

We‚Äôve always thought of ourselves as a considerate and thoughtful people and I explained the work we‚Äôve been doing at the weekends as we work 8 - 6 in the week.

In future we agreed we‚Äôll make sure to tell them when we‚Äôre doing noisy work and that we‚Äôre approachable to talk to if something happens at the time.

I want to get on with these people and I don‚Äôt want to feel like I can‚Äôt live, socialise or climb the stairs in my own house!

509,"I (18f) am moving out this week. my mom has been controlling of me for years, and ever since her bf moved in last year it‚Äôs been terrible. it was fine the first few months he was here. id moved out (I was still 17) but had to move back bc my roommate at the time of was moving. I told my mom when moving back in it was temporary, and i‚Äôd be leaving very soon. 

my mom‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs name is on my car. because of this, she insists that even with me moving out I need to tell her where I am all the time. I understand this, but it isn‚Äôt something I like. because she‚Äôs going to use this to try to keep that control and I know it. i‚Äôm 18 and in college, and she‚Äôs going to try to continue dictating everything I can or can‚Äôt do.

as well as this, if I can help it, I don‚Äôt want to have to be in contact with her bf ever. there‚Äôs so many things that make me feel this way, but a few of the big things are his treatment of my family‚Äôs pets that were living there long before he moved in. I made plans for my cat to be moved in with my boyfriend when he moves out in a few months, and I know I was right to do so considering I overheard his conversation with my mom about how she needs to get rid of my cat since I won‚Äôt be living there even though he‚Äôll be rehomed completely in a couple months‚Äîhopefully no later than this summer. but i‚Äôll likely be giving him to a friend temporarily starting in march or april until he moves. this cat has been here for four years, my mom got him for me when I was turning 14 because i‚Äôd never had my own cat and someone she knew had kittens. he knew moving in she had him and didn‚Äôt indicate not liking him at all until he moved in. 

one thing that makes me pissed as all hell at her is that she just lets him think he has a say in what I do. for example, he tries to have a say in whether i‚Äôm sexually active or not. and she just lets him! i overheard him talking to her about it and she literally just responded ‚ÄúI went with her to the gynecologist(I was 17) and they did a pelvic exam. if she was sexually active they‚Äôd be able to tell, and she wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù well she wasn‚Äôt even in the room for it, and I think she should‚Äôve just told him to piss off because it‚Äôs none of his business. my own dad doesn‚Äôt try to dictate that type of thing, his only thing about it is I have to be safe. 

how can I distance myself from my mom and her bf, without completely going against what she asked? I don‚Äôt inherently mind her wanting to know where I am but i know she‚Äôll pitch a fit if i‚Äôm places she doesn‚Äôt like even though i am 18 and won‚Äôt be living at home.",26Feb2020,1

Hey all,

First of all, English is not my first language so please be kind to me. 

A little backstory: My boyfriend of 3 years requested two months ago a break in our relationship. He needed some time to think and focus on tackling his problems. I led him and tried to focus on working on myself. Now after two months we again have contact for two weeks and it flips all the time between great and loving contact and confusion about everything. Now today we decided to go on a date again and I just can't relax about it... 

On to the question: How do I tackle my nerves? Or maybe even better, how do I channel them in positive energy?   
 It feels like I will be meeting him for the first time and I feel so uncertain about everything‚Ä¶   
What if he does not like/love me anymore, what if I don‚Äôt like/love him anymore. What if we don‚Äôt have anything to say to each other etc. 

I have always had a low self-esteem and it feels like I have to try and prove myself again‚Ä¶ I really would love to be able to just relax and look forward to the date.",26Feb2020,1
519,"Hello, I don't really know where to start but I have severe depression and anxiety. I am 22 years old and never had a job and I'm not really independent as I used to have a scholarship for my university but I failed a year and couldn't get it. I have no money. I haven't been able to go to my university for a month now and told the administration about my issue, I was dismissed(they can't help).
I am stuck in idleness and can't think properly.
I seem to be in denial. Right now there is no future for me. I don't seem to get that if I don't do anything then bad things will happen.
I was messed up as a kid. I had leave home because I couldn't deal with my mom and my dad has his own family in another country.
I don't what to do but I'd like to know how to get out of this situation. I have no skills, no interests, no hobbies, in fact I don't even know why I put myself in college when I don't really know what I want to do later in life. I'm a quitter and I always give up. There were days where I just felt like I wanted to die because of sleep deprivation but now I don't feel it at all, I have better sleep now but waking up is painful. I am not really suicidal, I am too coward to do it myself. Although I don't live with my mom anymore she would sometimes visit me and give me food and remind me to eat even though I have no appetite but the thing is she doesn't really respect me, she berates me, gaslight me, has a superiority complex just to name a few. She would sometimes complain why I do not look or behave like her family but nearly half of my life I never lived with her as she would work abroad and pay strangers to take care of me. I've been living for her with almost the half aswell.
She would be violent. Complain about my choices and complain how I am not a doctor or an engineer (she is asian). Blame me for her divorce with her husband when I was a kid (not my real father). Blame me for for her mother's death (spent some time in vacation in my native country with family, my grandma has her own home but lived with my aunt and uncle. After a dispute between aunt and grandma I went to ask both of them for reconciliation and nobody decided to ask forgiveness to each other. When she died my mom flew for the funerals, everyone was crying. I did not cry because back then my mom would beat me when I cried and tell me to ""man up"")  by saying that I stressed my grandma when she wasn't even there. She seems to have selective memory and forgot about the good things I've done as a child. She would sometimes ask me why I don't respect/love/obey her despite not demonstrating any form of misbehaviour. She would lie often, and at one point was homophobic towards me when I am not gay at all. She forced fed me pork one morning while I was still going to  high school at the time because I never ate ""meat"" she bought and was thinking I had been influenced by a muslim friend but I never ate meat because all she bought was low quality.
I have some of her bad traits reflected on me but I  try my best not to express those to anyone else.
I just thought by living on my own and minimal interaction with her things would be better for both of us and it was true. I believe she has some good in her despite all the nasty things she did to me but that might be because she was messed up as a kid aswell or I'm not sure if that is bipolar disorder.
What I want is guidance as I've never been taught about anything in life. I would like to know objective ways to get out of this depression.

Me and my significant other hung out with this particular individual (we'll call him J) almost everyday. J was our best friend. All 3 of us did everything together, and that includes becoming addicted to heroin together. I know what you're thinking. Heroin addicts are fucking scum of the earth, junkies, etc. I've heard it all- I'm just begging for advice that doesn't demonize addicts. 

We all collectively decided to get clean together and hold each other accountable if any of us relapsed. J went to treatment and me and my S/O just raw dogged the withdrawls. Getting on methadone or suboxone would prolong the inevitable withdrawl and its a trap to keep you coming back. 

Fast forward, we're all clean, it's been a fat minute over 8 months. J and his girl broke up. 

The next morning he calls me and my S/O at 6 am, he's high and heartbroken. He told us about his relapse but it was so early and we were so tired we let him go. 

J passed away from an overdose a few hours after that phone call. 

It's been almost a month since he passed, me and my S/O have had weird relationship dynamics now. He has known J longer than I have and they were closer. The death is hitting him so hard. He won't get out of bed, he only showers once every 4 days..he hasn't been eating really and he has bad insomnia.

(It's not worth it,you are important, go out take walks, hit the gym vs.) Talking to random people on the internet or suicide hotlines can get those thoughts out of your mind for sometime, it can get you the edge of the cliff you are about to jump. But you most likely be at that edge a couple of days later. (Don't get me wrong, i am grateful for who has given a slightest,tiniest,microscobic fuck about someone they don't know, just because that said person is about to hurt himself.But most of the times it's just not enough)

I can talk to my psychiatrist, but i see her once a month and that's not really doing anything. 

People say talking to someone. Letting someone in helps.

So who can you talk in your darkest hour ?",26Feb2020,1
533,"So my significant other and I have been together for a year and living together for six months. We are both really comfortable talking about what type of person we find attractive, he might point someone out and say ‚Äòwow she‚Äôs super gorgeous‚Äô  or talk about how attractive a certain ethnicity is to him. He‚Äôs also told me quite a few sexual escapades he‚Äôs been on in the past. As well as watching porn and masterbating almost every night. I‚Äôm not bothered by any of those things as I‚Äôm extremely comfortable in our relationship. However the only thing that bothers me is the fact that he doesn‚Äôt cum when having sex. He will finish me and then stop. I‚Äôve asked him about it but he says that it‚Äôs good to exercise self control and reassures me that it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with me. The whole self control thing is bullshit cause I know he jacks off every night.",26Feb2020,1
534,"When my father passed away I was devastated, he died at the age of 51 and a day before his 52nd birthday. I was so mad and angry. It happened in September and in that period I worked (student summer job) and even tho I knew he was sick I barely spent any time with him at home because I worked every day.

Due to a disease, he lost a lot of weight and he barely had any appetite and we were worried that things could go wrong. He had a specific diet to follow which is a lot of protein in food but he didn't want to eat the same food every day even tho he knew he had to so we decide to find what he likes the most and then combine it with food he must eat. A few months into therapy results were promising. Medical files were saying that it is getting better and the doctor said that results are improving. We talked with him that we won't give up and that there is always hope which we won't lose.

Around early august things started going south. He started to lose energy constantly and he barely could walk by himself. He could barely speak and even if he tried he would have felt tired and exhausted like he ran a marathon.

On the day he died I was sleeping and one of my brothers called me and said: come here dad is not breathing and I didn't know what to do. I got off my bed and when I came next to his bed I started shaking him and calling him even tho I knew what actually happened. We called an ambulance and the lady on the phone explained to us how to do CPR and talked with us until doctors arrived. Doctors said that our father is dead.

I cried the entire day and I couldn't accept that he is gone. I was laying down in my bad and I didn't want to talk to anyone. Naturally, I am shy and I can't open myself to everyone. From that day I haven't talked to anyone about it even tho I feel terrible and I don't have that in me to share my feeling with anyone about my loss. Few of my friends suggested to try professional help but I really can't because in my mind I think it will make it even worse. My mood drops every time someone mentions my father or anything related to him.

Not all my friends even know what happened because I try to keep it secret and it would be awkward of me if I come now and just say: hey guys my father died 5 months ago, I don't feel myself right now and sorry for not spending much time with you.

I really don't know how can I continue my life normally, I am barely talking to anyone and if someone tries to talk with me I always make it short as possible for no reason.

If you have any advice for me please share it, if you were in any similar situation or you know someone how to overcome it I beg you to share it.",26Feb2020,1

543,"Okay, so, I recently started a job with a major company in their digital security team. 

I started alongside someone i trained with, but she is beginning to annoy me greatly. 

Until yesterday she has been given the same basic task that would have taken a couple of weeks tops to set up and implement. It has taken her 4 weeks. And in that time I have had to complete my tasks, shoulder all of the other tasks that she had outstanding and had to do two duo projects single handedly. 

I've repeatedly had to show her how to do basic things that she should already know or at least should be common sense. And the quality of her work is shockingly bad. And it's clear she hasn't understood any of the materials we were given during training. I ended up having to rewrite a complete document written by her because it was a complete mess. 

She'll shoulder surf me and read my emails or Teams chat or just sit and stare at me if she needs something from me. The shoulder surfing is a particular concern as some emails may be for my eyes only (like admin passwords) I have told her to stop but she continues. 

She also likes to gossip about how her relationship is going to shit and wants to insert herself into my life, which I'm just not interested in being a part of

Naturally, I'm not trying to be an asshole and get her in trouble, and today she's trying to shoulder some of this duo project that I've been doing solo. I'm trying to do it to a high standard as it's important. And I've given her the task of making power point presentations from the documentation I've written. 

I come back from lunch to check how she's getting on. she's writing a word document (not a power point presentation like ive asked) and using the wrong documentation (her documentation, rather than mine, which has been verified by the product owner) I try to politely point it out to her she says 'stop shoulder surfing me' as a petty quip and starts getting upset at me because I pointed out that she was doing the wrong thing and tried to steer her back on track, and tells me to leave her alone. 

I did, now I'm here. Because I'm frankly done with her

Just to clarify first thing I did before I went over is to check if she had her emails or any potentially confidential information on screen. She didn't; it was all documentation I recognized. 

 So I wasn't trying to check her emails or teams chat like she does. Like, if she sees outlook or Teams on my screen and I'm typing she'll come and have a nose at what I'm talking about and to whom. 

It's at the point where I'm getting sick of working with her and having to pick up after her mess. She's clearly the type of cunt that tries to bat her fake eyelashes and get people to do the work for her instead of bettering herself

But I'm also concerned about bringing this up with my line manager, or getting firmer with her. I don't want to be seen as a bitch here. And I'm not in a supervisory position but she knows from training I take the lead naturally and my line manager is aware of my desire to lead and is trying to develop it.


I'm fine with people who produce shoddy work but don't mind me coming in and pointing out what's wrong with it. And I do my best to be polite about it. I know how it feels to be on the other end of harsh criticism and know it will not change a thing if you do it harshly, but rather let them follow you through. 

What do?

I have a meeting tomorrow afternoon in which I can discuss concerns if I have them. Should I bring it up there? How?

550,"So I have an ex that has a child and she‚Äôs been trying for years to pin it on me, but at the same time refuses to get a DNA just for the sole reason ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre the father and that‚Äôs that‚Äù. I‚Äôve faced a lot of hatred and accusations from her and her family or friends but none of them want to do anything to back it up. I‚Äôm sorry but I refuse to pay for a child I don‚Äôt believe is mine. 

Now for some back story, we dated 5ish years ago for 3 months before a rocky phase of our relationship started. And this started because she was too in love with partying and drugs and being a mother figure to multiple guys and girls that were also addicted to drugs that just wanted a free place to stay and mooch off us. I also worked a 12 hour shift 2 hours out of town every day of the week so not only did we not have much time with eachother but when we did there were Always 4-7 other people in our apartment at all times, even staying the night. 

That being said, we had long periods of no intimacy and fought quite a lot because I didn‚Äôt agree with her drug use or her constantly having people over invading our privacy, eating our food and using our utilities. Now during this period of no intimacy I was feeling incredibly down on myself and taken advantage of for my vehicle and my money, so when I came home one night from work to her asleep with her phone beside her unlocked my gut was screaming for me to check and be sure she wasn‚Äôt Cheating on me on top of all this (there were numerous guys at our place with her while I was there and while I was away). So I check and find some flirty messages to one of the guys but nothing super serious until I find messages to another guy I haven‚Äôt met before that were intensely sexually charged and went back through literally our whole relationship, and even messages about them meeting up and how great their performances were the night before, but when I questioned her she said it was purely fantasy. 

We lasted as a couple for about a week or 2 after because I struggle with getting out of bad situations right away and then of course she hits me with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant‚Äù and that the conception was during our rough patch so immediately my mind goes to this guy she‚Äôs been super sexual with and the list of other possible guys she was always around, so her best friend and I both told her she should get a DNA done, which was met with immediate refusal and a defensive panicked attitude which was a HUGE red flag, and the one that caused me to leave her. 

I could understand not wanting a DNA if we had no issues with our relationship and especially no cheating issues but the fact she immediately refused a DNA and to this day (almost 5 years later) still hasn‚Äôt decided to get one or to resolve anything in court has me suspicious. She maintains the lie to everyone around her that she didn‚Äôt cheat or do anything to deserve being ditched and is an innocent angel and I‚Äôm a piece of trash. 

We tried to make things work 4 months after I left her because I was having some doubt and feeling ashamed but I noticed she was still into drugs, still hanging out with incredibly bad influences, and only really wanted me around so she could make me look after the baby while she partied all day and night everyday and so I could go and spend all my money on stuff for her. As soon as my money was drying up and I couldn‚Äôt afford to keep up with her demands she also seemed to lose all the ‚Äúlove‚Äù she claimed to have for me when we got back together, and she started distancing herself from me and treating me like an idiot in front of all her friends, her parents and even my parents. 

We broke up again and I refused to speak to her up until a few months ago where I was met with threats that her and her parents would harm me if I slipped up again, and even after all that she STILL refused anything to do with court or a DNA, but wanted me to pay her child support (no my name is not on the birth certificate) and again made everything about money. I ended up just stopping all communication of any form with her because tbh I can‚Äôt stand the thought of dealing with her anymore. She‚Äôs a violent, abusive, manipulative person that really needs some professional help.

There is still more to the whole situation but I‚Äôm going to leave it at that so I don‚Äôt end up with a 50 page book. Basically has anyone been in this position, if so what did you do to resolve the issue? Any advice will go a long way, because my parents, best friend and current gf are obviously more biased toward me than someone outside my inner circle would be.",26Feb2020,1
551,"TW: suicidal thoughts (not anymore luckily)


I graduated high school last year, and I am in law school right now. Unfortunately, two of my bullies are too, and even worse - they are in my university. Luckily we have multiple campuses spread around the country, and they are studying close to home while I took the plunge and am studying as far from them as I could, so I don't live at home anymore while they do. I haven't met them since graduation, and I wasn't supposed to until 2022 when they are forced to move to this campus for their last year of their bachelor's degree.

I'm doing great, got therapy to deal with my trauma and suicidal thoughts due to their excessive bullying (6y!), made new friends, picked up new hobbies, got good grades and even found a boyfriend (I wasn't looking for one, but I'm happy I found him). My mental health is better than ever and I am gradually getting stronger.

However... I'm not strong enough to meet my bullies, who broke my bones, who hit me, who got me a concussion, who put me down mentally by calling me arrogant, dumb, a no one, by telling me I should die... The school didn't intervene. There was but one teacher, Mr R, who made time for me when I was crying. The others looked away, afraid of the high and mighty parents of my bullies, and afraid of the stain this ""situation"" could leave on the reputation of the school.

Now, my high school is hosting an evening where the graduates give some info to the 12th graders about choosing their studies and giving personal experience. Out of respect to Mr R, I applied. 

Then my bullies applied to. Since we study the same thing, they are scheduled to sit next to me for 6 hours while giving info. They are probably going to act super friendly, ignoring the fact I was suicidal a year ago because of their actions. They have done this act before and everyone is fooled by it, but not me. They are going to laugh about my hobbies, my grades, they are going to ask if I have made some friends who are stupid or blind enough to stay... Worst case, they become physically threatening.
It's not going to be pleasant.

What can I do? I can't cancel the event anymore, but I can't let these people start to bring me down again either...


TLDR: I am forced to sit next to my bullies who made me suicidal during an event I applied to out of respect for the only teacher who helped me during the bullying. I'm not mentally ready to see them yet, especially since they'll act like nothing ever happened. What can I do when cancelling isn't an option?",26Feb2020,1

I'm a 29 year old working as a mechanical engineer for the past five years, but I have realized that I am completely uninterested in my field.

I studied engineering mainly because I thought 3D modelling and 3D printing was really cool. But I sort of studied engineering on a whim. I had done odd jobs for years and was just worn out and depressed from constant job search and no real direction in life.

Now...I just feel like my job takes over all of my time. Every single say I look for ways to avoid work as much as possible. Every meeting I have to use every inch of my being to stay focused on something I find incredible boring.

The only aspects I like about my job is 3D modelling.  And during my spare time I want to learn more creative applications, like Blender or Zbrush. But I am constantly exhausted from work so I barely have any time for my hobbies.

We‚Äôd have to do a three day road trip at minimum and we have two animals. I feel like it would be rough, but potentially really worth it. 

There are so many more nuances to this situation, but every single point of anxiety comes about randomly and just adds to the confusion. 

Should I ask amazon if they could consider me for their Midwest area? I also want a work life balance, something I‚Äôve been considering in my decision.

567,"Tl;dr: Girlfriend's grandfather has beaten his wife, has made her feel guilty for it and says/does a lot of suicidal stuff. He's armed and dangerous. The family won't call the cops. What do I, a third party do in this situation?

My girlfriend's grandfather, we'll call him POS for short, has beaten his wife to the point she can't stand and can barely talk. He beat her the night before last as well. Leaving bruises all over when he held her down and beat her with the buckle side of the belt. He's been shooting his gun off in the city limits, trying to start fights with family members to get them to start a fight and hate him or kill him.

Now POS's wife, the one he's beat up is so brainwashed by this fuck that she keeps saying this is all her fault. Which is stupid because the ""reason POS is mad"" is because when his wife was 12/14 she did stuff with other guys. Even though they weren't together at the time and POS has cheated as recently as a year ago that everyone knows of. 

He's got her so fucked up she says she shouldn't live at the house where her and her HUSBAND have lived for years. She was told not to call the cops or put him in a crazy house because he doesn't want his life taken away. Funny from the guy beating her an inch away from her life.

The family won't call the cops as he said he will hold the gun at them and threaten them until they shoot him. Which as an outside party, I'm of the belief that this is the best possible option as POS is liable to hurt any of them, including my girlfriend. 

I personally believe that they are fucked up for not just calling the cops and tricking him into coming out and getting cuffed/sent to psyche ward until his ass calms down. 

POS has been abusing drugs, drinking, the whole works. Saying that if his dad dies, he'll follow closely. 

Again, my girlfriend won't call the cops, they won't call an ambulance. They're fucking driving her to the hospital themselves. So, my question is, what should I as a third party do? Should I piss off my girlfriend and call the cops, detailing the situation and attempt to suicide via cop? Or should I painfully mind my business?",26Feb2020,1

572,"My friend of 4 years out of the blue ghosted me a few weeks ago. Not fully- he just gradually stopped responding and opening messages. If he ever did respond, it was one or two words and kind of rude/snappy. We are in a group chat together and every time I say anything, he mocks the shit out of me. And yet he won‚Äôt even acknowledge me outside the group chat. We used to call and talk every day but now he hasn‚Äôt called or answered my calls in a month. When we were in a group Skype cal he kept mocking my voice, laugh, and everything I said. I was on the verge of tears when I asked him why and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre not funny‚Äù and I just hung up. During this whole month he‚Äôs gone days without responding and suddenly gets friendly for a few minutes before disappearing again. 

I freaked out on him a few days later after he continued not responding and/ or being rude to me. I told him I was hurt and that if he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore I wish he would just tell me instead of lashing out and randomly disappearing. He basically acted like I was wrong for being angry with him. His responses were incredibly short and basically said he wanted me to ‚Äúrespect his privacy‚Äù. I suggested I‚Äôll never text him again and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that but if you insist‚Äù. Since then he hasn‚Äôt opened a single message from me so I physically can‚Äôt even apologize for freaking out. But I don‚Äôt even feel like I need to. 

He‚Äôs in the military and lives very far away. I can‚Äôt go visit him. But I‚Äôm fairly certain he‚Äôs been lashing out because he‚Äôs under a lot of stress and is physically isolated from his friends and family and kind of regrets joining the military. Would sending him cookies with a note be a terrible idea? I know he‚Äôs been a jerk but I care about him. Even if he never talks to me again and hates me I‚Äôd at least like to express that I still care.

581,"My first relationship just ended, and I‚Äôve been doing a lot of self reflection as of late.

One problem, and probably one of the main problem that caused sub-problems, was my tendency to keep looking to the future. I was raised to ‚Äúalways think 7 years ahead‚Äù. I was also raised in a household that heavily valued conformity. And my parents would use my very-many destitute relatives as an example for why I should follow life in their prescribed way (also, people of my community tend to suffer from poverty at greater rates than others, so there was also the added pressure from my parents of not being a statistic).

My ex and I got together at 18. Currently 23. Even from that age, I was obsessed with planning for the future. As time went by, I knew I wanted us to spend 2-4 years in our ‚Äústarter city‚Äù (city to jump start our careers after we‚Äôre done with school). Be married by 26 so that we could at least have 4-6 years of marriage without kids. Move from one city to a less expensive one so that we can buy a nice house. Have kids around 32.

I wanted the both of us to be financially stable by 26, but I especially wanted to know *he* would be financially stable and enter early stages of his career by 28. To me, if it takes longer than 28, then I need to find another partner I know can be an responsible co-provider for our future family, because I‚Äôd only have 4 years to find someone, marry them, and spend some time with them before kids. I don‚Äôt want to have kids too late in my 30s due to my biological clock.

I had a decent amount of anxiety because it‚Äôs taking him awhile to finish school due to mental health or financial issues (he‚Äôd be graduating with his bachelor‚Äôs a year after I graduate with my master‚Äôs, with me getting my master‚Äôs straight out from undergrad). A lot of this stems from my mom disliking him from the jump and telling me he‚Äôd never be successful. I tried to ignore her, but I didn‚Äôt start realizing how much influence my mom (and my parents in general) have over my life. 

For example, I let my mom take advantage of me and mess up my credit score. A semester before I graduated college, I asked mom to help me get a credit card and mail it to me (back at university) when it arrived. She never mailed it and instead claimed she was going to help me get my credit score in the 700s. My credit score actually decreased, I think even got to the low 600s, and she kept telling me to ‚Äúbe patient‚Äù. When I stole my credit card back during a break and removed her from my account, she made me feel guilty and I felt like the worst daughter In the world. I felt like I was doing something wrong by disappointing her...a month after I removed her, I easily got my credit into the mid-700s.

...that was a off-tangent.

Anyway, he ended up expressing that he hated feeling like he was on a timer, a deadline, and that I could ‚Äúleave at any moment‚Äù. I tried to rationalize by saying he‚Äôs not a woman and doesn‚Äôt have to worry about a biological clock for children. I‚Äôm starting to severely doubt that my ‚Äúplanner‚Äù mentality is healthy.

TL;DR: I used to think my level of future planning was healthy. But after the recent end of a relationship, I‚Äôm doubting if that‚Äôs the case. What does a healthy planner-type person look like? What does ‚Äúliving in the present‚Äù mean to you? I‚Äôm open to anyone, but I‚Äôd especially like to hear from women. Thanks

585,"I've been on a bit of a downward spiral for the past 5 years or so. I was a goodie two shoes, the kind of kid whose friends' parents loved, who did well on their GCSEs. I was a point of pride for my family. As I type this, I'm stoned, in the same clothes I fell asleep in, with an empty stomach (spare a cup of tea, god save the queen), smoking copious amounts of cigarettes. It's 1:30PM on a Wednesday, and I should be in University right now, in a meeting with my supervisor.

But I'm not. Like the other week, all I care about today is getting high. I pestered my dad for ¬£30 for my antidepressants last night, and promptly spent ¬£20 on a 20 bag. I got ripped off; my guy always puts way below 2 grams in, but I still bought it. I have numbers for other dealers, but I couldn't handle the uncertainty of how long I'd have to wait for my weed. I was that desperate.

Today, I had a supervisor meeting scheduled, and three pieces of coursework to catch up on. This morning, I had a joint, a cigarette, and a cup of tea. Didn't bother brushing my teeth or having a shower. I then read the entirety of 'fear and loathing in las vegas', topping myself up on pot whenever the warm fog started to clear.

I just don't know who the fuck I am any more. I know people can change, but I've changed so much I feel almost estranged from my own life. Like some other soul experienced the first 16 years of my existence, and then had to leave for some reason, so I took its place. That boy and me, our characters are so different. We have similar values, but we're seperate entities. In a way this is a comforting thought: that his pure soul was removed and replaced with a dirty one, before his life consisted of masturbating and drugs.

This feeling isn't helped by exploring the possibility of childhood trauma with my therapist. I'm beginning to doubt my memories of childhood, and so the childhood I remember feels like somebody else's life. How can I have had the good childhood I remember, when I'm struggling to function this much? When I'm so insecure?

I was raised by one parent much more than the other, and my primary parent has a lot of emotional trauma. It's likely that they impacted me, or maybe neglected my emotional needs. I cut myself pretty badly when I was 14, still have the scars. There were no long conversations about why I did it, only assumptions, and I wasn't taken to see anybody. There was a time this parent jumped up and down on a sandwich my brother didn't want to eat, and another where they vocally blamed him for their own lack of friends.

Don't get me wrong, my parents are not bad people. Scrub through the entirety of any parent's career, and you're going to find mistakes. Big ones. But I don't think this one was in control of themselves all of the time. A grand majority of the time. But sometimes they'd get angry, or sad, and lose the ability to stop themselves saying hurtful things, or contain scary and crazy behaviour.

Fast-forward to now, and I feel like my parents are trying to damage control. My brother has panic attacks all of the time, and I'm a flaming trainwreck of family shame, barely keeping from failing out of uni. They're not really interested in discussing the possibility that my brother and I suffered as a result of one of them. I think that it's more weakness than malevolence. The parent with all of the trauma derives a lot of personal meaning from the idea of ""breaking the cycle of abuse."" It would be very threatening to their identity to realise they perpetuated it, even if only in smaller and more unconcious ways.

The unfortunate result of this is that I get kind of gaslit. Did things happen to me and traumatise me? Am I just a bad, selfish, immature person? If they're not acknowledging it, maybe I am just making it up... an excuse for my own personal failings and misery. I have taken drugs at uni, maybe that did it... Maybe I love just living in this imaginary drama where everything is so... entertaining.

I don't believe in either truth fully. I suppose the real truth is somewhere out there, in the unimaginable complexities of life. But here I am, distant from my past and of who I thought I was. Maybe circumstance has stolen my future from me. Maybe I fucked it up myself.

I just feel like I'm in a bad dream, or scary movie. Like I'm the plaything of some cruel higher power that thrives on watching my hope get taken away.",26Feb2020,1

589,"I was never the biggest social butterfly, and have always been a little awkward when it came to interacting with people. But still, I managed to maintain a healthy relationship with my group of friends from school and others that I knew online throughout my early to mid teens.

However, as the years went by... I couldn't help but notice that I'm lonely pretty much all the time now. I found out that two of my so-called ""best friends"" have been trash-talking me for the last year and are still pissed about something that happened ten years ago--when we were 12... over a videogame. The others are just too busy with work and college to find the proper time. Family is a whole different can of worms I'd rather not open.

This leaves me with my online activity. I'm someone who uses a computer a lot, especially since it is also part of my job. I've been part of so many online communities throughout years and played dozens of different online games; I've come across hundreds of people, but no one seems to ever stick around. It's always me being too na√Øve and allowing others to socially manipulate and use me. 

It doesn't matter if I meet someone and then there's spark: that we engage with one another for weeks on end. It will end badly, and I will always be left by myself feeling miserable. It's actually driving me to depression.

I know my flaws. I'm pessimistic, I've been growing more and more self-deprecating over the years and I can complain a lot when I'm really in a bad mood. But still, I try to improve. But whenever I feel like I'm doing some progress, something bad happens. I try to be there for the people I like (even though I'm awful at giving advice) and spend a lot of time and money.

Me n my mom just moved into a new house. This house isn't that big but not that small. This house as my mom claim is historically pleasing. This house is built by our great great grandparents. Our great great grandparents are financially unstable and let's just say, poor. Our ""house"" is just a shack back then. This started to change when my mom married my dad who is ""rich"" at his time. Our families life got a 180¬∞ turn just because of him.

Now for my uncle. He is a criminal. A pussy criminal. Jobless, consumes drugs and alcohol. I DONT CARE ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER. SHE IS A LIVING DICKHEAD. My uncle ALWAYS begs money from my grandmother. But this time he is a complete moron. He steals ALL of my parents savings for my collage. Around 3k were stolen. At that point I beg my parents to report that accident to the authorities but they say we can solve this nice n easy. My parents is just a living angle. He forgives everything and that concers me. That moment when they say no, I just want to assassinate my uncle. ""Kill him"". My mind whispers to me when I'm empty.

I know killing him won't solve anything. So I stopped thinking about it and the whispers stops. Few months later my uncle got arrested for 7 years of prison for drug abuse. Yes, this happens 8 years ago but I still remembers every shit vividly. Now he's roaming around again. Yes, we are not living in the same house anymore, but he often come around without notice. I'm currently studying martial arts and always keep a hunting knife at me. I'm not afraid of him, I'm afraid of the safety of my mom(my dad works outside the town, visits only twice a year). My uncle is 5""3' and I'm 6""4'. I will beat the hell out of him if he hurts my mom.

Anythings I can do to keep him out of my house forever? I would do everything to keep him out. If taking his life is the only choice, I would hire a hitman. Whatever it takes.

600,"I can probably guess what you're all going to say.  That I should obviously report him.  But I'm nonetheless speculative and seeking other people perspectives.  

I was abused physically and emotionally by him for as long as I can remember up until I was 13.  I'm not going to go into detail, but I have some very disturbing traumatic memories of physical abuse as young as 4 or 5.  

I know him, and understand psychology, well enough that I can discern he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and grandiose delusions.  He believes he has a special relationship with God, and that he talks to God, but what he says God says makes absolutely no sense, and he's a wicked man which is not the type of person God has favor for.  He also hates the police and recently once called one a terrorist with a vile tome of voice while the officer was merely driving down the road.

He recently got out of jail and is on Parole.  He's the type of person that has random anger outbursts for no valid reason.  He blames everything on everyone else.  He says he doesn't trust people and doesn't care to establish ""still waters"" with them, but seeks ""still waters"" with his God.  Recently he coerced his mom who we live with and then strongly coerced me, pulling back his fist and threatening me vilely, because I had been contradicting his grandiose delusions with logic.  

He moved in with us when he got out of jail, and he's moving out soon supposedly.  I have more right to live here than he does.

That helped for a while, but now even on my own I‚Äôm smoking alllll the time.

609,"
I lived on my own for one month when I was 26, back in 2011. Lost my job and moved back in with mom. I always had trouble keeping jobs. I was in a few bands. I think, I'm a musician at heart, but alays had trouble keeping a job. 

My upbringing, (father was alcoholic, drank himself to death) - and my own addiction. I had a pornography addiction. Watched it everyday basically from age 20-31. I didnt know that was what's wrong with me. But I can sort of attribute it to it.  Even though I have stopped watching porn 4 years ago (occasional relapse) - I still have not progressed much in life. 

I'm 35. I have been studying real estate for a few months in an effort to turn my life around. It's been very difficult. Studying is hard for me, I'm a very slow learner. Once and a while, I will go to my friends recording studio and record a song. 

[You can listen to my work, here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1bngYKdrY)

The past few years I lived by myself. My mother was not in the house I stayed. She lived with her boyfriend so I basically had a house to myself. It was lonely- but I was fortunate. I always had trouble keeping jobs. After a certain time for some reason, my inner dysfunction comes out and I blow it. Or I Get picked on for being different. 

I don't know what it is about me at my last job that I got singled out, but some guys just start to not like me. It sounds stupid, but I think it's because I can have a strong personality or something, or maybe they don't like my vibe / energy. 

My last job I was promoted to shift lead. (I worked for the tow company) - The dispatcher and other tow employees I suppose got jealous, and started to conspire against me. They started messing with my calls, made life harder for me. I confronted them, and got fired. THey succeeded at triggering me.  That's kinda like how my life has been. 

I gave it my 120%. In the end I walked away with little savings and no job. Past 2 years I worked for Instacart delivering groceries. Just not enough to live on my own. Im studying real estate, and i know that I can move out, I just don't know if I really want to. It's hard to explain.

I am partly motivated to move out, and I'm partly given up. My mother has moved back in. She's chronically depressed. If you want to read more about our living situation, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/f9dyxg/my_mother_and_step_father_are_depressing_messy/)

SO being 35. I'm unmotivated to move out. Probably due to aging. It's like I ""Don't have it in me."" kinda. I know I can do it if I Really tried. But I would just have to take some job. I can't work full time. I just can't. I last longer at part time jobs. I want to have my own space, my own place, but not sure how to go about it. 

If I work full time it would make me depressed. I seem to do better doing part time work and studying / making music. 

I finally have excellent credit for the first time in my life. I have a somewhat decent job history (maintained the job for the past 2 years ... but they recently cut pay and I had to stop doing it.) 

I also have savings.

610," 

I had a panel style interview yesterday (3 people) which included a woman that I had a phone screening with. It was her, one gentleman (Lead-same as the woman), and the manager (who is over both of them).

I want to send a follow up email to the woman and say ‚Äúthank you for the opportunity to interview with you, *managers name*, and *the other lead*‚Äù

But I cannot for the life of me remember the other leads name. I am looking at the organization chart and the top managers in the department include the woman, the manager, and another name who I THINK is the team lead. He has the same title as the woman that was in the interview so I think it‚Äôs him, but in the event that it wasn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt wanna include the wrong name.

So should I just address the woman and say I am thankful for the opportunity to sit down and speak to you and your other two colleagues? But then again, I feel like if I say that then she will think idk the other managers names...which I do...but only one of them. Lol

612,"I'm a teen boy just trying to pass by in life. My academics aren't that great but they're definitely above average. I don't trouble anyone and have numerous friends who all enjoy my company and vice versa. I'm just an ordinary young man like most other people my age.

Then there's my family. Anything I do seems to be wrong. This may seem like a typical teenager's issue but everytime I leave it behind and stay positive, it brings me down again. 

My dad gets angry at the smallest of things. He complains about how I use my phone too much, how I don't have basic manners and etiquette etc. That's fine but he also argues about how I eat slowly! Once I had about 20% charge left in my phone and was talking to my sister on call. She wanted to speak to my parents so I gave it to them. A few minutes later I warned them that it would die soon and i need to charge it. My dad put a frown on his face and started asked with a raised tone 'why don't you charge any of your electronics you use it so much but you're so irresponsible and always leave it till it's about to die'.

My other sister always tries to pick a fight for no reason. She calls me a dog whenever I make a mistake. It can be as simple as forgetting to finish a bag of chips and she'll yell 'Tell this PureChromism dog to finish them since they've lost their crispiness'. She says I have no dressing sense no this no that and it's just really sad to hear it almost everyday.

My mom sticks by my side most of the time though. She shouts at me for lazing around and will give my a chore if I'm not doing anything but that's common in every household so I'm fine with that. 

Sometimes all they all just attack me at the same time and it really brings me down. I became an extrovert in high school and I'm always happy around my friends. But when I reach home after school, I get bummed out. I'm not depressed or anything; I just don't want my happiness to be brought down again and again.",26Feb2020,1

This problem has been going on for quite some time, and I just need some ways to cope. For context, I'm a student, and I really struggle in math.  Most of the time I need lots of help to even understand it, let alone do it.  I also struggle with anxiety, which makes both interacting with others and staying in a positive mindset incredibly difficult. Because of this, I struggle to talk to my teachers at all, even when I need help. I don't want to bother them. (Same thing goes for friends, family, classmates, extra)   


Right now, I have a math teacher who is incredibly toxic. Laughing with the students over something one day, yelling at them for the same thing the next day. Sometimes he'll help people, and sometimes he won't. He really doesn't like me for some reason, and every time I ask him a question about anything, he says something along the lines of ""We talked about this yesterday!"" ""Why can't you understand this, this is easy!"" ""I just explained this."" ""See, this is why we don't talk in class."" (I don't talk that much, maybe a couple of snarky remarks to my friends.)  I hate it. And For a long time, I've been working to bring my self-esteem up. It was pretty low at one point, but it's a bit higher now. But these comments make me feel awful. He doesn't explain a lot, and he really just is a toxic person. He even throws markers people who talk in his class. He actually scares me.

I've been working Monday-Friday 8-5 at a call center in which has been overwhelming me to a point that I cut down my hours to part time, 3:30-8 and I can stay late if I want to. But that leaves me at only 22.5 hrs/week before adding additional time if I decide to stay late, and with those kinds of hours I think I'll need a second job.

I'm considering taking on a second temporary job, but I'm worried if I try to do it on the weekdays before my other job, I'll get overwhelmed or run into instances I cannot get from one job to the next and have time to change and eat, which leads me to there conclusion: Work weekends somewhere else, also in baby shifts and just slightly earlier in the afternoon (maybe 2-7). 

The downsides to this plan are that I would be working every day and I'd have to schedule in advance to go out of town, but the plus sides are that I'll have plenty of time both before and after work every day to still do things and socialize a little bit and interview around. (Because who does interviews on Saturdays and Sundays? Nobody.)

632,"**Backstory:**

First of all, I'm 16 and have a younger sister. I made this account to seek advice. The marriage of my parents was always bad. About 17 years ago my father moved to Europe to work a typical normal office job. I want to keep it vague to protect the privacy of myself and my family. Soon after my mother and I (when I wasn't even a year old) moved with him to Europe. Rewind a couple of years later he decided to start his own company, but that became a disaster and lost all of the money. To survive my parents lent a lot of money from their families. And from here on is where everything went downhill, because of our financial issues my parents fought a lot. My dad smoked every day at least two packs of cigarettes and drank a lot. My mom also drank for a short time too. When we had no income at all because my father's business failed and my mom was an immigrant/typical housewife, we were barely surviving. My father is the hardest working man I've ever seen and I've always been so thankful, but he always threw tantrums, like screaming very hard at my mom, my sister and me, but I always understood this because he was just frustrated about the fact he wasn't able to provide his family, even though he worked the best he could. To top this all up, my mother also had breast cancer a year ago, so we really hit the bottom there. But this event woke him up and hadn't thrown a tantrum for a long time. As of today my mom is cured and doesn't have to be treated anymore. But my mom still gets a lot of stress because of his poor money management. Every week he gets a speeding ticket worth 200 euros and never pays his taxes on time. We don't have a lot of money, yet he decides to blindly throw them away and gets really angry when he is confronted about this.

**My question:**

Yesterday I was watching a football game and a timer of my dad's phone went off. He was upstairs so I've decided to snooze the alarm, but then I saw a notification from someone that wasn't in his contacts with a profile picture of a naked escort. Out of curiosity, I've opened his messages (what I've never done before won't do it ever again). She sent him dirty talks, videos, and photos. I also saw an old message saying: ""Did the drink that I gave you horny?"", and when he asked her what it was, she responded with GHB. In their conversation they've definitely met up before. I assume this only happened once or twice by the small amount of texts and recent dates, but who knows? My mom doesn't know that my dad has cheated on her with an escort. My mom tried to file a divorce a year ago however she has no income nor money. And don't forget that she is an immigrant who is the only person in my family who can't speak the local language and/or English at all, so the chance that she can find a job is nihil. She is also a very sensitive person, what should I do? Fuck...",26Feb2020,1
634,"I am an 18 year old female in the U.S who unfortunately cracked one of my frontal bottom teeth. It's still intact and whole, just extremely painful and exhausting. I also don't have any medical/dental insurance and go through my county's free medical clinic when shit hits the fan. Well, about a week ago shit hit.

I was at work and chewing a piece of gum when all of a sudden the pain hit. I spit out my gum and went easy on the front of my teeth for the next day or so, but I have a severe overbite, and every time I move my mouth/talk/eat/etc. my teeth crash together. That's where the pain is worst. The back of that tooth doesn't hurt at all, just the top/front side. Over the past couple days it's gotten better, but again, every time I move my mouth I feel like the getting-better cycle resets itself. I can't eat a n y t h i n g, so I've been basically just taking huge doses of ibuprofen on an empty stomach all week long, and the ibuprofen feels great and reduces the pain, but it's not enough. (Also additional info, I grind my teeth severely in my sleep and I think that's what caused the crack/weakened the tooth enough to crack) 

So, I phoned the free medical clinic this morning. They said they'd get me antibiotics and set me up to get my tooth pulled, but that's the thing, I really don't want it pulled. It's a small crack that I've been nursing pretty well (like I said, feels great until I bump it), I don't want to look ridiculous with a nasty gap right in my front teeth, and in three months I'm moving and meeting all of my fiance's family for the very first time. The free medical clinic will N O T do implants or anything like that, they are notorious for just yanking teeth and sending you on your way looking like a crack addict rather than perform a root canal or save the tooth. I'm hoping I can start feeling better by the time my appointment comes (another week from now) so I can just cancel it, but I doubt that'll happen.

Root canals are ridiculously expensive (like $3,000) but there's an office who will take payments and actually do right by my mouth, but I don't make enough to be able to pay off the procedure in 3 months. Also, by the time I move I'll be put onto my fiance's family insurance and be able to get the treatment I need once in the other state. But, I'm playing a game of risk. Will the crack get infected? Sure it's small, but it's deep enough to cause violent pain. Will I mentally be able to wait that long? I've cried myself to sleep every night because of it. What if I learn that I can't get the procedure regardless? Idk. What do you all think? I'm open to any, and all, ideas and options.

636,"So I am 28 and have been smoking every day for the last 10 years or so minus some 1-2 week vacations twice a year. My wife is newly pregnant (super excited!!) and I feel that it is time to quit smoking. I know smoking everyday is never good as smoking/inhaling is bad and why should I smoke all the time? 

So before I started smoking at like 16 (not a heavy user until 18) I used to have anger problems. But that was probably a lot of teenage hormones and all that however I usually chalk up my ‚Äúcalming down‚Äù to weed. I generally am more relaxed after I smoke when I get home and before I go to bed. But nonetheless I want to quit for the baby. 

When I look up stuff to help me quit it just tells me you have to quit bc it makes you unproductive and interferes your life. But the thing is I really feel it hasn‚Äôt. I went to college, got a great career started (passing the drug test), just finished my MBA while working full time, I study/read what I want and my wife doesn‚Äôt hate me for it. We still hang out and do things like cook and house projects together bc I can not smoke to spend time with my family. So every time I go to find resources I just feel silly bc a lot of it is ‚Äúso you‚Äôre sick of being a failure, here‚Äôs how you quit!!‚Äù. That‚Äôs not my mindset. I quit 2 days ago and even my wife is like ‚ÄúI mean I don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt smoke sometimes‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt help bc if she at least made me do it then I‚Äôd have a reason lol. She doesn‚Äôt smoke so it‚Äôs even more ‚Äúnice‚Äù of her to tell me that. 

I guess I‚Äôm mostly afraid of being super angry all the time or just not as care free, which might be a good thing. Idk. Any advice on how to convince myself this is what I should do? Or maybe some stories of those who quit?

I love him more then anything, but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to start looking more like a mother than a girlfriend. I clean his room, bathroom, put clothes away etc. He helps out a lot too, don‚Äôt get me wrong. 
But idk, I want to help him bc his parents never taught him anything. Like how to apply for a job or college or taxes and I‚Äôm trying my best. But I‚Äôm getting tired. 
He‚Äôs absolutely amazing to me and is so sweet and really does love me.
How do I get him to be more motivated..

644,"So I do music, because of this I have to interact with a lot of people. I always try to have surface level conversations with people and be nice then move on. But recently there's this person who keeps replying to every story, sending me memes that I don't want to see, and trying to discuss things I don't  feel comfortable with. I try to be nice but firm with bro but I don't want to talk to this person. If this was real life I would just avoid the person and not hang out where they do. But since this is online I don't know how to cut this person off or at least avoid contact without downright blocking (which I don't want to do because I just don't want to talk to this person, not cut off). I have no issue with this person but I don't want to talk to them, I use instagram so they know when I read their text. I'm worried they think we're friends because I'm not a dickhead to them. What do I do? This person is a weirdo, they make me uncomfortable. I don't know what to do. I have major social anxiety, borderline social paranoia, and this person sparks it.

645,"My school term just ended, and I'm debating whether i should spend my time working or if I should pursue an interest in coding at home.

My parents are struggling financially, which is why I'm contemplating getting a job. 

Im also looking to get into therapy for my depression and anxiety, which costs quite a sum too (another reason for getting a job).

But the thing is, I suffer from really bad social anxiety where I would experience depersonalization/derealization for days and weeks. 

If I get a job, there is no doubt I would experience social anxiety again, which would be even worse since I would be meeting strangers for the first time. 

Is it worth it to sacrifice my mental health for financial's sake? Or should I rest at home and do something safer (like learning code)?

649,"M/30 

I worked for a tech company for 6 years and dated my ex (whom I met there) for 5 of those years. We had what I consider a bad break up about a year ago. There was no closure and she has had no contact with me since.

Since then I had quit, traveled, took different jobs and bounced around but recently got an job where I am paid less than I made but am in a field that is pretty interesting to me. The benefits are also, understandably, worse but the people are very nice.

Yesterday I was contacted about a position that opened up at the tech company that I am qualified for.

I know that the tech company will pay me more, give better benefits and overall be a fairly easy albeit boring job. My current position pays less and has worse benefits and being retail oriented worse hours however it is in the food industry which i really like (wine ""consultant"") and seems to have the possibility of one day allowing me to work at restaurants/vineyards etc...

These factors alone I think would make it a no brainer on paper to take the money and save up but my fear is that going back to my old job would put me back in a position of seeing someone who really broke my heart and I only recently started getting over. To be fair I dont even know if she still works there.

Would it be foolish to take a job that may give me more money and flexibility in the short term to move around or do I stay where I am and maybe find an interesting different career that could one day take me where I want to go?",26Feb2020,1
650,"Hello. My car, BMW recently got stolen from my driveway over night mid last year. It was about a 30k car so nothing too fancy but that didnt stop the theifts.

(2 of my insta contacts literally almost look alike) I literally thought she must have recognized me. She was in the same room when I was laying in the dentist chair and she laughed when I was joking about something with the dentist which I found really cute. Anyway...

Well I texted both of the girls on instagram, saying it just struck me that it must have been them. Both of them said no. So basically I met another really cute girl who looked oddly similar (and I mean it) to 2 girls I‚Äòm already into and who was just sitting there. 

The problem is that I might have just missed an opportunity to meet her, and I wouldn‚Äòt really know how to approach girls, because I don‚Äòt really have a context.

I'm a two time college dropout, recovering addict (weed, cigarettes, alcohol), have no real skills, no self confidence, steeped in apathy, and have dental issues that cause me great emotional and physical discomfort.    

I'm nearing being 36 and feel completely hopeless. I have a crappy job that leaves me in pain everyday (which I've only been at for a month, and is also my highest paying job yet). I've been in a relationship for 10 years that leaves me feeling unwanted, unneeded, and empty inside.  

I have major emotional and mental health issues that prevent me from being able to form friendships or any close relationships with any being. The fact that my entire family is dead and I have no friends and a loveless relationship makes me feel so entirely alone. 

I have nowhere to go, am in massive debt, and beholden to my responsibilities that I've created with the relationship I despise. I'm writing this while at a truck stop smelling my coworkers food I don't want to smell and forced to listen to their mouth noises as they suck down the breakfast they should have had before getting to work. I have no control over this. I have no control over anything in my life. I am unhappy, lost, and know that something needs to change but I have no ability to make that happen. I quite literally feel like I have one option to be happy, and that's something I am not that depressed enough to do yet. It gets harder to convince myself of that everyday. 

Seeing a therapist is not going to happen as a) I can't afford it and b) don't need to talk or be on pills, I need my life to change. I don't even know how to get a job that would pay enough to allow me to be independent, or a job that I can actually do. 

I love driving but hate being stuck in a vehicle with other people (I really just don't like people). I love working independently. Unfortunately I don't have the mental or emotional space to try for a degree or certificate while working full-time and there is no way I can't work (I tried and failed miserably). 

I literally have nowhere to go, no one to talk to (about anything), am in constant physical and existential pain, and have no idea how to get any of this to change. I don't want to give up, but I can't see any other option. I'm just really tired of my life and how truly worthless I am.",26Feb2020,1

664,"So this morning I came to work after my usual few days off and was reading some emails on the shared office computer (I am a shift leader, we share the office with our General Manager, the boss in question) and found that she lied to our payroll department about me asking to use PTO. 

I am quitting soon to hike the Pacific Crest Trail and I realized last week that I had a lot of PTO left, and wanted to use it for my last week scheduled (March 8th-15th) so I texted her about it and she basically said no because she had already asked for days off for that week, approved by the District Manager. She said she would schedule me for another week after the final week and just use all my PTO for that week instead. Sounded good to me! Free week worth of pay! 

This Sunday was my birthday, and I obviously did not want to work on that day so a while ago I had asked to make sure that I didn't work, however it coincided with my usual days off (I usually work Tuesday or Wednesday through Saturday) so I wasn't concerned about it. 

I came in this morning and found a conversation between my boss and a payroll person where they first asked why I had 16 hours of PTO requested even though I had already worked 40 hours. She responded by saying that I had asked to use my PTO for my birthday (this Sunday and Monday). I absolutely DID NOT ask her for this, nor anyone else. She writes the schedules so she knows that I don't work Sundays or Mondays. The PTO request was made by her and eventually deleted by her because I had 40 hours on that week already. 

I am at work right now, pretty fuming that she had put words into my mouth about my own PTO. It also happens to be a terrible day at work today where I have barely anyone scheduled so I can't do my job. 

Is there anything I can do? How should I respond? This might be a lot more petty than I think it is and I might be over reacting. I just don't know what to think/feel about this. 

TL;DR: my boss told payroll that I had requested to use my PTO for days that I am regularly not scheduled to work for so that she can have time off on my last week of work.",26Feb2020,1
665,"Hello, everyone. I'm new to reddit, so sorry if this is all over the place or if this is the incorrect spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a new job in retail two weeks ago. The first day I worked I was trained for about thirty minutes before I was left on my own to greet/check out customers and stock/recover merchandise. Same goes for my second shift and every shift after. I've basically trained myself at this point. Every time I call on the manager or someone else to help, I feel like such an inconvenience.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked two other jobs, one in retail and the other in restaurant hospitality. I can confidently say I've never had such a poor training experience. Not to mention I've worked seven shifts now, but I'm still not in the system. In other words, I can't use my info to clock in or out or sign onto my register. I've been using the managers instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Now each associate is only scheduled to work about 10 to 15 hours per week which is two or three shifts. I'm perfectly okay with this. What I'm not okay with is the fact I've been called in a handful of times in two weeks. **Five times to be exact**. I've said no twice (one to another employee which I was passive-aggressively chewed out for), but now they want me to work tonight, tomorrow and the day after as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasoning behind my saying no is because I don't have a license as my anxiety doesn't allow me to drive. The days I'm scheduled have to coincide with the days my ride is available. I also babysit for my family almost every day I'm not scheduled, so my days off are rather busy too.

&amp;#x200B;

Minor details (more so a lil vent): I was only given one uniform shirt, so time is spent washing it after every shift. Pretty annoying, but it is what it is. Also, when I'm scheduled to close, I only have time to grab fast food for dinner and get to bed when I'm scheduled to open the next day... which happens more than I'd like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry to ramble on. I just can't get my head around being called in five times in two weeks. I feel like I can never sleep or do anything I enjoy on my days off because I'm just waiting to be called in, y'know? **I guess what I'm asking, is it normal to be called in so much? How do I stop feeling so guilty when saying no? Should I actually answer the calls and texts? What do I really say when I do? Is it best to find a new job??** 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'd be down to hear any opinions and experiences with retail/etc when it comes to being called in. Thanks for reading, folks!

666,"So context, I used to sleep in a single bed in my parents room because my room was occupied for a long time, but now I got my room back, but then i realised later that my mum would prefer to sleep on the single bed instead with my dad on the king bed.  Maybe I'm just being extremely paranoid, but is this a bad sign for their relationship?

To add details, my mum said she doesnt like it that my dad switches on the lights next to him at 4am which would wake her up, plus my dad always takes up a big chunk of the bed leaving my mum less space (not intentionally just rolling around when he's asleep).  Also my dad and mum may quarrel a little like usual couples, but overall I feel their relationship is very normal with regular but unharmful conflict (eg usual stuff like my dad being annoyed with my mum's nagging and my mum being annoyed with my dad's habits).

In addition, as I'm aware that Redditors are from everywhere but many from America (I'm from Asia), if not mistaken America has a high divorce rate, but not here, which makes me a little paranoid but I hope I'm wrong.

So ever since the start of the semester, there has been this one guy in my college class who sits in the middle of the class who has been a major distraction for me among others in the class.

Ever since the first day, this guy has cleared his throat non stop. It at least happens in 10 second intervals throughout the whole class. I‚Äôm talking about loud, clearing his throat, humming to clear his throat, etc. 

I thought I was the only one who noticed until several girls mentioned and asked me if I recognized the throat clearing and heard it, so I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one. I sit near the front of the room and he sits 2 seats behind me. The girl in the row next to me sometimes gives me looks like,‚ÄùOh my gosh this is annoying‚Äù. The girl behind me is probably one of the sweetest people ever and she‚Äôs even whispered in my ear,‚ÄùOh my god this is annoying‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve passed back a cough drop for him. It didn‚Äôt help. Apparently one day when I wasn‚Äôt in the class, one of the girls who sat all the way in the front gave him a cough drop as well. It‚Äôs really annoying.

When we all exit the class, he walks behind us and NEVER clears his throat or makes any sounds though. This makes me think it‚Äôs a nervous tick, however it‚Äôs terribly distracting and it definitely takes my mind from what the teacher is teaching. This also happens during tests, which is distracting in that manner too.

Should I just shut up and sit back or should I confront the teacher or even him about it. He‚Äôs an international student who doesn‚Äôt speak the best english so I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd understand what I meant if I did. How should I go about it if I do also? Thank you!",26Feb2020,1

My husband's old friend was in a whipped relationship with a manipulative controlling woman. Her and her husband would collectively bully me and I felt no way out until my husband cut it off with them. 

Then my husband's cousin would compliment me to my husband and ignore, belittle and roll her eyes at me when no one was looking. 

So to these three women -- I've been able to drop the first one more than the others because she changed. The other two are so FAKE. Both if I met them now would come up to me and say ""hi! Omg!

674,"I have bipolar disorder, I've lived and worked in 5 countries in many cities and had 12 GPs, 7 psychiatrists 3 urologists 3 endocrinologists 2 cardiologists and over a dozen GPs,

Depending on where I lived I would get diagnosed with something different so realised diagnosis is not accurate and so i started distrusting doctors. They would have different opinions and undo each others work also reference ranges differ from country to country.

In my quest to find the underlying dysfunction I found my thyroid at the bottom of reference range in the country that I live but if I was in the country where I'm from I would have been below reference range and so I bought some levothyroxine online as wanted to do a trial as read in studies it can stabalise mood resulting in not needing mental health medication


So I bought the levothyroxine and it was intercepted by customs. They wanted me to pay a fine equivelent to 400 dollars so on advice of the website I denied it was mine and my apartment building door doesn't lock nor does my mail box which has my name on it nor does the parcel area where parcels get left so I said literally anyone could have done it to intercept.

I have now recieved a letter saying they don't believe me and demanding my credit card and bank statements. Fortunately I paid for it with a bank account with a different country transferred via transferwise to another country and the levothyroxine mailed from yet another country.

So I don't see anyway in which they could prove rhat I paid for it nor know that my other bank accounts that I have exist.

So what should I do ? Carry on lying because they won't be able to prove it or admit to it and explain why. It isn't even really that illegal I can get mailed less than a months worth but I ordered 12 months supply.

To begin, I am well aware that the circumstances of my life, and the outlook are better than those of billions of people. I wish I could find that enough of a reason to be satisfied. I will be as short as possible, but I can clarify if anyone cares to know more.

I am an American male, 20 and in my second year at a four year state university. I am majoring in Chemical Engineering. Since the beginning of my sophomore year I have come to realize I really don't care about engineering as a practice at all. A lot of my classmates seem to have an inherent interest and I just don't feel the same. I picked the major pretty arbitrarily a month into my first semester, in some kind of attempt to trick myself into enjoying something.

Up until now my grades have been high, but a month into my fourth semester they are absolute shit. It would take immense effort and drive that I know I just don't have to even come close to maintaining my GPA. I think the main source of my fading determination to earn this degree is simply coming to terms with the fact that I didn't take my future options seriously in high school, and jumped into college with a big old ego. I *think* I would have ended up enjoying a trade much more but I really just considered it below me at the time.

I have been relatively open about my doubts with my family but I don't hear anything from them that I haven't told myself. Currently I am waiting to hear from a company about a cooperative experience (summer-fall internship) that is dependent on staying in school. Until then I am left trying to decide between dropping out this semester, and spending the next two-four years going back to square one with trade/vocational school or an apprenticeship, or slogging through some honestly very difficult classes to try to find my way in the chemical engineering industry. After all, everyone says the day-to-day jobs have little in common with the classes.

I'm looking for any advice on this, really. Am I just thinking the grass is greener on the other side? There isn't anything I'm ""passionate"" about or really want to do, I just feel like this is an expensive, tiring waste of time.

I (23f) have been dating my bf (28m) a little over 6 months and this man is wonderful. He is so sweet and funny and smart and a great cuddler; we get along great and I really enjoy spending time with him.

The problem is I don‚Äôt feel any sort of connection to him.

A recent example, we were both out of town last weekend, in different cities, visiting friends. I didn‚Äôt think about him once while I was away, I didn‚Äôt miss him. I texted him Sunday night to ask about his weekend, NOT because I was genuinely interested, but because I felt obligated to. I really didn‚Äôt care. In the moment, I enjoy the time we spend together, but I‚Äôm not excited to see him.

I feel like at this point, the ONLY reason I am still dating him is for very selfish reasons. I like the idea of him. But in reality, I‚Äôm just using him as a distraction from my own disappointments. In the beginning I had really high hopes for us! I was really excited and I really liked him (I still do). But my thought process is this; if it‚Äôs been this long and I STILL haven‚Äôt formed any sort of connection with him, then maybe its not worth continuing.

I would never do anything to intentionally hurt this man and I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. I just feel so guilty, I have no intention of taking this relationship long term and in order to save him some heartache down the road, I need to end it now.

The funny thing is though, I don‚Äôt want to end it ‚Äì I enjoy what we have. I am happy with the fact that there is no real emotional investment on my end. But I can feel it one his end and I know he is not what I want long term.

I just don‚Äôt want to lead him on or give him false hope. I don't know if I should have this conversation with him, or just break up with him, or maybe just let this run its course...??",26Feb2020,1

She's extremely childish. Crying about grades, insulting teachers when they don't agree with her, and getting overly mad about relatively meaningless things. I witnessed her pick her nose in class without even trying to hide it, yawning, coughing, sneezing without ever once covering her mouth, and eating without closing her mouth.
She's also always touching me and taking food (mostly chips, snacks) directly from my hands. I told her many times that I'd like her to ask permission before doing these things, but she never does that.

I don't think she's a bad person, I just don't know how to be her friend. I don't know how to act around her and I feel sorry for her because I know that she's lonely. I don't know that I want to be her friend either. What should I do?",26Feb2020,1

Now, I‚Äôm not proud of what I did, but I lied about my spot: I told her that it got bigger, and changed the color, just so I could finally see a doctor. She then again insisted that I had to show it to her. I told her I‚Äôm not comfortable. She lifted her shirt, and if I hadn‚Äôt looked up, I would‚Äôve seen her breasts. She said: ‚ÄúThere!

699,"Hi everyone,

Lately, I've been having a hard time with letting things be as they are and about letting it go. I really wonder if I'm not being selfish or too demanding and I need an unbiased opinion from someone else than myself. For context, I work 9 to 5.

For example my girlfriend is a nurse working 12 hours night shifts, 7 days in a row who's got AD(H)D (she's not hyperactive). I know she's working hard and she's tired due to her long shifts. The thing is when she's in her working week, she doesn't do much (if not nothing) around the house and always scatter her things around (used tissues, papers everywhere, dirty dishes, clothes, etc), we have two cats and their litter boxes need to be cleaned daily or at least every two days be she never does unless I ask her to... and she always forget basic stuff like putting the wet shower mat on the border of the bath so it can dry, never rinces her lunch dishes and leave it on the counter for days if I don't do it myself and stuff like that. I know some of it is due to her ADD.

Basically I feel like I live with a teenager even though we're both in our late 20s.

When she's not working though she's cleaning the entire house most of the time, she does groceries and budget. She's also the sweetest human being I know. She's so kind, mostly always smiling, beautiful.

I just feel like I always need to 'double-check' everything she does and redo stuff she didn't do properly the first time and it's exhausting. For example: I always need to put her used tissues back in the garbage bin because she threw them over and was too lazy to put it back in, the pans and cooking utensils are often dirty even though they are ""clean"" so I often need to clean them again when I'm about to cook, etc. I always need to remind her of doing simple things that are obviously in need of being done.

I love her very much but this is getting on my nerves and I want it to get better.

Do you think I'm being too demanding or selfish for thinking she should help around the house even though she does big shifts? If so how can I accept this fact and work it out?

I'm a guy that needs my personal space to be accessible, efficient and in order. I'm having a hard time living this way. I always clean after myself so my space keeps being the way I like it but she doesn't and I talked to her about it. She acknowledged it but doesn't do much to fix this.

Feel free to give me your own opinion even if it's a (respectful) harsh one.

Thanks and have a good day!",26Feb2020,1

Background: My bf and I have been together a year and a half. It started out great. But eventually He became pretty possessive and has progressively gotten angrier with me. He created threats to make me stay involving me giving him money to keep the relationship. I didn‚Äôt realize how wrong it was until someone told me. He had me so controlled I never even saw it. He would make up by being nice and buying me dinner and things. Not that I wanted that but I thought that was his way of saying sorry. It got really bad around Christmas time where he was saying he‚Äôd send out my pictures and blah blah. But he drew me back in by acting all apologetic. 


So yesterday my boyfriend and I were in the car (he was driving) and he started yelling at me because my opinion of the coronavirus didn't make sense. (Not that it matters but I said it‚Äôs something to increase healthcare profits because as soon as it hits the United States everyone with a cough will be running to the hospitals therefore insurance companies will be making more money. And i said if there was a voluntary lockdown people would still go to work because people are more concerned about money rather than a virus that is like pneumonia) My opinion is my opinion he can‚Äôt tell me what to think. When he told me to explain it I tried my best but in reality im not too concerned about it nor do I know much about it. I formulated my opinion on what I thought. So again he told me it didn't make sense and started screaming at me to shut up. I tried again to explain but he grabbed my leg so hard. I started crying and trying to explain my point. He got even madder and started hitting the seat but first hit hit me in the arm. Then he went to hit the back of the seat and hit me in the head. He then told me to get out in the middle of the busy street. He eventually took me to my car and called me a bunch of names, told me I was stupid, small minded and a waste of time. Now he's trying to say he didn‚Äôt hit me and then that i deserved it. Do I have a case to make a police report? He said if I did he would send out my pictures.

For my entire life up until this point ive lived to serve him, my mom tells me to do everything he says to avoid conflict. This usually goes the opposite ways of my goals and aspirations, he wants me to inherit the farm and frankly, i don‚Äôt want it. And everytime ive tried leaving, im grilled by him about it, he uses my mom as ammunition, and talks about how id be abandoning her and breaking her heart, i have a very soft spot for my mom so i always back out from fear of hurting her. But i just cant do it anymore. My father has made it very clear that he doesnt believe in my goals, he doesnt think i can much in this life. He is giving me the farm because since he feels that i‚Äôm a failure, at least ill have something to fall back on. I k ow he loves me and wants the best for me, but he does more damage than help. Work monday thru friday, from 8:30 -6 and with an hour and a half commute to work, and weekends off to do laundry, clean, and do whatever i need to do. I have very short window to do farm work, which i always do on weekend, cutting out social life hanging with friends, or even quality time with my girlfriend who does the same. He feels that my girlfriend is manipulating me, but he says that about every girl me and my brother have. Hes 56 and isnt as strong as he used to be and i help him when i can. But nothing that i ever do to him is enough. I dont want to abandon my family and i wont, but i dont want to live there anymore. My girlfriends mom offered to move in with them for only 200 a month so we can save money to get our own place. And she lives close to my dad, i dont know what to do, it feels like every decision i‚Äôd make would be wrong. I‚Äôm gonna feel guilty regardless of what i do but i wanna hear what someone else would do in my shoes",26Feb2020,1

719,"So i have conflict with my barbarian neighbor, the story began back to a year and half ago when I told his friend not to park his car in front of my house gate and blocking my car inside. After more than a week, one night he was drunken and seek revenge by asking his friend parked his car at the same spot again after I went out. When I came home and request his friend politely to move his car away he then threaten and provoked me for a fight. I knew he took alcohol because of his asian flush face. I was thinking to call the police at that time but I don't want to create too much attention since my family has slept.  

The next morning, I went to his home and requested an explanation and told him I was about to call the police if necessary. Then I found that he was actually having mouth fight with his wife since  yesterday and then I saw 3 of his kids, 3 of them age between 3 to 5. I was sympathy to his kids because I was unsure what will happen to his kids if he got jailed or something so I changed my mind. Her wife was scared and kept apologized to me. 

But this guy never give up to provoke and threaten me. All these years, from time to time, When ever he heard my family and I are having dinner and chatting in the kitchen area , he will ask his kids to scream purposely to catch our attention or create deep thump sound with either pushing table to the wall or by his fist whenever he has chance. Many times he did that during midnight after 2 am and causing me to move my bed room to another room.  

He only make the deep thump sound once and stop for like an hour more and continue again. I was thinking to confront him about this but thinking that he might said that his foot hit something accidentally.  Sometimes when he has fight with his wife, he also slam the door at the kitchen and the sound freaks my family out because the door was made of metal.

My mum and sis afraid of him because his body size is larger than me, they afraid he might hurt me or something. Both of them ask me to ignore him. But he keeps harassing us and even teach his kids doing the same (hit the wall with something hard). 

Whenever i heard his sound and knew he is in his house, my heart will start racing. I am not afraid of him because I know what he's doing is wrong. But my family won't allow me to confront with him. That really make me sick and feel like to move out as soon as I get a new job, but what about my family. They refuse to move because my passed away dad bought the house with my mum. Many memories that my mum do not want to give up. I wish I have money to hire lawyer but i don't have that extra funds.

So now I am trying to record those sound with microsoft sound recorder and collect as much evidence as possible. And I am learning how to use AI or deep learning to filter the thump sound as well since the recorded file was more than 8 hours long. 

I would also like to hear other options what should I do. I appreciate any suggestions.",26Feb2020,1

He went to a different secondary school and we had always hung out throughout our teen years, only issue is I was in a long relationship with one his close friends when I was 16 and only broke up with him last year.

This meaning that O stopped self-harming (visibly, at least) but continued to be sad and kind of lonely ah home, because her mom is absolutely shit. 
me and a group of mutual friends were sure to say hi and check up on her a lot, and it seemed like she was alright until a few days ago.
she messaged me saying that she wanted to hurt herself again, worse, that she wanted to kill herself but didn‚Äôt know how or what to say to her family.
i know this girl. i‚Äôve known her since i was six years old. i know her favourite ice cream flavour, which colours she likes, which songs she hates, and i know that unless she is stopped, there is a high chance she is going to go through with it. she‚Äôs going to find out how to do it, she‚Äôs going to write the perfect note, and she is going to go through with it.
i know she‚Äôll hate me if i tell somebody. and yeah, that really bothers me, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is what i have to do. we have mutual friends so that‚Äôll be awkward, but whatever. her life is more important. there are two main big problems with me saying something, though:
1) her parents are not good at being parents. they know, and have been TOLD several times that their children are going through some stuff, and never seem to help them. i know that O hates spending time with them, having to talk to them. this might make her a lot unhappier, or her parents will forget to check up on her and she‚Äôll do it anyway.
2) it takes her a long time to open up. i‚Äôm surprised she told me this, and i‚Äôve known her for ages. if she learns that telling somebody how she feels = them shaking her out = being even more uncomfortable and sad, her trust in me and everybody else will plummet.

723,"Hey! 
I am here to ask advice for dropping out of school. Obviously I have my reasons, so I am gonna explain those first. This may be a long post, so if you don't want to read my whole rant, feel free to scroll down to the end. 

It started last summer, when we suddenly had to move out of our old apartment. That wouldn't have been a huge issue, if the owners didn't tell us literally 1 month before school started. Luckily, we did find a new, awesome apartment just in time, and even though moving was really stressful especially considering our circumstances, we were finally at our house a week before school started (our clothes and stuff still had to be stored on the floor, as we couldn't move all our furnitures yet). This was not only a new town for me to live at, but I also started the year at a new school. I didn't even have time to get used to our new home before school started. Needles to say, the whole family was stressed out.

As time passed by, I started to skip school more often and often due to me being sick all the time. I had several doctor appointments planned out, and found out that I had migraine, something wrong with my stomach (which the doctors still couldn't exactly figure out, btw), got signed up for a stress management program, and the doctors found a possible tumor in my brain (still not sure, we are gonna find it out in a few months), problems with my period and multiple other issues. They just randomly hit me after years of being (mostly) healthy, and it just felt overwhelmed. Due to missing most of the things my classmates learned, I couldn't catch up, and came back to school to fail several tests and exams due to me not even knowing about what my classmates learnt.

Now, I did ask my classmates about at least borrowing me their books so I can catch up, but all of them were too busy to help me out in any shape or form. Obviously teachers want students to interact in such situations, so I had nobody to help me out. My parents have never even learned all the stuff that is taught at this school, and it's hard to learn stuff when it's based on things everyone learned when you are missing. Obviously this is a hard school, and most students don't get the most positive grades, but I am way worse than any of the people I talk to. To add up to this ; my class consists of 4 females, and more than 20 males, me being one of the females. This wouldn't be such a huge issue, if half of these guys respected women, however they think that women deserve no rights. They started mocking me recently, and make me very uncomfortable. I am already anxious and nervous talking in front of people, but when I am in this class I just start shaking as if there'd be an earthquake, which is probably one of the reasons they started picking on me.

A few weeks ago, I started having problems with my skin, and have to constantly scratch it. Even if I don't, I wake up to my pillow filled in blood due to my arm bleeding. Sadly we couldn't get a proper doctor appointment yet, and probably won't get one for months. We are suspecting this may also be due to the stress, as nobody else in my family or class has it. I am at the point where there is no day I am not exhausted, and can't even concentrate on stuff. I also have sleep issues since school started, and I literally can't make myself fall asleep before 1 am, no matter what kind of method I try to use. I am just done with all of this shit and finally want some peace.

I wrote an email to two of my teachers, but obviously, they can't do much about this situation. I want to drop out, however, my parents are very strict and due to my other sisters being worse than I am, they always expect me to be perfect, so at least I am not so much of a failure in the family. I don't care if I dissapoint them anymore. This would be helpful to my health, both mental and physical, and I feel like it's time I make my own decisions. I already have several plans on what to do if I dropped out. However, as I said my parents are very strict and sometimes abusive, and it literally scares me to even tell them I want to stop doing the only thing they are slightly proud of me for, I don't want them to get aggressive and just make me continue school, but with them making it even worse additionally. I am very anxious and nervous about it, and whenever I plan to I just can't open my mouth to tell them. I am unable to form sentences about this while looking into their eyes, and I don't think I am ready for them starting to yell at me.

Any tips or advice to this topic? I just want some peace for once.",26Feb2020,1

727,"I got an extra hostess job at a restaurant to supplement my PIC job at a fast food place. 

I love and trust all the staff at my fast food place, and it pays much better. 

Last week I asked my manager if i could change my availability to dis-include tuesday nights. She directed me to the scheduling app and told me to alter my avalability there. 

Tech wizard me submitted an availability that said i could work *anytime* *ever* except tuesday evenings. I brought this hailstorm unto myself. 

Sunday night, my manager posts 2 weeks of scheduling where I'm working back to back to back all over multiple fast food shifts. 

I contacted my manager about this and she responded by sending me a photo of my wide open availability submission. 
I submitted a new and complete availability right then

I immediately went to get these conflicting shifts taken by someone else at both jobs, but i still have shifts that conflict. 

Thing is, fast food place I am liked there and i get paid 11$ an hour to be a PIC for a few of my shifts, which is a job i cannot afford to loose. However the restaurant is a possibility for me to be a waitress and make a lot as well on specifically well staffed evening shifts that wouldn't conflict with college. 

I don't want to upset my current fast food place that i love, but I also don't want to piss off the people at the literal only restaurant in town.

728,"A little backstory... currently I work at a dog training and boarding facility and I'm a junior dog trainer I've been here less than a year and this place is not perfect and there's no room for me to grow in this company. But I can do basically whatever I want, I get paid 14 and hour plus bonuses, it's less than 10 minutes from my house, I actually love training dogs I think it's really interesting and they are pretty flexible with days.

But I recently applied to a breeding/training place for guide dogs (dogs for people with vision loss). The job would be cleaning up after them and doing all the science stuff and that isn't really what I wanted to do but it was the only position they had available. I went in for an interview today and it went great and they asked me to come in for a trial day. I would get 15 an hour plus a shit ton of benefits but it's about a 30 minute drive from my house. 

I don't plan on staying with either of these jobs because I would like a high salary plus benefits job so that I could save up to own my own rescue one day. &amp; I was also hoping to (no shaming/hate here please) get back into my online sex work as a sugar baby/financial dominatrix too and I know some jobs will background check me and idk if that will come up or not.

But as you can see there are a lot of factors that are pulling me in every direction and I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to be stuck at my current job if no one hires me at a job in a psych field but I don't want to end up quitting this other job a few months in if I get hired elsewhere.

730,"TL/DR: should I quit my $17/hr 40hr/week desk job with PTO and Insurance benefits, or work at a gym for $40/15classes with no insurance or PTO, but less time spent working, more physical activity, etc

I have an 8-5, $17/hr desk job in a field unrelated to my education (education in teaching, working in an office / call center as an admin assistant).  After taxes and health insurance (of which I pay $195/month for health, vision, and dental insurance)  I make $1932/month.  I get by, barely and with several roommates, and spend all my time sitting at a desk and eating (they feed us a lot at work).  I've gained weight, and barely have time for my hobbies (I paint and do other crafts and want to build my portfolio up) and working out.  I started going to a boxing gym and while the fees are $125 / month, it's worth it because they force me to get a good workout in and I go atleast 5x/week.

Recently two of the trainers quit within 3 weeks of each other (one was demoted shortly before because he wasn't doing what he needed as head trainer) the other just had a baby and already has a full time job so I guess it wasn't working out.  I jokingly mentioned to the owner I could work there and she was actually on board with it.  I have experience teaching German and zumba classes, plus have been coming to their classes for around 4 months now and know the structure of the workouts pretty well.  

The gym would pay me $40/class, at 15 classes a week.  There is the potential for assistant PT for $15/hr as well.  Technically I would be losing $80 per week, plus need to buy my own insurance (estimating that would be around $350/month)  but since I already pay $200 in insurance plus $125 for the gym (that would be free if I worked there), it comes out about even.  I can make up the rest of the money I'd be losing by driving for lyft/uber, or hopefully be able to get into my art more and that could be a source of income (don't have time for it now as I spend 45hr/week at work not including transit time).  

I want to get in shape while having more time, but I'm always afraid of change and uncertainty.  While I don't think the gym will fail, I have no experience really working in one and that uncertainty / loss of benefits is holding me back a little.  My desk job is consistent and safe but extremely boring and unhealthy, and there is no room for a raise or upward mobility.

I'm on my phone so apologies for formatting. 

I love my boyfriend. He is an amazing fellow. We live together, he treats me exceptionally well, and although we have our tiffs, i think I can make it with him. 

My issue isn't him. Its me. He already has a ring of my grandmother's, but he hasn't proposed yet. He says it's because I don't seem sure. Its true. I am terrified of spending the rest of my life with the wrong person. I believe if you get married once, it's forever. I get extremely upset sometimes (which I've been working on) and feel like throwing the whole thing away. This is a reoccurring issue. 

I have broken up with almost every boyfriend I've ever had because I've gotten angry and just left. ""fuck it. I'm done. Its not worth it."" 

My current bf has worked through this many times with me. This is why he won't propose. Every other time he's with me I wish he would. Only when I'm angry or upset I doubt our relationship.

738,"I‚Äôm extremely obese, I‚Äôm making progress, but if I don‚Äôt continue to make progress than I will have a very hard life. My parents have been divorced for about 10 years now, and most every time I see my mom, we over eat. I don‚Äôt really know how to illustrate this so I‚Äôll give an example.

Last august my father had a heart attack. Understandably so I assume, I was very sad about this, even if the situation was very hopeful (he survived and is doing well btw). Since then, almost every time I eat it contributes to problems I have with self hatred, and really then only time I can eat and not feel like shit is if I‚Äôm stoned off my ass. 

Well while my mom and step dad we‚Äôre driving me to Wisconsin (the place where my dad had his heart attack and where he was hospitalized) to be with my dad, all they knew how to do it seemed was ask me if I wanted to eat anything. It was very hard because I did want to eat, but everything I ate made me hate myself more. I was crying nightly at that point, and if I remember correctly ptsd was being a bitch to me most of that week as well. But still, everywhere we went, my mom would still say ‚Äúoh we should stop and get a metric fuck ton of cheese curds, we are in Wisconsin‚Äù(I‚Äôm paraphrasing). 

Yesterday was Fat Tuesday and all, and unfortunately, an extended family member of mine passed away. This wasn‚Äôt all that hard on me since I never really knew him, but he is my sister and brothers biological grandfather I think (we have the same mom and different fathers). My mom wanted me to be with her and again, the whole time was all about eating. I had so much garbage last night that I fell asleep crying and I‚Äôm not going to lie, I hate my mother for this. I lobe my mom but if another day like that happens where I eat another 2500 calorie meal I‚Äôm going to go insane. 

That is all that is necessary here but I also have a second thing that I want some advice on.

I found out through an askreddit thread that I knew I should have scrolled past that the statute of limitations on reporting the girl who raped me doesn‚Äôt go up for another 4 years.

739," I think I should give more background. I'm a senior at a private Catholic high school, so I knew there were a lot of pretentious, spoiled, snobby assholes, but I never thought I'd witness what I witnessed yesterday. I'm also president of the French Honor Society, which is only important because of the context. The French teacher, one other kid, and I had planned and organized a French party for Mardi Gras where we would make crepes and waffles and bring drinks and stuff. I spent seventy dollars on the stuff and bent over backwards to make sure everyone had a good time and that all the food and drinks were ready. I never thought that someone could be as ungrateful, spoiled, and rude as a couple of the kids were yesterday. I can deal with no one saying their p's and q's but it was worse than that. I was five minutes late because I had to quickly go back to the farm where I work, and when I got to school, even asking for help, no one helped me bring all my food/cooking stuff from my truck to the school. During the entire meeting, everyone just sat eating waffles and crepes, all while I and the only kid who helped me never even got a single bite. People left their cups and plates and a huge mess untouched, and they all simply left. After everyone left, the teacher and I had to stay another twenty minutes to clean it all up and pack up our stuff, with no help from any other students. While I got used to people being extremely pro-life at a Catholic school, one kid randomly started complaining about how some Catholic woman had promoted something Pro-Choice, to which I explained to him that the woman shouldn't have to blindly follow a specific dogma of any religious group and that women should have the right to choose to be pregnant or not, and I would certainly be open to debating him, to which he called me self-righteous along with some other things. My biggest problem with what he was saying was that he had said it in front of the French teacher, a woman who without a shadow of a doubt is pro-choice and probably Catholic (although she insists that she's not allowed to share her view with students). I just don't understand why kids have to be like this. Maybe with the abortion comment he said, I should've just asked him to not talk about it anymore, so I'm willing to admit that wasn't so good on my part. Nevertheless, being rude, ungrateful, unhelpful, spoiled, entitled, and pretentious is worthy of an ass whooping, and particularly one kid's ass is calling my name, so to speak. What should I do? I need some advice. Thanks!",26Feb2020,1

743,"Hello everyone! Guess I should mention that English isn't my first language and that this is my very first reddit post.

&amp;#x200B;

So earlier today a delivery boy came to my house with an order from a nearby fast-food restaurant. I hadn't made any order of course (I was having lunch at the time btw), even though he showed me that the order details matched perfectly with my address, bell, apt. number, etc. Eventually he left with both of us thinking it was just a mix-up.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't give it much thought, but a few moments later someone called at my house but rang off before I could answer them. Since they called without hiding their number I just called them back, but they hung up without answering.

&amp;#x200B;

These two facts may be irrelevant from each other, but when I later called the fast-food restaurant I was told that no one had called to complaint about a missing order, they just brought it back.

&amp;#x200B;

I searched the number on a messenger app, turns out my possibly prankster has an account there (so they are a real person and not some super annoying data-collecting company).

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this post is to ask for advice on how to resolve this. I could ignore everything, but I don't want delivery boys of all sorts of fast-food restaurants showing up at my house every day. And the one that came today left without asking me to pay, what if the others don't?

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of calling them from a different number and starting with something like ''Hello, don't mean to scare you or blame you for anything'' (again, they might be irrelevant) but I fear that either they will hang up again and block me, or in case that they 're actually pranking me, they 'll keep doing it.

My  job is not bad .recently I got  another  part\_time  job offer( which is very prestigious and well\_paid) I felt lucky until my manager told me that I have to attend  5 day training in the city before I start a new job .

1) I have  strange social anxiety.I feel great around ppl.I feel like social butterfly at times but attending  formal/official meetings  where I am surrounded by unknown ppl makes me extremely anxious and i always try to avoid it 

2) The  training is in the city, 7 hrs away from my town .Last time I was there ( 3 months ago) I got terrible panic attack,could not calm down and  left the city at 3.a.m ( I visited the therapist that day and after that visit I felt terrible  fear  that earthquake may happen and I may be injured.I guess  my therapy worked  well bc  I realized my fears better but even though my fear was irrational could not calm myself down.... ( I felt better  after  I left the city)

Right now I do not have a good support system and i also deal with break up .I think it will make my panic in the city worse. I would like to be a ,,strong girl'' and ,,just do it'' but I am not ready for it .

1) Will I be fired  for not attending my training ?

2)Should  I lie that I can't go bc I have minor   physical illness( flu,cold and etc....

3)I live int the country where being open about my anxiety will ruin my reputation :( I would  love to be open with my coordinator about it but I am afraid of her reactions.

I  feel like I am not ready to go and also I do not want to loose that job.what makes me anxious is that if I deny that offer ppl in my community will gossip about me (bc it is a dream job for many ) and it will make me feel even more weird....Plus  it will have negative impact on my current job.

I need some advice on how to make a big life decision...I also would like to hear what you guys would do in my situation.

TL;DR: I am 20 years old and could set myself up financially for life or I could travel the world for a year and have to work a little harder. 

I am 20 years old, I make roughly ~$60k per year, I am 2 years away from graduating college with a degree in finance. I currently have $70,000 saved up and for the last 6 months me and my best friend have been planning on taking a year to travel around the world beginning this July (2020)...I would have a strict budget of $20,000. I have recently been having my doubts as to if this is the best decision because I would be giving up so much money. After compounding until I am 60 I would be giving up over a million dollars, plus I am lined up right now to have a $75,000 a year supervisor job as soon as I graduate if I stay where I am now. I have been contemplating taking the trip at 22 instead by this time I could have ~$140-150k, but my friend most likely will not be able to then because he is joining the military after college and I would also still be missing out on moving up within this company. Anyone who has taken a year to travel when you are young was it worth it? Could I stay here until ~24 have a few years of supervisor experience and then take 6 months and go by myself?

For two nights, her SIL wants us to pay $220 a person. I don't make a lot of money so that number almost made my soul leave my body. That doesn't include food or the gas to get there.

Before that, I dated someone for a few months who ended things because of mental health issues from her sister‚Äôs suicide a year prior. A week before she ended things, she had told me how glad she was that she met me and made her happier.

After her I was with someone briefly who had a chronic disease(won‚Äôt go into too much detail what it is) who started getting more and more sick and told me she had to end things because that would be unfair to me.

772,"Ghosting is such a horrible thing to do. And what's worse is that it's such a rampant practice. I really wish it weren't so prevalent nowadays. I do believe that we can do things to pull the reigns on ghosting. A.) Don't ever be the ghoster. B.) Call out the person ghosting you. 

Here's why my issue is a little complicated. I understand that there are a lot of logistical difficulties and that's probably why this guy may have ghosted me. Nonetheless, it would still be the right thing to do to say it won't work as opposed to ignoring me.

Once upon a time, I walked into my doctor's office. I saw him a couple more times and we had nice conversations about books, life, philosophy, etc. I realized that there was also a lot of tension between us. It felt like he was a friend (who also liked me), I did not once sense a power imbalance. Anyway, after I got labs done, I was expecting his call to tell me the results. He called me from his personal number. I took that as a sign and I asked him out. He agreed. 

Fast forward a little bit. We go out on a date. I think it goes well. He says he's very glad I asked him out because he would not have been able to do it, given our patient/doctor relationship. He asked if I'm okay with the age difference. He also asked if he's okay with the fact that he's a different religion/race. At the end of the date, he said he really enjoyed himself and would like to do it again. He suggested other plans. He even thanked me. 

It's really important to remember that when I mentioned I was happy that I didn't switch to a different doctor, he seemed perplexed. Almost shocked. I didn't know whether or not to interpret it as insecurity. I come home and text him that I also enjoyed myself. We chat for a little bit. And then I say that I think he's really sweet. And that scared him, I think. Because he didn't answer me after that.

 Last night, I wanted to check if he is in fact ghosting me. So i texted him asking how he's doing. Radio silence. Why? I know that a couple of things are getting in the way. The patient/doctor thing, age difference, and different religion/race. Despite the differences, he could have told me that he doesn't see it going anywhere. \*\* The truth would be so much better than blatantly ignoring me. Furthermore, I would never have expected this behavior from a 37 year old man. That's why I'm so puzzled and want to call him out (respectfully, tho).\*\*

I never ask men out. If I hadn't actually really liked him, I wouldn't have risked it to ask him out. I know that it's risky for him too. 

If I don't get a response by the weekend, I think I'm going to call him. I'm just going to say that it's okay that he doesn't think this is going anywhere. But he should tell me. Because ignoring me is disrespectful and I do not expect that behavior from someone his age.",26Feb2020,1

It was all over the news, and well, i know its not as lethal as other infections like influenza (correct me if im wrong) but, i still dont want to deal with it - what are some ways I can avoid it? or, what are some tips to protect myself from it?

I live in the southern balkan region, so, not the best area as it is poor but my family is middle class so we are decent if i get sick (or someone else in the family)
Any tip helps, thank you",26Feb2020,1

I know this isn‚Äôt dire. It‚Äôs not life or death. I just need advice and I can‚Äôt afford therapy. I can‚Äôt afford anything.

They are jobs in my ‚Äúfield‚Äù but I must have went into the wrong path in life but I also want to make my parents proud and not switch to some other lower paying job that might be more fun?

It‚Äôs hard to make good money from it in my area. I feel unmotivated. I want to go on adventures but...how...How do young people with no money do anything fun or travel anywhere cool? It would take so long for me to save even $1000. And no don‚Äôt tell me to be a tik tok star or some crap, that‚Äôs all BS to me- how can you really sustain that especially since I‚Äôm not too funny or hot enough to become that popular.

It creeps her out and there's nothing I can do, you know?

She just kept walking and ignored him. I got her a knife and I make sure she keeps pepper spray on her as well. I get that she's insanely beautiful. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I just hate how helpless it makes me feel. And I worry about her safety. I'm saving up so we can move in together and move to a much better area. That's our next step we both want. I love her.

782,"I posted on here a few days asking something similar but I realized I left out some major details that I forgot about. My (f20) guy friend (19, who I've known for about 9 years so far) and his gf (19) and I all went to the same high school. His gf and I met in class about 4 years before they met. She and I were actually really good friends and we would talk in class and if we saw each other in the hallways. We only had the same class that one year and then, we didn't have any classes together the other 3 years but we still occasionally saw each other in the hall and she would always be super friendly and say hi to me. Fast forward 3 years, my guy friend and her started dating. Not long after they started dating, I started realizing some major behavioral changes in both of them towards me. My guy friend became very distant, wouldn't really talk to me as much, wouldn't ask me to hang out as much (we used to hang out pretty often), sometimes would make sudden changes in plans without telling me until the last minute, he would sometimes just completely avoid me if we saw each other in the halls, he didn't really seem like himself most of the time etc. His gf, on the other hand, wouldn't even let me hang out with him, whenever she saw me in the halls, she would just avoid me and not even look at me or say anything, etc there was this one time where my friend and I already made plans about a week beforehand and he wanted his gf to come, then, on the day of, he randomly just says I can't go with them anymore, saying stuff like, ""Oh, there's no more room in the car"" (There was max. 4 people going, how is there not enough room in the car??) ""Oh, if you guys are both there, it would be awkward"" ""I wouldn't know what to do with you if you were both there"" ""I just want alone time with her"" (Understandable) etc. He just kept insisting I couldn't go which is completely out of character for him since he would always introduce me and let me hang out with his friends and stuff even if I didn't know them. I started thinking it was because his gf knew how close we were and didn't like it so she's trying to break us apart just so she could have him all to herself which has led me to hate her. Not long after they got together, she even unfriended and unfollowed me on every social media platform we had each other on. Like ""Why else would you do that if it wasn't because you suddenly didn't like me anymore?"" And the only logical reason I can think of that caused this sudden change in her behavior was because she doesn't want me to be so close with him. Like are you serious?? You're not his mom, you can't control his life like this."" I really want my friend to know how toxic and abusive she is but he is so in love with her that he thinks she's perfect and I don't know how to tell him that she's not right for him without seeming like I'm an a-hole. She's a very controlling, emotionally abusive, overprotective person and it's not healthy for him to get limited to everything he does but he doesn't seem to notice that just because she's his first gf and he's in love with her but I honestly think if she wasn't so controlling or overprotective of him that he would have a better relationship with her. I just don't think he realizes that this isn't a healthy relationship and I feel like the old him would've known it but he's gotten so ignorant because of her and because she ""brain-washed"" him into thinking it's healthy and normal when it's actually not.   


TLDR My friend's gf is very controlling, emotionally abusive, overprotective and I wish I could make him realize it but he's so in love with her and thinks she's perfect that I'm not sure he'll listen to me and I don't want to come off like an a-hole to him. I want him to be happy but I just know it isn't a healthy relationship and she's not the right one for him. More details in full text",26Feb2020,1

I have a neighbor who has a dog that barks throughout the day while the neighbors are out. I work from home and have spoken to them already about the issue but they are not bothered about trying to fix it (all it takes is closing the blind so the dog doesn't bark at passers by).

794,"To give some background, I am a m(24) i've had my job for 5 yrs now and love the job itself.  I do drafting for a concrete form rental company,  i make 50k gross a year and have great benefits, and already have a retirement going. I've worked in my position for 3 yrs now but....   

I work with a woman who is 50 years old She is only 1/2 woman who works for our whole company,  she has worked for the company for 4 yrs and was hired into the same position as me, so she's been in the position 1 year longer than me ( i worked 2 years in another position).  

The problem i am having is that she hates me, she hates most of my coworkers and if she knew you she'd hate you too, and the feeling is mutual even the 1 other woman who works for us hates her. 

So she is always making fun of me, insulting me, belittling me, like literally making my work life a living hell.  She has even made facebook posts insulting me and my coworkers.  Even one time had me in tears at work because i had never been treated in such a way before. 

i have complained to my supervisors several times, and so have other people, but they refuse to do anything but slap her on the wrist.  Honestly i think because she is a woman in a male dominated field, they refuse to do anything because of the legal repercussions she may explore/exploit.  

To be honest she really isn't that good at her job, she makes a ton of mistakes and always has an excuse to why it wasn't right, or blames somebody else.  She even talks bad about us to customers and blames us for her shortcomings, if something was left off of a delivery she immediately blames the guys that pulled the order, when 9/10 times she forgot to write it up on the order, but it's always someone else's fault.  

We have had to move desks a lot because nobody can stand working next to her, (we work in an open area with 5 desks, grouped into 2,2,1. my boss is in the desk by himself.  i don't know how she doesn't see the common denominator here.

Another thing is she has an associates degree, where as i do not, nor does one of my other coworkers, but hers is from the ""Ivy League College"" ITT Tech, so she automatically thinks she is smarter/more qualified for the job than either of us.  The thing is we have hundreds of parts and pieces to our forming/shoring equipment and she can't even properly identify half of the parts by sight.  Even on the phone she tends to call parts thingamajigs and whatchamacallits, when talking to customers or trying to explain how to do something to a customer.  It is completely unprofessional and makes me die inside every time i hear it.  There have been times where we have had a walk-in customer that she has helped where she has given them the wrong equipment or even equipment that doesn't even go together, and i have had to discreetly run down stairs and change the equipment behind her back because if i speak up, i get in trouble, but i don't want the customer to have the wrong equipment because it destroys the integrity of our company, and the trust that customers put into us.

Basically what i am trying to get at is should i put effort into this company that bends to the will of one woman out of fear, when i believe, and others, that she is completely incompetent and should no longer work for us.   

i am scared of leaving because this is a job i could see myself doing for the rest of my life, and there is opportunity to move up and better myself in this company. But if nothing is done i think that we will lose our complete will to work because of the pain of one person.",26Feb2020,1
795,"So I found a great apartment in Austin by the Domain for $940 with W/D in unit and a fireplace. it's 2 miles from work but about 15-20 from downtown Austin. Being new to Austin I wanted to be a little closer so I can go out and enjoy what the city has to offer. But I think this apartment was a fine compromise because I drive to work every day, I dont go downtown everyday.

Now,

My friend asked me if I needed a roommate and I told him I wasn't opposed. Found an awesome house 3/2.5 that is 15-20 min from work and extremely close to downtown and all things Austin. Being new to a city, it would be great to have two other roommates to go out and hang with. The house is really a dope house, super modern and perfect size with great deck and backyard. The thing is, the person who asked me to be a roommate, I barely really know him. He's the best friend of my best friend, I've hung out with him before and I'm not sketched by him. Our mutual best friend told me he's a good guy and would be a good roommate. His friend though who would be the 3rd roommate, I do not know. I'm planning on meeting him today when I tour the house. Let's just say everything is great and they're both fine, which is what I expect. 

I'm kinda skeptical if someone loses a job and then can't pay rent. My one friend who asked me to be his roommate is currently looking for a job, he's highly employable (harvard grad) and had a professional job before he quit it to go on a spiritual adventure to mexico. The other guy works at my friend's old job, that's how they know each other. So what if one of them can't get a job or can't make rent?

Lastly, I was planning on having my gf stay with me this summer. It would be awesome if I had my own place and that's that. But now I can have a house, it'd be cheaper too. But then she'd be at home when im off to work in the day, and i suppose the other roommates would be at work too. Also, if i dont get the master bedroom id share a bathroom with someone, which means my girl would have to too. But bringing her into a house where I don't fully know the others and she doesnt know them at all would be kinda odd, right? Any advice on what you would do would be appreciated.",26Feb2020,1

31 dollars an hour. I was very surprised. I told him I don't qualify because I dont have my bachelor's yet, he said he would waive that requirement and train me. The only problem is it's not an IT job it's a SCADA job where I would program PLCs and stuff. It's related but it's not really IT. 31 an hour with benefits and a pension and its hourly so he said I can get overtime.

I was caught speaking to a colleague by the partner (I work closely with) when the guy was training me... he told my management (Bi) and external managers (Kay). I spoke to  Bi and used a colloquial word which pissed her off and had her verbally attack me again...

Bi told me in my interview that I would need to do 4 weekends in the entire year... hence keeping my weekend job. I declined the first two times she asked and she had a go at me. I have done about 5 weekends so far (plus my 9-5 on a weekday).

Bi had a problem with me doing my job (which was putting money away) as the bags ran out.. Kay was meant to order this but did not. I have mentioned numerous times over three weeks. I do not have access to security when they come as I have to stay in my position and basically not move. I sent e-mails and such. Today, Kay made it really awkward and said 'I told you they come on Friday, so watch for them, what more do you want, I don't want to see more e-mails.' I told her it's fine but the e-mail was to notify me when they come as I cannot leave my position at that time.

I said yes, I can do but I am doing admin. so have told the staff to let me know when they're here. She relayed this to my boss as 'I am busy, therefore won't take payment' which was NOT the case. My boss sided with her. I stood my ground and refused to take it lying down.

So much more has happened but this is all in the space of 6 weeks. I genuinely give up. I feel bullied there.  I can't deal with my boss. My team are full of fake bitches, sending passive aggressive e-mails and CC'ing my boss into it.

814,"I began cognitive behavioural therapy 5 weeks ago and have had 4 sessions so far. I was really happy that I was able to get started after only waiting for 6 weeks as opposed to the predicted 4/5 months (on the NHS).

You know that feeling you get when you get tell someone doesn‚Äôt like you? That‚Äôs how I feel with her. I dread having to go there in case she huffs and puffs at what I say or looks at me funny. 

I asked her today how many sessions we have together just because I honestly didn‚Äôt know and because I wasn‚Äôt actually told at all and she snapped at me saying that she definitely told me and I must not have been listening. I wouldn‚Äôt have asked if I knew how long we had together... Idk there‚Äôs a way you speak to people and she just doesn‚Äôt seem very nice. 

I get a feeling that she can‚Äôt wait to end our sessions...


what do i do ? Should I wait to finish the sessions with her then get another therapist or do I just end it early ? I feel really uncomfortable with her

827,"As the title reads, my account has been locked for over 10 days and counting.

Apologize for wording, this issue is all over the place.

My wife and I share an Amazon account. Her credit card had some strange streaming charges on her card so she called her bank to cancel the card. I changed my Amazon password immediately and saw the streaming episodes were not purchased by us. Bank must have contacted Amazon for charge backs and Amazon locked my account because of chargeback-alert. Ok, no biggie. Our fault for not contacting Amazon first.

On Feb. 16th, Amazon sent me an email asking to charge another card to unlock the account. I replied with my credit card information and a description of what happened. Even though these were fraud charges, Amazon is making us pay for the services because they were used. No word for 4 days. Amazons policy is normally 1 to 2 days.

On the Feb. 20th the account specialist replied back saying the card was not on record. Strange, that card was charged for my yearly subscription on Feb. 12th. I asked them to check again.

On Feb. 21st I see a bunch of charges on that card from Amazon. He must found the card and charged my account.

On the 22nd, my account was still locked. I called customer support and all they could do is fill out a form. We filled out the form over the phone and they said the Account Specialist will get back to me. I also replied back to the email he sent me asking for them to contact me. No word.

On the 24th, my account seemed to be unlocked, but something was off. I could log in and make purchases, but everything else on the account was locked. My streaming services, my books, my settings, my order list, all blocked. Called customer support again and they said my account was locked. Strange, I can make purchases with my account but everything else is locked. Customer services wants me to fill out another form. Filled out the form.

Today, Feb. 26th, still no word from Amazon customer service or from the account specialist. I call customer support again and they wanted me to fill out another form. Wow!

I don't know what to do. Customer service does nothing but fill out forms. Nothing gets done with these forms. Account specialist is not contacting me. All this because of fraudulent charges were claimed on my account.

Basically I've been with my bf for 3 years. We have a child together and another one on the way. I have no issues at all with his mum. I adore her actually. 

My bfs dad died a few years ago (before I knew him) and since then his mum has been seeing another man. The issue is this man is awful. Hes homophobic and racist. Says completely inappropriate sexual things and generally makes me uncomfortable. Not to mention he trys to dictate what everyone thinks and does around him.

I flat out do not want this man around me and my children. He makes my skin crawl. I have bad anxiety anyway and I literally shake around him. My bf has said he doesnt like the man either. That he hates hin around our son but refuses to tell his mum incase it upsets her as none of the others like him.

We had an argument the other night about it. I want him to tell his mum that her bf isnt welcome in our home or around our son. I told him I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in my own home. My bf said he wouldnt say anything even though he feels the same way I do!

839,"I don't even know where to start. Basically I'm on a downward spiral with no way out almost. So much is fucked right now, my mental health, motivation, relationships with family, money and debt problems. 

Basically you know my mental health hasn't been the same since everything happened during sixth form and parents moved away and I had this mental breakdown.  This combines with zero motivation for anything means I don't want to do anything at all from I guess mild depression I tried a new retail job and couldn't do the full time training and a IT course and haven't done it for months as I don't care for it. Something I'd thought I'd of loved since it's IT. 

I've lived on job centre benefits for almost a year now where they pay me money to live and help survive whilst I search for jobs but I rarely do even though I lie and say I do. My mum and dad and all family members give me money but especially mum who works tons to help me bless her and dad too  

I also realise how bad my dad's attitude and way he is effects me now more than ever, (although he's been that way for my whole life) because of my anxiety and constant worrying. He rarely says anything nice and always, always will have something bad to say or something to pick at or moan at me at. He's not a bad person at all this is just how he is and it completely destroys me and gets me worrying every single day as he does help me a lot with money but clear and rightly so he doesn't like paying me it as it's a lot and daily asks me like a robot ""have you got a job yet"" or ""need a job"" evert single day with the rare just ""you ok"" thrown in. I hate it. But how can you say bad towards someone who works and helps you out so much? 

This Ties in with me knowing my stepdad secretly disliking me, I mean it's rightfully so since all he knows is his wife's son leeches off her money whilst she works hard. 

Both of these make moving back in with either impossible and both locations are quite remote as they are.

843,"I‚Äôm in an extremely stressful situation atm.
(If you don‚Äôt want to read it, I‚Äôll put a little marker and a TLDR afterwards)

Basically I‚Äôm the school president, so I need to deal with everything that has to do with organisation, and all bigger problems from every class. I‚Äôm also the class representative, which also makes me responsible for minor problems in my class. 

This causes me to have multiple afternoon meetings, discussing rules, problems etc.

Now my school has major problems. The main problem is my class. My classmates are constantly insulting teachers, disrespecting them and over all making classes impossible. You don‚Äôt learn anything. The teachers are done with life, we‚Äôve had multiple teacher have breakdowns, which tbh, I can completely understand. No one wants to admit any fault, so there is no solution in sight. 

Did I mention we‚Äôll get our degrees this year?
Yeah that‚Äôs happening too. 

So, I just had a 3 week internship, and then 1 week of holiday, and I was actually happy and relaxed. Now that I‚Äôm back in school I‚Äôve already had one mental breakdown because I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. Especially because of the contrast between how good I was feeling, and how in contrast school has been ruining me.

I‚Äôve genuinely considered dropping out and just doing art in the woods, but thats not really an option.

My final exams are in ~2 months and I haven‚Äôt started studying, and while I‚Äôm fairly confident in my skills, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll burn out some time soon or just have a black out during the exam and know nothing.

So I‚Äôve been going to meeting after meeting talking about my class and the problems and there‚Äôs no result in sight, no one can fix it and it‚Äôs just getting worse. 
I genuinely don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this.

The reason I can‚Äôt really quit, is that then someone will take my spot who won‚Äôt be putting any effort in (I can guarantee that there is no one who will even try. Everyone has given up)

851,"Hi, I'm 29 and just your everyday average guy with average looks, average hobbies, and an all around average life. Like everyone else, all I want is to find a girl who loves me for who I am and never do anything to hurt me, but I've never had much luck. I've had a few flirtations here and there, but nothing really came from them. I was pretty much  not noticed throughout high school. Girls only talked to me when they wanted me to help them with their homework. I guess you could say I was something of copy of a certain comic book character you all know before he got his powers (Peter Parker, Spider-Man). After graduation I was tired of being ignored by girls and picked on for being so skinny. So I bought some weights, really committed, and by the time I reached my mid twenties my body became very muscular and people really started to notice and I haven‚Äôt been pushed around since. Unfortunately, girls still didn't notice me much.



So I tried online dating since it seemed to be the way most couples meet nowadays. It worked for my sister who met her now husband on a dating app. I joined tinder and swiped right on a bunch of girls, but nothing really happened. I wondered what I was doing wrong? I worked hard to make myself a more attractive guy and I really don't think anyone would refer to me as ""ugly"". I‚Äôm nice, respectful, physically fit, smart, and caring. So why am I not getting any attention from girls? Everyone tells me that the one for me will only come when the time is right. I still don‚Äôt know what that means if no one pays any attention to me, how am I supposed to meet anyone? Then one day I matched with a girl named Hanna. She was beautiful, and I couldn't believe she swiped right on me. We started to talk and to my surprise, she wanted to know everything about me as much as she possibly could. This was a new feeling for me. It wasn't often someone wanted to talk to me so frequently. I treaded cautiously while talking with her, as I‚Äôm well of aware of all the dangers that come with meeting someone online. She told me her last name and I was able to find her on Facebook, so I sighed in relief when I learned I wasn't being catfished and she was a real girl. After a few days of chatting and getting to know each other, she gave me her number so we could text each other and talk on the phone instead of using Tinder. This was a first, but we started texting each other and she seemed happy to always hear from me. It wasn't long before I started to get excited thinking I may have this beautiful girl as a girlfriend pretty soon. She seemed to be everything I look for in a girl: smart, polite, dresses nice, pretty hair, and she was taller than me at 6""1, I know that sounds weird but I've always had a thing for tall girls, and she liked the fact that I liked tall girls.



Everyday we'd constantly talk about what we were doing, things we like, past stories and experiences that made us who we are, and things only two people who really liked each other would share with each other. She told me about the guys she's dated in the past and how one physically abused her and another actually raped her and she still had nightmares about both of them. When I told her that I wasn‚Äôt capable of doing anything like either of those things to anyone and she acted like she'd been waiting to meet someone like me her entire life. When I told her about how I never had a girlfriend, she couldn't believe it. She said I sounded like a knight in shining armor that any girl would fantasize about. My heart fluttered because I've waited a long time to hear a girl say that, so I lowered my guard and talked freely with her like I would with a close friend. It was so easy to talk to her, it really felt like we were really building a real relationship here. The only problem was she lived about 30 miles away from me, and my current car was pretty old and would often breakdown so I couldn‚Äôt drive too far from home. She reassured me that that was ok, and I was definitely worth a 30 mile car ride to see. We talked about things we would do together, things we'd do if we were in the same room, and admitted to each other that we were imagining kissing each other. To know that she wanted to kiss me and do all these things with me, I couldn't believe my luck. It really felt like I was being rewarded for the years I spent being an invisible nobody wishing for a girl to notice me.



For weeks we constantly texted each other, we talked on the phone a few times, and sent videos of ourselves to each other. From the moment I woke up each day to text from her til I fell asleep talking with her late at night, I've never been so happy. Of course I wanted to meet Hanna face to face as soon as possible, but as long as she was still talking to me, I was happy. The problem seemed to be that every time I was available to meet, she wasn't and every time she was available to meet, I wasn't. We kept promising each other that we would eventually meet and we both couldn't wait. One day, she seemed to be having a hard day and kept saying she wished I was with her right now. The best thing I could think to do was to send her a picture of myself that a friend took of me while I was working out and my biceps were on display. Her reaction to the picture was not what I had expected. She didn't just like it, she went nuts over it and our conversation that night got very....dirty. You could say we kinda sexted. That was the best night of my life, knowing that this beautiful girl wants me in the ways she said. She told me that she was so happy she met me and couldn't wait for us to meet in person. I still remember her telling me I made her feel like her ‚Äúsoul was on fire in the best way‚Äù. Those words will always stay with me, but not for the reasons you‚Äôd think...



At this point I felt like we were already boyfriend and girlfriend. So naturally I was the happiest I've ever been and the people around me took notice. So I mentioned to them that I had met someone special, and they congratulated me as they've always wanted to see me this happy and with someone. When I told Hanna that I mentioned her to a few people, she acted uneasy and said maybe I shouldn't tell people about her. I found it odd for her to say that, but I thought she was just being shy. I shrugged it off, after all I was pretty shy about meeting the people in her life too so it didn‚Äôt raise any red flags in my mind. Then one day, Hanna didn't text me in the morning and I waited for her to reply to me. A full day psst and I texted her again asking if she was ok. She replied and said she was fine, but couldn't talk. I said I understood if she was busy, and to just text me when she could. Another day past and she didn't text me once, so I texted her again asking if she was ok. This time she immediately replied and apologized for being so distant. She told me she was busy packing for trip to Boston. I figured she was going on a vacation and I asked when she was leaving and when she'd be back. The next thing she told me was one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever heard. She told me she was going there to ""go apartment shopping"". I asked what she meant by that, and she told me it was her dream to live there and it was finally time for her to start moving there to live the rest of her life. It felt like someone dropped 100lbs on my chest. I was dumbfounded and couldn't bring myself to ask her all the questions I wanted to: So what was this? Where do I fit in your plan? If this was your plan all along, why were you on a dating app looking for someone who lived close to you? Why did you lead me on to think we were going to have a relationship? But I was too shocked so I just told her I wasn't feeling well now and that I'd text her tomorrow. I didn't sleep that night at all. All I could do was cry, and I cried so much that my eyes looked like red tomatoes and my nose started to bleed from running so much. I‚Äôve never been so heartbroken!



The next day I texted her and told her that it was wrong to lead me on to think that she wanted me as her boyfriend and that we'd have a real relationship. After all we talked about doing together, she actually didn‚Äôt mean any of it, and now she was going to leave me behind and move to another state. She replied saying she was in tears and said she shouldn't have messaged me. I couldn't bring myself to yell at her and let out all my frustration, but I wanted to know if she meant anything she said to me, but she didn't reply to any of my texts after that one, and when I tried calling her, it went straight to voicemail. It wasn't long til I realized she blocked me. I couldn't believe it, the girl I spent so much time getting to know that made me so happy, just tossed me aside like I was nothing. I had no way of talking to her ever again! The best thing to ever happen to me was gone. I began to think that this was so typical, and I blamed myself for not thinking that this was too good to be true. I hated my life, I hated myself, and my anger was all I felt now. People were starting to notice how angry I seemed, so I had to pretend like everything was fine, not wanting to tell them everything that had just happened to me. For weeks I lost myself to anger, wondering what I had done to deserve this kind of pain. All I was left with was questions. Why did she do this to me? Did she ever like me? Was it all a lie? What do I do now?



It was hard to come to grips with but after a week of depression I came to the harsh conclusion that Hanna wasn't coming back and I need to move on however I could. So I rejoined Tinder hoping lightning would strike the same spot twice. I figured it was a long shot, but there was no harm in trying. This time I included in my bio that I have no interest in talking to anyone who even had a little thought about moving out of the state at any point. After awhile, I did match with someone. Her name was Kim, and she was cute. We started talking and she seemed nice enough and said she would never leave the state as her family means too much to her. We spoke freely just like Hanna and I did before, and when we both agreed that we trust each other now, we exchanged phone numbers. Kim had what I wish Hanna had, the motivation to actually meet up in person. She wanted to go out on an actual date and after telling me she would pick me up because of my car trouble, I agreed. Now I was super nervous. I'm going out on an actual date with a girl. When the night came, I dressed as nice as I could, kept telling myself to not blow it, and tried my best to relax. We went to dinner and talked and then we went to a local park afterwards to talk more. The date lasted four hours, and things went pretty well until the very end when I moved in to kiss her. I was so nervous I pretty much missed her lips. She said we should try again and we both kinda missed again. After a third try we got it right enough and said goodnight and that we'll talk later. I spent the rest of the night reflecting on what just happened. I actually went on my first date. Was it how I always imagined it? Hard to say really. I did notice I felt a lack of love struck happiness. I always thought that after my first date I'd go home feeling like the luckiest guy in the world, but I didn't. It‚Äôs hard to describe how you feel about something you‚Äôre not really used to experiencing so  I thought things would get better and easier the more I date Kim.



We kept going out on dates every week for about two months and we agreed to be boyfriend and girlfriend. It felt like every time we went out I liked her a little more, and she certainly liked me. Then came a weekend where I invited Kim over to my place and we spent the entire weekend watching TV and movies, eating, talking, and kissing. This was something I've always wanted to happen, and when the weekend was over I wasn't especially sad. I kept wondering why I wasn't insanely happy. I FINALLY have a girlfriend that really likes me that I can talk to, hug, and kiss. I kept thinking about the last time I was extremely happy, and that was when I was talking with Hanna. That's when it hit me. No matter what I told myself, I wasn't over Hanna, and I was only using Kim to get over her. I couldn't believe it. I've become the very thing I hate: a liar and a user. I‚Äôm lying to Kim  and myself by saying that I'm over my last love encounter and that I'm happy having Kim as my girlfriend. I couldn't go on like this any longer. So the next time I talked to Kim, I told her how I felt and broke up with her. She understood, but I know I upset her. I'm sure I was to her what Hanna was to me, everything she ever wanted. I made poor Kim feel the same why Hanna made me feel, and I hated that! But I couldn't go on dating Kim like everything was ok when it wasn't. I know was going to miss me, but I know a nice girl like her will find someone better than me. Still, I couldn't believe what I just did. I never thought I would be the one to end a relationship with a girl.



As time goes on I find that I still miss Hanna and how she made me feel. But in my heart I know that she's not coming back. It was wrong for me to jump back into dating so soon after a heartbreak like that. Clearly, I wasn't ready for a new relationship, and Kim paid the price. I would advise everyone watching to never start dating again after a breakup of any kind. Give yourself enough grieving time that the person no longer matters to you. But here I am, back to square one. It's been some time since Hanna broke my heart and I don‚Äôt know what I can do to get her out of my head. I know she‚Äôs not coming back, but I still want someone like her to talk to. It took so long for me to find her, I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm never going to meet anyone like her ever again. What do you think I should do to move on from Hanna? Have you ever been lied to by someone you thought cared about you? Did I do a bad thing by agreeing to go out with Kim and then dumping her? Do you have any sad dating stories? Let me know in the comments below.",26Feb2020,1

854,"Hello everyone , I'm an electrical engineering student who's struggling with differential equations.  While there are tutors on campus I find myself struggling to ask them for help. This stems from the a feeling I have where, if I feel like I haven't done everything in my power to find the answer on my own I'm just wasting the tutors time and taking away help from other people. I feel like this is hurting my progress as it feels like it'd just be easier and faster to ask a tutor for a better explanation. Diff EQ is a gateway course and this is my second attempt, I really need to pass this class otherwise I'm pretty fucked.

857,"I'll try to keep this short. I started getting close to my friend, G, at the beginning of the semester. They told me there were a group of people who believed that they raped their significant other, M, but that it was a misunderstanding over consent over a kiss. Obviously, this was kind of a red flag, but I decided that I would give them the benefit of the doubt, especially because the partner was still with G, and according to G, they are doing well. For reference, I've never met M. They have taken a medical leave of absence, and G says it was because M's friends were being shitty about the whole situation.  Regardless of whether that's true or not, I've recently been told the other side of the story from one of M's old friends, who says that G and M were having sex, and M was saying no to certain things, but G wasn't listening. M also apparently called it a rape right after it happened. I don't think anybody would lie about something like this, especially since G was friends with some of the people who now hate them.

I was recently accepted into a masters program myself. I feel that the masters would definitely advance my current career in higher education.

859,"I feel as if I have an obligation to them to do as they tell me. They are loving parents who have immigrated here and have left their hometown for my siblings and I. Every ounce of hard working money they receive, they save it and spend it on us.

However, they have also controlled every aspect of my life: what religion I must follow, what I should major in, my career path, what type of home I am going to buy in the future (apartment vs house), the person whom I am supposed to marry...

Currently, on the timeline, I am at career-path they wanted me to be in. Initially, I did not want to be in it whatsoever, but after awhile, I started enjoying it. So, I am assuming that is a win.

My whole life, I have been quite unhappy thinking things will eventually get better and they may give me some form of independence and freedom, but this has not happened. I spent my high school and college years in my books, studying, going to classes, and coming home and studying. Honestly, it was way better than what I am doing currently since I have been out of college.

The past 2 years, since I have been out of college, I have been basically stuck in my house unable to do anything. I would love to take vacations with my friends for about 1-2 weeks, but this is not allowed, and since I am a female, it is seen as something obnoxiously terrible.

For two years, my parents have not even cared about how this has affected my mental health. I sleep all day, and even getting out of bed has become a horrific chore for me. I struggle to brush my teeth and sometimes I don't even wash my face. At this point, I don't even have a desire to do anything and I am just sick of my life, and at times, wanting to just put an end to it.

I start medical school in a few months and to think that this is how I spent my time off... And then I will have to spend the next few years studying immensely angers me.

I know it may not seem like a hard thing to stick up for myself to my parents. But, please take in mind, they are from a third world country and are old minded, overly religious, conservative, and think backwards completely. Me going out for a week or two will be like some form of hell breaking loose.

In fact, if they found out I wasn't a Muslim and have been in a relationship for 8 years with a Christian, African American man, they would go jump off a cliff or God knows what. It would be the biggest betrayal ever.

And I unfortunately feel obligated to live the way they want me to, and basically live my life as a puppet, because I drown in the guilt of how they have given up everything back home to be here, and how hard they work daily to provide for me. Plus, my mom is always threatening to hurt herself if I do something that is against her desire.

I don't know what to do. At one end, I want to make my parents proud and give them everything they deserve, but this will be at the expense of my own happiness. And at the other hand, I want to do what I believe will make me happy, but this will be at the expense of losing them and horrible guilt that will follow.

I just assumed that it was nothing but a fender bender because people were still going around the wreck. As I started to get around the fire engine I could see the blue Honda accord that had apparently ran a stoplight and been hit by 2 trucks probably going 45-50 mph. The entire rear of the accord was ripped off and shredded. After seeing that I panned my head slightly to the right and saw a woman laying in the middle of the wreckage face down. She had been ejected from the car since she wasn't wearing a seat-belt and probably died on impact.

I‚Äôm a good student, I‚Äôm very respectful of my parents for the most part, and I really don‚Äôt get into too much trouble. I‚Äôve already been accepted into a nice college, gotten some pretty good scholarships, and I have a plan for my future. They agree that I‚Äôm mature for my age, and they know that I‚Äôm not stupid. In my opinion, these factors should equate to me being given a certain amount of freedom. However, there are certain things they just won‚Äôt budge on. Notably, they refuse to let me spend the night at my girlfriend‚Äôs house, and I have a rather early curfew (10 PM). 

Their whole ideology is that as long as I live under their roof, I will obey their rules. To an extent, I agree with this. I believe that I shouldn‚Äôt be able to do whatever I want INSIDE of their house. OUTSIDE of it, however, I don‚Äôt think it effects them at all.

So I work in a country club. Been here for almost 2 years now. This club has a whole bunch of problems but what club doesn‚Äôt? We‚Äôve gone through 3 chefs since I started working in the kitchen. 3 food and beverage managers, three general managers and a whole bunch of staff. So problem right there.
Our previous chef, great chef, second chef since I started, he had a rule set that said we always had to be or look busy, whether it be cleaning or making something. I work in the kitchen. He knew that I loved to bake and would let me bake whatever I wanted and sell it as a special dessert of the night. I loved it, the people loved it and I got to do what I loved. Later he got fired for reasons I‚Äôm not going to disclose.
In July, about 2 weeks after he got fired we got a new chef. He was great at first, saying he would help people achieve their dreams and bring this club to greater heights, etc etc. But for me everything just sort of went down hill. 
Everything I made he would criticize, rip it apart and it was never good to him no matter what I made. He asked me to do something for an event we had and I would do it but even that was never enough. He said he would teach me but he never did. One day he told me to stop. Stop doing what I loved to do. Up until that point I had become famous amongst the club members for my desserts that they loved and would even ask me to make birthday cakes for them. The chef told me to stop. As I can‚Äôt go against the executive chef I did.
But since last week things have been different. All the desserts for events or for the evening were left to someone else. Someone he had worked with before at his previous job. Before this he was an executive chef at a high end, well known hotel that he worked at for almost 15 years. 
I don‚Äôt hate her, she‚Äôs cool, I had actually graduated high school with her. I‚Äôm just mad at the chef because he seems to no longer have my back or want to let me do what I love. I‚Äôm still stuck on the line making salads and sandwiches despite the fact he said I would get my own baking department in the back.
I‚Äôm starting to hate my job. I don‚Äôt want to pull him aside and beg him to give me a chance because then I feel like I would be pitiful. I‚Äôm only 21 but I don‚Äôt want to give up what I love to work at a place I no longer love to work at. What should I do? Should I just find another job that allows me to do what I love or should I stick it out and see if he‚Äôll give me a chance?

I don‚Äôt think this woman is lying she met my husband the night it happened,  but what she described sounds nothing like my husband, I know alcohol changes people and he could be this disgusting person when he‚Äôs drunk enough, I‚Äôve been around him while he‚Äôs wasted and he‚Äôs never acted this way. I believe her but I also just have a hard time accepting that not only did my husband try to cheat on me, but he sexually assaulted someone. It just sounds nothing like him. 

That weekend I did ask him not to drink because I knew his problem was getting worse and he lied to my face and drank anyways, I know he has an addiction but I don‚Äôt want to excuse any of this. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs telling the truth, and I definitely don‚Äôt trust him anymore.

I‚Äôm completely lost, he wants to act like normal but I feel disgusted and this is affecting me everyday. I can‚Äôt see him as the same person anymore, I have no idea what to make of it. I‚Äôm scared and I feel alone, I want to talk to him about it but he doesn‚Äôt want to even think about it happening. I don‚Äôt know if he regrets drinking and lying and then that whole event happening or if he regrets getting caught. I don‚Äôt know what to think and I don‚Äôt know if I can get over this. How can I handle this and is this fixable?",26Feb2020,1

So there is my situation, my friends at school only talk to me if there's no one else to talk to. When someone comes around I get ignored and the other person is suddenly more important than me.

They don't do something with me out of school either. I don't get invited to parties unless everybody whos has something to do with them faintly gets invited too.

I try to listen to their problems, help and comfort them and try to be a good friend. If I talk to them about my problems they accept them and try to change the topic. I'm rather an unopen person but I really try to open up to people. I think they dislike me because of this (and things like my look) and don't care because of it.

883,"I am looking for some advice on an emotional issue I am experiencing.

I am 33, when I was in High School there was a teacher that taught me from 2002-2003. She was very encouraging and a nice lady. I left school at 18 in 2005.  Whilst a student at university, I briefly ran into the teacher a few times from my part-time job.

I have been reminiscing lately of my time spent in high school and I suppose feeling quite nostalgic. I decided that I would look her up. I since recently found out she had to leave the school in 2003 as she had a nervous breakdown. Doing a bit of research, I have since found out she passed away in 2018. She was divorced in the eighties after a brief marriage (no children), lived with her mother who died in 2003. I am assuming this is the cause of her nervous breakdown.

I feel an overwhelming, and suppose, unreasonable feeling of loss for this lady even though I didn‚Äôt know her well. I feel awful that it looks like she couldn‚Äôt cope with the loss of her mother and really didn‚Äôt have any other family. She probably had to deal with it all by herself. I wonder what the following 15 years were like for her. I imagine stuff like Christmas Day. She didn‚Äôt seem to have much or have anything to look forward to. I can vividly remember the woman ‚Äì she was only 64 when she died. This nice lady didn‚Äôt seem to have the life she deserved to. In becoming Internet Stalker trying to find her, I found that her house was sold after she died (the pictures of the listing still online). She didn‚Äôt have much in lived in a horribly old fashioned house. Seeing the rooms, it gives an added dimension to my imagination as to what her existence was like. It‚Äôs just horrible.

On trying to find out about her, I found that she really had no legacy and it all started to hit home that how fleeting and I suppose, ‚Äòdisposable‚Äô life is. No one will really remember her, except me. That‚Äôs the end of her line. As a gay guy, I don‚Äôt plan to have children and maybe the reason it is bothering me so much is a similar realisation that I potentially won‚Äôt have any ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô either.  What if I lose my partner and have a similar existence? I suppose I am also having an overwhelming feeling of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô.

I don‚Äôt often write down my feelings and thoughts, like above. I‚Äôve tried to articulate how I feel. In a nutshell, I am feeling an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and a sense of loss. I suppose I am asking for your advice on what I have written above. I plan to honour her memory somehow ‚Äì I think she deserves that. I know my feelings are maybe irrational ‚Äì we weren‚Äôt close. But nevertheless, here we are. I also have an overwhelming feeling of ‚Äòit‚Äôs too late‚Äô and regret that I wasn‚Äôt able to tell her how much I admired her as a teacher. There is something that bothers me about never being able to do it, the feeling of it now being out of my control. I suppose I am looking for some form of closure.

Before anything I want to thank you for helping so much people on this sub
. 
I'm a 20 yo lonely student. I have my big final competitive exam for med school in 3 month. I'm studying for it since 1 year and half now. So I am I'm a very stressful situation and I want my exam more than anything.  

I don't want to remember it but I have had really bad depression when I was 13 to 17 yo: suicidal thoughts and anxiety... I still have marks of this dark period on my wrist and body (if you see what I mean even writing the word make bad memories comes back).

 I'm way better now but I am afraid: I have lost all of my friends recently because of alcohol and I can't make new (I study all day and I see no one). I am still crying about my grandpa's death last summer. I haven't talk about him with anyone (since I don't have friends anymore and they didn't really care anyway). I  still can't believe he is gone... And of course there is my final exam, even if I'm not so bad I am afraid to fail.

I am so stress about everything right now and bad thoughts start to come back. I am so afraid that my teenage's year might re begin again. 

I really don't have time for the next 3 month in my life but I have decided that I will take an appointment with a psychologist in my university.  The problem is I don't see what to  told him. How to start ? This is only 30min ... I know that I need to work on myself but I don't know where to start... Plus I have ADHD and a tons of dys and hyper thing so its always so long to explain everything...

Well what do you know, I start liking children as I work out my social anxiety. I also figured I wanted to work with people and hopefully make a difference somehow. I just don‚Äôt want to be in a school or kindergarten.

Some of my friends are looking at the education for nurses and I would personally maybe continue the education to become a ‚Äúnursing assistant‚Äù? It‚Äôs what google roughly translates it to. It‚Äôs basically a person who keeps track of your baby‚Äôs growth and makes sure it‚Äôs healthy etc. They track the child all the way up to age of 16.

I was like ‚Äúworking with babies, without having one myself? Awesome‚Äù

Then I talked to my boyfriend. His mom is a nurse and apparently the highest ranking? Or something. He said there wasn‚Äôt much possibility to work your way up and the wage was lousy. My mom says her best friends started as a nurse and is now a leader and to me she has a very nice living situation. 

Well now I‚Äôm doubting the whole thing and wondering if it just sounded good because it‚Äôs better than being completely blank.

Then I said I wouldn‚Äôt be done until I was 27, considering I‚Äôm taking 1-2 years to grow, work and travel. Then he kinda said it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it, since he is already done at the age of 21.

Josh said if me and my husband couldn‚Äôt afford it at the the time they would settle for a car repair from my husband. 
I told my husband this and he got mad not only because of the situation we were in but also because he didn‚Äôt want to work on their car for free (I fully support him, he‚Äôs not part of the wedding) and he also said they shouldn‚Äôt be asking us for money anyways knowing the financial stress of having a child in the NICU (were from Canada so thankfully our healthcare is covered but we weren‚Äôt working at the time and running the roads everyday). I sent her a message back, trying to be as polite as I could just explaining we weren‚Äôt in a financial position to give her $50 and a gift. I apologized profusely and just didn‚Äôt mention the car repair. She was ok with this!! This was early October. I had communication with her until early November then it stopped.

910,"This season is coming up and starting in 3 weeks. I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm playing and I‚Äôve been thinking for the past 3 months and been unable to decide. I am in desperate need of some help. I‚Äôve been told to listen to my heart a lot and I still have gotten nowhere. 

Summary of my situation:
I‚Äôm a sophomore this year and I was the only pitcher on my team last year. I was overworked and got an injury near the end of last season from repetitive motion in my shoulder. I went to PT all fall/winter and still can‚Äôt pitch or throw without pain. Anyway, last year I was miserable and was under so much pressure to constantly perform perfectly. The coach was also mean. I started to lose interest in softball, the sport I‚Äôve been playing for 10 years. A lot of my friends are on the team too and I don‚Äôt want to let them down. I‚Äôve talked to my coach and there most likely aren‚Äôt any other positions for me on the team, other than bench, since I can‚Äôt really pitch. 


I need to decide wether or not to play this season. I honestly can‚Äôt make a decision and nobody is really helping me. I am being persuaded to play by everyone I talk to (including my parents). My parents keep telling me to do it and sit on the sidelines all season and be a ‚Äúteam player.‚Äù I get how this is important, but it seems like such a waste of time to me if I‚Äôm going to be committing so much time to just observe.


Reasons I don‚Äôt want to play: 
- I‚Äôm worried about my shoulder and making it worse. This could cause more problems later in my life.
- I hated it last year and didn‚Äôt have fun most of the time
- It was too stressful. 
- It took up all of my free time 6 days a week for 3 months. 
- I would have to quit my job that I‚Äôve been working for 3 weeks at. 
- I wouldn‚Äôt be able to focus on my hobbies or school 
- I would be happier and better mentally. 
- I would be able to work at a coffee shop in town in addition to my other job(my other job is a one day a week thing)


Reasons I want to play/things holding me back from quitting: 
- My friends are on the team and I might feel left out/ regret quitting 
- things might be better this year 
- I‚Äôve been playing for such a long time and idk if I‚Äôm ready to let go. 
- I don‚Äôt want to piss my friends off and let down the team. 
- I would walk by my coach everyday and have a really awkward time in her gym class senior year.
- I wouldn‚Äôt see a lot of my friends often. (I‚Äôm kind of introverted and don‚Äôt have many friends, so it would be hard for me to go out and make new ones)
- I would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle. 
- I don‚Äôt do much extracurricular things and might get bored
- I already told my coach ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably play‚Äù so it might be awkward explaining to her why I changed my mind

926,"Hey hey I feel weird asking a bunch of strangers for advice but I am not good at opening up to my friends despite them being very supportive actually.
This is a very long paragraph sorry 

So like my entire life I‚Äôve been easily bored, always moving on to the next thing, easily distracted and distracting others. It was fine when I was a child because it could just be brushed off as ‚Äúbeing a kid‚Äù but as I got into highschool it sort of became a problem. (Keeping in mind I didn‚Äôt get good grades in primary and had a low attendance and was barely in school, I missed like half the year in grade1/2). I‚Äôm in highschool now and I can‚Äôt concentrate for longer than like 5 minutes, if someone is speaking it‚Äôd be probably 30 seconds top and I forget things very easily. 
I often do my homework in form or right before the class it‚Äôs due in and struggle to understand instructions/ stay in tune in conversations. And I have to constantly ask peers what we are doing and have been told that my fidgeting (which usually I‚Äôm unaware of) is irritating. 
I looked it up on google to see if there was a way to increase my attention span and all that but ended up finding out about a thing called ADD. I‚Äôm not sure I have it because I, currently, have decent grades in most subjects, I have quite a lot of friends. I constantly have this weird amount of energy? Like I can run a cross country. 
I am constantly loosing things and basically have all the symptoms for it aside from difficulty making friends or failing classes or handing in homework (I do them right before class). 

So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it to try see what‚Äôs wrong?

I also have a concerning lack of empathy. I dont know why but I have never felt any remorse or sympathy for others, sure I fake it, but it‚Äôs never genuine. I am easily ticked off and get so angry like I‚Äôve thrown an ironer at someone once and switch emotions very quickly. I am aware that I have violent tendencies that shoudlnt be normal. 
I do not know if I can speak to my parents about any of this because they are the type of parents who constantly argue and I‚Äôve been thru every abuse you name it

I am not sure about what to do? Should I just continue my life and hope I get thru it? Do I show symptoms just because I‚Äôm stupid/lazy and over thinking it?

My boyfriend‚Äôs mom grew up with 5 other sisters who would all constantly sneak out and go to parties and do drugs and drink and one of her sisters stole a significant amount of money (thousands of dollars) from their parents to buy drugs. Because of this she treats us like we do the same. My boyfriend and I have never snuck out, we are always honest about where we are going and who we will be with. We do not do drugs (besides weed) and we do not drink. Yet she always had felt the need to accuse us of doing things like this, and would go through our room while she was cleaning. So a couple of years ago we asked her to stay out of our room and bathroom because we wanted privacy. (and surprisingly she did) 

This weekend we went to stay at a friend‚Äôs house and gave her permission to fold some of our laundry. When we got back I realized our 7‚Äù neon pink dildo (Debra) wasn‚Äôt in the bathroom closet where it was left. My boyfriend and I searched the entire bathroom and our bedroom for it in case we had moved it and forgotten. (It‚Äôs pretty hard to loose a neon pink 7‚Äù dildo.)

He once started dating a girl that I liked way back in eighth grade. He never replied to me properly, he would just go and be an asshole to me every once in a while. After some point of his life, he pretty much just threw me away, and I was so sad that I did nothing about it.


He would always say that he was having troubles personally, but now I feel like he overcame his problems and I'm the one who have stuff to figure out. It looks like now that he has accomplished all the shit he wanted (and some of the shit that I wanted), he wants to be my friend again. He wasn't the worst back in the day, honestly he was my only friend from school back in 2012. But thinking about it now, I feel like I should give the guy a chance. I don't have many friends. He sent me a message saying ""I miss you bro"", and really no one ever said this to me. But at the same time, just a couple of weeks ago I was thinking about how my life would have been better without him. He knows that he hurted me before, he said he was sorry once, but all the shit that happened before still makes me kind of sad. I don't know exactly how to feel, but maybe God or something wants me to give this motherfucker a chance, since we had our moments and also I'm feeling pretty fucking lonely.

So basically, to keep this short and to the point, I‚Äôm (F19) upset that my mom doesn‚Äôt seem to view my relationship with my boyfriend (M23) as serious as I do. 

I‚Äôve dated people before my current boyfriend, but I‚Äôve never fallen in love until him. Nor have I told my family about anyone until him. Not to gush over him, but he just seems like the perfect match for me and he‚Äôs just about the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. I think we could potentially last quite a while. 

My mom has always been, like most mothers, very protective of me. So my decision to go to a university 1,000 miles from home has definitely taken an unspoken toll on her emotionally. I reluctantly told her yesterday that this weekend, my boyfriend and I were going to go on a road trip to visit my eldest brother. It‚Äôs about a 6 hour drive. She said ‚Äúokay, but why? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going to marry him. Why does he need to meet your brother?‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been through quite a bit in my childhood and because of the unusual amount of exposure I feel like I‚Äôve had to the way people are, I try to be a rational person and think realistically. I understand that people change, things happen, feelings fade, or sometimes life just gets in the way. I must admit though, hearing her say that I wouldn‚Äôt marry him sort of... dampened my mood.

962,"So for about 3-4 weeks now, I've noticed a sort of mental fog in my head. It's been present and about 5 weeks ago I had a major personality shift. I used to be really fun and outgoing, now I'm just tired, depressed, and don't even really have the energy to socialize or anything like that.

Now since last week I noticed that I am starting to lose my memories. It was something simple like not remembering what I ate for breakfast and things like that, and this week it's changed. Two days ago I noticed the mental fog setting in and I couldn't even socialize or anything like that and today something changed. I can't remember anything. That's not an exaggeration, the best example I can give is that it feels like I have a wall in my head blocking off all my memories. I can barely remember anything about my life and my past experiences. If I really think about it, I can unlock a memory or two but other than that my head is blank.

My head hurts but I don't even feel any pain. Something just feels off. I have no one to really talk to about this since I am still in high school and my dad wouldn't believe me and my mom would blame it on my phone.

I'm getting enough sleep at night and everything is good. The only different things that I've noticed is that I'm taking a medicine called Focus Factor and I've been using that for 2 weeks, but I also notice this brain fog if I don't use it for a day or something like that. The only other thing I've had is that I'm now started to become attracted to weird sexual stuff, like things that I'm not comfortable saying but I know that stuff is wrong, but sometimes I just can't even control my mind and it just goes there and I'll move my legs around or something like that, like I'm trying to masturbate in a way, but I'll stop this but it's been happening constantly for about 5-6 weeks now and I haven't done anything like that to the point of an orgasm so I don't think anything has happened sexually or anything but this stuff is weird, screwed up stuff that I'm not even attracted to, but it's just in my mind and causes me to worry, so I don't know if that is the problem or not.

965,"I run a t-shirt design business, and I placed an order for a small run of prints last summer with my vendor who prints shirts. This was a subcontract for a slightly larger company that I work with, and I‚Äôm very close to the owner of that company. He‚Äôs my mentor.

The manager (not owner) of the supplier is extremely close to me as well, and he will sometimes waive fees or do freebies for the owner of the larger company. Never has done that for me though.

Well, this order... my client bailed due to dissatisfaction with the final product.

My mentor was not happy, and I was blamed (for reasons we won‚Äôt get into). But though the client was unhappy, he was willing to talk them into paying some, and he also told the client that they could pay the supplier directly for cost. I‚Äôm unsure if they did that. Granted, I also actually received a very small sum for my time (and an apology for their overreacting).

I continued my business for the year, paying invoices and the like with the same vendor, but I never received an invoice for this order gone wrong... 

All three of us are close, and my concern here is that my mentor explained the situation to the manager of the supplier, and he waived the fees like he would for my mentor. That‚Äôs super presumptuous, but all signs are pointing to this.

Nearly a year has passed, and I don‚Äôt want to say anything because I A) don‚Äôt want to get my mentor in trouble since it was technically his invoice, and I was only doing the work, B) don‚Äôt want to get the manager in trouble if he was doing me a favor, as he is known to do, and it is supposed to go under the radar, and C) maybe the client paid the vendor. I don‚Äôt know.

Part of me wants to do the moral thing and check in, but the other part of me is afraid if I stir the pot a year later, it will set off a chain of events that will ruin things for people that may be trying to help me.

Needless to say, I handle all my clients differently, and I have improved. But a year later, this is eating at me. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll receive that invoice and get a thorough chewing out for not paying as well. On one hand I potentially screw myself, and on the other hand I potentially screw two people who wanted to help me. Then there is the third mutant hand where the client actually called in and paid.

I always pay my debts, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to screw over friends who are trying to help me if they are. If I bring it up, I‚Äôm afraid it will cause more problems. In any other circumstance I would track someone down to pay them... Should I just leave it alone until it‚Äôs brought up, if ever?

972,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking advice to help my not so tech savvy (previous) coworkers, the business is located in Massachusetts. For some background I worked at this small family owned restaurant for seven years, left last january, and came back to work under the new owner two weeks ago.  I have two big things that happened and we are not sure if there's even an option for them. I was not sure if this met the requirements of r/legaladvice or not so I guess I'll start here.

Current: 

Issue 1:

Monday I went in for my scheduled shift to find out the owner cut my coworker from Saturdays (she has held this shift for three years). She asked the owner why she was cut and he refused to talk to her. The day continues, she's running a credit card and the owner approaches her and says something nasty, she does not respond and walks away. Fifteen to twenty minutes later we walked out back to the kitchen at the same time, we both had food orders to take out. While we are picking up our food the owner looks at my coworker and tells her she needs to leave. Both of us are in shock, we bring our orders out and then head back into the kitchen. This is where we find the cook (he's new maybe worked there a month) waiting for us. He pulls my coworker aside and says ""You need to leave right now or I'm calling the police"". Both of us don't even know what to do but she says fine and starts packing up her stuff, at this point she does say something not so nice to the cook but it was not in front of customers and she was not yelling. The cook goes ""You know what? I'm just calling the cops anyways."" So he did, she left right away without any issue. At this point I walk into the kitchen, find the owner hiding in his office from my SIXTY YEAR OLD coworker who has already left. I ask if he really called the cops, he did, I told him I was done and I would have to leave too. He's very upset, but I go back out, put in five tables worth of orders so the third server isn't completely drowning (she is a very new hire and saw nothing of what happened). I'm packing up my stuff when the cops show up, I go to leave and he is telling the police that my coworker got violent and started a scene. That's the last I heard while leaving. I was then told later by another person who works there, that she got called in, was not told the situation and the police were still staking out the building because of the report of a violent terminated employee.

It used to be even worse, but over the last few months I cried before, as well as after sports (my parents had to deal with me at like 7am, just bawling my eyes out because I didn't want to go swimming, and I missed half of Geography class and French because I was crying because of something, I don't even know what, that had happened during sports class). (I think) I had a panic attack because I didn't want to go to the doctor's, and after I was done having a panic attack I just started crying, panicking some more and running around in front of the doctor's office, and of course my mother had to deal with the whole mess.

998,"I'm a 16 year old male high school student. I believe I have a sex addiction. My confidence and self esteem lies solely on sex. I'll be sitting in class and all I can think about is fucking the cute girl next to me. I'll go home and search for porn of high school girls just because I cant get them myself. I'm not attractive or in shape. I'm not appealing whatsoever to my peers. But every day I look and see that that cute chick across the room has a bit of cleavage showing. Or that other girl is wearing tights and her ass is showing. I envy my Male peers and always assume they're getting laid more than me. I'm aware of all my flaws. I know this isnt healthy and I know I'm a fucking creep. I know I need to change this. I either need advice on how to start getting laid in high school or stop focusing mainly on how sexually undesirable I am. I need help. But I dont know how to get it.

DISCLAIMER: I'm in therapy. TLDR: Friends don't make meeting as a small group a priority.

So  I have a group of 5 friends. We know each other because we were pageant contestants together. For a while after the pageant, the gc was still quite active. One girl S moved without telling any of us.

The others are still on campus and involved in the club associated with the pageant. The issue is they some not all of them have boyfriends( I'll admit I'm jealous of that, I've never had a good relationship.) and will  make time for dates with them. Yet they can't take the time for just our small group to meet.

Imo it's that they just feel like bf are more important than our friendship. I've expressed my feeling and got the I'm busy with school/work. I know make other friends, I've joined a church group and the same problem is there we can only meet at group church events. Nobody asks to meet as a small group. I only have one person I can do one to one with. She's great, I  love her but I need more. I have a family who loves me but that's just not the same.",26Feb2020,1

I chose to have her cremated (I wasn't that far along so there are almost no ashes) and I have been tryi g to find a way to have a memory of her. Since I havz always had a love for bonsai and am the proud owner of a few of them (bought, not grown from scratch) i had this idea of building a fairy garden consisting of various trees and maybe some flowers/plants. My budget is unlimited and space-wise i will make sure I just get whatever the trees need. 
Now, even though I have been taking care of the ones I have succesfully, I lack all knowledge for a project like this and given the sentiment behind it I want to do it right. 

Is there anyone who can help me with advice, pictures or even suggestions as to wich trees would be adviseable? Also, her name is Rosalee so if anyone has any clever ideas on how to work that into there without it looking like a shrine? My creative mind is kind of muddy right now.

My mom didn't realise how much it hurt when she tells me to drive places alone or get a job. It feels like every bit of childhood I've clung to is disappearing. I think there's something wrong. Listning to 'Never Grow Up' by Taylor Swift makes me bawl like nothing else. Every time I have to tell someone I'm 18 I feel so horrible and I want to cry.

1004,"Hey all. I (35 M) am a graphic designer for a small design agency and publisher that relies mostly on our publications' advertising, on both print, and web. It kind of ends up being a lot when it comes to managing multiple clients and informing them of everything we do and offer. Therefore, we have salespeople/account executives. Some ""sales"" is always taken up by our owner, who obviously has other job responsibilities. And then we have always had one (or for a couple months there were two) other strictly salespeople. They earn an EXTREMELY low base salary, earn a low commission, and get a minuscule gas stipend that does not equate to the amount of time that they are expected to be on the road visiting clients (or potential clients). 

I have seen these salespeople come and go. There have been at least 5 over the course of my time here. Our CURRENT salesperson (about 45/46 M) is the best one yet: considerate, driven/hard worker, knowledgable, well-spoken, is well-versed with data analyzation working towards strategic marketing plans, among more qualities. He took a pay cut switching from his former job in terms of guaranteed salary, obviously with hopes that commission pay would compensate. Anyway, earlier today when nobody else was in the office, he just vented to me about how he is struggling financially, as well as having received a few snide remarks and micro-managing comments. Of which I sit within earshot of, and I have publicly commended him later on because he genuinely does a good job (at least from my perspective).

One could say that nobody deserves any sort of micro-managing, let alone someone with his past experience. Obviously it is something anyone can do without, but it's harder for him to shrug these unneeded comments off given his money situation caused by the low pay caused by the owner. Not only do I want this guy to stay as I see him as a good employee for us, he also easily befriends people such as myself. Furthermore, if my company loses him, we'll go on a long search for the right applicant that includes someone who is AGAIN expected to do a lot for little pay. Ergo the cycle will continue. What can I do to help keep him around? Thanks.",26Feb2020,1

1008,"Hello Reddit,

Here is my situation. I moved in my new apartment during summer 2019. My girlfriend and I smoke cannabis on a regular basis (2 or 3 joints on the week end). It says clearly in the lease that we can't smoke weed or cigarette inside or even on the balcony. To put you in perspective, it smells like cigarette in the whole complex all the time. And I know we're not the only one smoking in the block.

Everything was going well, but 3 weeks ago, there is a knock on my door. It's my direct neighbor, and he screams. A lot. Mainly at my GF, she the one who answered the door.

""YOUR FUCKING WEED SMELLS LIKE SHIT. I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS"" (we live in Canada, it's legal)

I tried to answer calmly, didn't work. He kept screaming. Closed the door went back to my movie. 

Few minutes later, my concierge comes up and knocks on my door. He's very calm, asking if we smoke inside, we answered that we always smoke by the window at the far end of the apartment. Light a candle, put towel under the doors and spray a reasonable amount of spray. We take all the necessary measures to make sure we do not disturb our neighbor. 

2 weeks goes by without hearing from him. 

5 days ago, he knocks back. He's calm, but very condescending. 

We have a few meaningless verbal exchanges and he goes inside his apartment.  

""You're not in your parent basement anymore""

""You look so high""

A minute later, it started to smell like if he had thrown 1 gallon of cheap perfume in our shared lobby!

It smelled really strong. It gave me and my GF a headache instantly.

Now he's doing it every night for the pass 4 days. Muliptle times per evening.

I guess I already know most of the answers I'll get. I know I'm not supposed to smoke inside, but his attitude are pissing me off. I don't want to move, but I can't stand the perfume anymore.

We are beyond talking at this point and I'm not comfortable with confrontation. 

I'm seeking advice Reddit!!

Thanks

1010,"The title sums it up.  I'm a 26 y/o male and I am scrambling.  

I have never been able to get a daily routine and now it's a problem.  I've been fired from my last two jobs for being chronically late to work, despite no problems with work performance or coworkers.  

I failed out of college because of poor time management.  It took me longer to learn than other people, and I missed assignment deadlines and slept through 9am classes (and morning alarms).  

I wish I could say I at least partied often and had a vibrant sex life which caused these issues -- but I had no such thing.  In fact, most people on campus did not know me because I did not have time to participate in social activities.  I was simply always scrambling to get to class on time and to try and finish my assignments before the deadlines. 

Ultimately,  I never learned how to wake up early in the morning and I find myself needing 10 hours of sleep daily.  In high school, I was late to my first class most days.  Same goes for elementary school.  And anything I have ever signed up for really.  So this is nothing new.

My natural circadian rhythm runs from 11pm - 9am.  Conveniently located to sleep too early for nightlife and wake too late for morning life.  None the less, my body produces melatonin consistently at 11pm (I start to feel tired) and I naturally wake up everyday -- if uninterrupted -- at about 9-9:30am.  Without fail.  

I sleep through alarms, and if I get an alarm clock loud enough I get headaches and feel jittery from waking up earlier than usual.  If I force myself up earlier long term I begin to have mental breakdowns.  I start locking my keys in my car more frequently; I begin forgetting prior time commitments and assignments.  Then I just crash and have to cancel everything to recoup from exhaustion. 

I fear I will never have time for a sexual or romantic relationship, casual or otherwise, and it scares me.  Furthermore, I struggle to provide for my most basic needs due to being often fired.  And my education background really only qualifies me for minimum wage jobs.  

I need big help.  I just want to not get fired so I can have enough money to buy food, pay rent, other bills and basic necessities consistently without panicking.  And somehow have enough time and money to try and go out and find a consenting sex partner if possible as well.  I don't know how other people do it; it's like a superpower to me.",26Feb2020,1

1016,"As above, I need advice on how to move on from my ex partner. I'll go into detail below. 

I am 25. I met my ex partner when I was 19. It was a difficult time in my life, and I was going through some huge changes.

He was 13 years old than me, which suited me well. I've always been older in so many ways. I've had an adult kind of life since I was very young. 

We fell in love so quickly. He was my first love, and it was beyond anything I'd ever imagined possible. Dopamine was exploding in my body. He was my sun. Surprisingly, for being so much older and having loved before, he loved me back just as hard. He was the most gentlemanly, loving, kind, passionate person I had ever met. 

Although flawed, as we all are, his main struggle was beyond my understanding. He was in recovery. Heroin. 

I was so naive. I thought I understood addiction. I thought I understood recovery. I didn't. 

We fell hard and quick. It was codependent and unhealthy, but it was truly amazing. 

He relapsed 8 months in. Looking back - of course he did. Our love, as magical as it was in ways was too much. Too much of everything. 

Long story short, we were on and off for the next year and a half. We lived together, then we didn't. He was using, then he wasn't. Lying a lot. Living as an addict, me still living in naivety but believing I knew what I was doing. 

Anyway, I finally put an end to it and after being on my own for some time, I started casually seeing someone else. 

He was a great guy. Is a great guy. We were casual to start  with but then we said I love you. I don't really know if I did. Truly. I was so desperate for that feeling again. That all consuming love - which I know in my brain is not healthy and not what I need, but I was always comparing him and what we had with what I'd had before. It never measured up.

I got pregnant. We had our daughter. She's 6 months old and I've ended our relationship recently. 

He is a wonderful man and will be someone's everything. He's not mine. He maybe could have been - although I truly do believe we are too different to be each others end game - but I never really let him into my heart. Which is insane. We've been together for almost 3 years. We have a daughter. How is that possible?

I'm now faced with starting again. I don't want another relationship. I want to be on my own and get to know myself. 

I just... I don't know. Every day I think about my first partner. Every day. Multiple times a day. 

I know that we wouldn't work together. He's moved on and is clean now. I'm happy for him, truly. 

Why can't I get over him? I've lived so much life since then. I don't want to feel like this forever. 

I want to be able to truly value love from other people even if it isn't exactly like the love I had with him and from him. I know it's probably euphoric recall or something, but I just don't know how to stop this. I need to be able to if not forget, stop letting this rule my heart.",26Feb2020,1

1020,"So yeah, my mom dropped this on me last night while out at dinner. I'm having a hard time processing it. I'm 25 M and due to some personal stuff from 2018, I've been living at home since. My family is small, it is just me, my mom, and my dad. I am an only child. My moms sister and parents live close by and i rarely see my dads family because they are up in New England. The thought of this complete change in the dynamic of my family is honestly scary.

Last night, with the assistance of my aunt, my mom told me that on friday, she is moving out and into a new house not too far away that she has decided to start renting. Apparently for the past 3 weeks she has been slowly moving some of her things in. She plans to do inform my dad that she is filing for divorce via a letter on the counter (this is what she was told to do by her attorney, from what i understand she wasn't even supposed to tell me). He gets home noon on saturday, and I am the one who is supposed to be picking him up. This is what is honestly destroying me the most. He has no idea what is about to hit him and i do. My mom begged me not to tell him and i still haven't. i just don't know what i'm supposed to do knowing what he has waiting for him at home. He isn't going to take it well. He is catholic and tends to hold onto some of the traditional ways. I know it is going to really hurt him and it is hard to just watch from the sidelines. I seriously do not know how to best handle this situation. I've become sort of isolated from my old friends since moving back home and i don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I was just about to reapply for college and finish my degree but now, i have no idea what the next 6 months looks like for me.

Their marriage:

I can't really remember the last time they were happy. They don't hate each other but there is always tension. It is to the point where they both just assume the other is in a bad mood which leads to a perpetual bad mood that never gets better. My mom definitely has some issues she needs to work out as far as anxiety and all that goes. My dad seems like he's been depressed forever now and has always talked about how he'd love to transfer his job up north somewhere but never considered it because of my moms job and the fact we've kinda settled here. Overall, a very complacent relationship. My dad is pretty traditional so divorce has always seemed taboo.

My mom stayed with my aunt last night because i preferred to be by myself last night but she is coming back home tonight and we will probably talk about things. I don't know how to express that i am angry with how she handled this. I always been bad at expressing my emotions especially if it will upset someone else. I don't ever want anything to come between myself and my parents. they are the most important people in my life, they're all i've really got. What scares me is that if my mom does end up making me essentially be the one to tell him, that will cause irreparable damage.

There's obviously a lot more i could add to this but I'm having a hard time putting this post together as it is so feel free to ask questions. Any help is greatly appreciated.",26Feb2020,1

1029,"I (29F) have always struggled with my sexuality.  If I was either purely straight or lesbian, I feel that maybe it would have been easier to understand.  But being bi, I have never been able to feel like I fully know myself.  I go through phases of attraction...sometimes I‚Äôll be really attracted to men for a while.  I definitely feel more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when I‚Äôm in that phase.  But when I go through phases of being attracted to women, it‚Äôs difficult.  I find myself questioning if I‚Äôm really just a lesbian and am lying to myself, etc.  I have a lot of stress and anxiety around sex because these thoughts are always in my head.  It will get to the point where I‚Äôll feel like maybe it‚Äôs true...then I end up attracted to men again and the cycle of confusion continues.  

I constantly feel like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm actually attracted to.  I constantly question my sanity.  I have only ever been in a couple of relationships, and they have all been with men.  If I could go back in time, I wish I could have at least experienced what it is like with a woman so I would know.  But it never ended up happening.  I have been in a relationship with my husband for a long time, and we got married last year.  I love him so much, and he does know about my sexuality, but we never really talk about it much.  I just worry that he‚Äôll think he shouldn‚Äôt have married me or that one day I‚Äôll just leave him.  I have never talked about it with family or friends either.  My husband is not open to the idea of threesomes or me experimenting.  He is very monogamous.  

Now I just feel depressed all the time.  I often daydream about being single and getting to see what it‚Äôs like to have relations with women.  But I can‚Äôt fulfill this unless I divorce my husband (which I also don‚Äôt want to do because I am attracted to him and do love him).  It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve fallen out of love...it‚Äôs different then that.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.  I think about suicide often.  I hate it when people joke about how being bi must be awesome.  It sucks, honestly.  Everyone wants to think of you as either straight or gay, and they treat you like your lying to yourself or just want attention.  And the constant confusion and inability to understand my own mind is so hard...",26Feb2020,1

1031,"So i have this dance coming up, and its the only one i ever had a chance to go to. All was well and i had been planning everything for soo long now its insane (like 5 years to be exact) . However as time goes closer, my mam has been pretty vocal about me not going.
She first started telling me how ""guys will try things"" which im pretty sure yous can imagine what im saying. She then complained about money since i will be going to university , which i honestly do understand but i feel something like a dance that ive been so excited for and been planning and waiting for that i know will be the only truly happy memory of my teenage years. I also live in an area where university is free and we actually get paid to go depending on your living situation so i dont see how it should be a big deal.
While talking about money she commented how my bigger size will need a bigger dress which will cost more and im not gonna lie it hurt hearing that from my mom. Im hoping to lose weight by graduation and have been making progress and been eating alot healthier.
My brothers have also been vocal about me not going despite them never going to it either which does not help me whatsoever as my mam wants us to talk with them to chose whether i should be allowed or not.

1038,"Hi, so today I \[21 F\] was in a car accident involving one other person who hit me directly on the side of my car. It was a four lane street divided by yellow lines. They were pulling out of a parking lot and the person in front of me came to a stop to accommodate them. People in Atlanta are notorious for not using their signal, so I thought they were trying to pull into the parking lot and just wanted to give the other person space. My class was in 20 minutes, and I didn't feel like waiting for them to figure out what they were doing, so I decided to go around the car in front of me. The girl ended up pulling out. I pressed my brakes but it was too late, and she accelerated into me as well. My car definitely has more damage, and is more than likely totaled. Our court date is set for three weeks from now, and the officer didn't exactly determine who was at fault because of basic traffic laws. Do you think it's worth it to take the car to a collision center? This is my first accident ever so I'm still a bit shocked, and trying to figure out where exactly to go from here. Thanks for any help. I've attached links to the photos. I'm bad at explaining things, so I also drew a picture to show how it happened.

1042,"It's always been a struggle for me, to bring this up. Self harm started as it does for most, a way to cope with the stress and frustration of life, a way to punish oneself. What not. 

By now I self harm very sparsely, at least, the traditional cutting self harm. 

Every therapist wants me to quit, and tries to pin it down on me self harming as a way to cope with stress. This in itself is not a bad thing and I understand their reasoning.

Thing is, I am terrified to bring up the real reason behind my self harming. Very soon after I started I made the connection between the hurting myself and the ""high"" I experienced afterwards. Nowadays I do not hurt myself as a way to cope with stress or and outlet for my frustrations, but just so I can lay back in bed and feel amazing as all the endorphins rush through my body. I am in an essence, a masochist to its truest, it does not sexually excite me (when I do it on my own), but pain makes me feel intensely happy. 

So I hurt myself with candle wax, it's safe, leaves no damage or scarring. 

Thing is, my scars from cutting in the past are very visible and the self harm issue is basically the only thing in my medical file so *all* my therapists want to talk about it. And when I tell them it's not a priority for me they keep pressing on. When I say that it's not an issue anymore, they don't believe me. I don't want to tell them about how pain in general simply makes me feel relaxed and happy, in fear of making them feel uncomfortable. They might think I self harm for sexual pleasures, especially with the use of candle wax and its... additional uses. 

Problem is, I started therapy today and despite me trying to tell them multiple times through our conversation that I don't care much about the SH aspect of me, she wants to start treatment for it anyway. She probably mistook my unwillingness for just wanting to keep using it as an unhealthy coping mechanism.

How can I possibly formulate a way to tell my (current and future) therapist that ""hey, I am a masochist and that's why I hurt myself. No worries. I have tons of other issues I'd like to talk about instead.""",26Feb2020,1

Where to start where to start‚Ä¶

Asking only workman‚Äôs wages, I went looking for a job; but I get no offers, My current one is fine but I wanted something that pays a bit more, to support my income I do freelance writing, mostly weird porn, I never thought I would grow up to pimp out my innocent keyboard for this kind of filth, but you gotta‚Äô do what you gotta‚Äô do.

So I wrote this ‚Äúerotic‚Äù my little pony fanfiction for some loathsome degenerate, an I use the term erotic vary loosely here, I was most of the way though writing it when the guy dropped of the face of ~~Equestria~~ earth, and I never got my *~~bits~~*, dollars, and thus my masterpiece was left to gather electronic dust in the cyber purgatory, known only as ‚Äúnew folder‚Äù

Fast forward a year or so to now, and I am posting resumes left, right and center, feeling good about my chances despite my failures.

One day I put together an improved resume and saved in the first location which came up, a handsome young file directory going by the name ‚Äúnew folder‚Äù, I christened my new resume ‚Äúdoc2‚Äù, as the folder was already occupied my something called ‚Äúdoc1‚Äù and paid it no more mind., you can probably guess where this is going. swallow my wisdom, do not start down the treacherous path of default file names.

After a hard few days sending the new and improved resume out to various potential wageslave drivers, I decide to make a few housekeeping changes to my resume, only when I open the folder, I am not greeted with a professional looking recollection of my work history, but rather a less professional retelling of Fluttershy being rawed over a table.

And then like a punch in the gut I realized, what I had been sending to various employers near me, I checked the websites I uploaded my ‚Äúresume‚Äù and the emails I sent to make sure, and sure enough: most of them where contained copies of ‚ÄúA king needs heirs‚Äù, and for as hard as I desired it I could not reach my *~~hooves~~* hands into cyber space and pull those applications back

I send forgotten clopping material to as many as 20 employers, along with my name, address, and contact details.

One of the clopfic recipients has asked me in for an interview, what do I? go anyway? Deny that I wrote it? Continued to freak the fuck out?

1044," Im a male age 20 my gf is a female age 20 aswell

We have been in a relationship for over half a year

So to begin, I accidentally found my gf's oldest sisters on a porn site.

After I saw this I inmediately went to contact the oldest sister anonymously asking her if she knew about this and if it was with her consent, because I was worried maybe someone put this up with harmfull intentions.

After that I found out to my disappointment, that the oldest sisters both had own profiles and it was very clear they did it themselves.

So here is my part in all of this as the boyfriend, I know this is none of my business as I dont have any say about the lives of my gf's older sisters. But the problem I face, is that I am very very scared the lifestyle they lead might negatively impact my girlfriend.

To add to this, she already does things on a very minor scale, like chatting with guys for money which I found weird at first but acceptable as long as it diddnt evolve into something else.

So now that I found out about her 2 older sisters doing this stuff online on adult websites, and I suspect her to know this, my fear and concernes have grown enormously.

IMPORTANT: I wont tell my Girlfriend this, even if she might already know this in the first place ! I am not the person to bring this to her, I dont wanna cause any drama or possible emotional reactions.

How should I handle this situation? I absolutely don't want her to follow in her sisters footsteps as they are definitly people she looks up to.

1060,"Dear redditors, I would like some advice please if at all possible.

 I am struggling with any goal I set for myself and it makes me feel like I have completionist anxiety. Teachers and my elders would say I must have a passion for learning because I was a sponge and reliable regurgitator of information. I would actively research any topic (e.g the average male mosquito has 47 teeth, females have none) This type of passion faded around 16. When I was 20 I didn't/still don't have a plan or goal for my life, no bucket list and an idea that I could best serve humanity by not leaving a mark.
A family member got in trouble with the law, which in turn, made their dream unattainable.
Because of my lack of direction, that dream was pushed onto me.

I was excited at first and gained my private pilots license in the first year. Almost immediately, the lustre faded so I thought ""fuck it, I know how to fly planes now""  and dropped out. Nothing else notable happened except for meeting an amazing woman who pushed the pause button on my self destruction.

Now I'm 30 with a touch more maturity, so I tried goal setting (get a usable qualification, buy a house, try to improve the quality of life of those around me).
Seems to work at first glance but now the crux of the issue.

As soon as my goal is within reach, I lose all passion for it. Kinda like love the journey, hate the destination.
I got  a heavy vehicle license, didn't even turn up to the final test for an endorsement which equals an extra $5-10/hr
I told my partner I would propose once I finished making her ring, just need to set the stone(takes about 30 mins) been sitting there almost a year now
Make knives as a hobby. I only have 3 finished knives and no drive to do any more.
Learnt to play guitar, I know 3 songs and don't even want to learn songs I actually like.
Used to enjoy hunting, but it has fallen to the wayside.
And so on... 

I want to be eager to follow through and complete something. I just want to be passionate about learning again. I want to be excited for something, anything. Is there a chemical which can induce passion? Or a technique?

I got Arya back today!!! Thanks to the police department!!

But due to a comment in the original post that said I was unfit to have her, this is just some quotes from the 27 emails sent over the 36 hours... 

""you want arya back call me talk to me dont leave me wondering where you are""

""Look I'm not gonna keep her from you. You want her you can have her. You want to be left alone I'll leave you alone too. But what I'm not doing is driving more then 5 mins from my house or waiting for you based on emails. Or I can surrender her to animal control and you can get her from pound""

""And my life will be better with out. So that's fine I'll call animal control they'll pick arya up and I'll send you an email where to get her.""

He wanted nothing more than to torture me by keeping her from me. Not because I wouldn't be able to care for her in my temporary situation, but BECAUSE I REFUSED TO GIVE HIM MY NEW PHONE NUMBER. 

 He would rather send her to the pound than meet with me at a public location (gas station &lt;2 minutes from his house) and connect through email a time. 

This right here is abuse. I recognize that. I will be speaking in depth with my therapist about this.

I'm definitely the better place for her regardless of my temporary situation. 

And u/code_sloth and his comment in the original post can go fuck it.

I get that he's tired from his 12 hour work days but that doesn't change the fact that his problems have ruined so many days and things for me. My mom, however, is far more gentle.

Another problem is school. Her apartment is about a 20 min drive from my house and my house is right across my school. It would be problematic with school as my mom only has one car.

My mom would never let me have a motorcycle while my dad had already promised to get me one at latest when I'm 18. Also, most important of all, I don't want change... and finally, my dad needs help taking care of Maximus, our 3 year old German Shepherd. Like I said, he works 12 hour days almost every day of the week, meaning he needs someone to walk him in the middle of the day.

Overall, I feel more comfortable with my mom. With her, I feel relaxed and at ease. While with my dad I feel tense and uneasy. I'm always afraid that something will set him off. But at the same time staying here with my dad means school will be easier and less chaotic, I'll get more stuff, and I won't have to worry about being a burden on my mom when she's struggling economically, and I'll be able to help take care of my doggo... but going to my mom will mean I'll be calmer and more relaxed overall and not have to worry about the stupid things that set my dad off... I don't know what to do... sometimes I just wanna escape from my dad's rediculous ""regime"" over me. But I also feel like it's something I'll just have to deal with till I'm old enough to fend for myself...

TL; DR: dad's psycho but I get more stuff with him, also need to take care of my dog, and his house is closer to my school. Mom's nicer and sane, but she's lacking in the money department  and honestly I don't really want change.",26Feb2020,1

He‚Äôs a typical 21 year old frat guy so a lot of the stuff he likes is off limits and every suggestion I‚Äôve seen online is definitely not something he‚Äôd care for.
If anyone has any suggestions of what I could send I would be so glad to hear it.",26Feb2020,1
1071,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not suicidal. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed either. 

First a little background info: I‚Äôm 30 y/o, single, no kids, full-time job, atheist. 

ABSTRACT

I don‚Äôt understand how people seem to enjoy life in general. I would like to have this power. Is this just a misperception on my part?

DETAILS

I feel kind of gloomy most of the time. I can carry out normal activities etc. but I don‚Äôt really care about anything or anyone. I‚Äôve been this way for years now; I don‚Äôt remember if I ever felt differently. 

When I look at my life I just see absurd problems in front of me. For example, try to save money so that you have money when you stop working. I can get into why I think this is absurd at the bottom, but I think some people will get the absurdity right away. 

The bottom line is that I feel very weird. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking at my whole life from past to future and everything looks like an absurd series of episodes without real meaning.

CONCLUSION

What the heck is going on? 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I could take some mood-enhancing medications and that would make me feel happier for no reason. 

But the truth remains that this is the way I see the world. Yet, I don‚Äôt like this and unfortunately, nothing seems to persuade me to change my view ‚Äînot even sex, religion or drugs. 

Is there something out of the box you can think of that might bring some resolution to this problem ‚Äîother than ending your life?",26Feb2020,1

1074,"Honestly this is nothing overly serious, if you have a lot more important than responding to this then don't worry,

Anyways, I'm a straight A student, trying to get a full ride to EIU, want to go to college and become a maths teacher. Definitely not use to getting B's or C's, especially in PE, while I'm not athletic, I always try. In fact, in this certain teacher's class I've always gotten A's

But this drop wasn't 20%, it was 10%, I didn't do too well on the Basketball unit tests and all that, but I deserved that, so that was not the problem, by any means. But with these past 12 days? (teacher enters them all at once and only every so often, it just makes it easier on him I got a 40/60. That's a D, a D that dropped my grade from like an 88% to a 78%.

Something I should mention, I am not blaming anybody, of all people, I'm blaming myself, I just believe this is a mistake, because like nobody really else, I know how much I try when it comes to things. There has been a student teacher watching over our class (because student teachers, yes) which is honestly why the grading was so harsh, so of all things, I applaud his observations of my lack of skill and effort to coaching a PE class temporarily, which I can imagine being very hard, (which is why I think it was a 40/60).

The way my teacher has it set up, skills is a separate category, so truthfully, I believe any deductions because of skill should go in that category? As it's 15% of the grade, not 70% (that's why the bad grade hurt really bad) and this C has made me just panic. My unweighted GPA right now is at a 3.90, because I got 1 B freshman year PE (different teacher, different rules, thank you my current teacher for making the final optional if you have an A), a B in Civics last year, and a B in Honors III last semester, so it's not like it's ruining a perfect 4.0, but it isn't something I want on my Junior year transcript!!

The reason I'm asking advice here is because I want to go in and talk to my teacher, discuss logically how I don't think that grade is accurate, that it contradicts literally every other grade in his class current and past, as well as that I'm willing to spend tutorial walking or even running to show I'm not just demanding for a grade, but I don't want to tell anyone how to do their job, and I definitely don't want to be a douchebag... So what I'm asking here, is should I just ignore it and accept the C, or try to get my B back, something I'll live with not bringing all the way back up.

I get this is foolish, so sorry for wasting your time for reading so much, but I do appreciate any responses.",26Feb2020,1
1075,"My mom makes my feelings feel invalid and whenever she lets me down or fucks something up for me or makes ANY mistake whatsoever, it‚Äôs somehow my fault. An example: My mom brings me to school late ALL THE TIME, and blames it on me because ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve walked‚Äù well no I couldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs 45 minutes away and if I expect you‚Äôll pick me up at 8:30 and school starts at 9:00, then I‚Äôm gonna be late anyway. It‚Äôs a lot of stuff like this where she fucks up and expects me to fix HER fuck up and never apologizes for a damn thing. My step-dad owns a 70 inch flatscreen TV, a PS4 Pro, 30 games, and a PC... but he tore off me and my brother‚Äôs doors off while on a power trip 3 YEARS AGO as punishment, and is too cheap to replace them. Also, my mom broke our washer and doesn‚Äôt wanna buy the part to fix it because then she would have to admit that she broke it, it is RIDICULOUS. My step-dad has started to repaint/redo the walls and floors on EVERY part of the house except for his own room and I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that not one wall or floor is finished in one room in my house except for his room, and what‚Äôs hilarious is there is no door on THE FUCKING BATHROOM. When I call him out on this he says ‚ÄúI work for everything you have so I can do whatever the fuck I want around here.‚Äù And he completely ignores the fact that we are BELOW the poverty line and the funniest part is we don‚Äôt live in a house, we live in a beat up, half finished 1950s trailer in a trailer park for old people. Also, he doesn‚Äôt even buy anything for me, my biological father does. I haven‚Äôt gotten anything from my mom and step-dad in about a year. My mom will do ANYTHING to help ANYBODY except if it‚Äôs me and my brother, we get treated like we‚Äôre a rung under everyone else. My mom doesn‚Äôt understand how we feel because her parents brought her up in a middle class lifestyle in the suburbs and money was never an issue for her parents. She didn‚Äôt go to college, she told me the reason she never went was because she had me and tried to pin her lack of an education on my existence, well... she had me when she was 22, 4 years out of high school so that‚Äôs a bunch of bs. And now I‚Äôll talk about the rest if my family, whenever I go against my mom‚Äôs manipulative tendencies and I get irate with her, they all act like I‚Äôm the one out of line and the finger is never pointed at her and I‚Äôm invalidated and I have been taught since an early age that my feelings and opinions don‚Äôt matter and that my elders are always right and now I‚Äôm insecure in everything I do. Please any kind soul who decided to take time to read this whole thing I need help on what to do about this or to at least have any confirmation that this is a problem, which is such a rarity for me. As well as a sorry for the lack of formatting here, I got super emotional writing this and got all my first thoughts off my chest. Thank you.",26Feb2020,1
1076,"My last 3 years have been havily focused on geting to medical university. I decided to study medicine mostly becouse it seemed like a reasonable thing to do, since I got good enough grades to have chances to be accepted. And now I'm half way through my first year and I feel like it just isn't it. I hate the fact that if I just want to pass all of the subjects I need to give up all my hobbys and free time and study from dusk till down. I already need to retake anatomy next year due to low academical performance which is going to cost me around 5k (together with 60 other people). Just thinking about it makes me want to quit, even though my parents want to cover all my expenses themselves. 
When trying to talk with them about quiting they keep telling me how much money they already spent on me getting where I am now and how I should just endure this for next 6 years of my life becouse ""it just can't be that bad"" and ""you are better than this"".
Right now I dont know even what to do with my life if I quit. To change subject that I study (probably to computet science) I'd need to retake exams which would take another year of my life. 

Somewhere inbetween preparing myself to get into uni I managed to meet my girlfriend. We've been together for over a year now but right now we are on verge of breakig up mostly due to me coming out as an atheist (never believed in anything just wanted to not have problems becouse of it. I live in Poland where most of the population is catholic) and her being zealous catholic. She tries to accept me but I see how much of a problem it is for her since she is part of many religious organisations and is constantly reminded how nice it is to have partner who too is member of those organisations.

Sorry in advance for all the mistakes I might have made writing this. I decided to post this right before going to sleep, so sorry for not answering any time soon too.",26Feb2020,1
