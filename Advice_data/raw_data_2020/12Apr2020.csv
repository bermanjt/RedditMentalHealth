0,"Hi everyone. I'm looking for advice. I'm a 23-year-old female and I lost my virginity at 13... I was in middle school and I was dating a guy in high school. When I lost my virginity I honestly did not even know what was happening. I was so young and he just kind of did it... without asking me if I was okay with it. I was really insecure and was honestly just excited that a boy was interested in me. Looking back on it, it makes me so sad. I really try not to think about it. In fact, typing this is making me tear up a little because I think I've pushed it so far back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, after this guy I did not have sex again until I was 17 and I was in a serious relationship for 2 years with that guy. I've only had sex with 3 people (not including the guy that I lost my virginity to) and they have all been in longterm (2+ year) relationships with people I loved. I don't think the 13-year-old thing really messed up any aspect of sex for me. I love sex (lol)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm looking for advice on is... Can I erase that part of me? If someone asks me when I lost my virginity, I don't want to say that it was when I was 13. It makes me feel sad/embarrassed and it doesn't align with how I want to feel about myself. I mean I know I don't need permission from random people on the internet but I just want some insight or advice. It's not something I really talk about with my friends.

thank you :)",12Apr2020,72

2,"So one of my best friends let me down again today. I asked him to buy some weed for me, cause i had a fight with the only plug that delivers during quarantine(the same that I introduced him to) and he made some bullshit excuse about doing chores around the house for the next few days.


 Although we always have fun, rarely fight and know each other since 10 y/o he wasn't always the most reliable person. I used to sell him weed(the same price I got it) until he wanted to make some cash and I helped him know some people and taught him how to deal with any situations. After that he started to smoke everyday and spend a lot. When I needed to smoke some he would charge me for a joint or ask like 15$ for a g and then do speed, mdma, etc with me for free. I didn't really care cause I had enough money and I also had a lot of fun. He is also the type that rips off to 13 y/o and my other friends dislike him for trying to fool them too(23 y/o vs 13 y/o)


I had some deep conversations with him and we share a lot of great memories, most of them related to drugs. When I need help, 70% of the time he can't or is asleep. One more thing that annoys me is that he always has this excuse that his mom forbid him to do something, expects him early at home, said that he couldn't be friends with, etc. Most of his lies or excuses are related to his mother.


He is my only friend like this, but it is the longest friendship I've ever had. Any advice?",12Apr2020,1

5,"Its 2 am and i might just be tired and talking nonsense, but if at least 1 person has some advice for me i'd appreciate it.

I'm not lonely, in fact i have lots of friends, close friends. I have a loving family that's always there for me. I have a stable life. I don't think i'm depressed, because i've been before and this feels different. On the outside it looks like i'm fine, but in reality i don't feel much connection with any of my friends, like we would hang out and have fun but later i'd still be missing a feeling i can't describe and i don't know what it is. I find it hard to communicate with my parents, i've just gotten so used to being negative even though they're amazing. I have no goals in life, well except the end goal of living a nice life with my future wife and kids, but as far as obtaining that through a dream job or something I have nothing in mind. My parents would ask me ""have you thought about what you want to do"", and i'd usually get defensive, saying something rude. I feel like i'm being ungrateful by not having any aspirations in life, considering they worked so hard to make my childhood as nice as possible. I know i'm young and all, and this might be my hormones and puberty going crazy like my parents always say. But i honestly have no idea what i'm doing with myself and my life.

Sorry for rambling like this, i felt like i had bottled up these thoughts for too long. Telling someone on the internet is much easier than facing the problem in real life. If anyone has any advice for me it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",12Apr2020,2

13,"This is a pretty trivial thing, but I just got billed for a toll and the number they gave me was $6.35 more than they said it would be. There is no explanation for the charge on the bill. I'm considering sending the following letter to the company, but I'm not sure if I should. That brings me here.

&amp;#x200B;

{Quote}

To whom it may concern,

*En route* to my brother’s special Boy Scout advancement ceremony, I incurred $6.35 in tolls from your company. I failed to make the payment and incurred a five-dollar late fee, as prescribed in the original bill. However, you are attempting to charge me $17.35. This is an error.

I am sixteen years old. I make forty-five dollars a month. Thirteen of those dollars go to a St. Baldrick’s memorial fund for my friend. Occasionally I can make extra money by doing odd jobs for my grandfather, but the pandemic has made that impossible. Add it all up, and I really make thirty-two dollars a month. Your proposed charge (which, I remind you, is in error) makes up over half of my monthly take-home pay.

Nobody operates your tollbooth. Instead, it is a machine run by computers. Your lower-level employees have tasks that can easily be done from home, and your management doesn’t really have to do very much at all. In short, your company is almost immune to the pandemic. Most of us are not so lucky.

The charges were six dollars and thirty-five cents. The late fee was five dollars. You will receive eleven dollars and thirty-five cents, and you won’t do anything about it. Your underhanded “phantom charges” will prove quite difficult to enforce, as you can’t show where they are on the bill.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to mail me. In turn, I won’t hesitate to promptly file your letter in the garbage receptacle.

Sincerely,

\[My Name\]

I think it's very good writing, especially for an angry customer. And everything I say here is true. My concern is a) it's probably going to go to an unfortunate employee who hates ExpressToll management as much as I do, and I don't want him/her to take it personally and b) I don't want to get in legal trouble. I said in the letter it would be hard to enforce, but I actually don't know how hard it would be to enforce. I'm just trying to project confidence (negotiating tactic). But I am strapped for cash (I don't know if I'll be able to afford my own yearbook), and the last thing I want to do is let the stuffed shirts at ExpressToll pull one on me. Also, I'm a pompous ass who doesn't know when to shut up.

14,"My (32F) sister (37F) is a college-educated, successful woman. I love her dearly but her husband of five years has turned her into a tinfoil hat, far right conspiracy theorist. She is constantly sending me ridiculous conspiracy videos that are anywhere from one to three hours (!!!) long. I am open to listening to new ideas but these videos are very clearly created by trolls.

I didn’t say much when she sent me the first few because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings but now she’s sending me these types of videos nonstop and making me promise that I’ll watch them. I can’t get through 2 minutes of the videos without feeling like I’m losing brain cells.

How do I tell her nicely to please stop sending me videos, and also stop believing in them? She doesn’t take criticism well and gets offended when I disagree with her, and she called me a “sheep” for reading mainstream news. I feel like our relationship is strained because of this.

15,"Long story short... very long story short...

Matched with this female (21) on Tinder in September of last year. We have become amazing friends very quickly. We have hooked up a number of times and now live together. I have been there for her since day 1, and have helped her out with absolutely anything and everything no matter what it was or when it was. We have been living together since mid February and have been hooking up here and there since then. She wasn’t ready for a relationship or anything and I have developed heavy feelings for her. I’ve expressed these feelings on a number of occasions before and she is very aware of them. She says she loves everything about me and is the exact guy she would love to be with and date but she doesn’t feel a “click” with me. She recently redownloaded Tinder after deleting it for some time earlier this month and has been talking to a number of guys. Only one has become rather serious to the extent of she has cut off all sexual contact for the most part because she is talking to this guy. She still loves to cuddle, spoon, and occasionally sleep in my bed with me... I’m confused as to where her mind is. She loves everything about me and we live together, says she would date be doesn’t feel a click, is still super affectionate (cuddling, but slapping, biting...) but doesn’t want a relationship with me and is “dipping her toes in the water to see what’s out there” without looking for a relationship so to say... the lease is for a year and I’m in some pretty extreme pain already because of the rejection let alone if things become serious with this guy I have no idea how much more broken I’ll become. It already pains me enough to see her smile whenever her smile from ear to ear at her phone. I love her and want her to be happy. I do. I just don’t know what to do about the pain or what to think if she is playing games or confused about what she wants or if there is any sort of chance down the road that it will be a romantic relationship than a platonic one...

18,"Okay so for some backstory my aunt has been married to this asshole who’s been in and out of jail, robbed family members, robbed stores, petty theft, jobless for 5 years, license suspended( just recently he got it lifted and can get it back on the condition he takes a 5 hour driving course but refuses to take it). I love my aunt but idk why she insists on staying with this man. They have a daughter together who’s my first cousin, Vanessa. You would think since her father doesn’t have a job he would clean the house, cook, do laundry, and even help Vanessa but nope! He’s a miserable SOB! The house is disgusting- inch thick dust, clothes and crap in the bathtub, cigarette buds on the floor, my little cousin had shit stained underwear under her bed I found when helping tidy up her room. I could go on and on but I guess you get the picture. 

Anyways I try to avoid that house( for obvious reasons) My uncle isn’t aloud at my grandmas so that’s where I usually see my aunt and little Vanessa. I have my own personal items like a hairbrush, makeup, some clothes, etc. for whenever I stay over. Same for my older brother. My brother and I stayed over a few nights and felt the worst itch in our heads so we inspected each tower and sure enough it was lice. So fast forward we get the lice treatment and k*ll the little f*ckers. 

So I’m trying to figure out how we got this shit. My brother admitted he used my comb because he forgot his or whatever. No big deal but still didn’t know where we got it since we were either only home or grandmas. So I’m paranoid and whatnot. Anyways Vanessa comes over and since I’m so paranoid because I HATE LICE I checked her head and I have never seen worse infestation in my life. I told my aunt and she took her home right away. I heard form my grandma she got rid of it with the lice shampoo but the shampoo doesn’t kill it prevents lice. Couple weeks late to see Vanessa and she still has it and I say something again to my grandma. My brother and I go to the store and buy the treatment Kipling solution and give it to my aunt.  School starts so I’m away for a bit. Fast forward 5 months (it’s Halloween) and Vanessa comes to my grandmas to help decorate the house and sure enough when she came to say hi she had lice! I tell my dad and he tells my grandma because I sense my grandma was getting upset whenever I brought it up, I guess she felt embarrassed in a way for my aunt? I felt bad too because I didn’t want to embarrass anyone but the kid has lice running 5 months and I was so upset and disgusted with how neglected my cousin was. 

Now she’s a little older and she’s a little overweight because of how she eats. She eats and eats constantly. fast food every week, pizza,  pasta, crap. But I can’t do anything because she’s not my child. I try to introduce her to healthier options and try new things which is hot or miss.

She also is very sensitive and I can understand why which how she’s being raised. She mumbles and reverts to baby talk(she’s 10) when she wants attention. I try to talk to her like she’s her age because she’s actually really smart and creative and she shouldn’t feel the need to revert to baby behavior when she feels ignored, I guess that’s how she gets her way at home? I noticed once my aunt was showing me a video of a toddler playing drums and Vanessa ran to the couch pissed off and upset. I think she feels like that because a toddler was doing something she couldn’t and my aunt found it cute. 


Vanessa is fed and receives most things she wants but nothing extracurricular ( like summer camp or dance classes or sports) My aunt works hard but it’s hard with one income.

So I'm in the process of moving into an apartment with two other girls after having spent a couple years with the same roommate in a different place.  I have two televisions (which I know is a bit odd) one I pilfered from my parents (the smaller one) and the other one I bought myself.

But me and P slowly became closer friends over the summer and eventually I opened up to her about what had really happened between me and A. She was so supportive at the time.. 
but things quickly took a turn when she started to continually hang out with him and also slept with him multiple times, once apparently while I was in the same house!! I tried to just cut her off, but since all my friends were also friends with her, things got messy. She started saying I faked my sexual assault, and said it was all for attention. It broke my heart to think that someone I had trusted so much, cared so little about me. Most of my close friends supported me throughout the fight with P and decided to cut her off. 
But things started to change again. I would see my friends hanging out with P again, my boyfriend going to parties with P and posting things with her.

I have a decent paying job in the healthcare industry (I'm non clinical and more on the admin side), and while we are considered essential workers, my job is having me work from home.

I think maybe I’m doing or not doing something which makes it harder for my beard to grow in a normal way on both sides but idk lol 

Cars: Always wanted to learn about cars and I don’t mean in depth technical knowledge. I’m talking basic knowledge stuff that everyone who drives should know. I have spent maybe 6 months in my life driving and It was a haze. I am ashamed to say at 27 I have no clue how to change a tire. Just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of a place I can find this basic knowledge in one place. Like changing a tire, gears and how they work, features in every car etc

Working out/Lifting: This is a far third because I’m not doing this to impress girls or compete with guys. I need advice on learning beginner workouts to help me gain strength. Would say a 2nd grader could lift more so just looking for an entry point to strengthening my arms because I’m noting actual life things being harder due to me being weak which is so embarrassing but with this quarantine I’m trying to make the most of it 

Thanks for anyone who can help me with any of this and any tips or advice thanks!!",12Apr2020,2
44,"I’m a little bit worried about posting on this subreddit because I’m not sure what the feedback is gonna be but I need to know if I’m in the wrong.

I met two of my best friends in 7th grade, but they’ve known each other since 4th grade. We were very close throughout middle school, but then once we got into high school things started to change. They would start getting into a lot of fights with each other. They were always small and resolved quickly, but I was always in the middle. Every week or so, they’d fight over something small, each would talk about each other to me, and then I’d be the middle man and resolve it. Looking back, their friendship was toxic at this point even though none of us realized. 

In 11th grade, one of my friends started to feel really depressed. She would break down in the bathroom every period and I was always skipping class to spend time with her. Eventually she dropped out to be homeschooled because she couldn’t handle being around the people at school. My two friends started getting along better at this point. We’d both take time after school and on weekends to go to her house and hang out to make sure she was feeling better.

Then things started changing again. Her personality changed completely. It was beginning to become difficult to be around her because her humour changed so drastically. She would make jokes that made me uncomfortable, which I tried to make clear, but she would continue to push the joke until I laughed. In public she would be very embarrassing, screaming at the top of her lungs in restaurants, yelling and harassing people, jumping around and just being plain rude. I would consistently try to tell her to stop and that it made me uncomfortable, but to no avail. 

I was finding myself making excuses to not hang out with her or to escape from the room when I was hanging out with her. Eventually, my other friend couldn’t handle her anymore and they got into their fights again. Only this time, they stopped being friends permanently which left me to be the middle man once again. When I talked to my other friend, we told each other how we’d been feeling and I was very pleased to know she’d felt the same way. 

I don’t know what to do because I know that my friend has gone through a lot these past years and I know that this will hurt. But I can’t stand being around her and it makes me miserable. She still messages me and I answer but late and bluntly. Is it wrong for me to want to end our friendship?",12Apr2020,2
45,"Before this whole social distancing stuff came about, I went to a party with this one girl from my university. To be specific, I asked her to a formal of mine for my fraternity and she obliged so I took her. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend about 1-2 months prior (?) and I was a little skeptical but I took the shot. Fast forward we ended up having a good time at the party and made out on the dance floor and whatever. The next day we had lunch and everything seemed okay. Few weeks past and we were texting every now and then but kinda didn’t speak for a good 2 weeks after being sent home from school because of coronavirus. 

Due to boredom and just plain old horny emotions I snapchatted her and now it’s going on two weeks where we snap or text again. Every conversation has been a mixture of jokes and topics where we relate on but I haven’t been able to change the subject to tell her that I want to spend more time with her once this passes. I get she just broke up with her boyfriend not too long ago but I’d rather take the chance and see what happens.

My question is, do I just straight up ask her if she wants to spend more time together once everything passes? Or do I hold off and wait until I can actually take her out somewhere?",12Apr2020,1

48,"I (22f) recently had a pretty toxic relationship with someone (24m) where I was never good enough to commit to but he would still keep chasing me and leading me on, leading to jealousy and insecurity. One thing that I did was once finding him texting one of his old fwb I ended up blocking her number on his phone without him knowing. It was very insecure and wrong and all heat of the moment. Before him, I never would have went into someones phone let alone block someone on it, but I did it then and I don't like how it feels. I just confessed to doing it because it was never my place to invade someones privacy like that and I don't want to become the kind of person who is so jealous that they have to read someones phone... The advice I need is how to move forward from this and keep my own insecurity from blinding me.

49,"Im 16F &amp; my boyfriend is 19M . We have been together for over a year now &amp; in the beginning it was great but it's slowly going downhill. I don't know if I'm being toxic, or if its the other way round, or if it's both of us.

He always tries to outdo me. I have diagnosed depression &amp; anxiety. I am suicidal &amp; it seems as if he likes to outdo me on this. Whenever I'm upset, he tries to be 'more' upset so in the end I'm not getting the support I need &amp; I have to end up supporting him. For instance, he cheated on me earlier in the relationship, I was upset about it ( as I should be ) but he told me that if I spoke to him about it he would go kill himself. So the whole night where I found out, was switched around and I ended up supporting him. Whenever he does support me, he sends me a paragraph but will always include guilt trips such as 'I'm just a shitty bf, no one is there for me' etc. Last night I had a major anxiety attack and he sort of seemes jealous about it? He said 'oh thats weird, how are you though?' I replied 'a bit better how about you' he said 'I'm just suicidal.' 

I mentioned this to him &amp; explained to him how I felt. But its hard to explain 'Im sick of supporting you.' I will always support him, but I cant support myself &amp; him at the same time which makes me feel like shit. 

He tries to manipulate me. I never wanted to be in a relationship in the first place. I told him I wanted to be a thing &amp; to take things slow, he didn't listen to me &amp; basically told me I was leading him on if I didn't date him. I explained my fear of commitment etc &amp; he still didn't listen.

I always like to have protected sex, it started off with using protection, with him taking it off without me knowing so I just gave up. The ammount of times I want him to use protection, he will always take it off no matter what. It's to the point that I cant be bothered wasting my breath. I told him that if he ever got me pregnant, then thats it. He guilt tripped me &amp; told me 'well I cant bare to lose you' as if its suggesting that hes tryna get me pregnant? I am now 5 days late.

He never listens to what I say, I tell him about things that trigger me &amp; upset me and it just seems to push him a bit more to do it. 

I'm not allowed guys in my phone, he will go off at me even if I'm speaking to a close mate of mine. I had to block all my guy friends, but hes allowed to talk to any girl he wants?

What should I do? I'm terrified to end things as we have split up once but it turned to a nightmare which just made me get back with him for the sake of being safe. When we split up the first time, he sent me videos of him crashing his car. He made fake accounts to try to flirt with me, he dated a few of my best friends &amp; he got into hardcore drugs. I got back with him because I felt guilty &amp; bad for upsetting him &amp; making him suicidal. I just don't know what to do.",12Apr2020,1
50,"(see bottom for Tl;dr)

So I'll start with a bit about me and the whole situation, I'm 22F and I live at home with my Mum, Dad, and brother. I finished uni last year but never moved out, I have used to have mild mental health issues which led me to going to uni near home but over the last year they've gotten much worse and I now can't work so I'm unemployed and on Universal Credit as well as in therapy (just as an fyi my problems are mainly Anxiety/OCD based). 

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my dad growing up was great, and continued to be into my teens, we've pretty much always had arguments as we're both pretty confrontational hot headed people but things started to get worse as I finished school and took a gap year before uni at 18, they really started to get bad last year as my mental health declined and the arguments got worse, it also really doesn't help that these arguments have an impact on my mental health, and its worth noting that both me and him get very irritable and short tempered when anxious. Then there's my mum in all this, she plays a huge part as I hate to say it but I'm a lot closer to her, I see more of her, I speak with her more, we have a lot more in common, and we don't argue no where near as much and tend to work it out better. Though shes not perfect, she's very judgemental and also struggles to admit she's wrong too. My mum and dad argue a lot as well, sometimes my dads in the right, sometimes my mum, my dad feels like he's not part of the family and my mum doesn't trust him and hates how he puts his mother/my nan above pretty much all of us. I try to be on the fence and take to the 'right' side but more often then not its my mums I try not to be bias but that can be hard not to mention that me and my dad already argue a lot as it is. This leads him to seeing me and my mum as like a team almost and he believes me to be bratty, ungrateful, attitude-y, selfish, and lazy; and like wise me to see him as childish, overly defensive, unfair, single minded, un-thoughtful, and uncaring. Things have continues to be on decline recently and things really started to take of when the lock down was issued as he's now more stressed working from home which means heighten tensions and things all kinda came to a big argument today which made me realised I really need to fix this or at least try.

&amp;#x200B;

So about the argument today, we'd just finished an already tense discussion about who's paying for my new fire alarm in my room when I tried to leave the kitchen but he left the fridge door open with the shelves inside open so when trying to push it back and walk past it jammed and I walked into it, then he refused to move out the way so I had to wait then got past at which point I closed the fridge and its shelves and did it with obvious annoyance since he both didn't close it or move out the way. anyway I closed the fridge shut with a bit of force (not a slam worth noting, I was just annoyed not angry at this point) and he heard the fridge and thought I had slammed it so he turned around and hit me, it wasn't a strong hit at all but it was on my arm and it did hurt for a bit. He's normally not physical and I can't think of any other time he's hit me and to be fair it was more of a hey don't do that kinda thing, but it was a hit and it hurt. The argument broke of from there because I stand by that I didn't slam the fridge and even if I did he shouldn't have touched me and he refused to admit to hitting me things got pretty shout-y and swear-y fast and that turned to us pulling out deeper issues in our relationship, him saying I was acting like a two year old, me saying that he can't admit to anything, him calling me ungrateful; you get the idea. It got to a point where he got so pissed he got right up in my face and said something along the lines of 'you think that was a hit huh, keep going and i'll show you what a hit is' which for obvious reasons was scary as fuck on my end, I didn't back down though I was to pumped up and it eventually resorted to name calling before he told me to go to my room as I was left with little choice, this really fucking pissed me off and as usual when this happens and I end up in my room on my own after a heated argument absolutely pissed of I ended up self harming to realise some of the tension. Now a few hours later, my dad made a half ass completely non-genuine apology because my mum told him too and we're not really talking still. It also gets worse as my mum wants me to let it go because tomorrows Easter and she doesn't want it ruined because its her favourite holiday, but i'm still absolute hurt and pissed over the whole thing and not sure what to do because if my dad did apologise sincerely and see what he did wrong, especially with the violent threat , I would be okay with the whole thing. But how to get him to realise that and hopefully apologise is beyond me because in his head he's done no wrong; so any advice on this specific event is very welcome. P.s on this its worth notice my parents don't know I self harm and I don't think I could tell them.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other things that I should mention which are part of the reason the relationship is getting worse is firstly that my dad is a liar, you can present him with evidence that he is lying and he will still deny it, and even worse often not be able to cope with being called out on a liar and just walk out. Example, he once unplugged my heater in my bedroom, which I never do and no one else would care to do so it HAS to be him and yet he denied every doing it and said I was making too big of a thing out it, despite telling him several times I don't care about the heater its the fact he's obviously lied to me and refuses to admit it, it was a short argument and lead to him walking out and disappearing for a few hours, because that''s what he does when things get a bit harder or if he's at fault, he'll just walk out then give you the silent treatment for the next few days. He also acts very uncaring occasionally, example, we watch TV together at night as a family but there are some shows I don't like and so don't watch, when they watch these shows I go upstairs to my room which on a normal day is fine but on bad days going upstairs and being on my own with my anxieties can be pretty nasty and means I'll want to stay down stairs for the night which my mum and brother are okay with as they get it but often it'll annoy my dad because he'd rather have me be in a worse place so he can watch the show he wants to watch rather then just compromising for the night and watching something else. He says he cares about me, he says he worries about me, and I think that's true but sometimes he can be really selfish and single minded and I just feel like he really doesn't give a shit about me and sees me as just the enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's pretty much everything, it is worth saying though that my therapist recommended family counselling but my dad straight up refused it because we're all the crazy problem people and not him, so take that for what you will. And things never use to be this way, we use to have fun and get along okay with an occasional argument and I really don't want to lose him as a dad, especially since I also financially depend on him and my mum while my life is in such turmoil. So if anyone has any advise on how to fix this, or even begin fixing this, or even dealing with the whole fridge incident I'm all ears, and that I'm aware that it takes two to tango and that I'm as much a problem in this as he is but I'm just not sure how so any advice on that would also be great, lastly sorry for the long post full of probably spelling and grammar errors, its not my strong suite unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr- We argue an awful lot, he's very defensive, he lies, all getting worse in lock down, he mildly hit me at the beginning of an argument today and later in the argument threatened more violence, not sure what to do as he's never done anything like that before, he also refuses to apologise for anything, and thinks me and my mum are teaming up against him and that he's always the victim

63,"Can’t really talk to anyone about this so here I am. 

I have a guilty pleasure of posting nudes on reddit and meeting girls this way, and then to swap nudes with them through Snapchat.

Due to the fact that the internet is huge and these subreddits are constantly bombarded with content I’ve never been scared anyone I know would find me. However, I’ve lately been paranoid that someone is trying to expose my habit to the people I know.

In short what happened was that the account I did this on was followed by some user ‘something something tracer’ and shortly after a fake Instagram account with an image of a hot girl tried to follow me on insta. I temporarily deactivated my account so that there is no way (hopefully) for a stranger to know who my followers are. 

You might ask yourself, why wouldn’t anyone randomly want to fuck me over like that? Well there are two possible culprits with motives.

Firstly, not long ago, there was this girl who I had sexted with through Snapchat for some time. She wanted a relationship and I didn’t. It seemed cool, but when she asked me if I’d slept with people I said yes, she freaked out and called me disloyal etc. She was basically an attention hungry psycho. She then proceeded to blackmail me with nudes for two days for revenge or whatever and it was an awful experience. Luckily I never gave her my socials and she backed off when I threatened to involve police. She does however know my regular SFW reddit account, and like a day before the creepy follows I just mentioned I had posted on r/tinder for tips on my profile. Mind that while blackmailing me she mentioned she might leave it up to other, more tech savvy people to expose me. I’m scared the tinder thing might have triggered her.

Secondly, when posting nudes on reddit, 99% of comments and PM’s are from gay guys. I’ve been offered money by them a couple times to take nudes for them. I figured this could potentially be quite an alright extra income considering i jerk off anyway and I could do it from home. So I made a post on r/askgaybros to see what they had to say about the male nude market. One guy got sassy and I bit back, and then a random guy got pissed off at me as if I was being homophobic or something. His comment ended with ‘or do I have to get angry?’ So that kinda seems reassuring. Anyway this guy can have screenshots of me posting my body online and me asking about the male nudes market on a gay subreddit, so if he would send that to all my followers that would not be ideal to say the least. 

So these two people are the only ones I can think of who would potentially want to do this to me, but I guess there are people out there who would expose guys like me for no reason other than to cause chaos and feel powerful or something like that.

My question to you is, given the creepy follows I mentioned earlier and these two prior events, is it rational for me to be worried, or am I being paranoid in your opinion?",12Apr2020,1

69,"Ok so long story short, I made a post with the title saying something is objectively bad but it seemed to be popular and liked amongst many people and I was curious to know why people had liked it. I rarely make posts online so it wasn't constructed the best perhaps but I was being civil and everything yet only a few people answered my question and everyone else had this mob mentality and got pissed by the fact I said it was objectively bad and deferred from the topic. Everyone was being an asshole essentially.  Sure I realize that everything in life is subjective but it still that doesn't mean that nothing can be looked at objectively either. Back to the main point, instead of people telling me why my choice of wording was wrong and how nothing is objective and all that they all lashed out at me instead of telling me why I'm wrong and all that. I was being as nice as possible but eventually got frustrated and deleted the thread.  I don't understand either that my way of thinking can be flawed because I feel that anything in life can be looked at objectively and subjectively regardless of it's art or anything. I feel this is a topic that has no right or wrong answer to it and both subjectivity and objectivity can be applied to anything in life. Then again I could've been talking to a bunch of children or immature people but some people on there seemed really smart with their comments. I'm a very open-minded person and will listen and take advice from anyone and look at something from multiple perspectives, but is all this hatred and anger really necessary?

Hopefully this made sense I just want some advice of if what I did was right or wrong and if objectivity can be applied to anything in life.

For example if there was cheating to happen in an extended family, this is what they're gonna talk about for next weeks, even months. With this COVID-19 farce going on it started to get progressively worse. In the beginning it was simply watching the news all day and treating the subject as if it was the only thing happening in the world. Kinda understandable, but for me it's not healthy to torture yourself with constant information flow.

Then it started to get even worse, because there are theories going around the net, that COVID-19 is somehow related to 5G.

We live in a country where many news from around the globe arrive with a few days delay. So only like three days ago they heard about the theory. As virus is the only thing they talk about they've immediately started to believe in it and fill the blanks with a total bogus.

Three days and I'm supposed to believe that when the cure will come out I'm not supposed to take it, because some friend of theirs (a retired service man) was told by his colleagues that the cure will arrive with some kind of implants controlled by 5G network. Jesus.

Explaining them how does network work or telling them they have no proof on anything doesn't help. Situation is bad, because for now I live with them. Still finishing school and programming as I see this as my future job. For me it's hard to focus while listening to all of this, especially when they try to convince me that they're right.

79,"So, for context, I'm a young adult (early 20s) and currently live with my family. 

My parents are terrible at communication/conflict resolution, one of whom is very domineering and uptight and a stickler for things that seem minor in the context of real issues, and the other is currently working through grief/trauma--which is exacerbated by their partner not really letting them express themselves because of how profanity bothers them.

There are arguments where they're often both in the wrong; various communication barriers coming between them understanding the other because no matter how much they both deny it, they are BOTH very firm in their opinions of what the other person is thinking, and it's incredibly frustrating when I can often see both sides of their argument. I've become the person they both vent to , to a varying extent, and I offer advice when I can but  it generally does no good. I think they both need to see a therapist, but while one thinks mental health care is unnecessary, the other claims they've already worked through everything they need to on their own. They haven't.

I don't really know if it's 'my place' to advise them to see someone more seriously--I am young, I am their child, I rely on them for a lot of support, but...it's really upsetting to see two people I love and can understand, have so much trouble because the only mediator (me) is ignored, and both my siblings in the house just exacerbate problems by taking sides and provoking one or the other.

I'm just not sure what to do; if suggesting therapy is over a line, is there something else I can do?

80,"(Disclaimer: I didn't write down some details to this story because of personal reasons)

So today in my living my mom suddenly bursts into a cursing rant about how her biggest regret is marrying my dad. Now this was a HUGE shocker for me mostly because my mom is normally very sincere and playful. But looking back my mom has hinted servers times that she is very unhappy in this relationship and how she feels like my father is lazy (which is true).

Now a bit of a backstory\~ a couple of years ago my parents were talking about getting a divorce. But ultimately they decided against it, but their only reason for staying in the marriage was my sister and I. They’ve been to marriage counseling but dropped it (I don’t know why).

Now my dad isn’t the worst person in the world but he certainly isn’t an angel. A couple years back it would be pretty common for him to go into to screaming fits calling my mother unholy words. One of these fights he started was over my mom making an extra chicken wing sauce for him so he didn’t eat the only flavor I liked.... seriously though some of these fights he started were ridiculous. At one point in another fight he was close to hitting her (this is what my sister conveyed to me after the fight finished I wasn't there when it happened). Another example of this was right after they were married and before they had children my dad tried bribing my mom to do things by saying he’ll get a divorce if she didn’t comply. My mom would normally say “Okay get the divorce papers” which shut him down real quick, he hasn’t done this since after my older sister was born.But he has gotten a lot better, but we all still feel kinda scared around him. He is the type of person where it’s his way or the highway and at one point he could be cracking jokes and in the blink of an eye he is scolding you for something. As I said before his attitude has gotten a lot better and he seems to be trying to patch the relationship, but my mother doesn’t seem interested. Obviously he isn’t perfect so he still slips back into his old ways.

Anyways, this is where I need your help... I feel as if it would be better for the whole family if they did divorce since this is causing a lot of emotional stress on everyone. So should I convey my feelings about my opinion of a divorce or should I talk to her about seeing a therapist to properly project her emotions so she doesn’t bottle them up inside.

2019 was easily one of the hardest years of my life. In short, I was almost sexually assaulted by my best friend and my school teachers (and police) didn't support me nor did they keep me safe. My parents didn't get me therapy and I was showing obvious signs of PTSD (flashbacks and more).

 I smoked once ( about 3 months ago) and my parents immediately found out. They were upset but weirdly enough didn't scream as I expected. 

I hadn't smoked until days ago because quarantine has been just a cluster frick of flashbacks and breakdowns. I was desperate and smoked out the window (stupid I know) and my dad didn't confront me until today. He walked into my room and said ***""I know what you've been doing in the washroom. I'm sending you to your moms. I know you got it from her (I didn't) so I'm helping you by giving you the option of getting more.""*** 

This isn't the first time he's threatened to kick me out but he's serious this time. You might be thinking that I'm lucky because I'm just going to my moms house.

95,"i think i’m a perfectionist. and it’s getting too out of control for me to do things in the way i want. firstly for the past 3 years, i’ve wanted to eat much more healthily, lose a tiny bit of weight and gone up. as it would be beneficial to the sports i play, and i would just want to live a healthier lifestyle. i know what i need to do to get reach my goal, but if i eat anything that doesn’t fit with what i have planned out in my head, then i just mess it all up and eat so much junk for the rest of the day. i definitely don’t have an eating disorder, i’ve never ever had a problem with eating too little so it’s not about the restriction in the slightest, but if my mum hands me a bowl of ice cream (i live with her so she randomly gives me food quite a lot) i will eat it, then i cant stop myself, so i end up not exercising or drinking enough water for the rest of the day. 

another thing, is my room. it’s not too messy or too tidy, but i feel like it’s ruining everything. i have too much stuff which i can’t get rid of because my parents don’t like me throwing out stuff that is perfectly fine. the fact that i know there is clutter and messy drawers makes me so unmotivated and lazy, and i cant have them how i like because there’s too much stuff. i’m not a “neat freak” i feel like it’s sucking the motivation out of me. 

if i don’t wash my face in the morning, i can’t do anything, like eating breakfast with my parents, without feeling angry and upset. i feel like i’m overreacting, and obviously i do wash my face straight after, i just get put in a bad mood over literally nothing. same goes for my hair, i have to wash it every day or i’ll be in an insanely bad mood and can’t do anything productive. it’s not a case of “oh i’ll tie it back and get on with my life”, it stops me from doing anything, even if it’s only the slightest bit greasy, so not even unhygienic or anything. 

at the moment we have the lockdown situation so my parents aren’t working and i don’t have to go to school. i’m having to fit into their routine, eg. eating what they make for lunch with them. i’m not at all complaining about spending time with them, but if it’s not something that’s healthy i will mess up all the habits i’m trying to form for the rest of the day. everyday my mum will make me go running with her (i don’t like going running, i would rather do a different workout, but that’s irrelevant). and it would be in the afternoon, as opposed to straight after i wake up, which is what i would prefer. so, you guessed it, i mess up all the habits i’m trying to make for the rest of the day. 

another example of this whole perfectionist thing is my spotify. i have 900 songs in my library, and about 30 playlists with around 6 songs in each because i cant get it organised exactly how i want. i feel like i’m going crazy over the tiniest things and it’s stopping me from living my life productively. can anyone help?

My landlady cooks in bulk for her relatives as well and the whole fridge is stuffed with food. Now my landlady comes to me and says that the rentals listing said that only light cooking was allowed and that I was occupying too mcuh space in the fridge (half a shelf). I told her that that was completely false as the listing did say that cooking was permitted and that was the main reason I chose to take the place. She's occupied the kitchen 24/7 cooking for her relatives ( who are all well in their 30s and 40s and have families of their own, own a car so they can go out to eat whenever they like ) and I just think it's selfish that she wouldn't even let me in for just an hour to feed myself.

i have horrible intimacy issues, and it mostly effects my relationship with my family

for years now i’ve always been uncomfortable with physical, but especially emotional intimacy. 

as i’ve gotten older i realized that i just don’t like being touched by certain people, and most of those people are my family. i honestly can’t handle even standing close to them. but being emotionally intimate is hard for me to do with most anyone. (especially my family) i hate peoples seeing me vulnerable, it makes me sick. 

i know this may sound dumb, but i don’t want people to see me upset because i don’t want them to know i get affected by things. it’ll ruin the barrier i’ve created for myself. i rarely, rarely ever open myself up to my family unless i really have to, and even then i’ll try to make it as vague and brief as possible. opening up comes easier with friends. but no matter who i open up to, i always seem to feel sick and regretful afterwards. 

my grandma just passed today, but there’s no way in hell in letting my family no i’m upset. i know they already know i am, and i hate that, but i cant let them see it. so i’ve just shut myself off in my room, eating what i have in here and only coming out when i need to. 

i’d also like to clarify that my family is not bad: we have issues like every family but they are caring. so i don’t know why they make me so uncomfortable. what’s worse, is that despite how awful vulnerability makes me feel, i crave it. but i can’t get past my own barriers. i don’t know where this stems from, i don’t know why i developed these issues. i haven’t had major betrayls in trust. i’ve lost some friends here and there but i’ve never had a significant person (like a parent) in my life leave me. i’ve been trying to remember any type of source but i can’t. now i don’t know how to fix myself.

She’s convinced that we’re all we need, that we should be happy to stay in bed all day and eat pizza til we pass out and do it all over again. 

That can’t work, because I’m leaving in August for boot camp. She has no support out here despite telling me before we moved that she would make an effort to meet new people.

I'm kinda confused like no what do you mean - especially since only one of these friends had my address D has never been to my house - and she sent me a screenshot from snapchat (she still talks to them occasionally) and sure enough it says they're like two houses down from me. None of them live in my city, they're all 20-60 mins away. A truck is parked where they are. I didn't go over cause it was so late, and it didn't seem super safe, but she has texted with screenshots multiple times now and every time the truck is on my street. The phone calls, which had stopped, have started up again. I've also had more people than normal trying to add my socials, people I don't know who lowkey look fake, and I think its them.

What should I do? Am I being crazy?",12Apr2020,1
125,"About an hour ago I went to her room to get some advice because I couldn't sleep because of my arthritis and she started complaining about being woken up so I went back to my room and a few minutes later she bursts in claiming that I don't care about her and I only care about me

This continues for at least five minutes with her shouting and me trying to get her to leave to no avail

This then escalates into her screaming over now I never do anything she asks me too and I never care about anything unless it's about me and anytime I try to speak she tells to 'shut the fuck up' This leads to her slamming her fists down directly next to my head  quite hard. I immediately confront her because this is the 2nd time in under a month she's done this and she immediately starts in on how she would never hurt anyone and how she and my dad loves me

Five minutes later she's screaming about disrespectful I am too my father and she doesn't understand why I don't hug him or anything. I tried to explain that he either ignores my existence or takes jokes to the point I get hurt and she once again started with 'shut the fuck up'

After this I managed to get her to leave

I don't feel safe here anymore",12Apr2020,1
126,"So unfortunately during high school I didn’t get alot of luck when it came to math and science classes, mostly science.  My freshman year, my Biology teacher got super sick and was out for a few months at the beginning of the school year and only taught for a week and a half, then when he came back he taught for another week and a half before getting a better job offer and transferring, we replaced him shortly after but it was for the last two months of school, so I took biology before HS but I didn’t learn much.

My sophomore year, my Geometry teacher got super sick as well and her car somehow blew up and she was a little concerned and had took a significant amount of time off and barely taught anyways.  And the same year, my Chemistry teacher who was amazing felt it was time to retire as he has been teaching for years and years and years and they never found a suitable replacement for him who had the knowledge of Chemistry he did, so we barely learned anything in that class or did any type of work.

My junior year my Physics teacher had some personal issues and took a some amount of time off and then later on broke his arm while teaching and took about 2 months off and when he came back still missed multiple days due to him going to rehabilitation to help his arm.

So I feel like I’m lacking in severely in Geometry, Chemistry and Physics and was wondering if there was any way of learning by myself at my own pace and enough where I feel competent in that subject enough to at least take a introductory college class in those subjects.",12Apr2020,1
127,"Hello Reddit, this one will be a long one, and I apologize for that. I have created this Reddit account for this post, I am a college student that attends the University of Colorado Boulder. I was in their pre-engineering program and needed a 2.7 math/science gpa and a 3.0+ gpa. I currently have a 2.727 gpa and my father has told me he won't pay for college anymore because of my grades currently. I am not doing the hottest right now in my classes this semester, because I had to take on alot of difficult classes. I don't know what to do anymore, I cannot afford Out of State Tuition if I take out loans, it would cost me upwards of 50+ thousand a year because of how much my father makes. However, I was considering transferring into the business program of University of Illinois Urbana. This college would be instate but I do not think I have the gpa or class requirements of getting in. Before college, I could have easliy made it into the school but did not apply because I was trying to become an engineer. Not to long ago a day after my birthday my mother kicked me out of my house because I got into an argument with my step-dad and had moved in with my father. So I cannot go for help from her because she has totally abandoned me. I truly want to go to school and feel that perhaps I could succeed in business better but I have no clue what I should do.

I need a pair of laptops for my 5 kids to share to finish the school year. I've got videos I need to download at a hotspot each week in town as our metered satellite internet can't handle that much bandwidth. 

I've been out of the computer game too long to know who is reliable and worthwhile. I don't  want chrome because of the the limits I have experienced with my wife's chromebook, which she is using for her college courses.

I am unemployed so this will go on a credit card, which is giving me anxiety and second guessing my decisions. I am looking at New Egg and Amazon. I've got a refurbished windows 8 tower that we run movies through in the living room and an old windows 7 that is in the storage room that one of the kids watches DVD classes from school on, but it is struggling to keep up with those as well.

In the end, I'm thinking windows and since everything is ending up windows 10 right now, I guess that's where I'm heading. I'd like to go less than 300 a piece, but I don't know if that is worth it or not.

Inexpensive, limited on bloatware, multicore processor, at least 4 GB Ram- I feel I am running into the ""fast, Good, cheap: pick 2"" obstacle of life. Any advice on specifics I should look for, other reliable websites. Need to decided in the next day or so.

These will be mostly for school, but I would like one for my wife for her classes this fall and I'd like the other one for me for work. Again, not sure if that is feasible.

136,"Currently, we are watching a show about a depressed, anxiety ridden teenager who eventually turned to crime because he wouldn't (and couldnt) get help. 

In the show, when he was 14/15 years, he was super depressed. He would only want to spend time in his room and was very antisocial. 

His dad held a birthday party for him and he just didn't want to do it. He was only in his room and whenever his dad would check on him he was just crying.

My mom pauses the show and says ""See, that's when I would draw the line. Everyone would go home, cakes in the trash, I've got nothing for him."" 

Later in the show, he finally gets diagnosed with depression. (This is clearly evident in the beginning that he is severely depressed). 

My mom was raised in a world where she was a woman. A woman that was meant to put dinner on the table. She is expected to do the chores. She was physically and mentally abused by her dad, stepmother and stepfather. She got no help whatsoever towards her issues as a teen.

She was a single child. Whenever my brother and I fight, she has no compassion. She says that she doesn't care and she doesn't try to help resolve it. 

When I'm on my period and I get mad, upset, hurt or anything, she does not care. She just does not care. She couldn't give a fuck. She doesn't cut me some slack or cut me a break. When I'm on my period, I don't think. I just act. I get punished for anything. 

I don't understand it and I think it's because of her rough past. She didn't get sympathy so she won't give it. I just feel that I have a hard time talking to her about anything because she's so quick to not truly think about my feelings and just tell me ""who cares what they said"" etc etc. She doesn't understand that what people say to me affects me on a deep level.

My significant other and I have recently moved into an apartment complex because of me being kicked off campus due to the situation with COVID-19 and campus closing down. 

We have a dog who, we learned barks, when we are away at work. We both have to go to work because our jobs are essential. We have gotten a notice about this and have since taken care of the problem. 

The more the days have went by, we figured out that it was our direct neighbor making the complaint about the dog. 

We were coming back in from taking our dog outside to use the bathroom when said neighbor walks through the main door with their dog. Their dog starts barking at our dog which in turn made our dog bark. 

Once we got inside our apartment, the husband to the person walking the dog comes out of the apartment yelling about something then slams the door and runs down the stairs outside to which he slams the door again. When he comes back in, he does the same thing slamming the door and yelling. 

I was unsure at what he had said, but it sounded like he was saying something about a dog. 

We call and make a complaint about the commotion because this is the second day in a row he has been acting like this with seemingly nothing to set him off. 

Did we do the right thing? We are worried that he will call and make a complaint about our dog barking even though their dog started it.",12Apr2020,1

This all started when your voice changes during puberty. for some reason, my voice didn't switch and I had to force my vocal cords to do a deeper voice. So I just thought that it just happens during puberty. Fast forward to my current age of 17, I still talk to my parents with a high pitched cracky voice an I'm afraid to use my real voice, this problem also goes to other family members.

Whenever my parents talk to me, I barely talk and I just nod/shake my head or shrug whenever they ask me a question. Now I just have ""internal"" panic attacks thinking about my future and how long this act is going to last. I'm afraid of getting a job because I overthink stuff.

Luckily, I use my normal, deeper around my friends. I can't bring my friends over to my house and talk to them.

I am afraid of using my deeper voice in front of my parents and sister because they might look at me weird and ask, ""Why are you talking like that?"", ""Are you sick?"".

142,"My boyfriend and I moved into our first home together in december. Our neighbours all keep to themselves and we dont know anyone here.

Everything has been relatively smooth except hearing a woman crying occasionally. Properly sobbing loudly enough for the street to hear. The first night they were outside and by the time we looked to see what was happening they had disappeared into the next street until we could just hear crying in the distance. This was quite disturbing as you can imagine but I assumed there might have been a loss in the family or something like that.

It's now months later and I still occasionally hear crying but we have figured out it's from one of the the above apartments. I haven't seen the woman but my bf has seen her running downstairs crying followed by her partner, and then locking herself in her car to cry more. The crying is always really brutal sounding and it's often late at night. I've never heard an argument or any noise coming from a man so I've been unsure if it's possible arguments or if it's mental illness related.

Anyway, the police came to our door today. I was just waking up and not dressed so my bf answered the door. They asked if we had heard anything within the last hour to which he said no. They left very quickly after that and we haven't heard anything from it.

I've felt very useless and guilty since. I dont know if I should report this weird behaviour in the off chance this woman is being hurt, especially in the current circumstances. At the same time, I dont want to stick my nose into something that might not even be a case of domestic abuse. I dont know if the police were here in regards to them or if it was for something else. Should I report it? As selfish as it is, I also dont want the neighbouts to think we're nosy and make it uncomfortable.

TL/DR: I hear my neighbour crying often but haven't spoke to her. The police came to my door asking if I had heard anything today but I wasnt there to tell them about the crying. I dont know if it was about those neighbours and dont want to report something that might not be worth using police time. Should I report this?",12Apr2020,2
143,"I'm a first year student in university. I feel like school isn't for me anymore. I've been strict with myself and told myself that the only way to reach my goals is by going to school and sticking it through for the whole four years, but I've barely survived the one. I don't think I can survive any more assignments. I've already given up on most of the assignments I have due. I don't want to do them just to drop out at the end of the semester. I feel like there's no point in doing them. I can't keep this up for four years, and I feel like now that I've given up on school, I've given up on everything. I'm not interested in technical jobs. I can't do manual labour because of a recent spinal surgery, not to mention I'm a short, fat, wimpy girl. I'm bad at math and science and cooking and writing. The only thing I wanted to do was learn languages and become a translator, but now I've found that I'm garbage at learning languages too. My only goal was becoming a translator, and I thought school was the only way to achieve that goal. But now I don't want to go to school anymore, so I feel like everything has come crashing down around me. I feel like there's nowhere left to go, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend the rest of my life working a minimum wage job and living in my parents' house. I don't want to stay where I am, physically and mentally.

TLDR; I want to drop out of university, but if I do I'll lose my only goal and feel doomed to a meaningless, dreary existence, and make nothing out of myself. What are my options? What do I do from this point on?

edit to include other information: I have had depression since I was 13, have been to five different counselors over the years, and started taking antidepressants in December 2019.

The thing is, when we tell them politely to leave us (we spend already heaps of time with them) they tease/torment us by taking things or saying rude things. And my step mum sticks up for them. She came into the room the other day, raging off her head at my girlfriend and I. She threw a chair that was against our door to keep the kids out (because my girlfriend has anxiety attacks and the kids weren’t helping) and she grilled me and my girlfriend for telling the kids to leave us alone (after a hard day of work during Corona crisis) 

After her verbally abusing us, she blamed everything on my girlfriend, saying she had a bad energy about her when she walked in. My girlfriend literally had a panic attack and wet herself because my step mums grilling was that harsh and intimidating. My GF didn’t want to come back the next day after work, and I told Bianca and she said that she was being immature and basically needed to apologise for being disrespectful to us ( even tho they give us zilch disrespect) My step mum said that my GF was in the wrong and using her anxiety as an excuse. I got sad because I felt like she didn’t understand me and my point of view, so I broke down crying - and all she said was “your generation is so sensitive- when all I want is a parental figure that understand me and my girlfriend. 

I’m sick of it. All my siblings turn against me and bitch about my behind my back to her and I can never win. All I want is peace and I do a lot for the household and kids, and I get ganged up on. 
What do I do!!!",12Apr2020,1
162,"I guess I’ll start by saying that I’m 20F, and I have depression and anxiety. I’ve been dealing with them for years, I take meds, I see my psychiatrist regularly, etc. I’m doing what I can to manage. (Sorry in advance for such a long post).

Tonight is one of those nights where I feel completely alone. My bf is playing xbox with his best friend who he hasn’t seen in weeks because of the stay at home order Ohio has. He doesn’t get to play as often as he used to, and I feel bad about bothering him. Especially when he’s having fun and relaxing after a long day at work.

A few hours ago, I started to feel an episode coming on. I didn’t know what to do, so I tried to distract myself on my phone. When that didn’t work, I stood in the shower for half an hour with the water as hot as I could stand it. When that wasn’t enough, I plugged the tub and made myself a bath with the same scalding hot water. It turned my skin really red, and eventually my whole body felt numb. For a little bit, I felt at peace. The water started to get cold, so I drained it and got my pjs on.

Since then, I’ve been laying in bed, thinking about how I want to tell my bf what’s going on, but it seems like almost every time he plays video games, I have an issue that takes him away from playing. I feel bad, because that’s not what I’m meaning to do, but its happened quite frequently. I think it’s mostly that I have no one else to talk to or do anything with, so I feel like I have no one to turn to in situations like this.

I just want someone to talk to. I want to be able to tell someone things and not have to worry about them telling anyone. I just feel so alone, and I don’t know what to do...",12Apr2020,2
164,"I’m not gonna beat around the bush with this one, I’m pretty fucking scared. It’s been going on for around half a year at this point, and google hasn’t given me much. I’ve been falling into a dream state while I’m still awake. It’s not like I just picture the dream, but my whole body is literally paralysed, and it feels like I can’t breathe. I’m dreaming, but I’m always conscious, as I’m usually struggling to pull myself out of the dream and back into the real world. Usually when it happens I’ll fall into and wake up from the dream state anywhere from 1-3 times before actually falling asleep. I don’t think it’s sleep paralysis, as I’ve heard that’s typically something you see around you. When this happens, I can simultaneously see my surroundings and experience the dream at the same time. It’s becoming a big issue that’s hindering my sleep several times a week. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but if anyone knows some resources I could look at or where I could go next, that would be greatly appreciated.",12Apr2020,8
165,"I grew up in a cult where everything was black and white. People were either good or evil. Everyone either went to heaven or hell. If you weren't a member of the church, you are an enemy of god. Anything that wasn't holy was satanic. There was no grey area. The indoctrination created black and white thinking in me which exist to this day.


I'm an Atheist now, but my black and white thinking just encompasses new things. For example, I assume all Republicans are evil and want me dead even though I know it's irrational. Or I would often think I'm a terrible person when I make a mistake. I unintentionally categorize people and things as either good or evil even though I know most are in the grey area. 


I know these thoughts are irrational, but I don't know how to get rid of them. When I get them, I tell myself they're irrational and that I have no reason to assume things are black and white. I know people who disagree with me don't all want me dead or to suffer, but I keep having thoughts that they do because I struggle to find the grey area.

167,"I'm a virgin in my late 20s. I'm starting to date and I want a serious relationship, however, I can't shake the feeling that the woman I end up with will have a promiscuous past. I don't know if I'll be okay with a partner who has slept with random guys in her past, or worse, engaged in threesomes, anal, swallowing semen, etc. The thought of another guy able to claim that he ""used"" my wife, especially in degrading ways would disturb me. If these acts were done in a committed relationship, I'd be okay, since I feel the guy valued her. (Interestingly, the thought that the random hookup will eventually marry a woman with a promiscuous past is soothing to me. I understand this is ego based.)

I'm a bit ashamed of holding these views as I consider myself a feminist and wonder if part of my disdain stems from my own lack of experience. I have thought about sleeping around and exploring my sexuality before settling but then I considered if there are possible detrimental effects. For example, the act of exploring my sexuality will set an unmeetable standard for me in my future monogamous relationships.

I've thought about just living in accordance to my ""values"" but I don't know what that even means anymore. Religion has played a role in this and so has toxic masculinity. Not to mention, values change with experience so its a moot point.

168,"I need advice. My mom favors my sister over me. I am a 19 year old female. I am going to transfer to my dream university this fall and I’m very excited but last time I applied my mom spent the time telling me how that was a stupid thing to do and to be realistic and stay in a university I don’t like. So I didn’t go because she got to me this time I haven’t told her. She is also against my chosen major and minor. I am planning on majoring in criminal justice with a minor in psychology so I can go into the fbi. She still tells me to be realistic with my dreams and I should do something with math instead. Yet she supports my sisters dreams of being a photographer or being a model or actress. She once told me that you need to have a plan b and c career. She used herself as an example because when she was younger she wanted to be a dancer an actress or a model but she ended up being a Human Resources person and she put my career as an FBI agent, psychologist, or a police officer in the same bracket as her a, b and c careers.

170,"I have no excuses, or idea why I act the way I do. I have always been hot headed, and stubborn. I am also very self conscious with a low self esteem, so with all of this combined is a deadly combination. 

I have never been diagnosed, but I am pretty sure I have some sort of anxiety (random spikes of anxiety w/o a trigger, heavily avoiding people, overthinking very small things and letting it effect my behavior etc). Until recently I have blamed my failed friendships on the other person, especially since I was bullied in elementary school. I have never had a lasting friendship over maybe 3 years. 

In my recent friendships with my friends, they like to tease people, and although they preach being empathy, fail to realize that some topics really really get to me (I have even said specific things are too much). Recently in my brain I have been perceiving their jokes as attacks, even though they probably aren’t, and I’m not sure how to calm down. It’s all just slowly building up, and I can feel that I am about to do irreversible damage.",12Apr2020,1
171,"I'm completely aware that a self diagnosis isn't reliable, so I don't want to say I do have ADHD. But hear me out I guess.

I have always struggled in school. Nothing I've tried gives me motivation, unless I like or am interested in the class. When it comes to work, I tend to become distracted or unmotivated, while in a lot of other things that I enjoy, I work pretty hard. Nobody likes to do boring things, but no matter how much I talk myself into it, I literally can never get myself to do some things, even when I really need to. 

I don't know how to put it into words. I've always had this problem. I don't know why I can't do things and it's driven me to a point of depression that I think from time to time of how I would write my last note, not to be dramatic or anything. My parents never considered anything, but my mother's always been the leader and unless she thinks of something first, it just can't be possible to her.

It's just really infuriating and really sad and this state of being has consumed me since quarantine started. I don't know why it's hard for me to work or catch up in class. I always feel like everyone else took an extra class or something and that I'm behind. 

If I did have it, the possibility that medication could help gives me a ton of hope. 

Can somebody please tell me what they know about ADHD, if you have it or not. I've done my research, but again, I can't be the person that self diagnoses myself. How do I even see a professional these days? I hate feeling like somethings wrong with me lol.",12Apr2020,1

The reason I’m asking is one of my GF’s ex-friends off the rails bullies her and likes to get into fights.  I’ve seen her effectively pull people’s hair and bite their fingers, she’s also just a good fighter.

173,"\*Note, this is long AF, and requires a lot of explaining\* Ok Imma be honest here, this is a lot of speculation (with, albeit valid information) so that's why I'm asking, because I don't honestly have any idea what to do. So my best friend, let's call her Marie, is friend with this kid who we'll call Evan. Personally, I don't like Evan. He's honestly an asshat, although he has moments when he's enjoyable to talk to, overall I don't like him. He doesn't like me, it's mutual. ( I swear this matters ) I put up with him for the sake of my friend Marie, because he's probably her closest friend outside of me that attends our school. Lately he's been doing/saying concerning things. 

One thing I should tell you about my school, is that I live in a weird area. Half of the kids at my school are loaded, and the other half are broke. I like in an area near a top university (Like top ten on earth) so many of the rich kids have parents who are professors/doctors at this college, meaning they are rarely around and often tend to buy their kids love rather than showing actual affection. The other half are pretty broke, and the majority are living in single parent households (not that there's anything wrong with that, but a significant number of these kids have parents that died or left, so there's a lot of trauma in general). Long story short the mental health issues in my school are disturbingly common.

So Evan, like Marie and literally like half my friends, self harms. I know how fucked up that is, but there's not much I can do. Guidance is zero help. Essentially they tell the parents, but they never make sure that anything comes of it. They also tell the teachers and talk all the friends to see what they know. Usually the parents don't care, and they don't actually check to see if the friends are actually friends. So this results in guidance telling half the people north of the equator, but never actually making sure that they are getting treatment. 

Lately Evan has gotten so bad. He's been drinking (we're like, not even close to legal age. Let's just say we're not even 16 yet.), cutting himself in places like the soles of his feet and shoulder blades. And he's been saying some things that are...wildly disturbing. I remember this word for word, because I have never been more disturbed in my entire life. We were mid conversation, when he gets the weirdest look on his face. Then he says this ""Honestly I really want to kill you. Not because I don't like you, even though your personality is shit. I just want to see what it would do. I want to see what would happen to your family and your friends. I want to see what will happen to Marie, like how it will affect people."" I was so freaked out, I genuinely have never felt genuinely concerned for my safety until that moment. AND HE KEEPS SAYING SHIT LIKE THAT. And I swear to god, he sounds and looks dead serious. That paired with the fact Marie has been texting me saying that he's been saying things that lead her to believe he's suicidal, is really making me worried that he's going to hurt himself or someone else.

Because of all of these factors, what the actual hell do I do? If I tell a trusted adult at school they have to tell guidance by law. So where do I take this? His parents are totally oblivious, and honestly are probably aware at his drinking habits, considering how much he drinks they'd have to be downright blind to not notice.",12Apr2020,1

Tbh, I don't know why we never cuddled - we just simply didn't, and also back when we first met I was too shy to ask (and still kind of am).

Something I'm nervous about, is that he might think I'm trying to be romantic (I'm not - I genuinely just want to cuddle) or that he might reject the idea.

Hey I’m back again to ask for more advice. 

So a little backstory:
My gf of 7 months just broke up with me yesterday again. She first broke up with me a month before and we ended up getting ack together and breaking up a few times. She was always there for me and she was my best friend. It hurts to be without her. 

Problem:
She is the most important thing to me. She has always made me so happy but towards the end we argued a lot. I ended up pushing her so far away that it was impossible to pull her back.

198,"I live in a relatively expensive area that’s only becoming more of a tech hub location and increasing rent prices everywhere. I work 2 jobs to keep up, working 60-70/week and 10-12 hour days. It SUCKS. I have no time for a personal life anymore. 
My full time job is my career dream job, with everything I’ve ever wanted, except the worst management I’ve ever dealt with. They are new and clueless and honestly create a hostile environment for me, but I was dumb and didn’t report it to HR when I had the chance. Now I’m hanging on a limb on whether or not I get to keep my job amid this pandemic. I’m an essential employee so still working, just less hours and at risk of being fired/furloughed/let go at any moment. 
My part time job was put on hold, until my boss decided we need to make money so she’s blurring the lines to make us an essential business so we can work and have income. This makes me uncomfortable as it’s a customer facing job and I directly interact with my specific clients. 

I’m also finally enjoying having some days off, an actual weekend, something I’ve never gotten before. I finally feel rested. So I’m eager to work 5 days a week like most other people. 

I had planned on working a bunch up to June/July when my lease is up and I could leave to move in with some friends cross country, who had offered me the opportunity to live and work with them at a much better company, in a different career field, but also with better management. 

Things are going so badly for me and my mental health, that I want to move ASAP, but I’m worried because 1) I would screw over my co-workers I do like at work and my clients 2) I don’t have enough money to break the lease 3) the state of the country has taken away the job opportunity when moving, so no income.

199,"I am having issues with the kitchen manager... well everyone is. She is one of the worst people I have ever met. Let me explain why and then I'll get into the shit that happened this week.

Just some background information. I'm the manager of the front of house at a fast-food restaurant and she is the manager of the kitchen. We'll call her Karen. No one likes working with Karen. You know when you see someone who is an asshole and you think ""I don't like them, but I can tell they have good heart""? Karen is not one of those people. When I see her, my entire body fills with dread and hatred for this woman. I've honestly boiled it down to narcissistic personality disorder.

Things that Karen has done:

* Karen yells and screams at people. If she's mad at one person, she yells at everyone. Even if you try to ask her a question when she's mad, she'll belittle you and call you stupid. But when she makes a mistake, she just laughs it off. I can't tell you the number of times I've had to comfort her assistant manager because she's crying and hurt by what Karen said.
* Edit: When she wants something. She's the nicest person in the whole world. It's very unsettling.
* Has little to no empathy for others. When you say you are tired, she doesn't give a shit. But when she is tired, she expects sympathy and for you to listen to her whilst she complains.
* Super controlling. I get that Karen is a manager but watching the cameras every second of the day and calling every 5 minutes to tell your staff to do something is ridiculous. She doesn't trust her staff at all.
* Don't even think about giving her feedback. She'll get super defensive and be pissy the whole damn week.
* Blames everyone. For everything.
* Karen thinks she's all that. Like she's the most important person in the world.
* Never shows up on time for work. Always at least 30-60 minutes late but gets angry when others are 5 minutes late. When our district manager was on vacation, Karen didn't even show up to two of her shifts. Saw her report for salaried hours and it reported that she worked her full 40 hours.
* Constantly tries to tell me what to do. Saying it's her store and I need her permission. For example, I was hiring new staff for the front. Karen said that I took too long doing interviews and I shouldn't take more than 5 minutes? She wouldn't let me hire anyone I called in to interview. She said ""another management needs to do the second interview"" and sits down with my candidates for less than 3 minutes before sending them on their way. I had this one girl who had a diploma in hospitality and was all smiles but Karen rejected her because ""she's not friendly"". She hired someone for my department without telling me and I ended up firing this person because of an attitude problem. It's such a waste of time and resources training someone who only lasts a month.
* Karen asked me to go to our sister store to pick up stock (about 30 mins away) which I don't mind doing. I asked her to watch the dining room and help my staff if they needed it because they wouldn't have a manager there. When I was about to leave after picking up the stock, my car wouldn't start so I was stranded at the sister store. I called her with updates every hour to tell her what I was doing to try and make it back as soon as possible. I even walked 30 minutes to the nearest hardware store to buy cables but it turns out it wasn't the battery, it was the starter. I had to wait until my dad got off work downtown (about 40 minutes away from the sister store) to come to pick me up. I ended up getting back to the store 4 hours after I left. Karen complained to the district manager that I was fooling around and took 4 hours because I didn't want to work. After I picked up the stock FOR HER.

There is so much more that she has done but I won't bore you with all of it.

I have no proof of anything. I talked to the district manager about how I have a problem with how she is treating people. She sat me down with the kitchen manager and the DM acted as a mediator. She was all polite and calm when the DM was there. All I talked about was how she treated people. Nothing else. 

Afterwards, the DM asked us to talk it out without her and that’s when the kitchen manager started screaming at me. About how she’s not going to baby talk them when they make mistakes. How she has a better relationship with them than I do. Also, why they aren’t going to her and why I’m taking their side. 

She then was like “you think I’m a bad manager, fine. I’ll just stop talking. I have 25 years experience and you come along and obviously you know better. She then stormed out. 

I was so frustrated and angry, I just started crying. I have no idea how to handle this. 

I need this job right now as it’s hard to obtain a secure job with a salary close to mine. I know it’s not much but it’s $4 more than minimum wage. How do I deal with her/what should I do here?",12Apr2020,1

2. Should i tell him if i changed my mind? 

He is one of the best people ive ever known, i said no because i wasnt ready, and i wasnt sure if i was into him. But i think i am ready and i think i am into him. Honestly its unbearable not having him in my life, since i rejected him things just havent been the same for obvious reasons. I think hes distant, like hes mad at me or doesnt want to talk to me. 

I just really really really want to know whats in his head. Is he thinking about this as much as i am? Is he mad??? Does he think im mad??? I thought i was acting the same as always after. Am i dumb and he doesnt give a shit???? Boys???? What even are they???????? 

Ive honestly been screaming at myself ever since because he and i are probably perfect for each other and i blew it or something.

203,"My uncle used to be an army man and I found a bullet of his property he forgot many years ago in my house.

Some day, I decided to dismantle it to do something like a necklace or dispose it. I got dismantled the head and got rid of all the gunpowder but when trying to dismantle the detonator I fired it accidentally and it got my leg (near my knee), I treated the wound and didn't see the detonator in it (it was a hole) so I thought it was okay. 

Fast forward to this day, got an indentation over my knee due to the wound and looks completely healed. But sometimes, when I make some movements, I feel a slight pain so I was wondering if is it possible that the piece that made the wound got stuck in there and I somehow didn't see it?

My true passion at this point is photography, but I plan to start double-majoring in that soon. I'm prioritizing a degree in a tech field since it's also something I'm passionate about *and* it makes more money than photography would.

Things I like about tech: Working on computers (both Windows and MacOS), taking computers apart, replacing computer components, putting computers back together, solving problems with either the system or the network, and just knowing how they work in general.

Any advice or even just straight up pointing to a major would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, y'all.

225,"Hi everyone!

I recently got accepted into the Master of Data Science in Computational Linguistics program at UBC, as well as the Master of Data Science and Analytics program at Ryerson. Both would start in September 2020 and are one year long. I am really torn between the two programs for many reasons.

A little bit of background about me – I live in the greater toronto area (GTA) with my parents, and I’m finishing up my final year at the University of Toronto, doing a Specialist in Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics. I also work as a programmer part-time. I have loved languages and linguistics since I was a child, but I never saw it as something practical enough to pursue, and since my parents are both in IT and I was always good at math, they convinced me to go into CS for my undergrad. I was interested enough in linguistics to do a minor in it. In May last year, I discovered I could pursue a graduate degree in Computational Linguistics to merge my two fields. I also want to get a Master’s because I feel like my undergraduate knowledge of CS is not enough, and that I could get a much more interesting job by having a Master’s degree in data science and/or computational linguistics.

UBC’s MDS-CL program is the only Computational Linguistics (CL) Master’s program I found in Canada. It is a data science program that focuses on working with language data. Although there are a few CL programs in the states, I prefer to stay in Canada for several reasons (which I won’t mention here). For the past year, I have been trying to get accepted into this program, and really got my hopes up for it.

I applied to the Master of Data Science and Analytics at Ryerson as a Plan B, in case I did not get accepted into UBC but later still wanted to pursue graduate studies after UofT. As I understand it, the program at Ryerson is pure data science and statistics, with one elective course that I could take in NLP, basically just text mining. At UBC I would be taking at least one CL course for every 3 data science courses. UBC’s data science program ranks as #3 in Canada for 2020, and Ryerson’s as #9 according to this list: [https://www.coursecompare.ca/masters-in-data-science/](https://www.coursecompare.ca/masters-in-data-science/).

I feel that if I go to UBC for CL, and later decide that I want a job in data science not related to CL, I would still be competitive. However, for a job specifically in computational linguistics, it would look better to have a Master’s in CL rather than just a Master’s in data science. I don’t know if this is true.

All of these reasons would make UBC the obvious choice here, and it was, until I looked at the finances.

Tuition at UBC is $32k (CAD), and adding the cost of relocating to Vancouver and paying for rent, car insurance, gas and groceries, the total comes to about 60k (although that does include some leeway). UBC also does not recommend working at all during this program.

With the current COVID-19 situation destroying the economy, I don’t want to end up with $60k in debt and no job after graduation. I also don’t want to end up moving to Vancouver in August, only to end up quarantined in a tiny apartment, and doing the program online because the campus is closed.

At Ryerson, the tuition is $10k, and I would not need to relocate, meaning no paying for rent or groceries. Not only that, but a few days ago I got an email saying that I will receive a $4k scholarship to attend this program. This drops tuition costs to $6k, which I can cover with my current savings. Although yes, I will still have car insurance and gas expenses, as well as others, this Master’s degree will cost me at most $10k, and I will most likely be able to continue working part-time if I stay in Toronto. This isn’t even considering any funding I could get from OSAP.

(Or, I could just graduate, work for a few years, and later do a Computational Linguistics program in the US?) 

So long story short, doing the degree at Ryerson may be (literally) six times cheaper than going to UBC. But I truly don’t know what the best decision is for me – to chase my love of languages and give myself $60k in debt, or to get a decent Master’s degree that won’t put me debt but is not as unique or special. Giving myself debt seems like a terrible idea, but throwing away my dream to save some money feels like betraying myself.  I need to know whether the MDS-CL degree at UBC is really worth it before spending so much money for a program that might give me similar opportunities as the program at Ryerson. I don’t want to give up on my dream program to take the easy/comfortable route, but I also don’t want to put myself in debt. What would you do in my situation?

It would be really useful if anyone is currently in one of these programs, or if someone knows how the two programs look in terms of getting a job in data science and/or computational linguistics. 

**TLDR: MDS-CL at UBC is my dream program but will cost me 60k, MSc in DS at Ryerson will cost me 10k, but is not my dream program, which should I choose?**

227,"Hi, I’m Andy, I’m 16, and I need to ask advice on a problem I’m having. I apologize for grammatical errors and if this is too long or confusing.

So the attic in my house is very small, my mom calls it a “crawlspace” but you can stand up in there and it’s fairly wide. Anyways, the entrance to the attic is in my mom’s closet. For a while, maybe about a year and a half, I’ve been hearing noises in there. Nothing too loud, always noises I could always tell myself was in my imagination or not something to worry about. But this escalated several months ago. 

My mom takes my phone at night (because she doesn’t want me on it too late) and puts in her bathroom, which connects to her closet. It was around midnight when I snuck into her room, creeping past her bed and into the bathroom to retrieve my phone. I looked down the length of her bathroom to the pitch darkness of the closet, seeing that the door was wide open, which isn’t abnormal. I reached for my phone on the counter, trying to pick it up quietly, and in the total silence of the room I heard a noise from the closet. This was not the creak of a floorboard, which sometimes happens because the house settles and makes noises. This was a scrape of something against fabric, as if someone accidentally brushed against an item of clothing. I froze and stared into the dark closet, processing what I had just heard. Horrified, I ran to my mom’s bed and jumped in beside her, pulling the blankets up around me. I told her what happened, but she seemed mad that I was trying to get my phone and didn’t believe me about the noise. 


Since then, I’ve heard things in one other room, when I was sleeping in our guest room during a sleepover, I heard footsteps walking around the sleeping bodies of me and my friends (we weren’t on a bed we were sleeping on the floor). That was the most scared I’ve ever been in my life, I focused on keeping my eyes shut and not moving as the person walked around the room for god knows how long. I asked my mom if she’d come into the room and she said no, but again didn’t believe what I had heard. 

Becoming too afraid to sleep by myself, I began sleeping in my mom’s bed for the past week or so. I know, I’m too old for that but I’m genuinely terrified. I take an hour or so to fall asleep normally, but the past few days it’s been impossible to sleep for hours because I hear someone walking around the room, and in the bathroom that leads to the closet. My mom falls asleep fast and doesn’t hear, so she doesn’t believe me. 

She thinks scary movies cause me to have an active imagination and banned me from watching them. But I dread going to sleep tonight and hearing whatever is in the attic come out again. Could this actually be a person, or maybe something paranormal? I don’t believe in that stuff but I’m scared and will try anything. I’m so tired because I barely sleep now, and when I do sleep I have nightmares that I wake up from sweating. I always have the feeling of being watched and I hate it.

My grandma has paranoid schizophrenia, so I thought I might just have that, but I spoke with a psychiatrist and he doesn’t think I have it. My mom tells me to google how to deal with my “fear of the dark” because she thinks that’s all this is and wants me out of her bed at night. This is my last resort and I don’t know what to do.",12Apr2020,3
228,"Hello dear redditors, 

I am a 20 male whose parents got divorced before I can even remember. Been living with my mother since then until just recently.

As one might expect, when I started understanding my surroundings and speaking, all the heat and hate caused by that divorce had already faded.

As I started making questions about why my father wasn't there while I watched all the other  kids arround me playing with theirs, Mother  kept telling me that He was living with someone else (Btw a woman of course, who I supposedly met  for the first when i was around 3 years old, you know that shared parenting thingy or whatever).

Of course a 3-4 year old kid would never think about why his father left his wife and child for someone else, I just thought that it was normal and kept thinking that until I was 8-9 years old. 

It was then that it started really stinging. The phone calls started getting rarer and rarer, the money stoped coming and there were no more trips to Father's home. As I grew up I started thinking that he was a HUGE asshole, (and he is for what he did to my mother) and started closing my feelings to others, only letting out anger and arrogance while these feelings of abandon and rejection twirled inside my head. This lasted until I was arround 13 years old.

It was at 13 that I realised that Mother wouldn't be able to sustain me for too long as she had just lost her job that she had for the last 20 years, as the company that she worked for went bankrupt. Was a hard time for 3 years until I decided to drop out of Highschool to find a job and be able to help with the living expenses while making some money of my own. This lasted until last year when my mother found a new job and my life kinda twisted in a way I was not expecting.

Believe it or not, Sir Father finaly remembered that he, once upon a time, had another wife and a kid and descendend from the heavens offering me to come to live with him as he would cover all expenses of entering a private Highschool and also a college degree. But it came with a twist. His current wife had died with cancer and I had a 9 year old step-sister.

&amp;#x200B;

So frome here, this is where my conundrum comes to life:

\- I accepted the invitation, after spending some time thinking about it with my mother. Obviously she told me to go because as where we lived I wouldn't have much of a future anyways;

\- I am corrently living with my father and step-sister on a far away from where I lived region of the country;

\- I was going to Highschool before all this covid-19 nuisance came to be;

\- To be honest my grades where a godamn disgrace. I can't focus as I once could on what the teachers are saying, and dealing with all these younger than me classmates just gets on my nerves;

\- My step-sister is a damn spoiled brat, I can't put up with her more than 5 minutes at a time and my father just lets her be with whatever she wants and does;

\- My father's best friends look at me as if I were a stupid monkey  (they are a couple and their daughter is 2 years younger than me, btw she also treats me like an efing monkey).

\- I feel out of place and I feel like I betrayed my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask, 

What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I know  there are lots of people with problems that far surpass what is going on with my life, but nevertheless I  sincerely ask for advice as this phase of my life is proving to be a lot harder than I expected it to be.

242,"Hi. So, this is a bit more serious. I’ve talked about my sister before, but this time it’s different, and I don’t know what to do. Long story short she’s some mental illnesses and is suicidal. Tonight was a bad night for her and for us. And I don’t know how to help. I’m leaving for college next year and I don’t want my mom to be here because she is the on the receiving end of most of her anger. She’ll get into hysterics and my mom will take me out of the situation as much as possible, which means she takes all of the anger and name calling and accusations. My sister does go to therapy/is on meds/ sees doctors but it doesn’t work according to her. Personally, I don’t think she is taking it as seriously as she should, because she often uses me to talk about her mental health issues (and I am in now way trained to deal with that I’m barely an adult).  She says she feels excluded, which I can see. She will often make jokes about not living past 18 (she’s 17) and those jokes make me VERY uncomfortable because I was directly involved in her last attempt, so I clam up and stop the conversation there. But, she also doesn’t take advantage of opportunities that arise, we dyed Easter eggs tonight as a family and she was there and gone in five minutes. This past year hasn’t been a cake walk, and my mom has taken a lot of it on herself. This weekend is her bday and I doubt she wanted this. I just don’t know how to help her. In the middle of writing this she came into my room acting like nothing just happened! I know this stuff takes time, but it seems like she’s not using the resources she has and she seems ungrateful.

246,"Hi all. I work at a grocery store, and now is not the best time for it. About last Friday I started to feel sick and stayed home the following Saturday. I then went back to work Monday thinking I was feeling better, but then started to feel not great again (chest congestion, cough, sore throat). I have no access to any sort of testing as my state has not enough tests for covid.  I called my doctor and they even confirmed this hearing my symptoms. My chest is tight and feels like there is pressure on it as well as congestion. The CDC is reccomending to stay home if you have any symptoms that could be covid. My manager was almost guilt tripping me for deciding to stay home for at least the next week until I fully recover, saying I should come in and work when I'm scheduled. I get that things are hard right now, and that they need me, but I don't want to risk possibly infecting others with something that is deadly for certain people.  Am I wrong in my decision?  Thanks.",12Apr2020,1
247,"We are 4 male roommates. 28-30

He met her (36) recently and he talks to her now every night for hours(I cannot stress this enough...hours. 7 8 hours a night). And honestly....happy for him he just got divorced. But he says their personality tests make them perfect matches and that her personality gets bored if they don't see eachother. 

So now. He invited her to our town, because we have had a very good results with covid and its safer. So they can bang in a hotel and ""release the most happiness chemicals possible"". She is driving 16hrs and coming for a top 10 most affected city. 

So his excuse is he already drove to some town in the middle of nowhere to meet her last week so like they definitely have the same germs, but he is putting us all in danger and literally doesn't talk to the roommates when we try to communicate with him about it.

I'm not really sure how to handle this...would love advice.

also travel has been banned in both of our states except to help elderly family. Which two of us really shouldn't do now that we could be exposed.

248,"Hello Redditors, 
I went to school in the South in the USA and I remember in 3rd grade before september 11, 2001 there was a series of videos we had to watch in class. This video series had a funny song all I remember is the hook you gotta be be cool. This series showed us a scenario is a school environment happening to a kid. Then it would freeze and say something along the lines of let's see how we should react. It would then show the kid blowing a fuse and getting overly aggressive against the bully then stopping before the punch and saying let's look at another approach. Then it would show the victim acting calmly and at the end it would show the kid smirking with sunglasses on. I remember being in class with the other kids laughing and giggling and was hoping to find the video series or find someone that remembered it and see if we could piece together how to find it but please help me find this series of videos.

251,"Hi! Before, I start, I would just like to make it clear that I know no one knows someones intentions unless you ask. I just wanted to get an idea of what you guys think.

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (I really have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I'm confused: did he just put in all this effort throughout this year just to hook up with me? Or did he want an actual relationship with me? It's weird cause ever since freshman year we would keep in contact through some sort of social media, but now we haven't talked at all since the quarantine (like 4ish weeks).",12Apr2020,0

255," 

Hi YouTuber community! I have much experience with creating content for YouTube, but I never went all-in on any one channel that I've created. I have some ideas that I want to start manifesting into a reality, but I have a few general issues and more specific problems.

The first problem is that I have several different ideas for channels/content that I want to create, always leaving me with a feeling of ""what if"" whenever I think about starting a new channel. The main channel themes that I'm struggling to decide between are: gaming, psychology, social commentary, movie reviews/pop culture reviews, pets, and traveling.

If you were in a situation or understand at all how I am feeling, how do you get past this and make a choice?

More specific issues that I may face with each type of channel are as follows:

\-If I create a gaming channel, what structure should I use? A green screen and then just put my screen capture over that? I have a green screen, I just don't understand how I would sync up the video of me and then the screen capture at the same time. I'm not new to editing; I have a bachelor's in digital media production. I just want to know the standard routine for the community. On another note, should I focus on just one game? I would love to make it all about the Sims, but I have a few other games that I would like to bring in here and there as well.

\-If I create a psychology channel, I would definitely focus on psychology of personality and typage. The issue arises when I think about how far I can go with this content without a credible degree in that area. I didn't go to school for it, I'm just obsessed with it and know way more than the average person, (I'm assuming.)

\-If I create a social commentary channel, where do I even begin? I would have to sort of find a sub-niche just like in any other channel. But I feel as though I wouldn't easily be able to find it because I'm a jack of all knowledge and don't really have any expertise or obsession in any one particular area.

\-If I create a movie review/pop culture channel, the same kind of problems arise that would with a gaming channel. Firstly, what do people use to show themselves watching the movie and then stopping at specific points to show their reaction and for them to give commentary? Further, would a ""watch-along"" type thing be more effective? or would it make more sense to just talk about the movie and only pull certain screen grabs from the movie that support my opinion.

\-If I create a pets channel, you will probably get the most passion out of me, but ironically I don't think I'd be able to create nearly as much content. I have three cats and one ferret and most of my content would be funny things my ferret does and the rest would be standing up to common misconceptions about ferrets and pets in general (more of an activism-type thing).

\-Lastly, if I created a traveling channel, how feasible would this be? There are so many people who do this and I would find it hard to make it creative.

My final point I wanna make is: would there be any feasible way (in your opinion) to combine certain aspects of all of these potential channels and maybe make one that incorporates a couple of these themes and then if I get more popular, create a side channel that maybe addresses the other themes. For example, I could create a gaming channel featuring my ferret and talk about social issues while I play games, and then have a separate channel where I review movies with my cat and then have other videos on the same channel that focus solely on animal rights' issues. Or I could have a psychology/personality typage channel that uses video games and movie reviews to demonstrate the stuff I'm talking about (ie. ""Insert Movie Here"" demonstrates ""this psychological issue"" and then have another video like, ""These 7 Personality Types"" are created in The Sims 4.) And then have another channel once I get popular, that focuses on my traveling with my ferret and then has random videos while I'm traveling that address pet issues or social issues.

I know it seems like I might not need help figuring this out considering I have clearly thought a lot about it, but it's just figuring out what to start with that I'm really struggling with. ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. And if this isn't the right thread to be posting this in, then don't hesitate to redirect me! Thank you :)

257,"I've struggled with this literally since I could form thoughts. When I feel like I've been wronged, I have this impulsive need to say or do something to get ""even"" or make my point. Living in NYC, there are a lot of people, meaning there are a lot of jerks so these kinds of things happen a lot. But the problem occurs when I feel like I didn't get even. When I feel like I didn't defend myself as best I could I can't stop thinking about it, I can't get over it and it just plays in my head over and over again thinking about what I should have done. Even the most minuscule things.

For instance, I really hate when I have the light to cross the street and a car is turning but they stop to let me cross but then the car behind them honks at them/me. Like do they want them to run me over? IDK what they're thinking. I don't even walk that slowly. But usually in that situation I would yell at the car behind them or like flip them off but there was one morning where I was rushing to get an uber and my head was just somewhere else so I didn't realize what happened until it was like too late and they drove off and I didn't get the chance to do or say anything. But I just felt wronged and the rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about it and IDK why but it causes my heart to start pounding. I would describe it as anxiety but I feel more angry about it.

And I do get these obsessive recurring nonstop anxious thoughts about other little things like if there's something I need to get done and haven't done it yet I can't stop thinking about it or enjoy anything until I've done it. But those thoughts aren't as bad as these ones cause they don't involve as much emotion as these anger related ones.

Basically, in order to avoid these thoughts from happening, I feel like I HAVE to argue with all of these people when these kinds of things happen so I can at least get my anger out on the person who deserves it while I can. And it'll be instances where I KNOW I was right but I also know it would be so much easier for other people to just ignore it. But I don't know how people do it. Like how do you just let someone get away with treating you poorly without trying to stand up for yourself and get some justice?

Everyone knows it's like part of my personality and they find it ""funny"" and ""refreshing"" to see someone stand up for themselves but I don't think they realize that a lot of times I don't WANT to do it. Like I don't enjoy fighting or arguing with people. I constantly get compared to Larry David by my friends and family. Like it's an inside joke that I'm like his character in Curb Your Enthusiasm. But I don't think people realize it's exhausting. I argue because I feel like I HAVE to right a wrong otherwise everything is just unbalanced and unfair and I know if I don't it's gonna bother me for a LONG time. Even after years, I'm talking even 10 years, I'll think about something that happened that I didn't do anything about and I get angry about it and can't stop thinking about it again.",12Apr2020,1

So before the week of being quarantined for all of us I asked my (Now old Bestfriend) Bestfriend is we are still friends, this is how it went down;

**Me**: *Quick Question, are we still friends?*

**Him**: *Yeah, why?* 

**Me**: *Bestfriends or Casual friends? Just curious thats all.....Well I'm just questioning our friendship and amongst other friends as well.*

**Him**: *More like casual*

**Me**: *Okay, well that's a dummer : (* 

**Him**: *Yeah sorry*

**Me**: *It's fine, sadly.*

**Him**: *You sure?*

At this point I started to cry, I was in shocked I guess, I didn't answer his concered question I just typed saying *""Well when ever you need someone I'm there, I'm usually a GHOST anyway to everyone""*

**\[Backstory-ish?\]** Me and (Now old best friend) my bestfriend were friends for 3 years, IF me and him were still close friends it would have been 6 years sady it's not. Anyways I've always been by his side no matter what, if he had any girlfriend(s), I be recpectfully third wheeling; helping him and his girlfirend(s) to what ever problems they had, I would be the one to step in and help resolve false rumors agaisnt them etc. If he had any school issue bad grades/missing school/etc I'd be glad to help him do his work, gather his missing assiments, helping with projects, etc. I'd just be there for him no matter what issue there was. 

**\^\^\[Ending\]** I don't know how to even feel about it should I be angry? sad? talk to him? I've gone through 3 bestfriends now and I don't know what to do at this point, I've been focused on myself and it's been pretty much loney lol?

**\[Clarification..?\]** (Overall I mostly help out those close to me) ,  I'd just be the one to always be there for him or anyone in general, but there was some issues though he never came to any or one of my birthdays (most of my birthdays were spend with families which is great, but not enjoyable without any close friends), Never invited to anything birthdays/celebrations/holidays etc (weather he was busy or not).

When everything blew up with this coronavirus, my mom expressed concern saying that I (20) should consider coming home from my apartment at college to live with her and the rest of my family.

(Let me just mention I am the only one left in my apartment so it’s not even like I’d be getting it from someone else) My brother and sister (both 21) and my dad all live in this same house so me coming home was only going to make their chances of getting it worse (as I work at a grocery store)

I came home and told my mom that I, no matter what, would be going back for my birthday and anniversary so I could celebrate with my boyfriend. A week ago my mom and brother both started to show mild symptoms so we all had to go on complete lockdown so we could wait for the test results to come back. They came back negative and since my mom is still struggling to breath (she thinks she has walking pneumonia) she won’t let me go back to my job even though I’m an essential employee, the store needs me to work, and I need money. This has been very frustrating for me as I won’t get a paycheck at all next week due to having to give up I’ve 35 hours of work. 

I just tried mentioning going back to my apartment so that I don’t risk infecting the entire family and so I can separate myself from the family for a while and my mom is completely bent out of shape because of it.

I'm posting this from a throwaway account just to be careful. I don't think this breaks any of the rules of this subreddit but please let me know if it does, or if there's a more appropriate place to post this. I'm also not sure if NSFW applies, but it involves child abuse and threats of violence, so I thought I should just be careful.

About 3 weeks ago I moved into a new apartment in a new town. For the most part things have been really good, except the woman who lives across the hallway from me. My landlord told me on the first day here that she is a ""real witch with a B"" and that apparently she had phoned him to complain about the fact that my dad's car was parked too close to hers ... although she was in her stall and he was in his. She knew my room number from the stall number so even though she doesn't know me personally, she might still have had it in for me right from the start.

Anyway, I would frequently hear yelling, screaming, and cursing from her room. A few days after I moved in, I was watching a movie on my computer and yet could still hear the noise. It sounded like a child was in distress, so I shut off the volume so I could hear better. From what I heard, the woman was screaming and swearing at a young wailing and sobbing child. She threatened to throw something (not sure if it was the child or an object) out the window. She then sent the child out of the room, slammed the door, and told him that he would be in big trouble when he got ""back up.""

I was disturbed that anyone could treat their child that way, but I wasn't sure whether it would justify informing anyone. I know that CPS can sometimes break up families unnecessarily, or cause the parents to lash out at their kids even more, so I didn't want to act if it wasn't in the best interests of the child. However, after consulting with my parents, my sister, and my landlord (who implied that this is not the first time this has happened), I decided to make the call anyway. I gave them the address and they said they would look into it.

In the intervening weeks I would still hear yelling and swearing on a fairly regular basis, but nothing as concerning as the first episode, until today. I heard the woman screaming outside in the parking lot while the child cried. I went out onto my balcony and peeked over, trying to remain unseen. They were sitting in a parked car, the woman in the front seat and the child in the back, with the woman repeatedly shouting abuse at the child - I distinctly heard her say ""I fucking hate you right now"" to him and complain about him being spoiled and giving her a hard time. Lots of ""how could you treat your own mother, who brought you into the world, this way???"" Keep in mind this kid is all of 4 or 5 years old, I can't imagine what he could have done to make her feel so attacked.

The woman then gets out of the car and reaches into the backseat through the window. Kid starts screaming ""ow!"" and ""stop hurting me!"" It looks like she's grabbing/smacking/trying to choke the kid? At this point - and this is where I might have done something very wrong - I took my phone and started surreptitiously recording. I thought that whereas before I had only a muffled overheard conversation, now I had visual proof of this happening, that could maybe be shown to CPS or the police? I probably should have shouted at her to stop but I was just so scared and also worried that she might take it out on the child.

Now I'm not sure about the legality of me having done this. I know it's wrong to take videos of someone without their consent, but it's more wrong to attack and traumatize your child. I did not put the videos on social media or send them to anyone; they are just on my phone and I am more than willing to delete them if necessary. I thought of instances where racist abusers have been filmed in public and called out/punished based on this, so I thought, wouldn't keeping a video record of it help bring justice to the kid? But maybe I crossed a line here. I don't know.

After this the woman got back into the front seat of the car and continued yelling, threatening to hurt the kid again. Lots more stuff about how the kid is making her life miserable etc. She also said to him ""If you don't like it you can go fucking live somewhere else,"" and that ""if the neighbours don't like it I'll fucking punch them in the teeth."" She also victim-blamed him, saying that she hates to have to do this, but it's necessary due to the way he acts.

They quieted down a little and drove away, and I went back inside to write up an e-mail to my parents asking for advice. (This is my first time living permanently away from home and I still rely on them a lot for guidance and moral support). I wasn't exactly sure how to proceed. So far they haven't responded yet.

Then, about an hour later, the woman comes back. I hear her tromping through the hallway and going into her room, ranting the whole time about how ""the fucking b\*\*\*\* in \[my room number\] can't mind her own business and she's going to get smacked."" She was extremely angry. She came out of her room once or twice more over the next hour or so, saying the same thing and slamming the door loudly. I'd thought she didn't see me, but she must have caught a glimpse. Due to the layout of the apartment it would be extremely easy for her to figure out which room I'm in based on which balcony I was on, and she already has reason to dislike me because of the car thing.

In the moment, I didn't feel scared because of adrenaline, but now it's slowly sinking in how terrified I am. If she can hurt her own child, surely she won't hesitate to hurt me as well. I'm not going to work for the next two days because Sunday is Easter and my boss wants to take Monday off (she said I could work from home), and I got groceries earlier today so I don't \*have\* to leave my room. But I wanted to get some washing done in the laundry downstairs. What if she sees me walking in the hallway and beats me up? What if she attacks me when I'm going to work or coming home on Tuesday? What if she tries to break into my apartment or, idk, stick a flaming match under the door? Maybe these are ridiculous scenarios but I'm just getting so scared.

Overall though, I don't want revenge or anything on her, I want to act in the best way for the child. I don't want to escalate this into a huge scene because she might take her anger out on the son. I'm keeping in mind that he's the true victim of all this, not me. I don't want her to get evicted or go to jail because then that's just going to be worse for the child, isn't it? At the same time, I'm increasingly terrified and don't know what to do. Should I report this to someone? My landlord? CPS? A domestic violence place? Or just keep quiet and avoid her? Am I overreacting to this whole thing? Was I morally or legally wrong to film her? Will she be able to use that against me, ex. sue me for it or something?

Please help me out, Reddit. I know this might be too heavy a subject matter for this subreddit, but if it is, please please please let me know where I can post. I'm a very meek/shy person by nature and I'm really scared. Every sound is making me jumpy.

285,"My friend group consists of three other girls whose names I will change. For the sake of context, I'm 22 years old, and the rest of my friends are 21/22

Ally: my best friend who I've known since fifth grade. We moved schools after fifth grade but kept in touch and hang out all the time.

Julia: friend I met in sixth grade

Cassie: friend I met in sixth grade but didn't actually befriend until freshman/sophomore year of high school.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most approachable person. I have a resting-bitch-face and, because of some classic childhood trauma, I come off kinda cold and closed off to people meeting me for the first time. I have a hard time empathizing, but it's something my therapist and I are working on, and I've gotten a lot better at it. Baby steps, I suppose.

I introduced Ally to Cassie and Julia maybe a year after graduation because I was tired of having to choose which group to hang out with. Thankfully, they all hit it off and soon we were all planning regular meetups ad having fun. We were perhaps 19/20 around this time.

Then things changed. I would be hanging out with Allie and the other two would be blowing up her phone, while mine stayed silent. Julia would cancel plans with me because ""oh Cassie and Ally just showed up at my place and we're gonna go out"". Their snapchat stories would have the three of them hanging out without me.

I confided in Ally about this and she apologized and said I should tell the others, which I held off on for a while. Ally did start hanging out with me more often and inviting me out, which felt nice. Even if I couldn't go, it just felt nice to be invited, y'know? To be thought of.

And then a pattern started to form. Every time something happened in someone's lives, I was finding out from someone else.

""You know Ally broke up with her boyfriend right? Oh... she didn't tell you?""

""You were with us when Julia told us this right? ... Oh, nevermind.""

I'd gone from the friend in the center who introduced everyone to being a spectator.

One night we all had a sitdown and I brought up my issue. I told them I felt like the ""backup friend"" and that they only came to me when someone else had canceled on them. I told them I felt forgotten and left out.

They said they were sorry and said the reason they had left me in the dark was because I was distant, because they thought I didn't care, and... ouch. That hurt. Like I said, I'm not great at empathizing. I have a hard time responding to the emotions of others. But in the past when things happened, ad they *did* come to me, I always gave them my true, heartfelt advice. I stayed up with Julia until 5AM after she got cheated on, I took Cassie out to dinner after a bad test for her major. I know I'm not great with emotions but I am *trying*, and to hear this was a gut-punch.

So things were better for awhile but then things slipped back into the old routine. But then I noticed something else.

Our birthdays.

For the last two years, everyone's birthdays have been treated as a momentous occasion. Ally has a surprise party (that *I hosted*), and then we took her to dinner that weekend. Cassie and Julia each got two parties because their birthdays are close to each other.

Me?

Julia came with my dad, my stepmom, and I to my favorite restaurant.

Ally canceled because she was fighting with Julia at the time.

And Cassie canceled because she failed a test that morning.

... seriously?

I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do. I've been struggling with my depression more than usual lately and I haven't gotten a single phone call; not even a text from three of the most important people in my life. On top of all this, my ED is coming back full swing and I've no one to confide in anymore. I feel like I'm losing all of my support. I'm not even sure if I had the support to begin with.

I love these girls, they're my family. I'm just not sure if I'm theirs.

286,"I really am no longer happy in our relationship, and although there are still good moments between us, I still am having a hard time offering the level of commitment she would like out of me, and I'm not fulfilled in this relationship. I feel awful about this, as this is her first relationship and she is head over heels in love with me in an immature-ish way, and I don't want to break her heart and be the first person to dump her. She is a sensitive soul, and I do really truly care about her, and that's what really sucks about this. I just feel especially awful bc she has been struggling with her mental health, and as a result of this, she requires a lot of reassurance about our relationship. I have constantly given this reassurance to her and told her that everything is fine when it isn't.... and that was really shitty of me. She needs a lot of reassurance and I just feel really bad because I have given that time and time again with no hesitation and I didn't even realize that I was giving false hope of a future with us together by doing that... I was just trying to make her feel loved and it makes me feel so bad man. I hate upsetting her, and I know this would really hurt her and not help with the current state of things in the world. I also feel like I have been putting this off way too long, and the longer I wait, the worse it will hurt in the future. I just really do not want to be the reason she suffers, and I know the relationship means way more to her than it does to me and that sucks really bad and makes me feel like shit.

TL;DR, I am having a strong desire to leave my current relationship, but I don't want to break my sensitive and inexperienced girlfriends heart after she opened up to me about depression.

287,"So I (23M) take care of my brother (17M) who's still in highschool, along with our mom and my sister.  (25F) 

So to make this as simple as possible, pretty much the 4 of us have been on quarantine for the past couple of weeks and no ones really been leaving the apartment. Sister is wanting to go over to her boyfriend's house for a week or so because his parents will be out of town. (Which normally wouldnt be a problem at all) However, her boyfriend works in a very high risk area where hes exposed to many possible ways to catch the coronavirus. Plus he recently found out that someone in the facility he works at had recently been diagnosed with it.

Now, under any other circumstance this wouldnt be a problem. It's her life, it's her choice. The only red flag is, is that our mother lives with us and she doesnt have a good immune system AT ALL so if she were to be exposed to the virus in even the slightest way she would most likely become infected.

Sister doesn't see a problem with any of this and the potential hazards and risks. So I told her (being the one who supports and overall head of the household since I'm the one who pays the bills) that if she wants to go over there, then she has to stay over there until this whole thing blows over. However long that may take. She made a big deal out of it and became a bit hostile... long story short, I just want to know if I'm in the wrong.

294,"Before I go into detail, I love and accept everyone in the LGBTQIA community. Ever since I was 15, I began to discover that I was lesbian (romantically) but also asexual. My family is Christian by the way, and conservative. Ever since then, I began to hate myself for being gay because I know my family would not accept it.. and where I live, homosexuality is NOT very well tolerated and considered taboo. I'm not religious, by the way. I grew up thinking that you only had to be a certain way and be like the other people in our society. About 3 years went by (I turned 18) and I worked up the courage to come out to my parents as a lesbian because I figured they would not mind since I was an adult. Of course, that did not go well. They began to stop talking to me or do any activities with me anymore. I'm an introvert, so I have no friends outside of the internet to talk to, just my other gay male best friend. Because I want to please my parents and want them to accept me, I have this mindset that I cannot love anyone anymore and I have a hatred toward gay/lesbian people.. but in a different sense. I became obsessed with who/how I am, but in a disgusting way. I developed gender dysphoria, I wish to be a straight male so I can fit in. I fell into depression because of my body. I nearly cry myself to sleep every night. I felt like I was a man trapped in a female body. I've always like doing 'manly' things, I was forced to put on a dress and smile for the camera while I wanted to wear a tuxedo or work outside instead of the kitchen. But at the same time, that is not possible. My mind won't believe that there are ways to change your gender through hormone medicine and surgery because of my past and family, the way our society has shaped me. My family would not support me if I decided to become the opposite gender. I stopped taking care of myself because of the mirror or looking at myself, that I was gay and revolting.

318,"Hi all,

So Im really nervous and don't exactly know how to start this, so bare with me. 

When I was 13 I was sexually assaulted by a boy who was 17 who some of my older friends had pushed me to try to date. Even then at 13 I knew how fucked that age difference was. And so when he assaulted me it was pretty aggressive because I had adamantly denied him before. Luckily it was interrupted before it became rape. I told my friends at the time and no one believed me the 2 who did told me it wasn't his fault because he was high. I basically had the worst reactions possible from people and so I shoved it far away. I think it really impacted me though. I wouldn't hug people, even my dad for a year straight. I became totally opposed to the idea of developing new connections. Im 26 now and only have just begun dating, my sexual intimacy with men has been absolutely non existent (i've had experiences with women though, just experimentation wise and because i felt safer). 

However with starting to date and also starting to connect to new people for sake of friendships I find myself having the intense urge to want to tell people, and possibly too quickly. I think this is for 2 main reasons. The first is I never processed it and people never believed me, so I think after all this time my brain finally wants that support. That person to say ""I hear you and I believe you."" I think the second reason I truly want the people Im starting to build friendships with to know is because i see how it impacts my personality sometimes and I've had people get angry at me in the past for coming off as ""Secretive"" when it just that I wasnt ready to share. For instance I probably have a nightmare every week related to it in some way, and will cry or talk in my sleep. I've had a person ask me, whose house I stayed over, what the nightmare was about when they woke me up, and I didn't want to say and it was just one example of a how this has impacted my life. Another is I still get nervous going past certain parts of town he frequented. If I smoke A LOT of weed I have psychosomatic seizures because the last time I got incredibly stoned I got assaulted, so I typically don't smoke. I love hugs but got so used to not doing them after the initial incident that I typically want the other person to initiate it, because i feel like I've lost the confidence to approach people. Etc. These are just some examples. Anyways recently I was talking to someone I have been building a friendship with, and we've talked about some deep topics, and I found mylself hinting at the fact that there was something I want to share but just not yet. In our most recent text I expressed that im glad we are talking and that I would share this thing with a bit more of time, but I know its something I want to share because it impacts a part of my personality and it would help someone better understand certain parts of me.

I instantly regretted hinting at this.  I've only been talking to this person for 2 weeks. Idk what came over me or what to do. And I was left on read after which has my anxiety pretty high. My question is less about this person , though I would like to have advice on what I do moving forward. But it's more so about how i approach this with anyone. With new friends and old friends. When is the right time to tell people? Is it weird I want to? I hate that I want to. It makes me feel like it holds power over me, but at the same time I find myself hinting at it without even thinking about it. I am going to therapy for this btw. I just, idk, I want to say the fucking words out loud to someone I connect with and I want them to believe me because i never had that, and I'm afraid im moving to fast but after 13 years it feels all of a sudden hard to wait.

Ugh, sorry for the long post. I just am incredibly overwhelmed.

TLDR: I was assaulted at 13. Told people. They didn't believe me and the few that did excused it away due to being friends with the guy. Ive started dating and trying to connect/make new friends and all of a sudden I have this intense urge to tell people, but I think Im telling them too quickly and hinting at it w/o saying it is weirding people out and I dont know what to do moving forward.",12Apr2020,1

320,"So long story short i dated this girl for about a year I've  known her for 4 and she introduced me to some of my other friends i have now. Fast forward things didn't work out and I duped her and have now mostly gotten over the whole thing. 

Problem is now we have mutual friends which isn't to much of a challenge as my ex has basically become a recluse if she wasn't already before and never leaves the house except for work. There are two one guy and a girl we all got super close i think the guy will get it that we are over and I really do mean it when I say I never want to see her again but the girl i know will throw a bit of a tantrum. 
She kinda did this the first time i broke up with my ex and I know for a fact that if she finds out shes gonna flip out.


So my question is this 

I'm done with my ex but I still want to keep the two friends I have. I feel that its at least worth it to try but how do I get them especially the girl to understand. 

Seeing her is just going to cause me so much pain and if my mutual friends have to go too then I guess fine but 

I seriously just need some advice here i only have three friends and idk if i can handle being any more isolated than i feel right now. Please help",12Apr2020,1
321,"I just need help. Lately I’ve been feeling so depressed and awful and confused about my appearance and I just don’t know what to do.
The thing is, I sometimes take selfies closeish to my face and in good lighting and I am okay with them, and I like them, but then in bad lighting and from far away I can take a picture and I look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, and disgusting. I genuinely don’t know what to do because i’m scared that people are looking at the pics that I know look disgusting.
What i’m trying to say is, I feel pretty because I can take nice selfies sometimes, but then if I take a picture in weird lighting and from far away  I look completely different and that makes me feel upset and confused again. Basically in all pictures of me I look different and it’s just making me crazy. I don’t know which one everyone else sees. 

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to “ask”, but I just needed to rant somewhere. And I also did not mean for this to be an “am I ugly” post, but I just wanted advice to get over my obsession with how I look. 
SO, does anyone have any advice to just kind of accept things how they are? Because I can’t seem to get over my appearance and how different I look sometimes.

325,"This girl we'll call E and I (F17) were the best of friends for several years, all throughout middle and high school. We were inseparable, we could tell each other anything and people often remarked how in sync we were. We never fought once and she was the deepest connection I've ever had with another person. I really really REALLY loved E (and at this point maybe even as more than friends). It was always us against the world, as we didn't really have friends outside of each other. I had also moved away and back to the city E and I live in around 4 times in 5 years due to family issues, and our bond never stopped as we'd text everyday too. 

Fast forward to me at 16, I ended up saving 15k and going abroad as an exchange student. Upon that trip many mental issues I had began to quickly fester and I had an overwhelming urge to isolate from everyone and everything, and I ended up blocking her for 5 months with no notice or reason. I thought of her every single day in that time but had convinced myself she wanted nothing to do with me and I was doing her a favour due to my toxic nature of wanting to self destruct and isolate. Eventually 5 months later I caved and messaged her, in which we reconciled, however very awkward. Things were never the same but I accepted that as I was the one who caused it and fucked up. Very quickly as we continued to talk for a couple of weeks (a lot less than what was our usual daily), she'd talk about all of her new friends, etc, and I got incredibly jealous. I was possessive of her and I hated it. I never acted on any of these feelings and was quite happy she found friends as we are both loners. She's really easily manipulated and I began to fear I might manipulate E to destroy her relationships or worse so I began to distance myself once again.

 3 months later I couldn't stand no contact (though keep in mind she wasn't blocked, she just never reached out to me in that time), and I tried to reconcile once more. I wasn't necessarily better mentally but was more under control, in which I explained to E my reasons for constantly dropping in and out of her life. We maintained a borderline friendship, closer to being acquainted, for quite a while after up until the last few months, where she won't answer my messages for days (despite being online and me knowing for a fact shes talking to other people), and when she does we can barely exchange 3 without her disappearing and not answering for another few days.

 I guess I'm starting to get the hint to fuck off, and I understand I fully deserve it, but how the fuck do I get over her? E was the fucking love of my life. I used to say she was my ""friend soulmate"". It doesn't help that I have no friends and also feel horrible that it feels like she's moved on to better people and things and I'm stuck alone because I'm an insufferable piece of trash.

332,"I [20F] live in michigan. I hate the weather. Winters are terrible and you're basically stuck indoors for months. I love the outdoors so much and winters make me feel locked up and I can't do the things I like. Even the little things like bicycling, walking..

I've researched multiple coastal states (I absolutely love the beach) and california stood out to me most because of the climate. Little rain, warm winters.. the idea of having access to the outdoors year round..

For some perspective, I visit Lebanon (i am lebanese) in the summers and it is very similar to california in both weather and geography. I LOVE it there. I feel like my entire mood changes. Lots of nature, beaches, palm trees, no rain, etc. Were it not for the shitty living conditions and political climate I would defnitely want to move there.

I want to move there for graduate school and stay there. Find a job there, find love there, grow old and retire there. I would however be leaving my entire family, friends, whatever social connections I have here, to go somewhere I don't know anyone and in a place I am unfamiliar with. The thought of staying in Michigan my whole life though is just so depressing.

I'm not sure if I'm romanticizing California too much, and that life will remain about the same as it is now when I go there. I'm not sure if I'll have the improved mood (like I do in lebanon) for a month or so and then just get used to it and go back to how I was in Michigan. Or if I'll get lonely and depressed if I can't make any new friends and find people to have fun with.

If I wasn't leaving everything behind it would be worth the risk for me, but I don't want to make the move and sacrifice that much only for me to end up not having a good experience.

I won't be leaving for grad school until 2022 so it sounds like I have a lot of time to think about it, but i actually need to make up my mind soon (requirements of programs in California differ from the ones here, so I'd need to take certain classes, etc).

I know some of you might say to just go and that if I don't like it I can come back. My issue is that my parents are 100% against me moving so much that if I do go, it will permanently strain our relationship. I kid you not I would have to plan my entire move in secret. I think it's worth it if I end up liking California, but if i don't and want to come back, I will have strained our relationship for nothing. This might seem weird to you but I come from a very complicated family situation, so, trust me ..

334,Hi everyone. Recently I met a guy online and he's really sweet and we get along great most of the time. Unfortunately he keeps asking for nudes and gets angry when I tell him I'm not comfortable sending them. (I'm a 20y/o female btw) I've been telling him no for about 5 months now and i guess maybe I should give in and he'll stop asking yk? Sometimes he hurts my feelings with this but he says it's not important he just wants to see me and appreciate me etc but if it's not important why does he keep coming back to this? All our conversations have been strictly online and we've never met face to face(he lives in another country). I know his behaviour is kinda toxic and i see the signs. He says he loves me a lot but I've never said it back.(How do you love someone you've never even videocalled with? How can you be certain we can even have a good conversation irl? Or maybe that's just me...) He says he can't videocall but he sends pictures of himself and voicenotes. We talk almost everyday and it's great but we always fight about nudes... he says it's unfair that he sends me his nudes but I don't care enough to send mine...I always tell myself I'm going to stop texting/gradually distance myself from him but everytime he texts i go back to him and make the same mistake again and then we argue and I distance myself for a few days... But I always go back. How do I stop making the same mistake over and over again? I need to break this cycle :'(,12Apr2020,2

336,"Basically, I've been reaching out to people on Linkedin and networking my ass off for the past 2-3 months or so, literally just pushing my luck trying to talk to people at big tech companies that hold high positions so i can have my name on their radar.

I (F 22) recently got a connection request from a Vice President of the nations biggest investment bank (idk if im allowed to name-drop). Like, their assets are in the trillions of dollars. Naturally, i was *ecstatic!* I quickly accepted and sent him a message asking if I could have 20 minutes of his time to chat about what he does. He said he unfortunately had to sign an NDA, but could talk to me about any other thing I'd like. No uneasy flags yet; but looking back it probably was. Anyway, I push on (really wanting to talk to this guy and maybe get a referral eventually) and tell him what else i'd like to speak to him about.

That's when it gets a little uncomfortable for me. It's like a 180. He made a weird comment about my physical appearance and also an awkward comment about my behavior. This was in a string of messages.

I feel so upset about this and don't know what to do. I haven't replied to him either. I've read articles on this happening to women, but I literally have no job and don't know if this could be a way to get one. I never thought I'd be in the position of a man having authority over me in the sense that if i do something wrong (like ghost him or unconnect), it may bite me in the ass if I ever want to apply to their company. It was never a company on my radar, banks &amp; corporate weren't on my radar either, but what should i do? Should I just move one and ghost like many women say to do? Or should I do this call with him and risk him being creepy and hitting on me, but maybe getting a referral? That makes me feel so gross and grimy bc i don't believe in that behavior, but am I really one to shut down a possible job at a big company? I know this is long. I'm sorry.

353," Basically, I have an Arab father who likes to over react. I also have a sensitive brother that likes to over react and make the world out of every small thing I do. I am 14. He is 16. My father is 60. I have an older brother as well who is 29. I was messing around with my brother In my room, as siblings are meant to do. He doesn’t really like to be “touched”, and by that I mean just poking him in his arm makes him “uncomfortable”. Now I know I may sound stupid okay. 

I am looking for real advice here, it doesn’t matter how insane or sane it seems. So I accidentally hit him in his manhood. I’m thinking, so what; it happens. Just get over it and make the best out of life. Where I live, we have a guest house where there is a small man-cave that has a pool table, a cooler, stuff like that with a tv. It also has a lounge area for when guests come over so that they can feel comfortable. 

I come from a blood cut Arab family that strongly believe in formality and “being the best out of all your friends”. By the way, my brother usually starts these altercations with me, just he’s the first to tell my parents and he makes a huge deal out of it. Not only that, but when we get into “real” fights (doing what brothers do) he usually starts acting like he’s in so much pain and that the world is ending. I’m fine, not crying, nothing. I’m not trying to sound like “oh mr. Tough guy” I’m just looking for someone to help me. 

This usually gives him the upper hand when my parents decide what they’re gonna do; for example usually I get my phone service off for a couple weeks and a beating. Like an actually beating; my dad gets a belt and hits me across the back and the face. Today, the same thing happened except this time my brother said what happened almost 20 times; I’m being dead serious. He makes this huge deal out of it. He never says what he did. How he hit me and kept on coming in my room and jumping on my bed. 

Mind you, he’s 5’10 and 200 pounds. Not to be offensive, but he’s on the chubbier side. Even when I’m just texting my cousin, he comes in my room and messes up all of my stuff. (Sorry for getting off track, just some background info, now back to the story) Right now I am shaking and pacing back and forth typing as fast as I possibly can. 

So I accidentally hit him, he runs to my dad and tells him “he grabbed my d***” when that is not true. See now my dad is mad and confused, and anything I say will just fuel that. If I even yell “that’s not true” he’s not gonna stop and say “so explain”. My dad is now an angry Arab (according to my black and Hispanic friends that is worse than what they have experienced) who has a leather belt who’s ready to hit/destroy anything and everything. 

He goes to the main house and speaks with my mother and my brother (thank God). I thought it was over, or he cooled down. NOPE. He got more angry. This time he’s threatening me even more, saying these exact things “you’re a weirdo” “you should feel ashamed” “you’re going to go jail for touching someone like that”. First off, it was an accident. I’m not a weirdo. I am a normal 14 year old boy trying to live his best life here in quarantine. I mean sometimes my dad even grabs me by the shirt, almost enough to rip it, and smacks me as hard as he can across the face. 

One time, he made my tooth fall out when I was 8. Another time he busted both of my lips and made both of my cheeks bleed. Right now, I just prayed to God for forgiveness and that he would protect me. So he also said “I’m gonna beat the shit out of you” and “I’m gonna make you bleed”. What truly made me feel like I was trapped inside of my own mind was when he said “you’re a piece of shit”. 

At that moment I prayed to God so fast inside my mind that I swear I had super powers. Right now, it is 12:30 A.M and I’m still here. This happened about 1 1/2 hours ago. Right before he left, he mentioned “stay down here like a dog”. I don’t want to call the cops and call child support mainly because I’m scared of what will happen and I feel like I’m going to be stripped of my dignity and self respect. I’m not sure what to do, or how to prevent this, or why this happens to me. My plan so far is to wait until the middle of the night (1:30 or so) and try and come into the house without him waking up or realizing I’m there. The only issue is I’m probably going to go straight to bed and be asleep by the time he wakes up. 

Then, he’s gonna beat the shit out of me while I’m still asleep. Thankfully, I still have my phone service so that I can type this. My other plan is to go inside and wake up extra early before him, that way I can escape the Beating. Right now, I’m 100% sure that my computer, Xbox, and video games are taken away. All that matters is that I am typing this right now. See, I don’t really want to sleep here all night. If you guys could PLEASE give me some advice, that would be great. It doesn’t have to be huge, just please. I am begging you. It doesn’t matter how old you are. From one human being to another I am asking for a little of help.",12Apr2020,8
354,"Self diagnosed? Sure but hear me out

Currently finishing my sophomore year of college, (M20), and was looking for some advice on dealing with what I’ve classified as some sort of new social anxiety I developed. 

Quick backstory- had numerous health relationships thru hs, went to college and -literally nothing.  I started correcting my diet, exercising, then a friend from hs decided to give me some Xanax one night, (I had no idea even what they did, just it would chill me out) and then I was addicted for 3 months before managing to pull myself out of it. 


-For those who don’t know, getting off benzodiazepines is pretty fucked. I don’t remember these months and my memory is still recovering. I believe I have been experiencing rebound anxiety 


Unfortunately sobriety has also given me considerable anxiety- I used to never stress, I smoke so occasionally paranoid but nothing like this- I still get Invited to parties and social events regularly thanks to my friend group, but I feel like a social pariah. 


Literally the idea of randomly chatting with an equally intoxicated stranger stops me dead and I kinda just wander around aimlessly. My confidence literally evaporates for no reason, it’s kinda messed up. I basically gave myself a fucking anxiety disorder

So yeah, now that I’m stuck home all day, why not self-improve...

She wants time for herself, but her family always tell her to do something and her friends always texted her because she's like the advice girl and they just like her company. 

So her family is really big and she has to take care of her siblings and have to do chores too.  She been stressed about this for a while and just doesn't know what to do. She tied to tell her siblings to try to not make a big mess, but her siblings really don't listen. 

With her friends, she said that her friends always text her and she feels like she doesn't really have alone alone time. Actually, last week she told everyone that she wasn't going to text them for a couple days  and me too. Then two days ago, she asked me if we could call the next day. She said that she wanted to check on me. Then I told her that it was  what she wants because I wanted to call her, but she'll be on her phone and she said that she didn't want that so after I said that she started crying and saying that she feeling like she is letting everyone down with the people who need her and me down and everything. I told her that she is not at all and then she agreed. Then the next day she was telling me that she is still stressed and even her laying down was making her stressed and she had many mental breakdowns that day and she was overthinking about how she was letting other down again and she was overthinking about me and she thinks that I think that I want to broke up with her because of her overthinking. She said she didn't like that she had a routine everyday and she said that she's not having a good time with the  alone time she having and she misses her friends. She tries to do something new and she doesn't like. She just feel unhappy.

360,"Hi,

This is gonna be a bit of a random and all over the place rant. Quarantine has given me a lot of time to myself to think, and I think for many (like myself) has realized a bit of loneliness. Through this, I realized I am a bit lonely as a person. School got cancelled for the rest of the year, and through this time I've been thinking that who knows how much of a senior year I'll have. This has led me to reflect on the last 3 years, and I feel as though I have wasted them. At school, I would say I am likable and I am on good terms with most people I know personally. I have very few close friends, who I wouldn't trade others. However, beyond them, I have no other friends really. I feel like everyone I know (regardless of social status) at school has multiple people they talk to. I have a bit of anxiety/social anxiety (and have had it the whole time), so at times I do come off a bit awkward and I am very shy at first. Because of this, I've had a hard time to connect to anyone beyond the acquainting level. Even on my sports teams. I've been acquainted with certain classmates/teammates but I have had a really hard time connecting to anyone beyond that level, and developing friendships. I have my friends for support, but when we don't talk I just feel a bit lonely. I don't hang out with anyone really. I only really talk to people at school in person, and this whole thing has left me to realize this. Aside from that, I feel like I set such high standards for myself in HS that I never met those standards. I feel as though I have just gone by. I barely felt like I've really started to be myself. I just feel like time has gone by so fast that I've just been left unsatisfied. I know highschool isn't like the movies, but I'm just sad I've spent majority of the time procrastinating and being sad, even with myself. I feel like I didn't have that experience that most people have, I just feel like I've just gone about my years living routinely. I'd go to school, then home, then sports if I had it that day. On weekends, I see my friends sometimes. I've just kinda gone by routinely. I just feel like I haven't done it enough. Like I spent this time and the beginning of my youth being lazy and alone. I feel like I haven't had too many fun young memories to look back on. I feel like I spent the last 3 years being judgy with myself, and pressuring myself to be in the moment and take it all in, when it all has gone by so fast. I just feel like at my eventual highschool reunion I'm going to have no one to talk to because I never was super close with beyond a few people, or when I talk to others and they all have fun stories and memories I'm just gonna kinda be 'eh' and not really see it as a particular time. I don't know why, but I almost feel guilty watching shows/movies about highschool knowing I have wasted this whole time. I really don't know how to get over this guilt and see it from a different perspective, move on that this wasn't the experienced I'd imagined myself having, and I just to feel better over it all. It's a bit hard for me to be positive when I have this random guilt. Any advice/insight is appreciated.",12Apr2020,2

The reason I stopped eating meat is because when I was like 9 or 10 years old I saw a goat getting slaughtered and it was crying. After seeing that, I stopped eating meat, fish and eggs altogether.


I start getting thoughts that I should start eating it again whenever I come across those sushi, chicken wings and other food type asmr videos. Then when I actually think about how the animal will be slaughtered I nope out.

At this point, I've sent nudes to 4 different boys from bumble/tinder. They all have reciprocated and it's been through snapchat or face time, so I don't think there was any screenshoting. I also keep my face out of the nudes, except for on the face time calls.

At first I thought I was doing it because I wanted validation after the break up. But now, I really do enjoy it. Honestly, I wouldn't mind dating most of these boys either. However they either live too far, are not ready for relationships, or have ghosted me. 

Usually, I don't feel bad about sending them. Considering my face is not in most of them and I'm almost certain my snaps weren't saved, I feel fine about it.

Please help me make a decision!",12Apr2020,3
392,"Thank you in advance for anyone who reads through this. 

I am [24Y], 10 weeks pregnant and currently contemplating abortion. When I initially found out I was pregnant, I was over the moon happy. It was unexpected but I had the biggest smile on my face when I saw the pregnancy test come back positive. I also had my first ultrasound a week ago and my partner and I heard it’s heartbeat so we’re inevitably attached. 

Now, the further I am along and the more I think about how the pregnancy is going to affect me, my life and my partner, I can’t shake the feeling of wanting to abort the baby considering everything that is going on. 

My boyfriend and I have been together 11 months. He is very supportive and loving, so it has nothing to do with him. He’s willing to give me the emotional support I need if I want to go through with it. But what do I do? Will it benefit us or not? This baby is a piece of us and I’m having a hard time thinking of ending it’s life. If I go through with the abortion, I know I eventually want a child with him down the line when we’re more prepared. 

And that’s where my indecisiveness lies. I feel unprepared. I’ve always been a planner. My goal was to have a secure job, consistent flow of good income, have my degree, live in a comfortable home and be married before I have a child. And overall, pursue my dreams that require a lot of attention. 

Instead, I just hit the 6 month mark at my workplace. It’s a dream working there but I only make $11.25 right now. And with the corona pandemic, it’s making it harder to save for the baby. My other half got laid off completely, so right now I’m the main source of income until who knows when. To add to the stress, we’re currently working on paying off multiple loans.  

As for my degree, I was overwhelmed at the time of my last enrolled semester and decided to drop out. I  was taking Biology and I couldn’t perform the way I wanted to given my outside circumstances. I am close to done though and only have 1 or 1.5 years left of classes left. Still, I don’t have my degree at this point in time. 

Then my current living condition is only suitable for a couple. We live in a 450sq unit. We’re supposed to extend it out but my partners dad is the one supporting us financially to do it. With the lockdown, we haven’t gotten to getting the construction materials, so the project is on hold. It’s making me anxious because it’s not practical for a family or at least yet. 

In terms of my dreams, I have so many that having a baby might slow it down. Such as saving to open up a business, investing in a property or better home, and it’s silly but running in a pageant that requires that I have no children (but it was something I was working on before - I have a coach and everything.) 

The hardest part of it all is how many people know and are being as supportive as possible. We’ve told our moms, my stepdad, my partners dad, my grandma, our siblings, closest friends, and co workers. Currently I haven’t told my dad or stepmom because my partner and dad haven’t been seeing eye to eye lately. My dad was in the wrong but he’s too stubborn to apologize. But it’s affecting me because I always wanted him to be the first to know his only girl is having a baby. Overall, I can’t imagine how much it would hurt them. Who do I tell or do I let them think it was a miscarriage? 

I feel stuck. And what’s making it more difficult is where I live, Guam. We have no planned parenthood or abortion clinics on island. I’d have to fly out to Hawaii which would costs over $1000, plus I wouldn’t even know what to tell my work and if I’d even get approved for leave given our strict leave/absence policies. Also, the quarantine might make it so I can’t fly out anyway. I saw abortionrx and abortionpills247 as options but I’m worried with where I live and possible mail complications, I’ll receive the pills too late and waste $300.

He would do the normal sibling stuff like call me names and diss the stuff I liked, but he would also diss me for being a girl, the ""weaker"" sex. He would physically hurt me then jeer me for crying, to the point of me feeling worse for crying. He were completely estranged and our ages weren't even double digits yet. As we got older I wanted to be close to him. I was lonely and hated having a bad relationship with a family member. I worked really hard and grew up to meet his level and around 13 I fixed us. Now I'm 16 and we're just about best friends. We are super close and and the past is left in the past. 

Not only did this occur while I was growing up, but In the 4th grade I was home schooled, and held back for failing math. This crushed my self esteem as a kid and it never quite recovered. I didn't have any help and I was lectured by both parents a \*lot\* for not ""trying hard enough."" It got the the point that home schooled me was doing math for about 2-3 hours a day just trying to figure it out with little to no help, as my younger brother required more attention than me. As years went on it got worse. I got tested for a learning disability when I entered 9th grade at a public school. Turns out I have one. For math. All the sudden my parents switched their tune, ""oh we knew there was something wrong"" ""Oh you can do it you just have to try harder"" Nothing was ever good enough for them and once they finally found out I had a problem it was as if the years of emotional strain they put on me didn't exist.

Finally things were cooled down and alright. It wasn't like we had daily fights about it anyways. The past is in the past. You see, the main theme along here is: The relationship was bad, and it really hurt me, but I put it behind me because I wanted to keep a good happy relationship with my family, I couldn't blame them. It was always my fault. Somehow. I love them and they love me. But some of the things they've done really hurt me. Their actions affected me and changed me growing up. They're things I now have to deal with in therapy. I don't want to blame them or hold a grudge, but I can't blame myself. So I'm stuck being hurt by their past actions while simultaneously getting upset with myself for ""holding on."" **How do I get over the hurdles I have with myself, that they placed there, without ""drudging up"" the past?**",12Apr2020,2

399,"Me (20) and my wife (18) need some advice. We just had our baby just last week and we are currently living at my wifes mothers house while we wait for my mom to get done finishing the basment floor so we can move in there. The issue we have is whether or not we should move into her home sooner. The plan was to move into my mothers 6 to 8 weeks after my wifes recovery. Now we are thinking about it because my wifes parents argue a lot at night because our baby has some medical issues and her parents lost a baby with medical issues so its affecting them plus some financial issues. Her parents had drank quite often, but her mother has stopped drinking to help us and we are proud of her for that. My wifes dad still drinks and then argues with her so that doesn't help her mom at all. It in turn disturbs the baby's sleep which disturbs my wife's sleep so then nobody is getting any sleep and is a very stressful situation. Another reason we are not sure if we want to move in sooner is because of this whole coronavirus thing going on we don't really want to travel with her anywhere. Our baby is on oxygen right now. At her moms nobody has to out into public for work. Along with the whole corona thing going on my sister works at dominos and interacts with people, and my father works out at a mine and they both still regularly go to work so we aren't sure if we should risk moving in there if they still have jobs they are going to. My wife also had a c-section so she is still in very early recovery of that and my parents have stairs which would be difficult for her to walk up and down. One of the pros of us staying at my wifes parents is it helps her cope because of the familiarity after she had quite a traumatic c-section but she is under a lot of stress so we can't figure out which situation would be better for us and the baby. 


   TL;DR Need to decide if we want to move with my parents sooner, wifes parents fight a lot along with being alcoholics,  and my sister and dad still go to work, my moms has stairs which are hard to walk up and down due to c section to where her parents only have like 2, her parents lost a baby due to medical issues and our baby has medical issues. And the baby we just recently had is on oxygen.",12Apr2020,1
400,"Okay, a little bit of a long story for this one. 

My girlfriend has OCD, which mainly manifests in things being done a very specific way. We’ve had little spats about me getting used to her things, possibly seeing a counselor, etc. We had a pretty big fight a few weeks ago because I was home sick and left a package of strawberries on the counter, fell asleep, and when she came home she was fuming mad about it. After that I told her that i needed time to fully adjust to everything (we’ve been together less than a year) and if she corrects me instead of always getting mad and accusing me of not caring, i could work on it constructively instead of feeling belittled.  

We recently let our cat into our bedroom. we make sure to cover our bed fully so she doesn’t touch the sheets, as it’ll make my partner itchy. I was home today while she worked, and when we were getting into bed she made a comment about how our cat must’ve been in the sheets because she itched. 

i’m trying to think of when she would’ve gotten in since i was home all day, talking out loud to myself and realized it was probably when i left for about an hour for some errands. we agree to shut our bedroom door when one of us leaves, that’s that. 

then i see her vague-posting about me on her tumblr, saying ‘silence is better than bullshit’ and how she ‘won’t argue about something that bothers me in a way others don’t understand.’ i was completely floored, i hadn’t said anything about her being wrong or arguing that the cat WASNT in the bed, i full on admitted it was most likely when i wasn’t around and agreed on a habit change to help it not happen again. 

i confront her about it, and she says i had a ‘disgusted and angry face’ while i was talking, so that must mean i was trying to argue with her about it and discounting her OCD (she didn’t say that last part, but it was SUPER implied by what she posted.) even after i tried explaining that all i had done was retrace my steps, she goes silent, turns over in bed, and stays quiet until she falls asleep. 

this has happened before. no matter how many times i’ve told her that i’m more than willing to do things that put her more at ease, and work my butt off to make sure i’m doing them correctly, she always accuses me of secretly hating it and lying to her. i have my own mental illnesses, a few really, so i think i know a little about projection. she hates that she has OCD and has told me before, and it feels like she’s pushing those feelings onto me. but instead of realizing that, she gets genuinely upset and believes herself instead of me that i must be against her in some way over this. am i crazy? what do i do here? 

TLDR; my girlfriend with OCD accuses me of secretly hating her OCD and being disgusted with it, when my words and actions show otherwise. i think she’s projecting how much she dislikes having OCD, and it really hurts me when she accuses me of these things and won’t listen. what do?",12Apr2020,1
401,So I'm 27 female and he's 32 male we have been together 6 years and we have a daughter together. He is currently working and I am not.

However when he has multiple days off together he still refuses to be up and help me. We currently live with his elderly parents as we are trying to save for a house. My issue is even when he has 2 or 3 days off together he dosnt get up and help me with our daughter or anything.

Now I really appreciate what he does and tell him this often all I'm asking is for h to give our daughter breakfast sometimes or look after her so I can have a shower in peace or just some time alone. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to be the only one who does anything? I frankly feel lonely and uncared about. I make sure everything is ready for him for work and make him food and coffee when he needs it but when I talk to him about it he just gets angry and tells me I'm unreasonable and expect to much.

We’ve been together a year and a half, so, I was invited over for breakfast for easter tomorrow. 

Here lies the problem- his extended family is coming over too, who are very old fashioned, and last I was around them I had yet to change my name. I don’t think they know that I have.. 

Obviously i can’t just come out to my SO’s whole family and ruin easter, but... what if they get weird about the name change? or ask why i did? i don’t want to lie, and i know it probably won’t be as big a deal as i worry in my head, but i am a little worried. not to mention, even if they do go along with the new name, it might really hurt to be called “miss (new name)”, as the whole damn point of my new name is to not be associated with my assigned gender at birth... but that’s how they talk. not to mention how they treat the “ladies” different.. kill me

406,"Hey reddit;

I’m not really sure how to work reddit to be honest, I only ever read discussions, but I just need to get my thoughts out there.

I’m 16. And I really really struggle with my body. I have since about year 8ish (around 12). I’m tall, very tall for a girl, exactly 6ft, so I guess that is where it originally stemmed from. I have eaten pretty good all my life and had a really fast metabolism too, until about 14. When I noticed I started to get a little bigger (I was originally very skinny) I started to eat really clean and started to work out at the gym. I have been eating really healthy and working out 4-5 days a week for almost 3 years. And I think that’s why I struggle with myself so much.

Everyone says “If you want to have a beautiful body and love yourself, start working your mind and body”... so why hasn’t it worked for me? I do yoga, I keep organised, I eat clean, I workout, so why hasn’t it worked!? I’m frustrated. I just want to love myself but my hips are getting fatter and so is my stomach. I’ve done everything anyone has ever said to do to achieve self love. 3 years!! I just want to love myself and I can’t. I can’t. I can’t even look at myself without thinking “pig”. I hate my body. And I don’t know what to do.

So any tips or opinions? I just need something.",12Apr2020,2
407,"My roommate and I are both students going into our third year of university. This year was our first year renting out an apartment, however her dad’s name was on the lease and we forwarded everything to him. We live in downtown Toronto, so as students it’s not the easiest to find something anymore affordable than our two bedroom that we have now. The apartment is small, we don’t have a living room, but it’s in the Riverdale area which is quite safe and communal. I really want to stay at least up until December because it’s convenient and close by my work and campus, however my roommate is adamant on moving out and finding a nicer place which usually means more $$. 

Bit of a background on our relationship: 

We have been really close friends since we lived together in res. And you know what they say when you live with your best friend. I am very quiet, introverted and non-confrontational while she isn’t at all. I have a hard time being assertive and standing up for myself quite often. Since we moved in together, I’ve noticed that she’s been supper codependent with me. She gets very territorial if I bring a friend over, and she also is one of those people that requires much attention, whereas for me, I need my space. If I try to ask her to do anything she gets really defensive about it - especially when something doesn’t go her way. She has a bad habit of leaving her laundry in the dryer for weeks and every time I ask she gets angry or petty, so i’ve just been accommodating by putting her clothes in my hamper instead. She is also a polar bear. For most of the winter I’m freezing in my room and have even gotten a cold because she refuses to turn up the heat. She also gets very angry with me when I order in, which I do often don’t get me wrong bc student life. She’ll shame me for eating poorly, spending money/ indulging on food, but I think deep down it comes from an idea that I don’t cook for her or buy groceries instead - but she doesn’t take the initiate herself!! I like to buy my own food, I let her have some of mine most of the time but I think that has convinced her that it’s a communal thing. I’ve acknowledged that I’m not a consistent roommate, there have been times where I’ve left a mess or dishes in the sink or haven’t taken the garbage out, but at times this space has been exhausting and my boundaries aren’t being considered. Everything is “WE need to do this..do that,” until I consider we do something such as scrub the shower, in which she responded with “... YOU can go for it.”

As time gone by, we haven’t had too much conflict, our close and silly friendship has made the best of our relationship recently, but now I dread the idea of us needing to find a new place. The plan was initially to extend the lease until December or the new year. we both had summer plans, but things have changed since COVID-19 and she is adamant on moving out. I want to tell her that by September, it’s best we stay at least for a couple months until everything is back up and running and we have our jobs back. I don’t think it’s ideal to drop a bunch of money on a new place with government funding (that is taxable) because we won’t have much of our own income to sustain ourselves once the school term starts. During the Christmas market time, we’ll have several hours and extra money at hand to rent in December or the new year. I love our area, but she wants to head to the west side and her budget is much more pricier than mine. I want to explain to her that we’re students. We are in Toronto for school. We aren’t always going to get what we want. I think she has this cute ideal to buy a house and decorate and make it our own and “I live with my best friend” blah blah blah. I prioritize my school the most, and this year, that hasn’t really been the case - finding a job and working 4 days a week. Now that I’m settled, I intend on going into a new year without worrying about a new apartment and settling all over again and gaining a new routine. 

I know that she will not want to live without me or by herself. I however, am not opposed to living on my own or a new roommate, but then I’m risking a friendship. I also don’t meet the requirements to take over the lease because I don’t meet the income range and don’t have a suitable co-signer due to personal financial reasons. I’m worried that because her dad’s name is on the lease, that she’ll somehow use it to her advantage and then I’m forced to move to a place solely on her call. I just feel like I won’t win. 

Am I overthinking? Am I being reasonable? What are my alternatives? It’s honestly pathetic that I’m scared of my best friend and how she’ll react and I shouldn’t be, but sometimes my inferiority complex gets the best of me:(",12Apr2020,2

422,"So I'm 15M, turning 16 soon, and I'm literally known as the ""high-pitched kid"" in my school since my voice has always been abnormally high, (like an 8-10 year old) and people would make fun/bully me about it, (High School was suprisingly chill, but early Middle School was HELL) And my vocal cords wouldn't just cooperate with me until recently.

So over past 5 months, whenever I was home alone or no one was around, I would practice trying to talk in deeper voice and now, I can now talk pretty well in a deep voice, the only problem...

How can I start talking in it without people making fun of me/questioning/mentioning it? And it's not a small change in tone, It's going to be REALLY noticeable, as it's a **HUGE** difference. I literally went from high alto/soprano to a low tenor/base. I can still speak in my higher voice, which is why I've gotten away with it so long, even though some people have noticed it's a bit lower than usual.

People are never gonna let me live it down once they find out, *especially* my family and friends. I've been planning to start speaking in it once the Covid situation is over and we go back to school, but I don't know, what should I do?

That said, they've been here way before this blew up.

Her parents used to always say they don't ask her to go out of the house that often(before covid-19) and that she should just go out to so and so's house this one time, and when she points out how often they want to bring her out, her parents flat out deny it and/or start getting mad at other stuff she has done over the years- happens every time she says or does something that upsets them even slightly, and also manages to make my friend think everything that upsets them is her fault, even when her parents just had a bad day(i think once her dad scolded her out of nowhere too for his amusement because after scolding her he was in a better mood), all the while reiterating their sacrifices to her. 

Now, her parents are constantly complaining about her staying cooped up in her room, saying things like "" we should just quarantine her in her room for 14 days, food and all"" . They've also said how she should just talk to them if they have a job for them since that's all she talks about anyway. But then they also complain about how she doesn't play with them, and her mom also commented on how children these days don't know how to speak to people while eating at the dining table, and she was referring only to my friend. They sometimes blackmail?? her by saying how much they had sacrificed for her, and yet she can't do(insert thing they want her to do), and will often say ""see,since we allowed you to do ______, you should be able to do _______ for us too"", which makes my friend feel bad for refusing to do stuff they want to do. My friend has to do physio therapy at home and her parents asked her to do it with them a few times, more recently she didn't want to do it with them(first time she refused) and they started accusing her of not doing her exercises properly in her room, trying to convince her to do them in the living room even though they have seen her do her exercises in her room multiple times. 

They also hate it when they can't monitor what she does and would get really angry if they think she's hiding something. Once she was skyping a couple of friends and ended the call coincidentally when her mother came into her room. Her mom started shouting at her, asking her who she was calling and refusing to believe that my friend isn't hiding something from her. Another time she left her phone in her room and left her room for a while, and her parents found it the perfect opportunity to check her messages in whatsapp to look for ""something"". My friend saw them with her phone and got super annoyed. Her parents said she probably has something to hide she doesn't want them to check her phone, and that as parents they should have access to everything on her phone. My friend decided to get a lock on her whatsapp and all her messages can only be seen by using her thumbprint, and suddenly her parents aren't checking her phone randomly, which they used to do quite often. 

All her relatives support her parents decisions, and would often scold my friend for not doing things her parents want to do, which is usually meeting people. She is basically the black sheep as she was brought up in a different country than the rest of her relatives, leading to more discrimination which i won't mention here. basically, she has to fight against everyone in her family before anyone would listen to her opinions. 

She's getting super frustrated and is nearing the end of her patience. She will often confide in me after all her arguments(relatively daily), and as much as i am ready to type a 30 page essay on how she is a great person and that many people love her, i don't think it's healthy for her to think about killing her self this often. Her parents are also a reason why all our close friends and a SUPER CARING teacher suspect she has depression (showing some common symptoms of depression) and has been visiting the school counsellor(until school got cancelled). 

The whole covid-19 thing is also making things extra stressful and with major exams coming up this year she's becoming more suicidal. She can't schedule therapy sessions as they're all online and as long as her parents are home, they can hear what she is doing in her room and scold her for having depression again(they have done this before), or want to see what she's doing, making it nearly impossible to get therapy. Are there things she can do to make the whole situation more bearable, and as her friend what support can i give her?",12Apr2020,2
428,"Summary: as a kid I discovered at a too young age that my father is deep into rather pervert/ extreme SM. I’m worried that my nephews (4 and 5 yo) could be exposed to similar discoveries and it messes with their sexuality. Also I have an inner fear of whatever double life my dad lives/d. I don’t know how to approach the situation. Any advice?


Background: I’m f, 38 yo. My childhood was very happy until the age of 6. Then my parents decided to move to a different state. We weren’t happy in the new place. My dad quit his job after just a year and then took on jobs in different states, barely was at home. My parents took a big loan to buy the house, so my brother and I stayed with my (working) mum. My dad came home in a 2 weeks rhythm. The relationship of my parents degraded quickly. Although a small kid, I figured out very quickly that my dad led a double life. He always worked in some other city/state, where he had his own small apartment. He visited us but didn’t want us to visit him. Mum and dad often got into intense arguments as my dad obviously cheated, didn’t want her to have a key to his flat and being part of the other life. He wanted to keep family and private life separate. This went on for years. Now he’s self-employed and comes across as more settled. My brothers kids and wife live with them under the same roof. My question for advice is motivated by my nephews living in the same household. I left home at age 16 and live far away, in a foreign country. I Skype with my mum 1-3 times per week and with my dad 1 per month.

As a kid: Discovery of porn, sex toys and weird stuff.
When I was 8 yrs old, living in the new place, I had no friends (as we weren’t a socially integrated family) and I played a lot on my own. At several occasions I discovered huge boxes of super explicit porn magazines. Not the normal nudes/playboy. Curious kid I went through them. It messed with me. Still today I remember the abnormal poses and stories, women being slaves, bonded, violence/dominance played a role etc. So from what I know today it was like an abnormal high amount of 18+ SM magazines you can’t just buy over the regular counter. It was not pedo stuff but some of the girls were looked extremely young (like 16). Never told anybody and some day the boxes were gone. Some time later I found sex toys and sex dolls while playing in the garage. I brought the sex doll to my mum as I thought it was a kid’s toy. This one triggered a big argument...my dad didn’t come home for a long time. Hence a certain reluctance of my mother to openly address conflict.

As an adult: I once visited my dad. He is a rough guy but now caring grand-dad (something he wasn’t with us). He asked me for help to fix his iphone - I wish he hadn’t. Because on the browser there was still hardcore sex orgies on the screen. Again no pedo but very young girls and extreme stuff. My father has clearly sexual fantasies and hunger that he can’t still at home. This gives me the creeps given he his so secretive and tends to have different lifes.

Now:
The other day I heard a true crime pod cast, where several episodes talked about sexually motivated crimes committed by people who look normal but lead double lives. When they described the common patterns, habits and traits - I couldn’t help myself - I just thought, thanks God none of these were my dad because I recognised some traits in him.

I casually told my mum of the podcast and repeated the traits. And first thing she said was this could have been your dad too. She was only half joking if at all. This was the first time I told her about the many, extreme Porn stuff I found as a child and confessed to her that I think it messed with me as still today I see each of the cringe pics before my inner eye. She sounded worried that my nephews could find inappropriate stuff one day too.

Next day she emailed me a pic where she found a condom and sm bondage material in one of his bags (he still travels for work engagements).

I/We don’t know how to deal with the situation.
My dad isn’t open to dialogue on such private things, he can’t even talk about normal emotions like anger, disappointment etc.- he’d get rough, even more retreated and flee into “work engagements” away from home. I think he can’t express his feelings or needs verbally like an adult at all but he experiences them intensively - this scares me.

But then, it’s his sexuality and who am I to judge that. I’m not prudent, I have no moral issues with SM practices when it’s a mutually agreed role play and no one is hurt, it’s their business. 

But a) I have this very fluffy but deeply concerning inner voice that tells me I don’t know my dad, that he may be somebody very different when he’s not at home. I have doubts that somebody who is not able to talk about feelings and needs can indeed open up and mutually agree on sexual role plays. b) I’m afraid that my nephews stumble one day while they are too young about VERY adult/explicit pornography that mess their minds and take away the innocent way of discovering sexuality.


NB: My father never laid hand on us. He wasn’t particularly supportive, caring and barely here for us but in spite of his other lives he always came back, helped pay the house and got much more approachable/easy going since the grandchildren are born. So I guess I’m looking for advice of how to approach this subject with tact, without jeopardising a family’s relationship but also having a conversation on rules and trust. Not an easy one!",12Apr2020,6
429,"I don't know how to be sad about it. About a week ago my best friend committed suicide. So when I think of him I look back of the ""times"" we had and then say to myself too bad he's dead.

431,"*So just to prevent any useless non-answers right away; I went to my doc a few months ago already. They had me do a blood/urine test and ultrasound. They apparently didn't find anything (I suspected gallstones). Don't point me to any askdocs-type subs because they flat out won't answer me.*

This has been happening for years. I used to think fish and certain meats would trigger it, but this has been proven wrong, because I can eat fish as long as it's properly drained of excess oil if deepfried. 

It's definitely the oil that's causing this. I know it because my family makes extremely greasy food and doesn't drain or wipe off the excess grease and it sends me into a world of pain whenever I eat anything of theirs. When I cook the exact same food myself but with all the oil drained, I'm just fine.

The pain is in my upper abdomen and seems to be centered around the lower part of the esophagus(??). It comes in waves and radiates up to my throat, ribs and feels like it ""stabs"" through my back. I also salivate like a dog from it. Fun. It's VERY intense. And it lasts for an hour or two. I can barely move when it happens. 

I do seem to have a bit of a problem with acid reflux (had it since I was a kid), but I dunno if this is related to it. I haven't had any ""attacks"" in a while and I rarely have to take meds for it.

So, does anyone know what this is? Cause I'm stumped.",12Apr2020,1
433,"Recently since the quarantine happened I picked up a habit that I’ve never came across before the habit is during the night or day I always check my Instagram, not like checking out videos or photos I always check if my dms are normal like did I accidentally text someone or check my following number did I accidentally follow someone or my likes did I accidentally like a picture etc etc and earlier today I unblocked people and blocked them again now I keep on checking back and fourth if I have them blocked even though I know I blocked them I keep checking, is this due to no sleep?

434,"I was never popular growing up, never had many friends and the ones I did always saw me as the expendable friend. At 12 I was forced to be psychologically evaluated because of bullying at school. Nothing really changed and I still have no friends.

This has caused me to grow into the adult you're imagining right now. I'm not very attractive, genetically unfortunate but otherwise healthy, and have not very good social skills, so it makes sense I wouldn't be attracting a partner anytime soon.

The silver lining? Financially I am rock solid, 50/50 cash/stocks in an industry that won't/can't be automated and will still be here for many decades to come. Work is good and I have an ok professional network, I make good money for myself which seems to pile up because I don't ever go out or splurge on anything other than bikes or tech.

The peak of my life was for 11 months starting 2016 when I met a wonderful girl who opened me up sexually and emotionally, we broke up and I've never wanted anyone else since. She gave me a taste of how good life could be which quickly faded away shortly after.

I've been alone for so long I have come to terms that this is likely how the rest of my life will be, I occasionally have episodes of despair and sadness thinking about it but my mood is usually sorted by the time the sun comes up.

436,"My 11yo daughter has developed an obsession with changing her appearance.

Initially I was supportive of her desire to experiment with her appearance. She had expressed a interest in fashion, hair, makeup and ear piercing. I thought it was just part of growing up and her wanting to experiment so was supportive. I allowed her to get highlights in her hair, nails done and bought her some makeup which I allow her to wear on weekend. After much nagging I also reluctantly took her to get her ears pierced on a few occasions and she has now built up quite a collection of 4 holes per ear.

My concern is that my daughter has now become constantly fixated about how she looks. She is also constantly nagging me trying to push boundaries in terms of what I will allow. It seems like a constant battle where I try to be supportive but she is never satisfied with what I allow. The things she is asking for now seem to be too much for her age. She keeps wanting heavier makeup, dye her hair extreme colours and more ear piercings. More recently she asked to get her nose pierced.

Part of me thinks this is not a big deal and I should just be supportive. My main concern is that I do not want her to obsess about her appearance. Her father also said I should put my foot down before our daughter becomes a pincushion punk.

Any advice with this situation would be appreciated. Should I set boundaries or just be accepting of this? Should I be concerned about my daughter being overly image concious?",12Apr2020,3
437,"At my job I had a client who is elderly, disabled, high risk and on a fixed income. He said when he goes to the store, they’re out of food, and he’s worried about COVID-19. He called seeking services for someone to drop off a box of groceries at his door for free. I feel terribly for this man, as he has called several times and our care coordinators are letting him fall through the cracks. Unfortunately, it’s against policy for me to reach out to him or bring food myself and I have little hope my organization will do anything for him. So, I’m trying to see how I could get groceries delivered anonymously? I have his information, but I’ve never used a grocery delivery app, and I downloaded one (instacart) but didn’t see an anonymous option for delivery.

439,"Looking back, it was stupid and careless of me to move here with no degree. I tried my hand at serving tables but my anxiety and depression didn't let me cut it. I also have no real interest in food or wine, never did. I grew up in a trailer and my experience with food was arguing over scraps.

I ask myself why I moved here and really, the only reason was privacy and to get away from my family home. I lived month to month my entire time here and it was simply too difficult to save money by myself. Way too stressful for me personally and I caved way too much on the wallet out of stress and sadness. Rent is also ridiculous here.

I now realize what it means to be truly self sufficient. I realize how brutal the economy is without training. I can not express how sad I am to have to leave this city but it simply cannot be enjoyed without a basic threshold of financial security and comfort which is nigh impossible without any training.

I'm moving back into mom's place for a couple months. It may trigger a depression but I have a plan now. My licence will turn a year old in 2 months and I can apply for paid CDL training. I hate to put my eggs in one basket but it's all I got. I already failed out of college and I'd rather sell my soul to a company if it means I'll be more stable in the future.

I'm stressed. I'm too stressed to enjoy anything and I will be until I can afford living on my own properly. I didn't mean to waste my time here but there is simply no decent work here without a degree. The virus certainly didn't help things.

457,Help! I’m not sure what to do... I work for a government agency that serves medically fragile adults. The program’s eligibility it based off of the clients physical abilities to complete tasks to care for themselves. I’m working with a client who I don’t believe will continue to be eligible for our program because she is physically independent. She is being kicked out of the facility where she lives due to drug and alcohol abuse so this situation has blown up. In a staffing with Managment I started to question why she is still eligible when she (in my opinion) doesn’t meet the criteria for the program. Essentially Managment said they are going to make her eligible regardless and they’re selectively not going to get information from the facility that would harm her case because they don’t like the facility that’s trying to evict her. I don’t feel that it’s right to lie to make her eligible and/or purposely not get information due to personal bias. This situation really bothers me to the point I’m losing sleep.

Being that I didn’t have that much money as I didn’t get a job until I was 17 I moved to my father’s a week after spending time at friends houses. I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, I don’t remember much of my childhood but my mom has told me that I would not want to go to his place for the weekend, which wasn’t because of anything traumatizing I think, nothing like abuse but I didn’t like spending time with him because he forced it.

( He's very gentle and doesn't like to bother anyone) .This morning i saw him and he looked very upset and I asked him whats wrong and he replied that he was walking in our backyard and then he saw our neighbor's son (about 15 of age)  on my neighbors roof. the boy calls out to my dad to greet him  and says "" did you see the chicken feet over there?"" and my dad is puzzled and is like what chicken feet??   the boy then points to my backyard and my dad looked and there and behold a chunk of fresh chicken feet there. i say they're fresh because they still looked like they were just put there and the smell was horrendous. and then my dad looks back up to the boy and asks "" did you throw this here?!!"". the boy didnt say anything and turned around and left.   my dad cleaned it up and left and after that was when i saw him and we starting talking. he began to tell me about the times the neighbors throw bagged up human shit.  and the more i heard him talk the more furious i got.in the past my dad has tried to talk to them many times, they wouldnt listen. he says this has been happening for over 10 years.  many years ago he went to city hall 4 separate times and they wouldnt do anything because my neighbors would not stop. plus theyre trouble makers. they go to prison for a couple months then come out  and its like a cycle they dont stop. we dont have the money to just move houses nor build a taller wall around the house. ( our existing wall is like about 3 meters)  and they still sometimes break into our backyard and steal fruits from our trees.I'm so angry I'm considering throwing eggs at their house but I don't wanna cause more problems. plus i had a huge argument with my dad about this. he believes in making peace and maybe by seeing good will they may have a change of heart but i believe in putting boundaries.  my dad says you cant win against these people they're always in prisons and getting complaints for 10 years and nothing has changed.I'm sad to know my father is baring this. its breaking my heart. i could use some advice. otherwise i feel like imma go crazy and egg their house",12Apr2020,781

But I also want to have my own character, not a stolen one. but when u spend so much time with one another  they kinda rub off on you? 
I guess what I’m asking is, how to look at people and just seeee THEM instead of being self centered ,comparing etc. 
Literally my grandpa has told her to not be jealous of my beauty. It’s such a disgusting problem that gets to my head because it’s so ego driven and I want to be full of love and humbleness

My room had a leak in it starting a year or two ago. I never had my own money to fix it and parent's said they'd help me but put it off until too late. So now my room has gotten to the point where there is cup fungus growing all along the floor and black mold in the carpet and it smells like mildew and the air is very humid. Concerned about getting sick I don't try not sleep here until the sun comes out to clear the air ruining my sleep schedule.

I can't fall asleep in the living room because I go to sleep after my parents wake up and even listening to music to sleep they are too loud and the dogs are always licking eating or barking which simply just pisses me off.

They won't let me sleep on the unused cot in their room after they wake up and leave the room. They let me once and I couldn't sleep anyway.

My sister won't let me sleep in her room and she grinds her teeth and it's very loud I can hear it in my room if she even let me.

I have apologized but nothings good enough, he says I'm not doing enough I offered let's make a list of what needs to be done and I'll do it, of course it's not enough.

I'll go to the point on why I decided to call things off. Before I decided to call things off, we were quite happy with each other, it was still pretty awkward and I felt shy dming her, since we were in a long distance relationship, but it was because we just recently started dating and overtime we were more comfortable with each other. Besides so, we had no problems at all.

Then, one of my other friends wanted to tell me something that was going on with my ex. My ex has a private account on twt where she can vent out of her feelings freely,  she didn't want me following that account because It'd be embarrassing for her, I really didn't care too much about it. My friend told me that in my ex' private account, she's still talking about her ex, how much she misses her ex, and wrote poems about her ex.. I was really hurt, because I when my ex told me about her ex, I was determined to be more caring and loving, but she wasn't over her yet and my efforts seemed to be useless.

My friend told me It'd be better to call things off. I was angry, sad, then called things off with my ex without telling her why specifically, she didn't even question why.

490,"I have one day until a pre-employment drug screening and am incredibly stressed about what I should do. I know that there have been many posts on this issue, but I really would like some advice/answers to help put my mind at ease and decide on a definitive course of action. I have major anxiety and have been driving myself nuts researching as much as possible on this stuff for the last month. 

So let me explain the context first...

I've been smoking weed regularly since I was 17, and have smoked more as I've gotten older. I'm currently in my late 30s, weight 170 lbs, and smoked heavily (5-8 times a day) for the past few years. It has been a full 5 weeks since I last smoked; I've detoxed, and have been drinking large amounts of water, cranberry juice, and green tea regularly for the past few weeks. I bought three different brands of at home drug tests that measure for 50 ng/ml and have received very faint/faint lines when testing for THC. I've researched and have been told by friends that ""a line is a line"" and that is considered a negative result, meaning that I passed the at home tests. 

My main worry is that I don't know whether or not the pre-employment drug screening will test for what seems to be the usual 50 ng/ml for THC or if it will test for the less likely 20 ng/ml. The drug screening will be at the Guthrie Clinic tomorrow, and I can't find any information online to confirm if they screen for 20 or 50 ng/ml, so obviously I am worried. With major anxiety issues, the past few days have been very difficult, and as the deadline approaches, I am having a tough time figuring out what I should do because I bought Quick Fix 6.2 just in case I was unable to get clean in time for the drug test.

So to sum up, considering I have abstained 100% from smoking weed for 5 weeks, have detoxed, and gone through the motions of eating healthy and drinking water, cranberry juice, and green tea, have passed three different 50 ng/ml at home drug tests (with very faint-to-faint lines), I am wondering the following:    (please be forgiving if all of this sounds repetitive to previous posts on the subject, but again, my anxiety and paranoia would be put to ease with some thoughtful, knowledgable responses here--I thank you all in advance for your advice/answers)

1. Does anyone know the ng/ml cutoff for pre-employment drug screenings for the Guthrie Clinic?
2. Is it likely I will pass a pre-employment screening at 50 ng/ml given that I've passed three different brands of at home drug tests with very faint-to-faint lines for THC?
3. Should I risk using my own urine or risk using the Quick Fix 6.2 synthetic urine? \*\*I have seen a lot of anecdotal evidence that as long as the Quick Fix 6.2 is at the right temp, it will pass a drug test. I also know a few people who have successfully used synthetic urine in the past.",12Apr2020,1

492,"So long story short. Just before the coronavirus situation I (24m) found out my partner (25m) of 4 years had cheated on me a total of 5 times in the last year, twice with 1 person and once with 3 others, all in our own bed while I was at work. 

We are in a rented flat in the UK with 4 months left on our tenancy so I agreed to stay in the flat until the end of it as I would be at work most of the time and wouldn't see them that much. Also to get out of the tenancy it would cost a load and be a hassle.

Now the problem I've got is that with the coronavirus lock down I'm stuck in the flat with him all day everyday and it's starting to drive me crazy. All the little things that were cute quirks now just frustrate me and I'm building a resentment for him.

494,"Here’s some backstory

I am a 14 year old girl in love with a 17 year old guy who I met and got to know online on a game. For a long time, we talked all day and night everyday, and it wasn’t long after we met that we realized how we felt about each other and decided to be together. Everything was going well and we were really happy with each other.

Well that was until 3 months ago. It was late at night and my boyfriend and I were doing some inappropriate things. However, my brother found out and freaked out. And so did my mom. They went ballistic and tons of things happened that I’d rather not go into detail about. The way it ended is that I am not allowed to even speak to him anymore. At all. Despite this, I still keep in contact with him and message him often because I still love this boy with all my heart and he loves me too. Well that’s what I thought at least.

Recently it seems he’s having doubts. We have planned since the incident to wait until I can move out and be independent without my family to be together again, but it has been very hard. I have recently been in a state of depression because of how much I wish and long to be with him but can’t because of how my family wants to control that part of my life. He says he still loves me but is wondering if being unhappy everyday for years is worth it. As it is right now, with 100% of my being, I’m sure that I won’t move on from him. He is everything I ever wanted in a guy and even more. This talk happened about an hour ago and I’m still trying to process. I need advice on this bad. Please help me out.

P.S., my family despite not letting me date him is wonderful and provide me with everything else I ever ask for, except him. So please do not bash on my family because they truly do want the best for me, but I am not sure they know what it is.

Hi all :)

I hope everyone is doing well in these times. While being self isolated it's really got me thinking about what I want to do with my life. Ultimately I'd love to start a non-profit for people struggling with mental health/suicial thoughts/depression/anxiety/abuse at home.

Being a suffer with mental health myself, I know how hard this can be and the lack of resources/facilities there are. I've done charity work for a good few years and it's the most rewarding job i've ever been at. I loved every moment i was there for years.

I'll try keep it short and sweet

Please note i've not planned this in detail since I have no idea how to take this forward or if it's even a good idea so I thought to ask you lovely people

Basic Idea (It could be written better, I apologise.):  
Have gaming/internet cafes available for everyone around the UK with access to free therapy and other bits. (I was thinking about having a membership scheme to help fund them? People can apply for free membership so they can have access to everything &amp; a few extras)

**Why gaming/internet cafes?**  
It gives people a safe play to go, whether they have abusing parents/spouce or are having dark times and need people to be around them and a good place for them to make possible friendships. I don't know the legalities or whether it would even be viable but maybe a few rooms/sleeping areas for those who need a safe place to stay

**What would they offer?**

* Free &amp; Discounted Councelling/Therapy (I suppose it will presume on funding, Ideally free but i guess i have to be realistic?)
* Food &amp; Drink
* I'd like to have an emergency number people can call about self harm/suicide
* Everyone would be treated equailly whether they have the free funded membership or are just general public paying to use the services
* Study areas and resources (laptops, printer, paper, pens, books etc) available for kids (Parents can't afford it/abusive parents/parents just don't care)

This is just a brief idea of what i'd love to be able to do, I'd love some feedback on it and what I could improve &amp; add.

**Questions I have to help get this going:**

* How would I start even getting funding to do something like this?
* What can I do now to start
* Should it be a Charity/Non-profit or a for-profit business that donates the profits to fund this?
* Do you think something like this would be able to sustain for the first couple years while it gets going

506,"Advice please. 


I work in an office for a food manufacturer, and have been working from home since lockdown began. There's nothing in the office I can't do at home with a laptop.

My boss wants me to go back to working in the office as he's a bit old fashioned and as we directly report to the directors of the company (who are still in the office), he wants me there to keep them happy as it eases the pressure on us over year-end. Plus he thinks I'll be more productive working in the office which is probably true, but I'm happy to work past my working hours if needed at home because its a nice environment. I'm quite enjoying the freedom of working from home and not having to commute and spend ~£100/month on petrol.

I'm pretty sure there's only essential staff, people who can't work from home, and company directors in the office at the moment. I should say I'm pretty much at an entry level salary so its not like I'm a massively important figure at the company.

The company has taken measures to prevent the virus spreading, social distancing, constantly open doors, etc. But given its not absolutely necessary for me to be in, can I reasonably argue against my boss for me to stay at home? Or have any of you just sucked it up and have started working the office because your boss wanted you to?",12Apr2020,1

i'm asking you to please please please help me. please give me advice on what to do because i'm tired of hearing about it and also don't want to start an argument (already almost have a couple times) because my family takes it personally. it's basically ruined my easter. i dont want to silence their beliefs but i just want them to stop discussing them around me.

Apologies that this is so random, but it does say advice for anything. Please feel free to direct me to another subreddit, I searched but couldn’t find one on art advice. I did read the rules here and I feel like I’m asking general advice, not overly specific. 

My small business employer is closed currently, but is allowing me to work from home on some art for upcoming windows (think Anthropologie.) I’m doing well on most of it, but I wanted a life sized flamingo made from amazon boxes, garbage, and newspaper, to be painted abstract flamingo like. 

What I didn’t think about was how the darn thing would stand up. I have the “leg,” two pieces of a discarded tent, but I have no idea how to make a “foot.”  I’ve never sculpted or paper mached, and was so happy to have gotten this far, I just put off thinking about stability. He is light weight, maybe 1.5 to 2 pounds at most. Stable on the leg. But can anyone think of a base?

523,"My name is Vladimir.

I\`m 18 years old and I\`m in 12th grade. My girlfriend broke up with me the day before yesterday, but I think that it will be best if I start from the beginning.

We are in one class in school since 8th grade. I was in love, or most of the people think that I was in love with another girl from our class, but I was telling them that to hide something that changed me in a really negative way! Anyways... Soon after the new school year started, I started dating a girl, who is a friend with my ex.

Our relationship was toxic and I was taking advice from now my ex and this made us somehow close. We got to know each other and I asked her on a date. Our first date was at 07.02 this year. We decided to hide our relationship, because of my ex. For the first week, everything was really good, but I made a really big mistake at a party a week later (14.02) She told me that I should not drink a lot of alcohol, because when I\`m really annoying when I\`m drunk. I did get drunk, but everything was okay before we started playing Truth or Dare. Because now my ex-girlfriend is very pretty the boys started making her do sex positions with them and stuff. This made me angry and when it was my turn I dared her to tell the rest of the people about our relationship. Not direct, of course. This made her angry with me! After that, we didn't text for 2 days and the next Monday when we talked she decided to give me a second chance.

After that our relationship was not so good, but not so bad either. We didn't text each other really, but we went on dates. We hade some bad experiences in bed also. The worst time was when the quarantine started. We stopped going out and texted each other very rarely. I did send her memes tho. Last Friday I had a dream, where she was texting other guys and saying stuff like ""I\`m going to wait till the quarantine is over, then I will break up with him"". I just couldn't stop thinking about it and 3 days ago I told her about my dream. Firstly she said that everything was okay and I should not be worried but after a while, she eventually told me that she was texting another guy and that our relationship was not at its best time, but she decided to give me another chance after the quarantine.

And this is where I made some BIG mistakes. Firstly she decided that I had hacked her Facebook and Instagram and I knew from there that she was testing another guy. I told her that I haven't hacked her profiles, but she didn\`t believe me. After that, I told her that we both made some mistakes and we can try again and make it work. We texted for an hour and fought, but she told me that she needed time to think about it. I was really angry, depressed and anxious and at 3 am I wrote a very big text, where I said that I cared for her, missed her and that I want to be with her. She didn't text me back for the next 11/12 hours and I got really mad, I called her and she didn\`t answer me. Then I texted her ""You are with him, aren't you"". After a minute or two I realized that it was really bad text and I deleted it, but it was already too late. She saw it. In the evening she texted me, that she decided to end the relationship... We texted for a little while and we broke up. I love her and I want her back!

I know that I made some pretty big mistakes, but I also know that she still has feelings for me. I already watched some youtube videos and made something like a plan...

1-15 days no contact (I talked with two girls and they told me that 30 days is way too long)

2-I will text her something like that: I made a meme today and I remembered the time when I was making memes for you. That made me smile. I hope everything is good with you OR How are you (I\`m not sure if I should start a conversation or not for the first text)

3-I will text her something (I don't know what and this is where I\`m asking for advice) 2-3 days after the first text. I will make sure that I text her rarely and text her back an hour after she sends me a reply.

4-I will invite her for just a meeting and just to grab a coffee (To give me a book or something...I don't know how to make her meet with me and I would love it if u guys give me some advice)

5-When we meet, I will talk about how I have changed myself and our break up was a good thing. I will try to grab her hand and tell her how good I was feeling when she was squishing it and I will bring up the idea of how would things could be different if we try when I have changed myself.

6-I will set-up a date with her.

Please give me some advice! Should I do something different, do I still have a chance, how can I bring her back. Also, I\`m really worried about that guy with who she was texting, but I think that the quarantine should help me somehow.",12Apr2020,1
524,"First of all, let me explain the actual situation. I'm a (20M) student doing a sandwich course in IT development since september 2018. I've been learning a lot in the company I'm working in (15- employees), making me actually second of my promotion (first if you only consider IT parts) and allowing me to candidate to a lot of higher schools. People in the company are mostly kind with each others and no big conflicts happened.

I have the opportunity to go for a third year of sandwich course in a higher school that I'm interested in, and the company told me that they want to keep me for a third year if I agree.

""So what's the problem?"" are you probably thinking.
Well there are multiple problems... 

First of all, the company is trending to only think about money. Money, money and money. The CEO is selling new projects even if we (developers) are only half-way done with the previous one, forcing us to botch up what we are actually doing and putting a lot of pressure on us. And by botching up everything like that, one day justice will come back right at our face and goddamn I hope I won't be employed here anymore at this moment.

Second problem is the way we work. It's just... Meh...
We are 9 people in a 18 square meters room, erveryone has to have his own desk and the room also contains storage, leading us to have less than 1 square meter for each one of us. Add to that the fact that we have garbage chairs that literally destroy our backs (said by occupational health) , and that even if we asked to the CEO to change that nothing has been done (we're asking that for over a year) 
Again, people are kind and respectful with each others, but I feel like an asshole for thinking it's not good enough

Third problem is that we employees are getting sick of CEO's attitude with client, projects, and team management. An exemple of what happenned recently, an engineer guy working since 4 weeks on a 3 months project has already been put to an incoming huge project, which uses a technology that he discuss to not have to deal anymore with. He argued with the CEO and the only consequent response he had is ""You should be more skilled, then we would discuss about technologies you'll use""...

We actually have a ""group"" of 8 people that are feeling the same way I do, and we are getting more and more tired of this shit.

I already thinked about quitting, but this would have a lot of consequences : no third high school year (which is almost a must have in my country) or I would have to quickly find a new company, no more wages which could put me in serious financial troubles. I also still have too much to learn to start anything by my own and can't offer any high school formation without the sandwich course system.

I'm feeling stuck in an awkward situation, working for a company that isn't anymore the holy grail I thought in 2018 (damn was I foolish). I don' t know what to do and it makes me more and more depressed

TLDR - Have a shitty situation in a company where employees aren't treated goodly enough, but will be in troubles if I quit it, what would you do?",12Apr2020,1

Insecurity -&gt; fear that they'll lose interest and leave me

Validation -&gt; Signs that show that they're interested in me. e.g., Praise, Laugh or even talking comfortably and enthusiastically etc

People Pleasing -&gt; Saying yes in Yes, being in good looks of them, never saying anything that might offend them, not being myself and saying what I really want and what I beleive in. Instead, showing myself as very interesting, knowledgeable and superior, sometimes putting them down too.

Entitled -&gt; Feeling Superior(Just an act)

Overthinker -&gt; Micro Monitoring myself all the time, every reaction I get so that I can adjust like a chameleon. Moreover always being conscious of not giving too much or too less of what I feel(Love, sadness, angry jealousy)out. Suppressing my feelings all the time.
 
Fear -&gt; Live in fear to show my real side, so I ignore them, talking only when I have something interesting to say, because otherwise they get to know I am same as them -- ordinary, nothing special, and they will stop validating me. And will lose interest in me and leave.

Off cycle -&gt; Exhausted , I can't fake anymore,  I give up trying to impress and finally I want to be real but not before I make sure that the person can be trusted and will never leave (That's why in dating life I force the other person to commit after 4-5 months)


Because of Insecurity -&gt; I feel the love is earned, so I like chasing but go away when love is given to me without me putting any effort as if that love is easy and doesn't mean anything.

Because of People Pleasing -&gt;  Left me Feeling used as if I'm too nice to people, when I go out of my way to please people and put in so much effort in it.

531,"Ok so a year ago I (F20) was sexually assaulted and that person is now my neighbour after the police did nothing about it. He antagonises me a lot in many ways. I will not go into detail as I do not want him finding this post and recognising the details. 

Essentially, since this trauma I have been very paranoid that he is finding other ways of hurting me that I’m unaware of. One of them is that he has placed a hidden camera in my house and is streaming the footage to the internet. 

I have been unable to find anyone that knows enough about the subject to help me find hidden cameras or anything, so I have no way of disproving that this is happening to me. He seems to know when I am going out and I feel that some things have moved from where I have put them. The movement stopped when the UK went on lockdown. 

So my idea is that I just stream it myself. Set up a camera and just have it out there. I want to take back any power he has over me. 

My question is: how would I go about this?

It can’t be twitch or anything because it would be streaming my bedroom 24/7 and would obviously have some nsfw moments. It would not be inherently sexual but in order for me to take back the power, I need to do exactly what I fear he is doing to me. He can’t be pleased about violating my privacy if I’m already openly doing it, y’know?

536,"Someone I (M 23) care about deeply (F 21)is in the throes of depression and anxiety, and she is hanging on by a thread. I've been through this myself, I was in a very dark place and after years of painful lessons and mistakes, I managed to find my way out. I thought that I could help her out, but she is too consumed by her own troubles that she is scared to hope for a bright future, in case it doesn't happen, in which case she would likely give up.

It's so frustrating to know the way out and to still not be able to help. And I get it! If you expect constant disappointment then why would you get your hopes up? It would just make it that much worse if it didn't happen. And often, when you're in such a dark place, you have no interest in getting out because you just don't believe it's possible! 

Trying to explain things hasn't helped, and I know at this point she just needs someone to be there for her, which I'm trying my best to do. But how do I deal with it when she spirals into these conversations of giving up and not wanting to try? If I argue with what she is saying (which is clearly warped by the depression), it just makes things worse. But I can't agree with her when she says life isn't worth living? I can't give up trying?

* **Species: Ginger Cat**
* **Age: 10, Sagittarius (apparently)**
* **Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered**
* **Body weight: Was a 3 on the body condition system when adopted 3 months ago, I would bet he is at a 4 now. 7 pounds?**
* **History: Was left at a shelter at 10 with his brother who was adopted separately. Declawed front claws. Kidney disease.**

Here's the situation:

We were told he wasn't a vocal boy when we adopted him, but it turns out he's a night talker. He REALLY wants the bathroom faucets to be on periodically through the night and asks for it several times. My fiance is becoming frustrated that he hasn't been able to sleep through the night since we adopted him. We have tried a calming collar (didn't seem to do much) and we tried a streaming water fountain which he loved but not as much as the sink and tub faucets. At the beginning I would turn them on for him, now I don't unless I'm at my wits end at 3AM. He is a VERY sweet and loving old man.

We're moving to a larger place in 3 months so it will be a non issue as we will have a designated night cat room. Do you have any advice for how we could encourage him to be quiet during the night?

544,"My boyfriend \[31m\] and I \[31F\] have dated for 6 years and lived together for 4 years in his house. Throughout this time, we've had significant ups and downs, and numerous discussions about breaking up. We're both quite stubborn and admit we're afraid of being alone, so those conversations always end with us making up and going about our lives, until the next conversation 6 months down the line.

Understandably, this quarantine has made our issues quite apparent and I don't feel like I can ignore them any longer. I won't go into detail, but our values are so misaligned. Today was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back. Right now, he's partying with some friends at somebody's river house which goes against everything I believe in about this quarantine. While he was packing earlier, I explained to him how selfish it was to go do that and how much I disagreed with it. I even explained how he was essentially making a risky decision for me and everyone else he'll come in contact with these next few weeks. He responded by saying ""well maybe you should just go move back in with your mom then,"" and left.

&amp;#x200B;

My first reaction was to go buy some moving boxes.

I've sat staring at those boxes all day and can't bring myself to start packing for a few selfish reasons:

\- I'm not financially independent enough to move out on my own. I'd have to move back in with my mother who has not left her house for 2 years and suffers from severe depression. She also keeps her house incredibly messy and dysfunctional. It won't be a comfortable environment to live in.

\- On top of that, I'm afraid of her reaction when I'll have to admit to her that this relationship failed and ask if I can move back in. I know she'll be upset and worry herself about my situation and how I'll get back on my feet. I just picture her crying and crying over it.

\- I'm also pretty socially avoidant and have pushed some friends away. I don't necessarily regret that, but I hate that I don't have a close friend to talk to about all of this. Without my boyfriend, my mom will basically be my only point of contact until I can go back to work (I've been laid off for the foreseeable future because of the virus). Again, she's depressed and reclusive, so only having her in my life won't be the best for my mental health.

\- The most upsetting part is the prospect of losing the dog we got 2 years ago. She's my world. I never thought I could love an animal that much. I want to take her with me, but I know my boyfriend can give her a better life than I could. She loves him, is best friends with his other dog, and I know he can financially take care of her. I just can't hold it together and cry my eyes out every time I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know in my heart that I need to leave. I keep trying to remind myself that I'll be better off in the end. This is the only way I can open myself up to finding the right person and it'll be a chance to start fresh and learn to grow on my own. It's just so hard to see past the short term.

If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading. I'm just looking for support or advice since I have no one to turn to.

**TL;DR**: Quarantine has made me \[31F\] realize how misaligned I am with my live-in boyfriend \[31M\] of 6 years. I want to break up with him and move out of his house, but I can't afford to live on my own and don't have close friends, so I'd need to move in with my mother. She's depressed/reclusive and may affect my mental health even more. I was laid off from work because of COVID, so I'll basically be at her house all the time and only have her to talk to.

551,"okay so heres the problem- we have twenty (20) cats and just two people in our average sized townhome. my mom started breeding cats when i was like 10 and she just grew her business from there. she has recently decided to shut it down as it causes everyone a lot of despair and these cats have destroyed the house at this point. however, shes still attached to so many of the cats that once this is all said and done shes still going to be keeping about 10 of them. ive been cleaning cat shit almost every day since i was in the fifth grade and i am absolutely sick of it (when you're cleaning after 20 unfixed!!! cats it is a MUCH dirtier job than your average 1-2 cat household). ive been making my position on the matter pretty clear for about 5 years now- telling her its just too many goddamn cats, but she wont listen. on top of all of that she constantly threatens me when i am too tired to deal with these cats by telling me that if i dont do it i can say goodbye to the roof over my head. anyway, in the past couple days its escalated, i was feeling particularly shitty and she asked me to clean out the kitten room (the messiest room to clean) and i just wasnt up to it so she told me to leave. ive been forced to park my car down the street and sneak into my room so she doesnt think im actually home. as a result of that she thinks ive been staying with someone else and does not want to let me back in because shes worried i will give her coronavirus. what am i supposed to do?? i didnt choose this life and i cant deal with these mountains of cat excrements anymore !! it literally makes me so angry i want to punch something every time i have to do it and ruins my whole day which actually sometimes causes me to lash out at my mom  (and leaves me smelling like actual cat shit for the rest of the day too) so what in the world do i do?? she clearly cares more about the wellbeing of her precious cats than her 18 year old daughter who is barely on her feet, what the fuck do i do???",12Apr2020,1

555,"So, I'm 20 years old, male, and been living on myself for 2 years by now, but moved houses 9 months ago to the house in question. The house allows 3 people to live there in total, sharing the kitchen, toilet and shower (no living room), it's rather small.

At the time it had a roommate, Angela (no real names), and Nick. The moment that I was there, I knew Angela was a person with a fierce attitude, who doesn't take shit from anyone, and really collided with Nick as he rarely cleans behind himself, piling up dishes in the kitchen.

Angela was understandable, and knowing myself, I wouldn't bother her that much (I thought). I came outside of my room daily, cooking, and trying to socialize a bit. However, things got worse when Nick moved out, and Angela's best friend Patrick moved it. Both of them were REALLY present, Angela a bit more, raising their voice like no other. Angela complained a lot about life, with a lot of frustration inside of her. Understandable, life aint easy.

They were rather... Intimidating. I didn't get out of my room at all to socialize with them, even skipped days to coock, and just threw in microwave meals. I'm not sure how I was intimidated by them so quickly, it just happened, and I'm more of an introvert as well. However, things got worse, way worse.

Angela is a person who really likes things to be clean, and I made sure they wouldn't even know I was there to begin with, leaving nothing behind. However, here comes the first collision with them. Whenever I go to the toilet, number 2, it doesn't exactly smell like flowers, and even with spray and all, wouldn't go by unnoticed. Whenever they went, after me, especially Angela, they would freak out. Yell, curse, and just talk about me out loud in an unpleasant manner.

I won't lie, that hurts. I apologised in our group app, but they went on, no matter how hard I tried to hide the smell, or changed diet to make sure it doesn't smell as bad at all. Eventually a small fight erupts about this subject, throwing blame around, and eventually it calmed down a bit, and I promised to try my best, and they wouldn't freak out as much.

Eventually Angela got a bright idea, creating a cleaning list of who cleans what weekly (even tho I clean behind myself, leaving not a single mark aside from the number 2). She insists we all partake, and I thought, fine, I will try my best. However, since I work fulltime, around the same hours as they do, they are home when I am. And as I said before, they really really are present, talking loudly, complaining about life, and their presence intimidate me greatly, not sure why, it just does.

So, I neglected the cleaning schedule, just as my health, not cooking much at all, really only when I'm at my sister's place, eating with her. Even tho I don't make much of a mess, they noticed I didn't clean that much, and here comes 2 long long texts my way, complaining about my behaviour, just talking mean stuff. I didn't know what to say, it was just mean shit, so I didn't say anything at all.

Here comes another long text, about me ignoring her, and her saying that there will be ""consequences"". Eventually I replied that I didn't mean to ignore her, that I just didn't know what to say, and trying to fuse the situation.

So, a small thing that should be known about me. I have a little amount of energy, which mostly goes to work, and I'm a real procrastinator (which is bad, I know, but I can't help it). That combined with their presence, I don't get things done. I understand my roommates, I do, but the way they dealt with this situation, made things worse.

So, this went on for 3 weeks, me doing little amount of things, and I already expect things to explode real soon. So... What do I do? I hate this situation, I want to help cleaning, sure, but they are just so intimidating.

So I’m a gay guy and use Snapchat to talk and exchange pics with guys. I’m 35 and strict about only talking to guys 20+. I even have a ‘no under 18’s’ sticker on my profile. Recently shared my snap name on a sex chat site (over 18 site) and was added by guy on snap. He said he was 21. We chatted a bit and exchanged one ‘di*k pic. A little later he sent me another pic and the style of the room he was in made me think he was younger- looked more like a teen/young guys bedroom. Didn’t see his face but his body was that of a man.

I asked him to confirm but he didn’t respond. I’ve cut contact/deleted etc but in very worried that he may have been younger. I’m so not the sort of guy that would knowingly chat to someone young.

567,"Hey everyone, this is a fuckin doozy 

My boyfriend and I (both 22) lost our jobs in Colorado due to COVID19. We were staying in employee housing, so we had to leave. The only place we had to go was a friends house in West Virginia. We made the trip because initially we were told we could move in and sign onto the lease, but dude's gf came back into the picture, and very long story short, she doesn't want roommates, so he retracted his offer. We have 8 days to find a place to live. 

We both have shit credit, our parents do too. We haven't gotten jobs since we got to WV because we were told we had to leave, and didn't want to settle when we didn't have a solid place to stay and damn near NOwhere is hiring right now around here, or anywhere for that matter, and you need 3 pay stubs for most apartments as proof of income.

Together, we have enough money to put down a few months of rent upfront plus a deposit, but with everything combined, it doesn't even matter because everyone has been needing a guarantor. Which I completely respect and understand. It just sucks and I need serious help figuring out what I'm supposed to do. As soon as we can get in somewhere, I will literally walk into a gas station or a Walmart and ask for a job. I'm just confused. Help

Edit: Essentially I'm asking what housing opportunities there are for people with bad credit, possibly no guarantor depending if they care about said guarantor's credit (they probably will), and no jobs, but the no jobs part is related to COVID19.",12Apr2020,1
568,"For the past 19 years of my life my parents have forced me to go to church and this year I wanted it to go my way. Before you wonder yes I do live in my parents house for financial reasons but I will be moving out this fall for college. I am from the USA if you need to know that.

At my parents house I do pretty much whatever they ask me to do, house chores, projects, making dinner and whatnot. I respect them but sometimes they do not understand that I am an adult and they should respect my wishes sometimes. A big reason I don’t want to go to church anymore is due to repetitiveness (my family only goes every now and then but always on holidays). I hear the same message every holiday and it’s annoying because I don’t learn anything new, we always sing the same songs, it’s nothing different from last year.

So I ask this question, should I listen to my parents and go to church even though I am 20 years old and I feel that church is a waste of time to me?

573,"I moved in at the end of last year. My neighbors and I have said hi a few times, but I keep to myself.

One of my neighbors has always seemed a little, idk off? Not that I'm diagnosing anything but he's just a little weird I guess.

In the last two weeks I've noticed him sitting on his porch and talking to himself.. at first I thought he might have been on the phone but we share one common wall and when I'm in that room I can hear him moving around. He seems to move stuff around in that room a lot like there's banging or sounds of throwing boxes or something like that. Lately I've been hearing him laugh really softly to himself and talking and answering. It's not like a ""Wilson"" kind of thing but maybe some sort of mental health issue. In the last two days he's been walking around the block laughing really loud to himself and talking out loud.. he isn't on his phone or using a bluetooth as far as I know. And it doesn't really seem to have any meaning to his words, like he is just sort of saying random stuff.

When the quarantine first started I would hear him talking to someone on the phone, a family member or something from what it sounded like, but lately he has only been doing this talking and replying to himself thing.

The room in particular that shares the walkway has windows that face an outside hallway that connects our porches and leads to the parking lot. My porch sits sort of behind his, so neither of us can see the other unless we lean over the railing if that makes sense. But the walkway goes past our windows.

Last night I was working but had the lights in the room off. I heard him / saw his shadow standing next to my window and he was scraping the window grate and giggling / talking to himself and responding to himself in sort of a high-pitch whisper. I can't make out what he's saying but it's like some of the videos I've seen of arsonists / pyromaniacs who film fires they start and are caught talking to themselves on camera. I don't know.

Is there a service I can call for this sort of thing? We rent from the same landlord but it isn't something I want to get her involved in. I am his only neighbor, the floor below us is office space and the business hasn't been open for a month. So he would know it was me. But I'm still worried about him. It isn't something someone should have to go through especially right now.

TL;DR: Neighbor has started talking to himself in a strange way, not sure if I should call a public service to do a check up.",12Apr2020,0

577,"About a month ago, just before quarantine started where I live, I was in a maths class doing group work, working through past papers with a group of friends, lets say X, Y, and Z, and two of them (X and Y) were being their usual loud, fun selves. I can't remember the exact details, but it went something along the lines of me releasing a comment, and them taking it bad. 

They call me out for being ""sassy"", which for some reason got on my nerves at the time, so I started returning fire, meeting their remarks with other remarks. At some point, one grabs my pencil case and starts throwing things out the window (we were in a ground floor classroom), and at that point it starts getting quite childish, with me, X and Y grabbing each other's stuff and throwing it around. The reason why this is important is that it led me on to believe that it wasn't serious, just another round of jokes and/or banter. 

When it was all over, X and Y moved to a nearby table, meanwhile Z remained with me. Z had actually stayed out of the whole encounter, remaining neutral between us all. Moving along, the end of the class comes, and as we all leave, I go around the building and grab my defenestrated items, and find Y there, collecting the remnants. They hand me the things they'd picked up and tell me that they were going to get it all for me, which further reinforced the idea that I saw it as a joke.

Apparently, X did not. When I returned home, I found that they'd left all group chats with me in, and according to Z's words, I was a ""massive dickhead"". At this point, I still didn't really understand that it wasn't a joke to them, and texted them a sarcastic apology, something along the lines of ""Christ, if I offended you that bad, I'm sorry"". In hindsight, that probably wasn't the brightest thing to do. 

Long story short, the next day pulls through, and Y also stops talking to me. I now finally understand that somethings up. So after school, I create a chat with them in, and write out a long apology to each of them. I make it clear that I was an ass and I realised that some of the things I said were a bit too much. After a while, Y messages me, and tells me that our slate is clean, and that they were perfectly fine to continue, however, X keeps ignoring me. 

Another day comes, and I avoid their group, as I hate putting myself in awkward situations where I know I'm not wanted. I ask Y and Z for some insight, and they tell me that X is still pissed, and tell me that I should apologise in person, as it gives more meaning. So when I get home, I text X, asking them if they'd meet me somewhere at some time. No response. I go find X in the morning the next day, and ask them if they'd meet me somewhere. They said they'd rather not, and ignore any further attempts at conversation.

Later that day, I approach X's group and ask X if they'd talk to me outside. They disagree, saying I should just say what I wanted to say there, in front of everyone. I ask them why they started ignoring me constantly, and they reply that I'm way to sassy, and they didn't like it. This leads to me spewing one of the worst apologies I've ever made in my life, the main reasons being I get really nervous talking, or even doing anything, in or near groups of people, and I had to conjure things to say on the spot. 2 awkward, stutter-filled minutes of broken sentences later, they announce they need the toilet and walk off, and I'm left with the group, redder than a tomato, as Y would later inform me. 

To this day, X is still ignoring any attempt at communication, which is limited to text due to the current global situation, and I'm really on the fence on what I should do: If I should just stop trying and leave it be, or keep persisting to show that I actually care.

TL:DR :

So, should I keep trying to repair my friendship with X, and if so, what should I do?",12Apr2020,1

Whenever i used to ask to go for a trip or go to an expensive restaurant they would readily say yes and even force me sometimes to go. Now when i ask for money they started yelling at me for spending too much and how they can’t afford it as they are paying for my college. 

PLEASE let me explain further before you guys burn me to the ground. I was a topper in my school and wanted to pursue BFA degree(bachelor in finance and accountancy) and even got into two of the top colleges one with 92% scholarship. My parents had to pay about 200 dollars a year for my degree. Then my father lost it and forced me to go to an engineering college which cost about 8000 dollars. YESS that was the difference. 200 and 8000 dollars a year.

 I begged them to let me go to the one i wanted to go to but he didn’t listen. Fast forward 3 years and they keep an eye on every penny i spend in college. I asked my mother for some money to pay rent today and she completely lost it. 

I couldn’t take it anymore and i broke a chair and started shouting at them that how i tried to save them 32000 dollars yet they still blame me for suffering with money problems. I have a ton of work because i am not interested in my field and i have to study other things like designing and coding by myself. I don’t have time to track everything else. 

I just shouted at both of them and they called me mentally sick because of my OCD. I even got more furious but i left. And TRUST me when i say i have tried to talk to them about this stuff in a rational way but they just keep blaming me. And i am not saying i don’t spend money sometimes without any responsibility. I do but i never asked for this i was ready with the life i chose for myself but they forced me to come to an expensive place with an expensive degree WHICH WAS NEVER MY CHOICEE!!! and now they are blaming me for money problems. 

I am so angry right now i pushed my mother out of my room and told her how she just can’t do things like this and fix it instantly. I am very angry and impulsive right now. HELP.",12Apr2020,3

I think I've finally come to terms with the fact that I'll face lots of rejection, some inevitable and some my fault. I'm still a virgin and I practiced recently by going on tinder dates but I really didn't like the girls and I realized that I'm using the internet as a crutch to avoid the social anxiety of meeting people in public events that I feel I don't belong in.

But I realised I can't sleep, every time I closed my eyes I'd see something about her which was really unbearable. I was getting awfully sleepy and tried to force myself to stand it, worst idea ever. After like 5 minutes I woke up shaking, I was seeing (more like feeling there is) a pair of eyes looking at me, not human eyes more abstract and so very annoying, looking at me like blaming me, disappointed in me, it was like my brain telling itself that I will never forget the regret and never be a good human being, do anything good at all. I yelled at it, begged it to go away, it seriously was unbearable, wherever I look it was there, never leaving me alone, I started shaking and choking and stuff came out of my mouth. I had to call my sister and wake her up and tell her to call my mom because I couldn't scream for my mom

When I was younger, people had high expectations on me. I was always on the top 5% of students when it comes to academics. I always agreed to whatever my parents decided until college when I decided to take a course/major they didn't like.  This caused them -from my perspective- to be overbearing. I felt pressured so much that I just decided to be nothing. 
I stopped talking to people. I dropped out of college. Everything seemed to freeze for me. I started seeing the world in third person, just wanting to see what will happen next.   For 7 years I just had to sustain my physical body.   I found odd jobs like tending an internet cafe, working as customer service rep for just months, selling game cosmetics etc. I just made sure that I had I had enough money for the next 2 months meal. I just seemed to stop caring.

602," I was cleaning a small part of the floor with 90% rubbing alcohol when I decided to use bleach instead. I already had some diluted with a little bit of water in a bucket, got my mop and went over the area that was still wet from the alcohol. I was then stupid enough to decide to mop my whole kitchen with that mop as well as the hallway. I then noticed the smell was different than from what bleach normally smells like.

I went back to the area where I originally used the alcohol and it smelled more strongly there. I then used a wet cloth to try and wipe it off the floor but I decided It’s best not to be that near it. I got a clean mop and clean water and cleaned the hallway and kitchen twice. I only have two small windows but I opened them as well.

Right now I feel a bit nauseous and as if I can still smell it even though I’m on the balcony.

609,"So the title is a basic summary of our situation. My wife and I live below a very loud bunch of children. Now I understand that kids will be kids, but these kids are getting so loud and rowdy that everything in our apartment shakes. Things fall over. It's really next level. We're honestly pretty sure someone's going to get hurt.

I am on disability and my wife was laid off because of covid. So even if we could get out of the lease somehow, we can't afford to. Here's the thing, this didn't suddenly get worse. My wife was working all day but while I was home I'd hear it all the time, after 2 pm, earlier on holidays or I guess sick days? Whatever, the point is, it's a constant issue. About 3 months ago, I confronted the neighbor, calmly explaining that it was midnight and my wife had work in the morning. That stuff was falling off walls. She apologized, they quieted down for a few days. Then they went right back to it. With covid, it's gotten more frequent and now my wife is hearing it all the time too. It's starting at 8 and going on sporadically until 1 am.

Now one week ago, we filed a noise complaint with our apartment office. They said they talked to her, and for 2-3 days, they were quieter, except for some very passive aggressive sounding adult noises (vacuuming at 11pm). Forward to last night **BANG, THUD, BOOOOM, ""AHHHH, COME ON!"" BOOM.** It sounded like what could only be described as a reenactment of a WWE rerun. At some point one of them opened the patio door (we keep ours open for fresh air) and we could hear what sounded like fake wrestling talk. I had enough, so I went up again. This time I could hear the mother chatting with them while they ran around. So I knocked, and she comes to the door with this sharp as tacks ""what the fuck are you doing at my door at 11.30pm"" look and despite every urge to respond with an equal ""why the fuck are your kids wrestling at 11.30pm"" reaction, I calmy explained that I was sorry to bother them and they were knocking things off our shelves again. One of the kids was running around behind her in a buzz lightyear costume (imagine what he was getting up to). They made it till this morning. We filed another complaint last night, updated it this morning and it sounds like she got fed up and took them out somewhere.

I don't think it's over yet. With my disability already stressing me out to the max, this is setting me over the top. I feel like I'm losing my mind, my wife is miserably trying to bake banana bread and ignore it. I hate confrontation, and it was a miserable thing to do at all. What can we do? We considered police involvement, or maybe cps for the volume of the banging. Both seem so extreme for what is clearly an overwhelmed mother. We don't know what else to do. Even if the lease office agrees to let us move, it's not viable.

Edit: to add to this, I'm not totally sure it's the same neighbors, but a few months ago, the police showed up at our door because there was blood all over the hallway and stairs in our building. Apparently someone got rough up. Then a week later, someone threw a folding table and a clothes iron down the stairs. It might not have been them, but there's only 4 apartments up there, so it seems somewhat probable.",12Apr2020,2

612,"Cross posted in a couple subs for different audiences.

Sorry for the long post ahead, and the formatting - I’m on mobile.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life intermittently, but have felt I’ve generally combatted it well and been fine over the past few years, but the quarantine has me thinking maybe I haven’t.

I’m married and have moved from my home country to my husbands country and have lived here for the last 3ish years.

I feel like I have no reason to be depressed. My husband is amazing, thoughtful, funny, helpful and generally the best human ever. We have two kittens who always make us laugh and smile.

My husband’s main hobby is video games, that man can play for hours on end and never be bored or disinterested in the computer. While I find games fun, I can never find them stimulating for more than a couple of hours.

I often just watch tv and scroll on my phone. I feel like I have no true interest or hobby. I don’t have any desire to pick up yoga or exercise (though all of my in laws are into that, so I feel self-conscious that I should be into fitness), I don’t like painting or arts and crafts as I’m really bad at it, and I’m a perfectionist so to me it feels pointless to produce something if it isn’t good.

I did a masters in music and enjoy singing very much, but now I have a 9-5 office job and don’t feel like there’s any point in practicing the music as it will not be a career for me. I’ve looked into amateur groups in my area, but they’re either too amateur for me where I don’t feel there is a point, or too professional where I wouldn’t get in. I’ve looked into music theatre and opera groups in my area and even have inquired but have gotten blanked or told they aren’t holding auditions at this time. Even if I did do it, it would mean travelling into town a few nights a week which would make me tired for doing my 9-5 job so then I question if it is worth it.

All of this to say... I have a nice life, I’m financially stable and have a great husband. Yet somehow, I don’t feel like I have any deep friendships outside of my husband (all surface level) and I have no interests. This gets me questioning what the point of everything is... I just feel lost, I don’t want life to be like this forever as I can’t bear it. 

Sorry for the rant... I’m just not sure if this is normal quarter life experience or genuine depression.",12Apr2020,2

623,"So I'm a male and I was overseas for a while and I had a female friend who regularly kept in touch with me when I was overseas She initiated with me often and she told me if I needed anything at all to call her, especially during the last two months. Our last conversation while I was abroad was just 3 days before I came home, and she was the one to initiate and she even video chatted me.

She was telling me how we need to hang out, and if I need anything to call her. When I returned home I told her I was back. She replied good and thanked me. I asked her how she was doing and she didn't respond, but she was posting on facebook and replying to other peoples post and she left me on seen.

I figured I would just leave her alone for a while, and so I kept to myself. I posted on my facebook story and she reacted to my facebook story with a heart emoji so I tried to message her again but she still left me on read.

I was just surprised, and I'm not sure what happened when just 2 weeks ago she was initiating constantly, and telling me she wanted to hang out. I suspect it has something to do with her getting engaged. The last time we spoke she told me she was engaged and planning to marry her fiance in a year or two.

Suddenly the other day she posted something on facebook calling men trash and the fact of the matter is that I am a male. She didn't block her fiance but she unfriended him. So I see it as one of two possibilities either something happened between her and her fiance or she for whatever reason lied to me or changed her mind about contacting me. 

Either way I don't want to contact her anymore. Not because I'm angry but I'm afraid I will annoy her or scare her. Is that the best course of action should I just leave her alone?",12Apr2020,1

(We will call him Dan) We have been together for an embarrassingly short amount of time (just over a month) but we have been the best of friends for nearly a year, very similar sense of humour and personalities. Even still, I want to get out so badly. 

Things used to be going great :( we had an amazing friendship, Dan was your typical “nice guy”, who didn’t exactly get lucky in the looks department. He started telling me often that he liked me and wanted to be more than friends, every time this ended with a rejection. He KNEW that I didn’t see him in this way, despite this, he would ask me out at least once a fortnight. Other than this, he used to call me crying if he found out I went on a date or hookup with another guy. So yeah, I was definitely sure of myself that he was into me. Dan often blamed being unsuccessful in relationships because “nice guys finish last” and “girls only care about guys that will treat them like shit.” Yeah yeah yeah, heard it all. In my opinion, while he IS a great person, he isn’t exactly a desirable one. Yes. I know. It’s not all about looks, which is why I actually gave the man a shot. I thought about all the good times we have had together and felt like this could become a great relationship. 

That’s when I started having problems, like, immediately. Firstly, Dan’s interest in me really spiked to uncomfortable levels. He stopped showing his personality, Dan now lives and breathes Ella (that’s me!) every single thing he does is in the context of me. Every joke he makes will be an inside joke that only I will get, even if no one else in the group laughs or understands. He has to facetime me every second we are apart, and will complain as soon as I pause the call or my face isn’t showing. His friends have told me how when I’m not around, he constantly will comment about how much he misses me and wondering what I am up to. I understand how some of this is important in relationships, but trust me when I say that the amount of attention Dan needs is a borderline OBSESSION. I have sat him down and explained how this has been overwhelming me, but despite this he continues to have these expectations. This person completely idolizes me. He admits that he stalks my social media every day because I’m just “too perfect.” He tells me how much he is in love with me, how this has been the best year of his life and if I ever broke up with him he would kill himself (he has had a past history with depression, this worries me) did I mention it’s only been a few weeks of dating?!?!?!!

Speaking of high expectations, I find myself constantly in trouble with him, purposely getting a cold shoulder until I coddle him with attention again. For example, about 2 weeks ago we arranged to hang out when he finished work that night. He calls me, crying, telling me that he’s off work but he’s just going to drive home. I ask what’s wrong and he proceeds to yell at me, saying how he expected me to be waiting for him AT HIS WORK to finish, and because I wasn’t there waiting, there was no point in even bothering to hang out. I explain how this is simply RIDICULOUS because 1. There was no communication about me coming to his work ever being planned. 2. His workplace does not roster finishing times, you finish when you’re told. Therefore, there is a 4-5 hour window in which Dan could finish within, totally unreasonable to expect me to wait with that uncertainty. Even though I’m fighting back trying to get my point across, I got brushed off because Dan said “well I would do that for you.” Another time was when I chilled on the couch for like an hour or two on my phone and watching a bit of Netflix, when he got mad at me for “doing nothing” instead of coming into his room to cuddle him. I could go on, but this post is getting long enough. 

I’m tired. I’m so tired of pretending and I don’t see this getting better. I’m struggling to meet all his needs and I feel like I no longer have personal space. It is unhealthy to be in this pitty relationship and not fair for him to be lead on like this. I’m still not attracted to him and I never was. I cry after having sex with him because I don’t want to do it. I just wish we were still only just friends and I wish he never liked me. I have thoughts about wanting to be single. I’m young and probably extremely naive so please give me any advice you have. Im scared about the suicidal comments he makes about if I ever broke up with him. I want to break up with this person and I have never had to do this before. I’d hope that I’d still be able to go back to the way things were.",12Apr2020,1
628,"I’m gonna try to shorten this down.

3 years ago to the day, I told my dad I didn’t want to go to his wedding. He went ballistic and told my sister she couldn’t go either, then blamed my mum for it all. We were all very pissed off at this, and after weeks of fighting I decided to block him on all socials for a while. I didn’t block his number in case of an emergency, but he could no longer access my family and my social media accounts. His side of the family were very aggressive on Facebook, writing angry comments and the occasional death threat towards my mum. I gradually got more and more pissed off at him, and decided I’d take some time away. He began texting me - sometimes daily - trying to apologise or reason or beg me to come back, and occasionally just to make small talk. I switched off “Send Read Receipts” so he couldn’t see that I was reading his messages, which I soon realised was a bad idea. Anyway, weeks turned to months, then months to years. We moved away from the town in which his family lived, and tried to escape it all. I unofficially changed my surname, and started fresh at a new school. Somehow, hes still accessing reports and coming to my sports games and buying tickets to my band’s gigs. I feel like I’ve gone too long ghosting him, and think it might be time to grow a pair and make a decision.

What should I do? Text him, call him, visit him, or simply let him know that I’m receiving his messages?",12Apr2020,1
629,"So I’m a fourteen year old (I’m saying that because I am not sure whether or not it has to do with puberty). Every time I get a mild stomach ache or worse I get an erection.

I’ve heard that it could be that the inside of my stomach could be a point in my body that when pressure is placed on it, it gives me a boner?

630,"I need advice for this because our mom divorced my dad when I was like three, and I always had both of them. My little sister is about ten right now, and mom and her father (StepDad) are separated. Stepdad has about... four adult children or so, and he never talks to any of them and never talks about them, if you note me not even remembering how many other kids he has. He basically does the bare minimum while he's married to the mother and once they're apart he just vanishes out of the kids lives.

He's started on this with my sister and it's been hell for her. Mom begs him to make plans to see her, and then only does the day before fucking Easter when she's made other plans, and then says in front of my sister that Mom is partially to blame for communication problems. My sister has been crying because she can't understand why her dad doesn't come see her, and no, the reason isn't because of COVID. 

I know the best thing to do is to try to wait and see what she might need, but has anyone been in her situation that could give me any ideas as to what she might need? Any ideas on how to understand what she might be feeling? Is the answer just being around more myself to make up for Stepdad being a fucking dick?",12Apr2020,3
632,"I'm M, 23 and My mum is 59 and has been a long term alcoholic, longer than I've been alive. But recently shes been hitting it hard, most of the day.

She has had a serious heart attack late last year from the neglect shes had for her body over the years and has done nothing to change the way shes living. She has been struggling with memory issues which could be the early stages of dementia, however she keeps avoiding going to the memory clinic. Instead she just drinks. She complains about not being able to remember things, shes unable to do simple things like navigate through the TV ecs and has left the oven turned on a few times but I'm pretty sure its because shes wasted most of the time. Which is only adding to her fears that she is losing or has lost the ability to function.

She wakes up. Watches repeats of the same TV she always watches, tries to find something new, gets frustrated, goes out and buys alcohol and drinks herself into a stupor until 4am and then sleeps down stairs on the sofa. Now shes asking me to get her sleeping tablets because she can't sleep. But her sleeping pattern is all messed up because of her drinking and her anxiety is building because of her bad habits. And shes abused prescription sleeping tablets before. Taking multiple at a time. I've found her slumped over and unresponsive. I thought she was dead. Until her eyes flickered open and I managed to get her to tell me what had happened.

Don't get me wrong i understand the fear she has if it is dementia but I hate to see her self sabotaging because of her worries. I just hate to be around her when shes drunk. Its just awful. She can't function. She can't speak properly or express ideas or what she wants, but constantly pesters me to do things for her. Then gets angry when I try to figure out what it is exactly that she wants because she can't actually tell me. I just don't know how to help her. Especially with us being on lockdown. I don't think shes been entirely truthful with the doctors about her drinking. They know shes struggled with alcohol but I'm not sure to what extent. Shes got some really deep seeded issues that she refuses to tackle and just wants to isolate herself and drink. I just don't know what to do.

636,"Background: I tend to have these dreams that tend to be scary because they involve the people that are in my life. They’re not happy dreams of them randomly showing but are rather prominent characters throughout the dream. For example, my most recent was with my boyfriend and we went to sf together, where he then ditched me to go home by myself so I felt all alone in SF.

637,"Because this has some relation to COVID I can't post this in AITAH and while my friends either agree with me or are in the fence, I want some advice. Also TLDR at the bottom.

Me, my dad and my brother all live together in the same house since my mother walked out on us. There's a lot less abuse now though dad's Moody and often takes it out on us. Admittedly my brother and I don't always get along but it's because of his attitude, something even dad is taking issue with. My dad's coming down harder on me and other support fourms say that he's using a different form of abuse. This comes into play later.

You see, our birthdays are very close together,like weeks apart. My brother's is at the end of the month, my dad's the week after his, and mine the week after his... In exactly one month. Birthdays will be hard this year as we can't exactly go out and shop for gifts, and my dad may find a way to get birthday cards as a way to make up for it. But in short we won't get any gifts, but I suspect he'll give us money. Honestly I don't care if I do or not. I haven't liked celebrating my birthday since I was 16. Years of abuse from my mother and forgotten birthdays ruined it for me.

This year is oddly different though. For years I wanted to buy a switch and some games, but I never had the money. This year I managed to get work and I put $20 away each week so I could get one. Then I found out I'd get an additional week's pay at the end of the work term and I decided to put that towards getting a switch so at last I have the money. And before anyone asks, the employer said she was looking at hiring me once the virus starts to calm down so it looks like I'll have a job once things start to return to normal. And once I get that additional week's pay, I'll be applying for benefits like everyone else who's been laid off, so rest assured, I will have money.

Here's where I need advice. My brother never really wants or can think of anything for his birthday, and with essential goods getting priority for shipping, my only idea is to get him a game or something on steam and make him something for dinner. My dad never wants anything for his either so I was thinking about cooking him a dinner too since I doubt I'll be able to get them any cards.

The problem is mine. With the shortage of Switch Consoles, I've had a hell of a time finding one that isn't being scalped/gouged. Bestbuy is sold out online and the store closed, Walmart's online store is sold out (their online store isn't always accurate anyway) and Amazon... They have the switch, but scalpers are selling them for anywhere between $600+ CDN to $1,600+ CDN. I have however found a local store that has the console and game bundle in stock, but it's almost sold out. Unfortunately they won't sell it online, I can't pay online and I can't do curbside pickup. I'll be forced to go into the store in person this week to get it, if they're telling the truth and it's in stock/if they decide to still sell it. Trust me if I pay for it online and have it shipped to my house, I would.

I wanted one since it came out and I'm going shack happy in the house. Other than leaving for a doctor's appointment and to speak to my future employer, I've been home for the last 3 weeks since my work term ended. I'm the one paying for the console and I don't play on opening it until my birthday. My family has been at eachother's throats lately, with my brother copping a nasty attitude at times and our dad taking his frustration in life out on us. It's worse now since he's only working 2 days a week, and he sees me as a replacement spouse since my mother left, so I'm doing a lot of the cooking, cleaning etc. and have been since I was forced to drop out of school. His behavior was deemed sexist, and favoring my brother according to one friend and others think my dad is being abusive. Because of this and my depression getting worse because of it, I decided that this year I'll get my own present and that I deserve it.

The thing is dad will flip out for multiple reasons.

1. You didn't need it, do you spent money you didn't have (incorrect I have money and I specifically set aside money for this, and this has ALWAYS beennhis excuse when you buy something he doesn't like or think you should have)
2. Why did you buy yourself something and not your brother? (I can kind of see this as my brother wouldn't have a tangible gift, but instill plan on getting him a gift and making him dinner)
3. You're selfish! Don't you think about anyone but yourself? (Again heading out right now could be seen as that, especially bad I have no other option unless I give in to scalpers, but again, it's his normal go to excuse for when you don't behave to do what he wants you or thinks you should act. And considering I'm doing a lot of the meals, housework AND acting like his replacement spouse first and his child ocassionaly, while putting bup with his poor behavior,  I'd say I'm putting him and my brother first over myself. I think I'm justified bin doing something for my self for a change.
4. Aren't you a bit old for that? (I'm going to be 27, so what? You still enjoy putting on South Park and telling me that I'm not feminine enough while I'm trying to be comfortable with who I am.)
5. Couldn't you wait?  (Technically yes. Right now however, there's a switch shortage, and we have no idea when new stock will come or how long this virus will last. And even if I waited, he'd still use the fist 4 excuses on this list.)

There's more excuses, but those are his top 5.

I'd have to get it while he's at work and sneak it in the house. I can't reason with him at the best of times, even over silly unimportant things like the trashmen handling our greenbin roughly. I've started recording my brother and dad's behavior for the naysayers, it's getting that bad. So that rules out a civil conversation of ""it's my money, you won't let me pay you rent or help you financially""automatically.

I'm always putting him and my brother before my own needs and wants, so waiting until a better time or not being sneaky only puts me back in that ""putting their needs and wants before I look after myself"". Other than getting clothes after he relentlessly hounded me because he didn't like what I had at the time, the last time I actually got something for myself as a ""treat""/ did something for myself was over 3 years ago. The last ""major"" time I spoiled myself was almost 4 years ago, but I worked hard for it.

So what do I do?

Tl;Dr, after years of hating my birthday due to it being intentionally forgotten or ruined, I want to get myself a Switch and some games, especially since I put my family before myself. Even if I get them gifts/a card and make them dinner, he'll flip out basically because I'm spending money in a way he doesn't approve of.

Side note: I have little to no bills which I pay for myself, and no loans. He refuses to let me pay rent or help him financially. I have plans to move out once I have the funds to get a work visa/move to another country and I'm well on the way to that. Getting a switch with the money I set aside for it isn't going affect me financially.

Edit: for the automod:

I'm a 26F, will be 27 this time next month. My brother is 19/will be 20 at the end of the month. My Father is 64/will be 65 at the beginning of next month.

I live in Canada, and due to the medication limits/expected shortages, I can't go back on my antidepressants and my case is up in the air due to the therapist going off on maternity leave, and they don't know who's going to take it over, so I'm trying to cope with my depression and Anxiety as best as I can on my own. I also have a Non-Verbal learning disability that affects some social aspects of my life.

My mother walked out on us almost 4 years ago and started the divorce in February. She abused me and my brother, so we essentially cut her out of our lives.

I said I'm looking at a work visa/to move to another country, And I'm looking to move to Australia, though a friend suggested Singapore as a backup plan. I have a paralegal/legal assistant diploma and the equivalent of 1 years worth of IT studies, due to complications at the school. All my student loans were paid off so I have no debt. I'm already well on the way to being able to afford to move.",12Apr2020,1
639,"Sorry it’s long. TLDR at bottom. I lied to my boss, made up data, data got published. It’s a matter of time (maybe) until other scientists start doing the experiments and realize it’s fake, at which point they can tell my boss, my boss would be so mad that he would take away the letter of recommendation he said he’d write for me, and also inform the department. Once that happens—and yes I need his letter no question about it—I won’t be able to get into medical or graduate schools; med school was plan A, grad school was plan B, and they’ll both be out of the question.

Of course a part of me says I don’t deserve those fields because I was immoral and lack integrity. Another part of me says there’s nothing else I’d like to do, and I’ve learned my lesson. I suck at teaching (TAed and tutored), I suck at writing, and I’ve shadowed nurses and a PA and those careers didn’t interest me. Plus, I’d still need letters of recommendation from professors, one of which is my boss. I need his letter because I was stupid and didn’t get to know my professors. I asked 6 science professors and my boss (who was also my professor for some classes). 5 said no, 1 said yes, my boss said yes.

I have no clue what else to do. I thought about running away but there’s no where to go; I’d lose my career anyway. I thought of coming clean, but doing so would definitely jeopardize my career. I thought of acting dumb and pretending I just made an error in my original finding, but that wouldn’t fly because of the nature of the data and the lie.

So I effed up, put myself in this situation, and now I want to avoid the consequence because I’m a weak coward without integrity. I don’t want to kill myself, let that be clear. I’m stuck where I am with nowhere to go. Sitting here has made me paranoid and anxious. The thought of losing everything down the line makes me want to vomit.

TL;DR I lied to my employer which can jeopardize my future if found out. I’m trapped, anxious, paranoid, and depressed. I am not suicidal nor do I intend self-harm, and I can’t run away. I’m a weak coward.",12Apr2020,12

641,"   I'm a 22 year old guy and I'm starting to get confused on what I actually want to do, what I should be doing, what I'm missing out on etc etc...

   Lived at home until I was 19, moved around so much that I never made any long term friends, never started or had any sort of relationship, the only people I've ever hung out with or played with are my family members. Spent 2 years in college at home, had straight A's and was feeling confident that I wanted to pursue medicine. After those two years I had to move into the city because the campus at home didnt have the classes I needed. I was outside of my comfort zone, stopped going to classes , slept in at the dorms until 3pm with no one to hold me accountable except for myself, started realizing I don't like the sciences at all.

   I took a year off of college to try and find out what I want to do. I started my first job as a waiter at a sushi place, so my skills are limited to only that, since It's the only job I've ever had, and I'm only off there because of CoVID. I tried joining the Air National Guard to try and set me up with some discipline, realized that the whole one weekend a month work schedule would give me nothing in the long run, so I decided on active duty Air Force. I got right up until signing off to head out when I realized that the job I wanted and was booked for (Linguist) was going to take me so long to finish the contract (6 years) that I'll be 30 by the time I finish my bachelors degree, and college is something I really want.

   Last July I decided that maybe ROTC is the way for me. I'll be able to try to build discipline myself while also being in college, with a solid career path ahead of me. I'm going to be 23 by the time school starts but I'm not too worried about being older then the other guys. I love math and languages, so the plan is to dual major in math + one of the languages taught at the school, I'm fairly confident that is the path I want to take. When I decided that this was what I wanted to do, I was filled with a headwind that felt great, I was doing well at work, was going to the gym constantly, my brother came up and started living in my apartment with me so I wasn't lonely anymore and all was well. But right before college started I got hit by a car leaving the gym and had some pretty serious back issues that straight up said : No gym, No sitting for more than 10 minutes, No running . I was working and then sleeping for 4 months straight. Luckily for me it was all ligament and muscle damage and healed well. 

   Just started going to the gym again in January , started losing weight again, then CoVID happened and now I'm at home ruminating in awful feelings that I am looking for advice on.

  I'm 5'6 170 ibs , muscle has gone down and I've got a gut building, definitely not in shape for ROTC that I'm signed up for this August and I feel like its time for some self improvement, coupled with a few other aspects of my life that need a little help, I'm here to see if there is anyone that has any advice or roads I can take for a few parts of my life here and there.

  \--Like I said, I'm a little on the hefty side at the moment, maybe 20 lbs more than my ideal I   
think, What can I do to work on this while locked down? I am also extremely picky at eating,   
and ever since I started living alone I haven't been able to stomach any vegetables. Trying to   
grow out of this is hard, Its 100% a mental block stopping me from eating them and I dont   
know how to get past that besides brute force, and that seems like a bad idea.

  \-- When I said that I've never been in a relationship before, I've never so much as even held   
   hands with a girl before, super behind the curve on that one. Its  embarrassing and I don't   
   know where to start. At this point in time women are a complete alien to me, and I don't even   
   know if I want to have a partner, It's been almost 23 years, if I'm not broken now I must not be   
  missing out on too much. Any advice on how to start, or if maybe just leaving that alone to sort   
  itself out is the best option?

 \-- I'm extremely poor cleaning my place. Not gonna lie here, this one   
seems the easiest to fix, I just leave dishes in the sink, pans out on the stove, bottles and cans   
on my desk etc. Does anybody have any tips on general hygiene in general? I grew up without   
a mom and my sister was the housework person of the house, and I no longer live with her   
soo...

 \--- Lastly , my self confidence is pretty low. I'm short at 5'6, I have a receding hairline that spooks   
me since I'm only 22, all I do all day is play video games at home and go to the gym for an   
hour 5-6 times a week. Since I've never been in a relationship, the only positive reinforcement   
I've ever gotten has been from my sister, and compliments from family don't really mean   
anything, even if they are genuine, to me. I don't know where to start in order to build up   
some gonads... I thought about starting online dating, but I hear that if you have low self-   
   esteem and it doesn't go well you get burned out for life, and that scares me

now i'm off from school and thinking of her. i reached out to her just to see how she's doing and we caught up a bit. but i feel like she's keeping me a bit at a distance and just talking to me to be nice but maybe isn't actually interested in reconnecting (i could be reading into this , i tend to do that). i don't blame her - i basically abandoned her during her time of need and even when i found out about her health issues i didn't regularly check in because i was so ashamed of myself and so unsure of how i could even help, being so far away. i am disgusted with myself but i love and miss this person. i totally wouldn't blame her at all if she didn't want to be my friend (she helped me w/ some school stuff i struggled with a few years ago and i wasn't there for her, that's really awful of me) but i do want to at least try. i want to ask about her health because i'm worried about her with this covid situation, but would it seem weird and intrusive and not my place? if it's ok for me to ask, how should i go about it? and should i apologize again for not keeping in touch? i did when i reached out to her earlier this week and don't want to overdo it, but i feel really terrible for being such a bad friend.",12Apr2020,1

OS was on my bed eating chips and watching YT videos on the laptop, and it kinda annoyed me so I told her that if she wanted to eat chips she should get off of my bed. She declined so I asked her repeatedly to get off of my bed. I started reaching for the chips trying to stop her from eating and getting crumbs on my bed. She held it away from me, once I realized my efforts were futile I took the laptop, (the one i'm using right now) and hid it. She said she didn't care if I took it away. I asked her to get off of my bed one more time and when she declined once again I tried pulling her off of my bed, she tried to pull back so she could stay on my bed. Once she finished her chips she just put them on the stand and looked at me smugly and went to my other sister's room to sleep there.

  I thought that was the end of it, she came back to brush her teeth, I opened the door slightly to give her the toothbrush, she pushed past me and put a caprisun on the stand as well and made this smooch face and did the peace sign. She provoked me and talked about me and my breath. I grabbed my water bottle and attempted to pour water on her which barely even touched her. She got mad and started to pour water from her own bottle on me, even choking me with it. I thought that was the end of it but she started punching me and hurting me. She went to go lock the door, not done with me yet.  She tried pulling me off the bunk bed to try and hurt me more conveniently. When she realized she couldn't do this she just jumped on the bed and punched me again and again, of course I kicked back trying to get her off of me and she even hit her head on one of the cabinets, but she just kept coming.

  She got her hands on the digital alarm clock that was wrapped up with the plug and hit me with that. She flailed the plug at me, at the point I couldn't do anything because she was far from me but she was still hitting me with the plug so I hid under my blankets. She still kept hitting me and calling me names like ""fat-ass."" I thought the whole family could hear my screams except but the only people who heard them was my 22 year old sister and my 16 year old brother.

When my OS got finished with me she went to go brush her teeth and sleep in my other sister's room and complain to her about me. I immediately broke down when she left and stayed there on the floor digging a pencil into my legs. I stayed up to about 4 either digging a mechanical pencil into my legs. I woke up at about 7 and didn't go out til 12 to greet my father. My sister tried to justify herself to my dad and explained everything.  My dad seemed to not care and only deemed it as ""blah blah blah."" I tried to tell him what she'd done in more detail, he'd said he'd fix it but when he says that, I can tell you that he doesn't do anything. Now i'm crying while writing this.

651,"Okay i have these options and I will also be including some arguments for and against.

I will not base my choice solely on your suggestions but I am looking for some insight.

1) Engineering 

+ I really like Robotics, mechanicals stuff, technical stuff, also am good with logic and computers

- I dont have experience in this field (except some basic arduino stuff), i also really dont know what the work will be like. The uni i could go to is not one of the top unis for that field(this applies to everyone of these i guess)

2) Business Management

+ I went to a hospitality/business school before and definitely like the thought of haveing the ability to work in a lot of different fields and maybe opening your own business, I have a quite good understanding of how business works

- I really like changing, creative work, a lot of business practices piss me off

3) Law

+ I had law as a subject in my finals and aced it without studying. I also really like the small intricacies you get with different laws having different sub clauses  and stuff

- Lawyer work really seems boring and repetitive for me, it also is a really competitive field i think and I am someone who cares more about knowing his stuff than his grades.

4) Computer Science

+ Am always the guy to get asked about anything computer related and even have some very very programming experience and I quite liked it.

- don't know how to code and dont want to be one of those weird guys that seem to be only studying it for the big buxxx, also dont know if a desk job in the computer industry is right for me. Is there research in this field?

Any other suggestions are also really welcome. Maybe also some concrete examples what you can do with those degrees! 

Cheers, Deimos!",12Apr2020,1
652,"I’m a 24-year-old male (25 in a couple of months). College graduate, excellent job, minimal debt, my own car and home. I have a girlfriend of five years that I’m about to marry.

My childhood was awful and I have wanted kids since I was like 16, no joke. I remember making baby names and actually planning it with my high school gf, but I decided to finish my schooling first to be a better provider.

I’ve been out of school three years and I have been on my job for two years. It’s a financial firm that will do well and exist regardless of economic boom or downturn. The volatility of the virus actually increased my pay and job security. 

Every time I tell my GF or family members I want to start a family, I get scolded about how young I am. How I need to go out and travel and find myself. I do not view life like that, though. I like the career I’m in. I do not care for traveling at all. I traveled constantly in my last position from Colorado, to NYC, to San Francisco, to Peru. I hated every moment and just wanted to be back in my southern state. My only desire in life is to have a home, a family and give them the things I never had. I want to buy real estate and other assets just to pass it to them solely because no one in my family has been able to do that. I don’t value what other people my age usually do. I guess I have the more “loser” mentality that people talk about.

I work remotely. I do not care about waking up in the middle of the night to tend to my daughter. I’m up at 2 AM smoking weed and studying anyway. Money is not an issue. I don’t mind the patience and the sacrifice it takes. We have to babysit my cousins’ toddlers for several days sometimes, and I love it. I feel so fulfilled, even with the annoyances that came along with it. Crying, screaming, diapers, don’t bother me at all. I love loading them in the car to get ice cream and teaching them stuff. I feel empty when they leave.

I talked to my gf about having one now and she states that she is too young and wants to wait until around 32. She states that she has too much she wants to experience. This caused a big argument for us because I don’t want to be in my 30s with a newborn. It’s something I worked hard towards just to have to wait almost another decade, AGAIN. Her friends, her family, and even my family are on her side and telling me I don’t know what’s good for me, even though I literally make 3x the salary and have 10x the free time of everyone telling me this.

I understand her perspective and we are working it out and compromising, but am I really crazy for wanting kids? It’s strange how it was the norm decades ago, but I’m treated like a selfish prick for wanting one in my mid-twenties.",12Apr2020,0
653,"\- throwaway account, on my original one I have friends following... -

There were 2 times were a man told me that from the side profile I look like a girl, once even one of my female teachers complimented my looks, but then ruined my mood saying that it's surprising that I'm also more beautiful then girls from my year (i still hope it was jokingly)... And a friend even keeps teasing me about it ever since it started, it became his habit to ask all the new dudes that come in our group to rate my looks.

It started 2y ago when I was 17 and I lost a lot of weight and I began to be more confident in my looks, but the problem is that this thing keeps lowering my self-confidence even more then when I was fat.  I even deleted photos of me, I only use 1 photo on social media and such being a full body with my face showing just a little...

Dunno what to do, one day I feel confident if I'm complimented, but then 1 week I'm depressed and extremely self-conscious when I hear the above...",12Apr2020,1
656,"I'll start by giving some background here. I'm currently a 21 year old attending Texas A&amp;M University. I grew up out of state raised by only my father (who didint attend college) so there was obviously a lot of pressure for me to go. I did will in highschool and really strived but I was always pushed to go into engineering (not what I wanted) so I got forced into engineering school to not disappoint my father. I got accepted and he sold the farm and we moved to Texas to be closer to college. Freshman year a lot happened; head injury, mother passed away; etc. I dropped engineering and changed majors. I contracted through my University with the Marine Corps to be a officer once I graduate. Here's where I need help.

School is very depressing for me, I'm not in the major I want or even doing anything that remotely interests me, therefore school just is depressing and it's hard to get excited for anything. I love health and Nutrition, it's my passion, I'd probably graduate early if I could study that, but I can't cause it's too late. My father is very pushy, hes always told me what's right and wrong in my life and pushed really hard for me to go into engineering that I think he killed it for me. I'm not happy with my life, school is depressing and I genuinely don't want to attend anymore. I planned on taking the Marines into a career (20+ Years) anyway, so I wouldn't use my major. I have a beautiful girlfriend who is also doing the same thing with the Marines and we've been through everything together. I've been looking at enlisting and doing my time there then possibly attending school after a few years in and actually pursuing the major I want. That means I would have to drop out of my ""dream college"" and tell my father I want to enlist in the Marines. I'm really scared of what he'd say or that fact he would disown me or kick me out or idk. He's very unsympathetic towards my emotions. The only real rock I have in my life is my girlfriend of 3 years. 

I've had multiple friends that enlisted in the Marines out of highschool and now they're out doing college and have perfectly fine lives. I would l love to do the same, get a degree in what I actually enjoy, and pursued health and Nutrition. What should I do? How do I talk to my father? What do I do if he disowns me or kicks me out?

666,"I need some help. My girlfriend is not in a very good place right now. She is 15 and struggling with a lot of things. Homelife sucks, her parents make her constantly think she is doing stuff wrong, new rules without telling her that she is punished for breaking, etc. She has been told she is a drag on the family. She has also been through some manipulation but we have worked that out. Now she is struggling mentally. She doesn't self diagnose and with the world how it is it is kind of hard to get actually diagnosed, but from the things she describes it sounds like depression. She has also done self harm. A scary amount. She isn't doing it for the attention because she keeps it completely hidden, I only know because I begged her to tell me what was happening. 

Now for the kicker. She can't tell this stuff to her parents. The last time they did they said she was faking and that she needed to grow up. They are strange people and it is clear they would not be willing to help. She has also tried suicide help hotlines but has apparently been left on hold for 40+ mknutes and she gave up

I need advice. She claims i'm the only person she trusts. I need to know how to help her. Is there any personal feeling online therapy options? Or other ways to help someone struggling with depression or similar? Does anyone know of any better coping mechanisms than cutting or drugs? I have been trying to help on my own and it hasn't been working. Any advice truly does help.",12Apr2020,2

668,"So a few months ago I broke up with my boyfriend of four years. It was for the best, but I have been worried about him since we broke up. I knew that even before we met he struggled with depression and sometimes suicidal thoughts. He often said he didn't really have anyone to talk to about it. I kind of knew that once we broke up he would take it hard, so I felt (still feel) very guilty about it. I have talked to him several times since we broke up because I want to help and make sure he won't do anything bad, but there's only so much I can do. 

Now he's starting a new job in a new town, which can be hard for anyone, plus there's all this quarantine stuff happening so he's very isolated. I can't go back to being with him just because I'm scared of what he might do to himself, but I worry about him a lot. This morning I was on my computer and saw that his chrome account was still logged in and he has been looking up suicide info like how to write a suicide note. Of course now I am even more concerned. 

I know that me just talking to him about it is not going to be very helpful, but I'm not sure what to do from here. He's 24 years old, just moved out of his parents' house. I thought about contacting them to see if they can get him some help. But I'm not sure if that is the right course of action, like if it would make him feel like I betrayed him by telling them or something, therefore making it worse. I just feel like I'm the only one who knows how bad his depression is and I can't be there for him the way he wants me to but I have to do something.

The amount of times he has been involved with police, drinks, and drugs is too high. He is fit and tall and no one can fight him. My family dosen't ever want the police involved even when he is threatening us, making astronomical noise, or destroying things. He expects us to like him but its only my mom who tolerates him and does what he wants because she is getting old and dosen't want stress. I'm tired of him and am going into high school next year. I am guessing he won't be gone for 8 years and will continue to harass us but almost everyone in my family dosen't want him here. A lot of people think our family is peaceful but it isn't.

678,"Even though 2019 wasn't the best year so far, it was far better than 2020 has been this far.
I'll try and explain this as best as I can.
Last year I was diagnosed with depression, and finally began to be medicated [Sertralina Zentiva 50mg], and my goal for last year was to enter college in the major I wanted. Which I did, with flying colors.
Everything was okay, I was getting better. My anxiety was getting better and so was my depression.

The first semester didn't go incredibly well. That is because I moved 3 times in that time span. So I thought I'd do better when I was finally settled in my college dorm in January and would get my loge together and pass this semester with good grades.
And everything was going fine.

Until mid  February. My grandpa wasn't doing well before, but now he was even worse.
And let me explain. My grandpa is the most precious person to me. He took care of me since I was just a couple of weeks old while my parents would be working. He was always supportive and just the best person.
I was already worried constantly about his condition, but nonetheless I was trying to do my best at college.
Unfortunately, my grandpa passed away on the 27th of February. I missed about a week of college because I had to be back at my hometown.
I did get to say my goodbye and all that.
But still. I lost my most important person.

Of course it's normal to feel down after losing someone.
The thing is, then this pandemic started, some issues between my mom and my grandmother keep happening, and I am just generally very stressed and depressed.

I feel like I've gone into a depressive relapse of some kind. Whilst I could get up and attend my online classes for the first month or so [I've been having them since March 9th] now I don't have the energy to.
Even the classes I loved.

I am ignoring my responsibilities and throwing my college performance down the drain and that just worries me more. But instead of making me want to do better, I just feel more depressed.

I don't know what I should do... It's not easy to see my psychiatrist or talk to a therapist.
I also considered emailing my professors. But I am not sure if they would understand. We're all going through a hard time after all...

I'm sorry if this post seemed confusing. I'll answer any questions you all might have about what I just said.
Thank you.

She basically told me how great, driven, and funny a guy I was (those words) but she was not attracted to me and did not ever see anything happening ever. 

I appreciate her honesty but right now I feel a bit worthless, a lot more ugly and unlovable. My last girlfriend basically walked all over me all the time then dumped me and got with a new fellow within two-three weeks.

My friend she admitted to liking other people before she said she was never attracted to me. She admitted to almost dating her friend. And I realized, well yes she can date anyone she feels like, *even* her friends because few people would turn her down... Not me though.

685,"Hi reddit, I need some advice.. 

Female 23 

Recently my mom has been trying to plan my whole future. She tells me I have to marry within my ethnicity (I am asian), she says I have to buy a house right after working for 2 years. I told her that I will definitely not marry an asian because I’m not into them and also because I have a wonderful amazing boyfriend who I’ve been with for 5 years now that I plan to marry, but they don’t know that. 

The reason why I haven’t told them is because I know it’s against their wishes and I do live with them and will make living there hell and mainly because my dad threatens me, I don’t wanna go into the crazy threats but it’s pretty horrific what he’s said. They said I have to buy a house, said it was better for me for the future but I don’t see it that way. 

The way I see it is, they want me to get a house so they feel safe for the future. In asian tradition if you have a son the son would get married and buy a house and take care of the parents in the future. Like letting them live in their house until the day they pass and the daughter usually lives with her husband and his family. Well, my brother got married and he left bought a house and doesn’t want them anywhere near it... he broke that tradition therefore my parents are looking at me to fill that position. Everyday my dad would say “ your brother is useless, now we have to look at you.” 

When my mom told me I have to get a house, I said for what so you guys can live in it? And she got mad and said “if you don’t want to live with us then get a house with two floors,  we can take the second floor you take the first that way we are living apart.” And that’s why I think me buying a house is for them really not for me. 

What I need advice on is, I love my mom she’s not the problem. The problem is my dad. My brother wants nothing to do with them due to my dad. And I’m getting to that point especially after staying months with them inside 24/7 during this quarantine. I work in a clinic and wanted to go to work, I told them I would be going and would be protected, my mom was okay with it but my dad responded with “ I’ll chop your legs off if you step foot outside.” “ you’re useless, I got two kids and both are useless.” “ You don’t think about me and your mom how you’ll infect us, we can die.. would your life be that much better that you want us to die?” I argued back that they had protective gear and my manager explained everything to me, but he wasn’t having it. Ultimately I ended up not going and crying my eyes out. I realized that I can’t live with them in the future, I dont want to. I don’t want to have a curfew whenever I want to stay out late, I don’t want my parents constantly asking me to do things for them, I don’t want permission or let them know every time I want to do something, holding me back from what I want to do. And lastly, I don’t want to have my dad there as I’m holding onto everything he’s said to me, I want to grow and I don’t feel like I will if I end up living with them. 

So, how do I break it to my mom that I don’t want her planning my whole future, that I don’t want them living with me because in their mind they think 100% that I’ve got them covered. And I know this will break her heart, which was why I haven’t said anything to her",12Apr2020,6

My sister is 26 n has a 2 year old. She lives with my granny (75 year old) for 2 years. Makes my granny take care of her child. She lives for free doesnt even buy food for her child. She gets a 6 digit salary. And child no go to daycare. 

Shes been working at home due to coronavirus and its best because my granny has diabetes, 1 lung that no work so she can easily catch coronavirus/more at danger. 

My sister left her child in her room late at night. My granny didnt know she was alone with the child. She hears child crying at midnight and figures the mom will take care of it. 30 minutes later she still crying. My granny go in room and see the baby alone. She was shaken. She calls the mom and she ignores all her calls. She came home at 3-4am and my granny was so shaken and confronted her. 

Im shaken for the child. You shouldnt leave a 2 year old alome in a house and not tell the only person whos home about it. I dont trust her with this child when she moves out. When there will be absolutely no one. 

She also only eats junk food and cooks cakes only if she ever cooks and she gives donuts as breakfast to the child. Since the mom home my granny not taking care of the child. But she tells me she doesnt know what that poor child eats as theres no food and she no buy/cook food. 

I told my mom and she tells me that all i should do is pray that she changes and that we cant do anything about it. 

Im shaken. Shes being an irresponsible mother and shes putting my granny at risk on catching the virus since she going out to see people. 

My granny told her many times to move out and she just yells at my granny and never moves out. 

I confronted my sister about it and she says to mind my own business. 

Everyday i call my granny it seems the stories keep getting worse and worse and im scared something drastic will happen to my neice or granny. 

Would you call child services?",12Apr2020,13
689,"I am the only English speaker in my town. I have an intense history, but I don't wish to speak about that. My current mental health is deteriorating rapidly. 

I live alone in a mansion, I'm not rich, it's a peculiar thing. This is the only place to rent, I'm the only one that can do this job here. I am isolated, and I have always been mentally unwell. At this stage, it is bad. I max out my bikes speed, not caring. I throw and break things. I am cracking. I just need to vent.

My story:
Born. Sister died of cancer. Folks lost the big house. Moved to suburbs. Poor. Folks became alcoholics. Witnessed intense violence my whole life. Watched the hair get torn from my mom's head. My father was a bad drunk. Never hurt me directly. But indirectly, I got rode over by his car, people passed out on me while I slept including him. My mom is...I don't know. Some parts OCD, some parts bipolar. I was emotionally abused until right now. I was never told of her condition, I finally figured it out for myself in my twenties.

I got a job at a bar. I was a barman for ten years. It was a biker bar. I've been addicted to every drug there is. Not now. Not hard stuff. I smoke or drink every day, for 12 years now I have not been sober before I've slept.

There's too much to say.

I moved countries, sacrificed everything. Now I am in Vietnam. I found a better life. But then Corona. Since Feb I have been isolated in my home. I live in a 5 bedroom mansion. But there are no English speakers in my town.

I have just stopped taking SSRIs a few days ago, and my mind is falling apart.

I ride my bike with my eyes closed. I throw my things around my house. I slap myself as hard as I can, and break what I can.

694,"Throwaway account due to my main account being very open, and I don’t want this embarrassment to be traced back to me. 

I used to be best friends with this girl in middle school. We’ll call her Jasmine. 

It was my first day in a new state, at a new school. My parents had just moved me to Oregon from New York. Her and I instantly hit it off when she asked if she could sit next to me in class. 

Throughout the course of our friendship, I always felt like a sidekick to her. Never an equal. Since I was the new girl and she already had friends since she grew up here, I considered her my best friend, but to her I was her second best friend. Her main best friend was Amy. 

I thought that Jasmine was my best friend, but she would always lie to me. She would show up to school in matching clothes with Amy, and then tell me that it was a truly a coincidence (which later on in life she admitted that it was preplanned), she would go to the mall with Amy after school (but would tell me that she’s going home), just little lies here and there. 

I knew that she wasn’t the nicest person after she let me walk 3.5 miles home late at night when I was 11 or 12. We had just finished hanging out at her house and it was late. For some reason, she didn’t want to ask her dad to take me home. Her dad was one of the sweetest person I have ever met, so I know he wouldn’t have been upset had she asked him to take me home. My parents didn’t want to pick me up (I had deadbeat parents), so I had to walk home by myself. She told me to never tell her dad that she had let me walk home that night, because he would be angry that she didn’t ask him to drive me home. She lived in an unsafe neighborhood on top of a hill, and I got lost for what felt like forever because it was pitch black dark. It was also during winter and freezing outside. Eventually, I made it back home. 

The turning point in our friendship, was when she and Amy had done something illegal together. After her parents found out, they forbid her from hanging out with Amy to which we became closer afterwards. After middle school she moved to a different city, but we still hung out frequently and talked all the time. 

After high school, we were still close. She wasn’t a good friend, but I kept her around because I didn’t have any other friends. Best friends are supposed to be there for each other. It always felt like I was there for her, but she was never there for me. Whenever I would talk about an issue with my family, it’d be like “yeah, that sucks. Onto me now.” She worked at Victoria’s Secret, but didn’t want to help me get a job there. When I got a call for an interview with its parent company, she told me not to go because I was just going to waste my time and that they weren’t going to hire me (they did end up hiring me). 

The downfall of our friendship was when I got fed up with her, and I texted her calling her a fake ass bitch. I was going through a rough patch with my boyfriend at the time, and we were supposed to get lunch and catch up. She blew me off saying that she got called into work (which I was very understanding about since work comes first), but then I see her Snapchat stories of her hanging out with her boyfriend and other friends. I felt so betrayed and fed up. It felt like middle school all over again. After I called her fake and explained to her why I did so, her response was that “they called me in, but didn’t need me so I went hiking with friends. I don’t need to update you on every aspect of my life so that you don’t get upset.” I told her that her story didn’t make sense. Why would her employer call her in, then say never mind we don’t need you. If that were true, why couldn’t she just text me and say “hey, they didn’t need me at work, but my boyfriend wants to go hiking with friends. Mind if we reschedule?” If she had said that, I would’ve been completely understanding about it. It just felt like a knife to the back finding out through her Snapchat stories. 

I forgot to mention that we rarely ever fought with each other before all of this. There was a point where we were no longer friends in middle school because she decided she would rather hangout with the popular kids. She and these bullies cut my hair during lunch, and then she regretted it after it happened. She begged me not to tell her parents because they would be very angry if they knew what she did, and I always kept my promise to her. 

When this downfall happened, I thought that we would not talk to each other for a few days and then make up. She never texted me, and I refused to apologize first. Eventually, she moved on with her life as if our friendship never meant anything to her. We were close and told each other everything, and then we suddenly became strangers. I reached out to her a year later to apologize, and her response was “I accept your apology, but I don’t think that things can go back to the way they were. I wish you nothing but the best.” I explained that we could take it one step at a time, and she never responded. I texted her a couple times afterwards, and it was radio silent. 

The last time I texted her was on her birthday in 2018. I gave up on looking desperate after not getting a response back. Sometimes her Instagram would come up as a recommended, to which I would take a look at her profile. She seems to be thriving in every aspect, and I really miss our friendship. It’s been about 4 years now, and she has tons of friends. How do I move on from all of this? She was my only friend, and now I have no one. I have 0 hobbies and 0 interests, so it’s hard making friends. Even when I do make friends, it always seems to be temporary. I haven’t had a best friend ever since her, and I feel so lonely. Sorry for the long read, and I appreciate every advice anybody has! 

TL;DR had a best friend in middle school, we got into a huge fight after high school, thought we were going to make up in a few days/week, she never texted me again and moved on with her life, I can’t stop thinking about our friendship 4 years later.",12Apr2020,1
695,"Throwaway. My (26F) boyfriend (28M) is graduating university with his undergrad in May. Before this pandemic began, he was excited to graduate and wanted to find a full-time job so that he could help me more with bills. We are renting a house together. I have a good job and I pay roughly 75% of the bills, agreeing to do so until he graduates with the expectation being he'd share the bills once he finds a full-time job. It was a finite amount of time, so I didn't mind.

Now that the pandemic started and things are going to be difficult ahead, it feels like he has completely thrown in the towel about finding a job. Basically ""whelp, nothing I can do, no where is hiring."" He even started smoking weed again, which he had stopped prior so that he could pass job drug tests. 

The other day he randomly told me he was just going to go to graduate school right after he graduates so that he wouldn't have to worry about finding a job, and can push off paying back student loans. I told him that was a bad idea because I need help with the bills, even if we are in a pandemic. To make matters worse, my employer said I will be laid off around August because we are being acquired. So, he's fully aware that I will be out of a job later this year and will be in the same boat as him.  When I told him that's a bad idea given the circumstances, he understood and agreed, but he still hasn't made any steps towards finding a job. I feel like he's avoiding it altogether. I have already found a couple of jobs that are doing remote interviewing that I plan on applying for.

I've asked him if he's made a LinkedIn account: No. Have you contacted your school for employment assistance? (which his school is known for): No. Have you looked to see if your university has networking/career resources on their website? No. Have you looked for jobs online? No. 

We can't afford to just give up because it's challenging, no matter how much this sucks and is stressful. I told him that I feel like all of the pressure is on me to be able to pay our bills. He said he understands and he's stressed out about finding a job, yet he's not doing anything to help himself or me.

It's been a tough year. His grandpa died a few months ago and now the pandemic is scary and disheartening. He says this year is the worst year of his life so far. I know he's not feeling the best. I'm not feeling the best either. Am I wrong for pushing him to find a job?",12Apr2020,1
696,"So my sister recently decided to move home from where she was living because of a break-up, and she's not able to work currently. She is supposed to move in with our parents, but our parents are forcing her to isolate in a hotel for a week, just to be safe, because she was living in a house with multiple other young people, who weren't observing the 'shelter-in-place' rule.

Now, a few days into her isolation period, I see her social media posts with multiple people having a party in her hotel room. 

I am fully aware that this is a tough time for her, and that she wants to be social, and certainly doesn't want to move back in with my parents, but I'm not sure how to tell her that I'm incredibly disappointed that she isn't taking this seriously, and that my parents would be furious if they knew what she was doing in the hotel room that they paid for. 

Does anyone have some advice on how I should broach the subject with her, without straight up telling her that she fucked up? Or without ratting her out to my parents?
Thanks.

Edit: I am a 26YO M, and an essential worker right now, so as you can imagine, I've been working overtime and observing a lot of extreme precautions at work, which, needless to say, makes me pretty angry to see her doing all of this.

697,"My boyfriend loves porn and loves jerking off to it when it's my time of the month, when we're apart or when I'm just tired, which is fine with me - we've watched it together plenty of times too. I don't mind him watching porn. UNLESS it gets to the point where I feel like he's choosing porn over me. And recently, that's how it's been feeling. 

So the other day we were having sex for a while and he got ""tired"" and said he was taking a break. and then he pulled out his phone and started watching porn and jerking off. I got upset because like...? He literally just stopped having sex with me to watch porn. And then 1-2 days later we had amazing sex. It was great. But then he wanted to go again like 30 mins after (which I was all for it) but he pulled out his phone and watched porn so he could get hard. I got annoyed and took that as me not being enough for him to get hard again, but i didn't say anything and just let him do it and then we started having sex again. But he kept getting soft like every 5 minutes. and it kept happening and kept digging at my self esteem. Finally, I got really upset and said I was done having sex and I left the room and started crying while he was watching porn to finish himself. This has made me feel so insecure and I have refused to have sex with him since then. I can't bring myself to get turned on by him now because I just feel so weird and grossed out. I have never been grossed out by him watching porn but now I am and I feel bad because I don't want to make him feel ashamed for watching it. But at the same time, I feel like he is choosing it over me and its making me not want to have sex with him anymore. It's making me feel horrible about myself. 

**TLDR:** I'm feeling like I'm not enough for my bf to get hard anymore because he keeps getting soft and then watching porn in the middle of us having sex. It seems he would rather watch porn and jerk off than have sex with me.

**Am I overreacting? What would you do in this situation?** I have brought it up to him but all he says is ""oh my god of course i'd rather have sex with you than watch porn"" and he gets annoyed and makes me feel like I'm overreacting which maybe I am.

698,"I have been going to therapy for 2 years now, but I'm still struggling with many things. My parents said that if I don't get my act together, I won't be going to college, which of course I understand but I'm also nervous and afraid. I need help becoming more flexible, less argumentative, a better listener, more vulnerable, better at taking things seriously, better at taking responsibility for my actions/mistakes, and better at asking for help. If I could get all of these things under control, I'd be proud and comfortable being myself. If I am doing something, there's a good chance I'm doing it alone, even if I need help. If I'm struggling emotionally, there's a good chance that I'm dealing with it alone. For example, I never told anyone in my family about my first girlfriend, nor the break up that happened six months ago. If I am told how to do something, given instruction, or told constructive criticism, there's a good chance I'm arguing against it. If someone suggests a better alternative way to do something, other than what I had in mind, there's a good chance I'll not even consider it. If I make a mistake, even if it is obviously my fault, I'll pass the blame on to someone else. I wish I didn't do these things, and I don't know why I do these things.

701," I've  been living in my apartment for a year now. It's a new building,  however the walls are not that soundproof. Family that lives above me  (couple and their middle-school son) has been loud since the beginning,  so as soon as I moved in I knew we would have issues with them, but  until now it was only loud talking and obnoxious behavior during the  day, which is fine by me - it's your appartment, you can do there  whatever you want as long as you don't harm yourself or others.

For  me the problem starts during the night. In our block of flats the  ""quiet time"" is from 10 pm until 6 am. Small note from my side - I am  very proud of my sleep schedule, I usually go to sleep around 10-11 pm,  and wake up more or less at 7 am without an alarm clock, and I REALLY  enjoy it. Since the quarantine started, I do not enjoy going to sleep, I  can even say that it's my least favorite time of the day, because I  have no idea what those people will do this time. For the last 3-4 weeks  I've been on 5-6 hours of sleep a night.

First  and foremost, the father has a VERY loud voice, I can hear clearly what  he is saying most of the times . Unfortunatelly, they decided that  their favourite time for discussions is 11 pm until 2 am, and they do it  almost everyday. They play music which is very annoying, because the  volume is not loud enough to call it a ""party"" and call a police, but  loud enough to make it impossible for me to ignore it. Another thing is  their footsteps... My God I didn't know a human could walk so loudly!  How many times have I been woken up around 4-5 am for them to just walk  around the apartment and talk as if it's middle of the day. They also  have a dog, which they do not care about, he is barking whenever he  wants, they are not saying anything and sometimes he is barking for a  good 10 minutes. In the middle of the night. Last but not least - they  have been having sex so much lately I want to cry whenever I hear it. I  can lay in bed trying to fall asleep with the woman screaming, and then  wake up to the same sound. One time I was on a call with a customer (I  am working from home), and the woman started her daily screaming. I  actually went on mute for like a minute because I didn't want them to  accidentally hear it.

I cannot  live like that. Sometimes I just cry in bed because I feel so helpless. I  don't know what to do, because they seem very rude in person, they do  not look very enthusiastic when I say ""Hello"" to them, they argue a lot,  and I am sure if I actually went to them and asked if they could bevahe  a little bit more appropriate for the time, they would start behaving  even louder just for the sake of it.

I've seen this dude pick his nose then use my controller. I've seen this dude sneeze into his hand and then continue using my controller. Imagine sneezing into the air during a pandemic, that's this guy.

He leaves his mess everywhere. Only person who leaves his food and stuff on the counter of kitchens. Doesn't do any dishes. Uses the half the kitchen table as his desk, his laptop and shit is always on there.

He's so incompetent at cooking he looks like he's jousting when he cooks because he doesn't know how to turn down the flame. He tried to open a pull open can and broke off the tab. He asked me how to open it, the can opener wouldn't work because the lid was too low so I told him to use the knife. He busted the thing open with the juice flying everywhere. He wiped up maybe 90% of it but there was still spills on the counter and on the floor and now the floor is sticky.

Every time the house starts cleaning he doesn't do anything.

He lets the cat out accidentally even though once I saw he let the cat out on purpose at like 3 am. On the smart doorbell, he literally opened the door and watched the cat run out and then closed the door. Idk if he's trying to kill the cat or not. The cat is not neutered.

He's probably just totally oblivious to all this and I have told him before but he just doesn't really change his behavior.

I've lived with people like this before but this dude is 27. The people I've lived with before were in high school, like 19 - 21 year olds.

715,"I lived with my dad all throughout my childhood up until last summer, end of my junior year of high school when I left to live with my mom. My father was extremely physically abusive growing up. He'd throw glasses and hit and physically throw me whenever he was angry, usually when he was mad I hadn't cleaned something to his expectations. Cleaning and manual labor was the majority of the time spent with my dad, so it happened a lot. Hes a drunk and the majority of his physical violence happened when he was drinking. Sometimes, hed get drunk and instead just say the things he was thinking such as admitting to having affairs with my mother while they were together and hitting her, too, as well as comments suggesting he wished I wasnt born because life would be easier. At points as I got older he sorted to tying me up, hog tied, whenever I stood up to him when he hit and choked me for doing something he disagreed with or accidently messed up while doing labor for him. I remember a time specifically when he had hog tied me and left me in the backyard at midnight , dragging me out of bed to do so all because I ""forgot to wash a couple of the dishes"" but It was pans i left to soak overnight because they were covered in sticky gunk. 

Last summer when I left, it was after a conflict in which he was drunk and angry and complaining I wasnt hauling sheet metal fast enough. I was already not ready to put up with it and just walked off. He tackled me and choked me so I pushed him off of me, grabbed my bag and ran the 8 miles to town where I waited at a grocery store for 4 hours for my grandpa to pick me up.

My brother later told me he just wanted him to stay so they could finish a construction project and it was a lie that it was because of the lockdown. 

Tomorrow is my little sisters birthday, hes telling me to come visit for it but I dont want to because 

1. Everytime I visit I relapse being around him. 

2. It's not right for him to refuse to let my brother visit here but insisting I visit there. 

3. I've already mailed my little sister a gift and video chatted so it's not like I'm neglecting to celebrate her birthday.

Should I visit? Or do I hold my ground? I dont feel comfortable visiting him and I have no obligation to as he doesnt do anything in my life besides cause problems. I just cant help but feel like I'm obligated to go and feel extremely guilty about it.",12Apr2020,1
716,"Maybe I'm just used to living in my own place (read: very laxed rules for my past roommates cause their lives are different than mine) but a couple of things have come up at the place I'm now renting a room from (instead of being the one that rents the rooms out) and I'm wondering Am I The Asshole? Tried to post on r/amitheasshole but this exceeded their 3000 character limit.

Background:

It's only been a month of tenancy. 

 I live with my landlord, her son that is normally staying in the dorms at college (but because of C-19 is home), an older gentleman in his 60s (or so) that is almost never here, and we just got a new addition yesterday, whom I think works nights cause he was gone all night last night and I heard him snoring when I went to the bathroom shortly after he came back this morning. 

My landlord is super religious (leaves her bible on the dining room table, constantly praying in common areas, has even without my permission grabbed me, held me, and prayed over me). I'm personally not religious and I have no problem with people who live by the ""good"" book.

There are no bedrooms downstairs. The laundry room is right next to the garage and has a door that closes it off from the rest of the house. 

Issues that have arisen:

Issue #1‐
First thing that happened was that immediately after moving in (prior to C-19 turning into what it is), I was told I was not allowed to have people in my room. The living room, dining room, and kitchen were fine, but not my room. This has nothing to do with C-19. This was not brought up when we went over the house rules when I was in the renting process. I was told no over night guests (which I totally get and don't have have anyone I'd want to stay the night anyways) but nothing about hanging out in the space I'm paying money to rent. 
After a couple of discussions, long story short, it's due to her religion and her wanting to control her college aged kid. I told her that had she said that when we were going over everything prior to move in, that despite being homeless, I would have declined living here. I have never had a rule like that in any where I've rented from and not even from my father when younger. At almost 35 years old this sounds absolutely asinine and I would start looking for another room to rent. That I don't want to have personal conversations in common areas of the house. Shortly after that convo is when she came up to my room, said that because she didn't tell me prior to moving in, she would ""allow"" me to have guest in my room. I have since let her know if I'm having someone come over to help me move or unpack or for dinner and what not. 

Issue #2- 
I'm a night owl. When I was working as a chef and bartender (lost all 3 of my jobs, thanks C-19!), I had night hours often not going to bed until 3-4 am. 
Last night at about 7:30, I asked if I could use the washer (nothing in it) and was told yes. When I went to switch the laundry and do another load (I was washing my bedding), she told me at 8:45 pm that it was too late to do laundry because ""the noise"". When the door to the laundry room  is shut you can barely hear it even in the kitchen adjacent to it. When I pointed that out, her reasoning was that we just got a new tenant and she didn't want to disturb him (??). She later asked me if I always did a lot of laundry. I explained that my laundry is up recently as most of my stuff has been sitting in storage and smelled like it. I also explained that as a chef, once I start working again, that I will have to wear new clothes daily and probably need to do laundry every 3-4 days and that I normally wash my bedding weekly. Obviously everything has changed due to doing absolutely nothing (thanks C-19) and I'm going through less clothes. 

Overall, I like this place. She's not here every day and I've had zero issues with any of my other housemates. 

For example: after her son had his gf over (and upstairs) while she was gone, he brought me (I'm pretty sure that it was bribery) two boxes of Girl Scout cookies and they happened to be my favorite kind even though we've never discussed cookies, let alone GS cookies. I thanked him and told him I'm not here to be a snitch. His business is his, not mine.

I don't care what my housemates do as long as there's no drug use (marijuana is NOT a drug) going on and they're not putting me at any sort of risk. 

Am I being an asshole/disrespectful by standing up for myself? I've gotta say I'm most likely being visibly annoyed (mouth dropping open and there may have been visible eye rolling at one point) at the ""rules"" that keep getting made up as we go.

I'm currently paid through May, but I'm wondering if I should start looking for a new place. The whole point of the rental process is to set boundaries and I feel like all this should have been brought up before renting.",12Apr2020,2
717,"I'm going to start this story from the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

7 years ago my parents have been fighting for a long time because my dad had suspicions that my mom was having an affair with someone. I didn't believe it at the time, but she actually was. A month later, she ran away from him with only my father and me living together. Another month passes by and my mother contacts me for me to move in with her. I was unhappy at the time and always skipping school, so I chose to move in with her, and that's how I met the person she was having an affair with (Let's call him ""Joe""). I didn't care that they were having sex because I just didn't care about anything back then.

Fast forward to a month ago and now I am living with him because my mother has recently lost her job and has nowhere to live, so he offered for us to live with him.  

However, my mom was getting scammed by texting other ""guys"" saying that they will give her a greater amount of money if she gives them money first. She was also texting them on how she wants to have sex with them.

Fast forward to last night when Joe found out that she was talking to other guys and getting scammed again. Joe told me that she already got scammed twice before the first scam she lost $800 and the second scam she lost $1,100. However, this was the third time that she almost got scammed. Now he is angry at her for falling for it the third time and talking to other guys and he wants us to leave to move back to my father because he has helped her in every way by giving her money when she needs it and taking care of both of us, then betraying him 3 times in a row. I have mixed feelings about moving back because I haven't talked to him in over a year and I don't know his contact information. He let us stay until we move out. As of now, I don't know what to do. I'm scared of my mom because I think she is a sex maniac going crazy. And I'm about to turn 18 in 4 days. I honestly don't know what to do especially with COVID-19 around. Should I move in with my dad again? Move-in with my grandparents? Or even ask to move in with a close friend that I trust? Which is the only person I trust at this moment. And I think I am starting to become stressed and depressed for finding out the truth of my mother.

Please, someone on reddit help me. I'm honestly stumped.",12Apr2020,2
718,"Hey everybody. I’m 14 almost 15. My parents got divorced when i was around 10 and i have been living with my mom almost ever since. August 2019 my mother moved 150 km away from my school and i chose to move in with my dad because i liked my school. Anyways for the past 8 months i haven’t felt like i am home. I don’t like being here and i really want to move. The thing is just i like my school so much but it also makes me really sad being here. I cry about it sometimes. I am really split. I have no idea what to do. I think one of the reasons might be my room. It’s in the basement with no windows. Also my father and stepmom are so dark. Do you have any advice? What could i or what should i do?

Edit: i could move in with my mom but i like my school a lot. And i also have a bit more than a year left of school. After that i could easily move to my moms since all of my friends and i are going to diffrent places. So should i wait or should i move?",12Apr2020,0
719,"I really hate hurting people and I don't want to. I feel like my SO perceives me as a narcissist. I'm not going to argue the truth there or not, I just need help seeing where I'm wrong and how to fix it, and where I'm right and how to properly stand up for myself. 

We've been together nearly 10 years, and we've had our ups and downs, but for the most part it seems great. The issue I have is that everytime we get in fights she brings up something I did. She essentially says that I have no right to say anything I'm saying because of what I did (5 years ago at this point), she implies it at least. I didn't cheat, I had a compulsive lying issue that stemmed from a lot of shit that I've explained enough in therapy. She basically brings that up whenever I make a point that she doesn't agree with, it seems at least.

I get that I broke her trust, rightfully so, but I can't change what I did. I just don't know at what point I deserve to shut it down when she brings it up. Do I have to be punished for this for the remainder of our relationship? 

I've been honest with her from the day all the lies came out. I've explored why I did what I did, independently and with some therapy. I've done everything I can to earn her trust back. And I understand her pain over it is more important, but I need to focus on my pain too. Otherwise I'm not going to survive it long enough to pull my weight in this thing we have going here.

I feel unbelievable shame over what I did and I still haven't moved forward from. Everytime she brings it up, in the way that she does it, it re-opens the stitches I've put on the wound and I don't know how much more I can take. 

I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm asking for help. At what point do I have a right to stand up for myself here?",12Apr2020,0
720,"
I am 26 (M) and my wife is 29 (F). We have been together almost 7 years and married for 5 in August. 

My wife and I had a turbulent year and a half due to some life stressors, illness etc. We were in such a bad place. Tense all the time and lots of fighting. Was terrible and I really missed her. 

Anyway. We went to marriage counselling. I didn’t want to but I was willing to try anything to try and help us. I also sought personal therapy for myself again after stopping for a while. I dealt with a lot of things I didn’t even know
I was struggling with. I was able to let a lot go. 

We had this amazing marriage counsellor. I mean the experience really blew my mind. My marriage has improved immensely and we are doing really well. Lots of laughing, talking and intimate moments we didn’t have for a long time. It’s like we are dating again. 

Our last session was interesting because I realized we didn’t have much to talk about. We had this amazing week in quarantine together and we were just talking about that. Our counsellor gently suggested that maybe we could conclude our counselling. It was kind of sad as I began to look forward to it but I was also happy because it meant we were doing well again. Better than ever. 

I really want thank our counsellor. She was so empathetic, patient and willing to get on our level. I want to write her a letter or something to tell her that she really helped us. She also really helped me accept a lot about myself and my illness, that even though it’s hard I can still be happy in my life and marriage. She is amazing at her job and I am so thankful for her. 

I grew up in a really abusive situation and have had a difficult time connecting and being emotionally available for people. This has obviously impacted my marriage. This counsellor helped me connect to my emotions in a way that I felt safe. Helped me to stop feeling shame and guilt all the time. It has freed up so much time for me to be a partner. As a man, showing your emotions can be seen as weak, my father was emotionally unavailable. I want to break the cycle. 

I know this is a difficult time for a lot of people in the world but I have been incredibly fortunate. This time of isolation really saved my marriage and reunited me with my best friend. Even though we have stress with the current situation and ours jobs. We are getting through it together. I know we couldn’t have done it without the proper guidance. 


I don’t know if there is rules against writing a letter to a doctor. I just want her to know what she helped us do. 

Thank you and hope you’re all well. Appreciate your help.

TLDR: marriage counsellor helped me save my marriage and improve my life in many ways. How do I thank her?",12Apr2020,3

725,"For context, I went to a bit of a bizarre high school for a couple years. They were big on technology and had all students post videos of their work on a group video account.

I am now (19F) in college, and I discovered this video doing self research. It is still up, still public. It is extremely creepy, and I want to get it off. 

How should I go about this? Should I report it on Youtube? If so, under what settings? This school has not historically been helpful in removing images of myself that I don't want to be public, so I'm not sure what messaging them will get me.

732,"So,
I'm a fourteen year old female from a loving home, my parents finally got married (after like over fifteen years) a couple of months ago. But ever since then, they'd have little fights more often. And I know that that's just normal I guess, everybody fights sometimes, but for quite a while now, it's one particular topic. She's been on her phone way more often than usual, on whatsapp and texting people. And when my dad asks who she's texting with, she gets annoyed super quickly, kinda defensive even. I know who she's texting with. It's some guy who used to be my little brothers soccer coach. He also has a wife (I assume she's his wife, if not then girlfriend I guess), and two sons, one my brothers age, so around 10 years old, and one that's a little younger. 
I just can't fucking stand even just the thought that she might be cheating on my dad. Everytime they argue, I can hear it. I just don't know what to do. All I can do is cry all alone in my room, and it's just adding so much more weight onto my shoulders. I can't handle it anymore. I've had more than enough suicidal thoughts and considered self harm (not only because of them though) many times. 
Today I did it. She was in the basement, and her phone was upstairs. So I took the chance. I peeked into his contact and all I saw was like something about partying and then something along the lines of ""a hotel room sounds tempting"" (my mom wrote that), and a bit before that something with ""if only one person knows you there"" and those fucking stupid emojis. Those dumb flirty 😏 or 😉 god I fucking despise emojis
I just can't stop thinking about it and I know I  shouldn't have looked but I just couldn't help it. 
I'm so fucking done with everything and I don't even know if I could handle it if she really were. I mean maybe they're just friends, I didn't read everything, so I don't know if it was a stupid joke but fuck, if it really is true I don't know what to do. Like hell I'm gonna say anything to anyone, I just needed to get it off my chest, so I made this throwaway basically. 
I just can't wait until this fucking quarantine is over, I need to see my best friend, she'll understand I hope. 
Right now I'm a fucking wreck, I can't fucking stop crying. I just don't know what to do anymore or how I feel. If you read this, thank you very much, sorry for wasting your time tho.
I also apologize for any mistakes in grammar or spelling or whatever, since I'm not from any english speaking country. 


Basically, I have no idea on what the fuck I should do. I really don't wanna talk to anyone if I'm honest, but it's just kinda always been my nature to just seclude myself and keep stuff to myself instead of being like open about my feelings. I just genuinely don't like being the center of attention, and since I'm just viewed as the ""strong one"" (in my friend group for example), noone ever really asks about me or how I'm doing, but I feel that that's my fault, since I just don't talk that much anyways.

734,"I (M15) have an older brother (M17). Sometimes we get along fine, but I never really feel truly comfortable around him. I fear trying to have a conversation with him, as he tends to insult me whenever anything I do doesn't seem ""right"" to him. In the past he has called me stupid, lazy and useless, typically using swear words. Whenever he attacks me, it tends to be about me doing my homework (I don't know the last time he opened a book), about my appearance (mostly my acne and my hair, which he feels is to long), about my eccentricities, about me not ""working"", or about my lack of friends. Thankfully, this happens less frequently than it used to, but it sticks in my mind, it still does happen and I always feel like it could happen again at any moment.

However, he still irritates me, in a few ways. Firstly, he has a habit of touching and feeling my body, mostly when I'm sitting down with my back to him. When my arm is sleeved, what he normally does is grabbing my upper arm and squeezing it until it hurts. (In the past he has said my arms are ""like sticks""). He also sometimes pokes his fingers around the area between my shoulders and my neck. Secondly, he has a generally intimidating presence, occasionally speaking loudly and in cartoonish tones, and often insulting others in the house. (He typically calls them ""stupid"", but also ""soft"" and ""awkward"", always followed by a swear name.)

But mostly, he upsets me by repeatedly saying ""I love you"", often in a mocking tone. Because of everything I described above, I simply find it hard to *feel* anything for him. As such, I never throw the statement back at him, even though that's what he obviously wants. I can't bring myself to say it, either as truth or as a lie. A few times, I mustered up the strength to tell him I *don't* love him. To this, he told me that I should love him ""no matter what"" simply because we're brothers, and then called me ""cold-hearted"", again also using swearwords. Mostly, though, I remain silent.

What I'm asking here is whether you think I deserve this, and why. I've talked to a few people about this, primarily my parents. I've made it clear to my parents that I don't want them to confront my brother, as I know he'd use that against me. My parents tell me that I'm doing nothing wrong, but I feel like they're too biased in my favour to be objective about it. It doesn't help that my social life really isn't great; most of the time I feel that my brother is my only insight into what other teenagers think of me.

This fear of mine started a few years back when I fell out of love with my first boyfriend. Everything was going great but we fell into a rut and I became tired of the relationship and my feelings for him vanished.

We got together at the end of July right after we both got out of serious relationships back in May. We both slept with other people (used condoms) before getting together and in the beginning of September my boyfriend got tested for every STD you can think of and everything came back negative (we didn’t use condoms). So everything is great for awhile, I went to NOLA with my friends for my birthday in beginning January and then he took me on an amazing weekend getaway just the two of us two weeks later for my birthday. Come beginning of February, I start getting concerning symptoms that made me go see my OBGYN. I thought it must’ve been just a bad yeast infection and it turned out to be HSV-1. My doctor told me that I recently contracted it because I didn’t have the antibodies for it yet (it takes a month for these to develop). She said without a doubt that my boyfriend gave it to me and even though he’s never had symptoms he could just be asymptomatic or simply just never noticed. She also said that even though you may go in to a doctor to get STD tested, doctors do not test for herpes unless there are visual sores. She said that even if you have sex with a condom, you can still contract this virus from bare to bare skin touching and since HSV-1 is oral herpes, it could’ve spread to him through oral sex with a previous partner. Before I found out the results I obviously talked to him about it and he was very comfortable with saying that I gave it to him from someone I had sex with over the summer however once I told him what my doctor said he immediately became distant and cold about the whole situation. It’s been a recurring fight since February and he refuses to believe what the doctor said and still has yet to get tested or talk to the previous girl he slept with about the situation we’re in currently. He broke up with me a few days ago and this definitely was a factor of it. He thinks I cheated while I was in NOLA which I NEVER did. I thought I was in love with him and really saw a future for us but now I don’t know. He thinks I’m a liar and thinks my doctor is a liar and biased because my mom works with her, just trying to tell me he gave it to me to make me feel better.

The first piece: My ex-husband of 18 years basically began sleeping with everything that moved six months into our relationship and continued to do so until he was caught. He was a terrible partner, we divorced and we both moved on. We have both been in relationships since the divorce, both going on three years now.

The second piece: I am an only child and the only family I have in the world (literally) is my parents. They divorced about a decade ago and have always lacked in the parenting/relationship department. I never felt like my dad gave a shit about me, my mom never wanted to be a mother and treated me like her emotional dumpster for many years, etc. That said, they are my parents and I love them. I can count on one hand the number of times my father has said “I love you” and I’m about to turn 38. You get the idea.

The third piece: I have recently noticed that both of my parents maintain a delightful relationship with my ex-husband and his partner. We had a birthday dinner for my son a while back and my dad met my ex’s partner for the first time. My dad conversed exclusively with the two of them throughout dinner, then ended the night embracing them both in a big hug and dousing them in love and smiles. I don’t know if my dad has ever hugged me outside of maybe family funerals and the like...ever. That particular night, after he was done with them, he didn’t even say goodbye to me. Now let’s move on to mom. Easter baskets lovingly prepared for the two of them and dropped off early this morning, constantly bending over backward to do anything and everything to make their lives easier and to make them feel loved.

I am hurt. Very hurt. But at the same time, I have not addressed any of this with them because I feel immature and selfish. Anyone should feel free to cultivate whatever relationships he or she wants. But again, my feelings continue to be incredibly hurt by the only family I have and I don’t know why I must always be the one to bear these emotional burdens. 

Please don’t tear me apart here; I am really struggling. But what should I do? Even if the only question that bears answering is how can I more effectively deal with this pain?

Thank you for “listening”, friends.",12Apr2020,1
742,"Okay, so I’m in a bit of a personal dilemma with my job and if I wanna go back to school or not.  

I’m also 23. 

I work at this job I really enjoy.  The work is okay, but I really enjoy my coworkers.  I work with a small group of people, about six of them, and I’d do anything for them.  They almost feel like family to me.  It’s one of those things where I actually like to wake up and go to, and I have never felt that way about anything else.  Former jobs, school, always dreaded waking up.. but not this one. 

On the other hand, I don’t make a lot of money.  It’s more than minimum wage, but it’s not a lot, and there’s really no room to grow here.  No chance for a raise.  I’m basically stuck. 

Here comes in school.  I thought about it a lot.  Applied for the FAFSA in November for the Spring semester.  Got accepted.  Was ready to go and I just didn’t.  Didn’t wanna leave my job, my coworkers.

That’s where I’m at... I really think going to school is a good choice.  However, I don’t think I’ll ever get another job where I’m as close to my coworkers as I am now, and that just makes me sad.  

So I just don’t know what to do.",12Apr2020,1
746,"This may sound weird but you guys know how humans associate smells with certain memories? I think this is what I'm getting but I have no idea why. For reference my bf and I are both 21 and have been together for 5 years.

My boyfriends dad recently bought him a new deodorant because the store was out of his regular kind. My boyfriend has worn the same deodorant since before we've started dating. I've gotten used to it, it's his smell. When he ran out of his deodorant he used mine which was no big deal. I didn't have a problem with how he smelt. Maybe because I knew it was my scent? Idk.

But ever since he put on the new deodorant I get super uncomfortable. I don't like being near him, I can't hug him. The smell makes me feel scared and like he's going to hurt me. The only reasoning I could come up with why this is happening is maybe the guy my mom cheated on my dad with wore it? I have no idea what deodorant he wore but I remember when I found out about my mom cheating on my dad with him it was because my mom and the guy started heavily smelling nice for eachother. Anyways I just feel uncomfortable and I don't want anything to do with my boyfriend when he has the new smell on. I feel absolutely repulsed. 

He doesn't understand why and I have no idea how to describe it to him. It's starting to upset him that I'm lightly pushing him away whenever he comes near me. Wtf is going on?? Why is my brain doing this?",12Apr2020,5
747,"I’ve been with my wife going on 8 years now. I live in AZ while my recently divorced Mom lives in Iowa.  We’ve had minimal contact since i left Iowa in 2008 which means a text or phone call every 3-4 months.  Since my wife and I have been together they have never hit it off. When we first started dating my wife began to be controlling, would distance me from friends and coworkers and loved to fight over stupid things and doesn’t know how to have a conversation. My Mom initially disliked my wife because i expressed this to her so she  insisted i fight back and not put up with it which drove my wife crazy because i would stick up to her when we would talk. They’ve had numerous issues in the past i could go on and on but needless to say  I’ve been sworn to never drop her name or mention her in our house again because of how she’s “disrespected my wife” and so I haven’t for several years to keep the peace. Not to say my wife isn’t completely in the wrong, my mom has said and done some selfish things in the past being a bit of a brat herself and sadly has even had some issues with drugs in the past which led to her being jobless and divorced- she was once a medical professional. My mom and I still send text message every few months to keep in touch that i hide from my wife so it doesn’t cause problems.  My Mom has since tried to make up with my wife but wife absolutely refuses too. Mom wanted to do something nice for her granddaughters and send them some Easter gifts- something she doesn’t regularly do. Out of the blue, my wife brought up my Mom sending gifts (not even knowing she was sending them- i swear she’s telepathic- i deleted the text) and said she refused to accept any gifts and would return them to sender. I didn’t tell my Mom this because she had already sent them and i didn’t want to hurt her feelings. It’s bad enough i thought she doesn’t get to see me or her grandkids but is going through a rough time in her life.  My mom spent at least $100-$150, made a bunch of homemade crafts, Easter baskets and toys two huge boxes full of stuff. I ended up mentioned that my Mom was in fact sending gifts and had already sent them and all hell broke lose. I merely suggested we let the girls have the gifts since they were expensive and they would enjoy them and so i could feel better about it having no contact with my family anyways. I tried to me amicable but that just resulted in a blow out fight and has basically ruined our Easter.  I love my wife, i have A.D.D., can be hard to live with at times but pull my weight. I’m a little lazy and unstructured and enjoy her structure as determined and as she is to see that it stays that way. I still provide, i make 200k a year and am home 7 months straight out of the year while i travel the other 4 months for work. She is a stay at home Mom. She is an amazing Mother very hands on other then the fact that she likes to fight in front of our kids and say some very  messed up stuff in front of them. I usually just sit back and stay quiet because i don’t want to further piss her off and risk getting something thrown at me. I don’t understand why she is so upset since i have little to no contact with my mom in the first place and never mention her. My Mom just wants to make a nice gesture even though they don’t get along shouldn’t the grandkids still be able to receive gifts? Or am I completely in the wrong here and have my wife’s back and just go with it even though i don’t entirely agree? Do i tell my Mom my wife won’t accept the gifts? Send them back or pretend that I got them and try to keep the peace?",12Apr2020,4

751,"I have a dream of having my own homestead and living on the land with minimal trips to the store, but I don’t know how to achieve it. I’m 23 years old, a college dropout and Ive worked many different jobs. From working at a coffee shop, on a farm, then child services, to a call center and lastly a mortgage company(etc). 

If I need a degree, I’m more than willing to go back to school. I just don’t know what degree to even get. Ideally, I’d have a work from home job that’s part time and use my homesteads resources to make ends meet. I also plan on living sustainably, it’s just that all of this takes money...Or does it? 

I have this need to just pack my things and just go where ever life takes me. At one time I’ve actually followed that instinct and went to work on a farm in Hawaii. It was honestly the best thing I’ve ever done. I now have a boyfriend and fur baby making it not so easy to just back up- although I know he’s 100% on board.

752,"Hi everyone. I really need some advice. This is going to be a long post. Sorry in advance. If you want to read a summarized version without any details, skip to the very bottom.

I am a 22 y.o. male. I am the oldest of 4 siblings (20M, 17M, and 7M). My dad works overseas to give us a comfortable life, leaving my mom to take care of the 4 of us alone.

To provide context, I need to go back a few years.

In 2016, my family moved into a new home that my dad had built just for us. It was in a fairly new residential area that was not heard of yet by anyone. Before that home, we lived with my grandparents, my 4 aunts, my very young cousings and one of my uncles. They lived in and air base in a tiny home, and being introverted, I felt tired all the time, since there is never a time where I was alone to recharge. Everything was going great int he new house, until my family started getting messages on messenger from someone we don't know. We had a stalker. The stalker kept telling us stuff like ""Don't trust your father"" and ""He's seeing someone else"". My mom asked my dad about it and he denied all of it. So, we all gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided to block the person on facebook. However, the stalker kept coming back with different accounts and kept saying the same thing to us. I was really confused why that person was trying to ruin our family, but all I could do was block the profiles that person created. 

Fast forward to December. My dad got a few weeks off work for christmas time and he flew back to be with us. I didn't know why but my mom looked really sad that whole day and refused to talk about my dad. When she picked him up and brought him back, she didn't look too happy. I was confused, but forgot about it because my dad had brought Subway subs for us to eat. Then, my mom called all 6 of us to my parents' room, and I knew something was very wrong. When I got to the room, the first thing my mom said was, ""You have to choose - do you want to continue living here in this house, or go back with her to live with our grandparents."" I was so shocked and asked if it was because of us, but she told us it's not our fault. Then, she turned around and finally asked my dad, ""Did you cheat on me?"" His answer shattered my world. All he said was ""Yes."" I remember the date very well, because it's burned into my brain for the rest of my life. December 21, 2016. 4 days before christmas. That moment, my mom burst into tears and all I could think about was that I had a 13 and a 3 year old brother that shouldn't have to comprehend it. I started yelling at both of them to get out of the room so that I could shield them from what was happening. I was only 18 at the time. My dad tried to explain himself, saying stuff like it was ""just lust"" and it was ""not serious"" and what not. My 16yo brother and I were there as he tried to explain and my mom was bawling while hugging my brother. That day scarred my whole family and left me, my brother and my mom permanently scarred. We were not the same after that. I remembered how my mom tried to kill herself when I was young because she was so stressed from being a mother and I got worried. I told my brother to help me hide all the objects in the house that she could use to harm herself. I appointed myself as suicide watch and I stayed up all night to make sure she doesn't try anything. That incident changed me , my mom and my brother for the worse. My mom became more paranoid and more controlling. She demanded to know where we were going all the time, and started to rant whenever something was not done to her liking. My brother and I started to fight a lot. It became so bad that now, we don't even talk anymore. My dad said that he was sorry and he wanted to fix his relationship with us. It took a few weeks but my mom decided to give it a shot. My brother too. I on the other hand couldn't yet. Then too soon, he had to leave for work again.

I'll skip a bit because a lot of things happened between that incident and what is happening that I need advice for. To summarize, It got so bad I ended up losing my friends, and my brother and I stopped talking after getting into a very petty fight(petty in both our sides) and I fell into a pit of depression that resulted in me having suicide thoughts.

Last year, I decided to forgive my dad for what he had did and repair our family. That year, everything seemed to look up. I was getting better, I had a support system in place and had no more suicide thoughts. After I graduated college, at 21, I decided to lose weight because it was causing complication in my knees and feet(my weight fluctuated between 69-75kg, and I am only 5'3 3/4"" tall). I hate running, but I am a huge fan of KPop and I love learning their choreos. So i decided that my for of excercise would be to have a dance routine. And at the time of writing this post I am 63 kg. Everything looked bright. My mom was doing better, but the incident left a scar so deep that the changes that she had became habitual. It rubbed me and my brothers the wrong way, but we understood given what happened to her. Then everything fell apart again.

March came along and covid-19 was all over the news. There was a plan to quarantine my city so that the virus does not spread any further. I was eating dinner,  and was watching a thai drama on my phone when my mom screamed for me. I thought something happened so I rushed up to her room and the first thing I heard from her was, ""He's doing it again"" while sobbing. My heart shattered once again. My mom was facetime-ing my dad and he told her she had another affair. This time, it was much worse. This time, he fell in love with the other woman. It shattered my family. Then I remembered something that I now hate. I exclaimed ""Your marriage is as old as me!"" My mom married my father while she was pregnant with me. Realizing this, I burst into tears and ran out of the room. I cried for a few minutes because of the immense pain I felt. That moment, the only thought that ran in my mind was that my dad only married my mom because she was pregnant with me. Luckily, I had a support friend and I vented my feelings to her. When I was done, I had my answer. That moment, I decided that my father was dead. He had died in 2016, before all this happened and the guy married to my mom was not my dad. My dad said that it was because she changed so much, that her attitude towards him was the reason why he did it again. The worst part is, since covid-19, they put a travel ban so my dad can't come back to us. The mistress is in the same country as my dad so it was extremely difficult to fix this situation.

I began suicide watch again, meaning I get less and less sleep. And since I usually exercise late nights, that meant I would go to sleep at around 5 am everyday. I would hear my mom cry in her room everyday, and all I could do is try to comfort her, and sometimes it doesn't work. My mom knew that losing my father would be bad because, not only do I have 3 brothers still in school, but we had a house that we're still paying for, a car and he was the sole breadwinner of the family.(I had just been let go from my first job and that took a toll on my self esteem, so right now I don't have a job.) To make it worse, if my father was out of the picture, my 7yo brother would grow up not knowing why my father never came back. Realizing this, my mom started BEGGING him to stay with us. Yes, that's right, my mom had to BEG HER HUSBAND to stay with us even though it was HER HUSBAND. One morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. I saw my mom, and it looked like she was exhausted. She saw me and asked us to talk to my father, because it was her fault this whole thing happened. That's right, my father blamed everything that happened on my mom. I did not want to talk with him after hearing that.

Another time, she tried to leave the house to ""disappear"" but I managed to stop her. We ended up crying by the front door for a while. A 2 weeks ago, she managed to leave the house. That time I was cooking dinner because she was not up to it. She suddenly came down and told my youngest brother that ""she was going very far away"" and to ""be good and not cause trouble"". My 17yo brother was there listening to his headphones. I knew what she meant and told my brother to close the door so that she couldn't go out. My mom dashed for the door and MY BROTHER LET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE. He was so focused on what he was listening to that he didn't think of what he was doing. I started yelling at him and asking him why he let her out of the house. He knew what had happened with her because he overheard her conversation with my father. Yet he still let her out of the house. I was frantic and worried and yelled for him to follow her cuz I was still cooking. My youngest brother started crying and saying ""I want my mama back!"" It was so heartbreaking.  After all my brothers had dinner, I told them to go up while I waited by the door for her. I was so anxious. Luckily, she came back. But only at 11pm at night. I was so relieved. The next day, my mom anounced that we would be spending a few days with my grandparents while quarantine started. I protested because I get anxious if I don't return to my room at the end of the day, but relented. There, my mom got better. She was smiling more, looking at her phone less and enjoying her time there. It was a good thing to see even though inside I was very very anxious. However, lockdown was starting soon so we had to return home else we won't be able to return and we had not enough clothes for an extended stay there. So we returned home.

My mom started getting progressively worse since then. She is crying again, she is losing weight and her health is deteriorating. She also refused to see a doctor. Again, I am on suicide watch and I barely get any sleep. She had attempted to commit suicide once in her room, but it was foiled when my brother(20) entered and prevented her from cutting herself. She was talking to my father that time. I thought I could handle watching her and helping her but it keeps getting worse. The last straw was what happened yesterday.

I had just returned to my room to rest when I heard my youngest brother screaming. I rushed to open my door to see a horrid sight. My 20yo brother holding down my crying mom, who was holding a sharp blade in her hand, begging my brotger to let her be. My youngest brother was pleading mom not to do it, not to kill herself. He was a crying mess. Yes, my mom tried to commit suicide in front of my 7yo brother. I forcefully took the blade out of my mom's hand and ran into my room and locked the door. I contacted my aunt to tell her what had happened and she informed my other aunts. One of my aunts wanted to talk to my mom so I went. She was in her room. Guess what she was doing? Of course, talking with my father(Apparently, he decided that he was going to stay with his mistress rather than us, his family.). My aunt started crying and pleading with her to stop this, that she had kids and her siblings. She even went as to threaten to get the police involved if she tries to do it again. Everyone was crying at this point, and I could see that my mom was hurting so much. I understood why she wanted to do this, so I don't blame her one bit for what she tried to do. After a while, my mom had calmed down and told us she needed to be alone. We left but to be safe, my 20yo brother was situated outside her door to make sure she's okay. I talked with my aunts and they decided that she needed to stay with my grandparents for a while and that the house was not safe for her. I told them that I wanted to stay because of my anxieties and  they agreed, but my youngest brother was to go with her. I went to pack my brother's things but my mom got suspicious and asked what I was doing. I told her and she flat out refused to go, saying that she had a work to do in the house. I was frustrated but I went to go tell my aunts, who had just arranged for my uncle to pick her up. They were breaking quarantine rules set up to get her. They were frustrated but agreed to her wishes.

Today, my mom slept the whole day after making us food for both lunch and dinner. She ate after cooking and just went to sleep. She did not wake up until almost 10pm. She couldn't stand up straight at this point and needed assistance getting down the stairs. I told her she needed to see a doctor, but she refused. Then I told her that one of my aunts was coming to stay with us gor a few days and I would ask her to bring food for us the next day because she did not look well enough to cook or do any work. She told me to tell her not to come, citing her reason as to ""my cousin's birthday is coming up, and she will miss it because of the lockdown if she came"". I sternly told her that it was not my decision and she was upset by that. I want my mon to get professional help, but we can't afford it right now. We barely scrape by with what my father sends us. I am planning to find work after quarantine is lifted, even though I'm not ready yet. I am at the end of my rope right now. I had not had any proper time to grieve over what has happened and between being on suicide watch, trying to improve my health by exercising, mentally preparing myself to find work right away even thought I'm not ready yet because my father could cut us off at any moment, and making sure my mother was okay. I am tired all the time. I feel my mental health has taken a toll after I just recovered from what happened in college and I could just break down at any moment.

To make it short, my father cheated on my mom twice, blames everything on her and decides to stay with his mistress. My mom is not doing well both physically and emotionally. My mom is refusing help because she wants to die and I'm trying to help her for the sake of my brothers. I myself is at the end of my rope and feel like I could break down at any moment. What should I do?",12Apr2020,1
753,"So this sounds kinda stupid right off the bat, 16 and confused? yeah who the f\*ck isn't at that age.

So the thing is that my emotions seem kinda out of whack? but the thing is its pretty much always been like this. I don't cry, like at all, at least not at the things that really deserve crying - like my grandparents dying. I practically never cry about other emotional matters, but then when say listening to a song and i get really overwhelmed (if that's the right word) and can tear up, or when watching a movie and I really love it and just have a lot of feelings for it - like getting really excited and can tear up at that.

Another example, my mum was recently in hospital for a couple weeks after getting really sick - with a possibility of corona and she's also in a risk group - and passing out during the middle of the night and cracking her head open. The thing is with this is that I am currently away from home and haven't seen any of my family for 8 months. A lot of my family was freaking out and crying and all of these things, and I just kind of felt numb(?), detached from the situation, obviously worried and stressed but it was distant.

This happens a lot with things like this, my gran died around this time last year and I was also away at the time on the other side of the country and I hadn't seen her for a couple weeks, and sure I felt sad, but it was more prominently this detached type of feeling and I didn't cry. Later that day I had to tell my older sister who I was visiting at the time, and she asked if I cried and I said no, because I hadn't. Then she called me heartless and said some shit about me not caring about her and things like that. Which honestly made me feel really really shit and I had no idea how to respond to that so I just took it.

So many things like this have happened with me. People I love get really sick, almost die or they do die, and I don't feel like I have the right to feel bad about any of it, don't have the right to cry.

I could probably go on and on about other times that this has happened but I feel like I'll just bore whoever actually does end up reading this

tl;dr I feel like my emotions are really whack bc I don't seem to be able to respond normally to traumatic (?) events and I'd really like help on how to deal with this i guess.",12Apr2020,1
755,"I (19F) have been saving up my money for over a year now (I'll have 4200 saved) and have had plans to move in with some friends this June. Well, as everyone knows, covid has hit the US hard. One of my friends is now unable to move this summer, and I'm starting to wonder if it's the best thing to continue with.

I'm moving to another state, which means I am going to have to secure a new job. Speaking with those close to me, they've made me think about how it will most likely be very difficult to get a job in the current crisis, and on top of that, there is no saying that this job will be secure as many individuals are already getting laid off. So my question is, do you think that I would be able to get and secure a job (doing absolutely anything, I just need a job) so I can be confident in signing a 12 month lease? My other friend is still willing to rent, however it would overall cost more most likely because instead of being split between 3 people it is now 2. Are there other housing options I have yet to think of? I have a place to stay temporarily that I don't have to pay for, but it would only be for a couple weeks at most.

We never hung out tho (except to go to the gym) just cuz im so reserved and private and i guess kinda intimidating so he never asks and neither do I. Now during this pandemic, I havent seen him since 3 weeks and he started sending me at the beginning horny memes at night but I called him out on it so he stopped, he flirts with me when he calls and we talk during the day. He alwyas texts first but waits long to answer back so I guess he wants me to chase after him which i dont even tho I like him :/ idk why. Anyways last time we talked was Tuesday and I called during the day but it was weird like we had nthg to say. He called again at midnight which was weird but he just asked if I watched X movie and that was it lol. Its been 5 days now and we have NEVER went that long without talking unless ome of us is out the country.

I miss him. A lot. And I live in Sweden and there is no lockdown here so like we could meet up and just walk outside.

763,"Hey all. I've been in a less than optimal living situation for two years now and just recently I started putting more effort in finding a new flat, since I at least found a city that somewhat inspires me.

But I am totally clueless as to whether I want to live more inside the city or more rural. I love nature and I miss having secret hidden places where no one bothers me where I am right now, but on the other side I would be afraid of getting a bit too isolated if I lived more outside.. plus I like having so much choice in what kind of food I buy in the city without having to commute too far.

The second one I am so unsure about is whether I want to live alone again or in another shared flat? I lived alone once and it was okay, but I also see how living with someone can give me more freedom as they can take care of my plants when I travel or so. But due to my current shared flat I am super anxious about not being able to find people who can tolerate me and who I get along with.

I guess in the end my actual question is for those of you who moved around quite a bit: how do you know a place is the right fit for you? I looked at several potential flatmates places now and even if some parts sound good there always are some that are not right or even there might just be some insecurity and a weird lingering feeling. 
I also have social anxieties so that makes it even more confusing to differentiate.

By the way, I don't really have the finances and health to go and travel and actually check out new areas so it all is supposed to work out mostly over distance. (pretty sure I don't want to stay in the same city I am now)

My mother is a teacher and is teaching her students from home. My brother works at Wal-Mart, is on night shift and has limited interactions with my parents. They all live in a rural town in middle America. The nearest shopping center is 40 min from the house.

I am a nurse and see how this is actually affects older people with medical conditions. After the state-wide lockdown went into effect, I called my father because I knew he would ignore it. I brought up in causally conversation that he couldn't go to the convenience store every morning to buy his breakfast burrito and a fountain drink or the hardware store everyday after work like normal. Immediately, he got defensive and would no longer speak about it changing the subject. Since lockdown my mother is not leaving the house and disinfects the counters and door knobs daily. My brother goes to work at night when no customers are present and his employer is checking employee temperatures before they clock in for work. Brother also is not leaving the house for anything but work.

For about the 1st 2 weeks of lock down, I called my parents house (about every 3-5 days) trying different ways to broach the subject of PPE and limiting exposure for the family. I also texted the links to the CDC site and reliable information. My father gets all his news from Fox News. 

I thought I had finally gotten through to him last week Fri, he told my mom he would no longer go to the convenience store daily. I texted him an article to hobbies while in lock down. Early on, I gave him my netflix/hulu/amazon passwords so he wouldn't be bored. 

As I'm sure you can imagine, all of this has come to a breaking point. He went to the grocery store and 2 hardware stores on Wed. He claims he needed to buy me toilet paper (I did not ask nor need more TP). I did not say anything to him. I figured a trip once a week is ok. I'm trying to pick my battles.
On Sat (11 Apr) my mom brought over the TP and a shit ton of food to my door step. I live about an hour away.  We interacted from afar. After prying her for info on why she's being me food, she told me, he keeps buying so much food on his trips that it's going bad and there is no room in the frig. 

Now, it's Easter Sunday and he is driving 45 min to an entirely different town to buy a used VCR from marketplace. Yes, a VCR, so he can watch home old tapes and convert them to DVDs. These tapes have been in the basement for 20+ years. The town where he is going is getting hit hard by the virus. 

I texted him an sarcastic asshole comment about really needing a contaminated VCR. Not my best moment. He texted me back not to contact him. Then, he quickly texted me again that I didn't thank him for the TP. 

My other brother(35) has called our father about 1x a week to get him to understand the gravity of the situation and my older bro was quickly shut down and my father refuses to talk about the subject. 

The part that really pissed my off was 2 weeks ago he literally said to my mom if he gets her sick he'd just blame my brother(30) then he laughed like it was a joke. She told me that yesterday. 
My father has always been an arrogant selfish asshole, but usually his asshole actions only hurt himself.  (Yes he does have redeeming qualities.) I haven't had any contact since. Do I just need to to accept his recklessness? An ultimatum won't work. He'll shut completely. My mom can't live with me. I am constantly exposed. We do not have any other family in the area.",12Apr2020,2

Yesterday I sent her a message because I saw that she and her gf were active all day,. She didn't even answer it, she just read it hours after sent it and didn't respond until the next day because she saw that was on do not disturb after that and said that she ""fell asleep at 10"" which is a lie because she was active on other platforms and talking.

778,"Apologies if this is formatted weird due to me being on mobile.

Backstory:

My roommate over the past week has becoming increasingly paranoid about my safety and has mentioned several times to tell me “if anything’s wrong”. He says my dog sometimes comes into his room looking skittish and he thought there might be someone in my room (while I’m also home in my room) that’s hurting me. He has sent several texts asking if I’m okay. I have assured him plenty of times, over texts and in person, that I’m completely okay. In reply, he has told me he wants to make sure that he’s “not going to freak out if I have any guys over”. I then say that I was not worried about that and am fully aware that I can do as I please, since I pay half the rent here as a normal tenant/roommate. This goes on over a couple days through multiple repeated conversations.

Last night, he came up to my door that was cracked and said “Anon263736253 are you in there? Are you okay? Is somebody else in there?” Then proceeded to open the rest of my door with a loaded shot gun pointed into the room while I’m casually sitting on my bed with my dog watching a movie off my laptop.

I obviously nearly had a heart attack and he ends up putting the gun back in his room. I proceed to start yelling because this came completely out of the blue unexpectedly. We have both been home all day and hadn’t said much to each other, and I had not done anything to ever make him consider that I might be in danger or need help. I’m extremely uncomfortable at the moment and he has left to stay at his parents house while I calm down, until further notice. 

Aside from this, he has been a totally normal roommate for the most part without any major red flags. He texted me apologizing. And before tonight’s events occurred, had mentioned that he might just be tweaking from taking adderall for his office job.

This makes me uncomfortable for several reasons. Partly because he feels that comfortable coming into my room with a pointed and loaded shot gun. Also, for *worries that if I did happen to have company, what might have changed in that scenario.*

**I’m not sure if I should try to terminate the lease (which is only six months into a two year lease), or hope this was a complete and honest misjudgment on my roommates part, and hope nothing like this happens again?**

I’m really not sure what the steps to take from here are. Since last night I’ve called non emergency police number to have on record what happened.

I just moved to this large city with no family in the state. Due to the current pandemic, not sure what the possibilities of even finding a new place and roommate would be.

TL;DR roommate came into my room with a gun because he thought I was in danger, after he has been paranoid for a week and has been assured that I have been fine this entire time",12Apr2020,1

781,"I think that my romantic relationship is being affected (not completely), but in part because of my codependence issues and anxiety attachment style which I JUST RECENTLY REALIZED.

I feel like I put my partner's emotions, dramas, and issues first, as if they were mine, and is making me miserable. He had been dealing with ""porn addiction"" and is taking big chunk of my energy because it was affecting our sex life, and feeding my own insecurities (my own issues, I guess?). A lot of the times when we fight I feel like it is the end of the world, sometimes I am confused whether this is all on me, on my life experiences, or if this relationship is also triggering me? Sometimes I behave like a victim since I take things very personally.

The saddest thing is that in my previous relationship I believe my partner suffered from this. I had a trauma because of lack of trust, and having a very obsessive boyfriend over my behaviors, what I did, everything. He even hacked my phone, my social media to sneak on me for the longest time. He also hide stuff from me for years, and I felt completely violated. I really don't know if this is connected or not.

783,"I know most people are probably sick of hearing about the global pandemic, I am as well honestly, but I’m in a tough spot right now and don’t really know what to do. 

I’m an essential worker. I work for a third party company contracted by Meijer and Target that shops and delivers groceries for customers. With everything going on, the company I work for sees thousands of orders a day so I am constantly working and trying to get people who are desperately in need some groceries. I’ve been safe and regularly wash my hands as well as wear a mask when out in public. 

I had a pretty nasty cold (and it was definitely just a cold, not corona) about a month and a half ago and I recovered except for my cough. It’s not a bad cough or anything, but it won’t go away. A few days ago I noticed my cough starting to get worse and then the next day I started experiencing some chest pain/tightness that hasn’t gone away. To be fair I do have allergies so I told myself I was just being paranoid and just to be extra cautious. I even asked my sister who is an RN and she said pretty much the same thing: take precautions, limit exposure to others, take my temperature regularly, and if I develop a fever then I need to self quarantine for 2 weeks. This morning I received an email from the company I work for stating that one of the Meijer stores that I normally work in has had an employee test positive for COVID-19. 

What should I do now? I didn’t think I’d be in this situation so I haven’t really planned well for it.

785,"I am very curious how other people handle friendships when your friend is going towards an extreme. This is the third time that I am trying to tackle this and I am still bad at handling it.

For example:  
One of my friends already was religious when I met him. I am an atheist and it never really was an issue. Fast forward a few years. We both have kids and I have two sons. One turned 15 and recently came out. My friend has joined a church that frowns upon gay people, especially their lifestyle (whatever that means). I have discussed the subject with him and asked how he would handle these religious views if one of his kids were to be gay. The answer I got was that he of course would never accept it, but would still love his son/daughter.  Now that my kid came out, I am unsure on how to go forward with this friendship. We know each other a long time, but my son is my priority.  
Should I just cut it off now, or invest time and energy by sitting down with my friend to discuss my worries? I already know that my son will never be welcome with his boyfriend and if he his, it will be under conditions (no holding hands etc.)

Another example (I must choose my friends badly I suppose):  
I have been friends with her since we were around 10 years. She always has been a little eccentric, but so am I. In the past year she has been moving towards the far right more and more with her political views. She sounds racist at times, but she keeps stating that she isn't. She does have colored friends but the way she refers to them is horrid. She calls them very specific nicknames and says it is meant lovingly. And, in her words, she must be able to call people whatever she fancies. If people misunderstand her, it's on them, not her.

I know friends come and go, but the above examples are heavy on the heart because of everything we shared and the support I have gotten from them throughout the years. I come from a fairly odd family  with substance abuse and that has skewed my views and feelings a bit, so I am not sure if I am too harsh with these friends, or if these really are solid reasons to say goodbye.  
I already made my decision, but I feel the need to check my reasoning because of my upbringing my feelings and thoughts are quite blurry sometimes and I don't always trust my own opinion.

I have been working now since February 2019 at a grocery store, but in March my area got hit with a really bad tornado so people were buying a lot of stuff to donate and hoard, and right after that the pandemic hit. So basically since then i have been working nonstop most days, full time and i am feeling really really burned out. Also theres a deadly fucking virus that I would much rather not get even though I would probably live, I don’t want to expose my family and grandparents to it. Also, this company and our store has done the bare minimum to protect employees and only waits until literally every other essential store still opens (even fucking Walmart beats us to the punch) to give us hazard pay, disposable masks, disposable gloves, limit the # of people in the store (to 400, really -_-). 

So i want to quit or take a LOA because of the intense stress and long hours with okay pay. If you understood how absolutely swamped we are you would want to quit too. Even my manager and store managers and alot of employees are talking about straight up quitting or taking a LOA. 

My dad co-owns/ rents the building for a dispensary in California and he has always told me that I would have a job there if i want it. And now i am highly considering it as i have a lot of money saved up, dispensaries are considered essential as well and im not adverse to working two jobs part time if I don’t get enough hours, but the pay is more than i make right now.

My question is would this be a good idea right now or should i wait until the summer when this dies down a little bit? I know travel is very taboo right now and I know the situation is really bad there and my dad updates me a lot but he says business is really good at the shop. Would this be a bad idea?

The story is, I have had issues with the neighbors below me for months, have spoken with them many times, the property managers...nothing works. Basically they play what appears to be a low volume bass speaker all hours of the night (until around 5AM). It is unclear whether or not it is music or the TV, but it is enough that when I lay down I can constantly hear noise. The problem is that it is low enough that recording it with any iPhone app won't work. It is also low enough that sometimes I wonder if I'm losing my mind and it's in my head, but every night like clockwork, it begins around 1-2 AM. I would call the police, but I'm afraid that it's too low and they will laugh at me for calling.

I can also feel the vibrations as I lay in bed. Has anyone had an experience like this with low volume bass music that keeps them up all night? The property manager says that no other tenants have complained about this particular couple, and therefore I have no evidence to back me up. The problem is that I am the only person living above them, and their stereo system appears to be right below my bedroom.

So here is some context my father is our main source of income. He is working 2 jobs, first is at a factory which sounds really bad but actually he has a lot of free time. The second one is also not that engaging as he has to just tell and sometime check on some people to see if they do their job. I know it's vague but my main point is he has a lot of free time. Recently the midlife crisis has hit him and he started going to the gym (there us nothing bad just the fact that it's not good for a 49 year old may to try to pump some muscles like a 20 year old jock). Because of that he has started to eat like crazy and demands food from my mother 24/7. 

Now some context about my mother, she also works a full time job but her's requires a lot of time spent at her workplace, she also needs to cook for 2 teenagers and a man who eats more than both me and my brother together.

Now to the main part, for the last 2 years they have started to annoy each other. I cant remember how or why exactly did it start but recently my mother has been complaining more about how my father doesn't do shit around the house. His excuse is to ALWAYS say he has too much work and is tired, once he sits on the couch he cant even get up to get a fork. This is a lot of mild thing but the main problem is my dad has been telling me he CHEATS on my mother with multiple women and he is ALWAYS commenting on how he is gonna fuck other females really good. Of course my mother cant hear all of that and im just annoyed at this already. But recently my mother has received photo evidence of him being in a club with another woman. She of course has confronted him but he just shrugged it off. So today my father said we were treating him bad(i snapped at him for a second but apologized and my mother wanted him to get her a chocolate(oh i have forgotten for their last 3 anniversaries he has given her nothing and for Valentine's day -- a dead flower.)and she got out and got it herself) to this he said he is moving out and said he is going to slowly move his stuff.

To all of this i am confused, l don't know what to do, i can only imagine we are gonna live paycheck to paycheck, because my mother's wage is almost the bare minimum and my father is a very stubborn person and not apologize even if he is at fault. How do i handle the situation? What do i do?

TLDR: My parent are gonna live separate, mainly of my fathers stubbornness.",12Apr2020,2
809,"I (M14) would never consider posting here a day ago, but here I am. 

Today, I noticed that there were red lines (look like rashes but definitely aren't) surrounding my genitals.

I touched them lightly and they felt less thick as my skin, like super thin fabric curtains compared to dense paper. They are red/purple, and, as I said, super thin. I looked up rashes around male genital area and looked at images and nothing compared, so I looked up bruising around male genital area, and that too was a dead end.

I'm only a 14 yr old virgin, so it can't have been contracted from intercourse, but in the midst of a quarantine, I can't see a clinic, and with the fact of my pride, I can't ask a family member.

Then they kept pressuring me to take her outside and to be 6ft away with masks. I don’t feel comfortable doing that with COVID-19 and especially because even the common cold can God forbid be deadly for her because she’s so small. Now they’re all mad at me and won’t talk to me. They told me to just forget about the whole thing. I just feel really sad. I’m already very lonely and I do get a little depressed sometimes. They act like I don’t want to see them. I do but it’s just my priority to protect her. I also don’t want my parents out if they have to be- they’re high risk. Idk what to do or how to feel and I just need some reassurance....,12Apr2020,0

My sister is 22 and living at home. She basically gets to do whatever she wants. She’s extremely rude to both of my parents. She often times start arguments.

819,"English isn’t my main language, so apologies in advance for spelling mistakes that will be in this.

My earlier years were pretty uneventful, i was happy and went to school like any other child. It wasn’t until i was about 10 that my life would take a large turn for the worst. You see, I grew up in a dirty and gross household and both me and mom were constantly abused physically by my older sister. 
Pretty much daily psychic terror caused me to keep to myself at home, play video games and go on the internet. Luckily i was able to be myself at school and i had some great friends, i never talked about what happened at home though, even if i told them i knew they probably wouldnt care all that much.
Not because the situation itself was unbelievable, but because i totally didnt give off the vibe of a person in that situation.

years went by and my life mostly stayed the same. It just wasnt until this schoolyear that the realization set in:

I just want to have a normal social life, and be able to invite a friend over for once and not be afraid of how they’ll react to my home life. I always lived a double life, i wanted to keep the two seperate out of fear. But im sick of it, i want a single identity and no more escapism. The problem is that my home life won’t fix itself, and its pretty much broken beyond repair. My sister is moving out in a few weeks so thats nice. But thats about the only problem that fixed itself.

My house is still a gross mess with a stench you would not believe. And i don’t know what to do, i don’t know how to make “the” change here. I love my mom but i have no idea how to break it to her as well.

I also need to overcome my own fear, probably the most important issue.

i would love some advice here, how do i get my life on track?",12Apr2020,1

For months (about 6 now or so) she has been doing this thing of texting me for a few days, usual “how are you” thing and such, then leaving me on read, then after almost a month, she hits me up again. So In February she did the same thing but I swallowed my pride and double texted her a day or so later, only to be left on read that very same night after a few texts. So after that day, I just was fed up with the constant circle of texting and being left on read, so when she hit me up in mid March, I did not reply. We have not spoken since, other than 1 time in person which was while we were at work, and it went fine. I’ve been waiting for her to hit me up again since, but nothing has happened.

822,"Before I start, I know what is happening in the world, but let’s assume for a moment that I can travel in July.

I met my travel buddy in a Facebook group, and since mid January, I have gotten to know her very well. We are both 18 and I am male and she is female. We love in different countries in Europe. We have been planning to travel in Scandinavia for a month in July and August. I have really enjoyed getting to know her, and I would like to continue to be good friends, but I have realised that (if we can travel), that I don’t want to travel with her in the summer and instead would like to go solo, despite that some things I have planned are much safer and better with a travel companion. We also complement each other very well, but I feel like these stark differences may cause friction in the long run. 

I have never expressed interest in going solo, so I am wondering how best I can tell her the news that I don’t want to travel with her. I know it will be very shocking news for her, and she might get very upset and be very confused.

Regardless if we were travelling this summer, she will hopefully do Erasmus at a university near mine and my home, and she would like to do an exchange, so we will definitely see each other in real life at some point. I won’t rule out travelling with her in the future, but right now, I just don’t think it will work, considering a few red flags and disagreements we have had already.

I would be happy to give more info. I essentially don’t want to be a dick and would like to give her reasons so that we can somehow be on the same page.

831,"Sorry in advance, y'all. This is a long one. 

I grew up in an abusive household, both emotionally and physically, but since about 16 years old, things have subsided and my sister (16) and I have been able to coexist with our parents, though none of us are that close. I've lived the past 2 years in relative peace because I go to college three hours away from home, and I expected to be able to live the same way through this pandemic in my dorm. Obviously, with all colleges closing across the country, that plan fell through. I came home about three weeks ago, and my father has become ""unhinged"" over that time. 

It started with him telling me he had a welcome-home present for me, only for him to ""gift"" me a gas mask and two full milk crates of ammunition for the gun he keeps in his office. He said it was ""in case something happens"" to him. I laughed at first, but the look in his eyes was terrifyingly cold. He was dead serious. This odd behavior has only continued since then. Just listing some occurrences:

* He took every bit of food in our fridge and freezer (cheese, microwaveables , eggs, etc.), stripped and threw away all packaging for fear of contamination from others at the grocery stores, and put it all in the near hundred tupperware containers he purchased. He even poured the milk and orange juice into Britas and threw away the jugs. 
* He's begun mandating that we only eat what he cooks in order to ration. My sister and I work around it late at night, but most of the day (from about 6 AM to 10 PM), he sits in the dining room on his computer and keeps an eye over the kitchen. 
* This morning (Easter Sunday), he woke me up for what I assumed was to do our traditional Easter egg hunt, but instead he showed me a fishing pole and said he wanted me to bait the hook with grape halves in order to catch lizards and birds in our backyard to eat.

I was already stressed about the state of the world anyways, but his behavior has worsened that stress. We live in a very nice neighborhood and are financially secure, so I'm not sure where any of this is coming from. Every time I tell him his actions are putting a mental strain on me, he accuses me of hating him as a person and leaves the house. The worst part is I've gone to both my mom and my sister, and they both agree with him. I've been called irrational by everyone in the house and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I'm leaning towards looking for a friend's or relative's place to stay for a while. I'm just scared that 1) my parents will take it as confirmation that I hate them and cut me off (they pay for my school), and 2) I'll be leaving my younger sister to fend for herself. I just don't know how I can stay here and maintain my online classwork, and quite frankly my mental health.

TL;DR - my dad has become a doomsday prepper and it's hurting my mental health.",12Apr2020,333
832,"Hey Reddit, I wasn't sure about posting about this but I really need some advices about something (since my family doesn't help me much), also sorry for my possible mistakes in english

I'm a woman in her early 20s and it's been months (i noticed it in january but saw pics from december 2019 where it was already visible) since i have a lump on my neck. I went to see a doctor to get it checked and i was asked many questions such as if someone in my family ever had thyroid problems etc etc then she told me to go get some radios of my neck. Sadly because of the coronavirus/quarantine and some papers i don't have yet related to social security, i was unable to get more infos about what's going with my neck. My lump is still there and I've recently noticed while opening my mouth that one of my tonsil(?) is actually swollen, also the back of my throat feel ""weird"", I wouldn't say dry but it's made of a very light pink and i have 1-2 dark purple veins (i definitely suck at describing my symptoms-). I kept trying to google my symptoms (which is not always a good idea) and they kept saying it's either infection or cancer. When i try to check pics about swollen tonsils I also always see pics of people with very white/disturbing patches on their tonsils and as far as i know, i don't have this? (it's not impossible for me to have tonsil stones though, but it doesn't often happen thankfully). 

Besides all these symptoms, i also feel like the sides of my jaw are kinda swollen but idk if it's just a feeling. Also i've noticed that everytime i'd feel bad to the point of feeling like crying, my lump in my neck would hurt me even more (except that, my lump doesn't really hurt me, i have to admit that sometimes i feel like it makes it a little harder for me to breathe tho). Another fact: around december/early january i'd suffer a lot from chest pain but the doctor i saw during that period didn't notice anything wrong with my body except maybe a lil bit of anemia, so I assume it was because of anxiety but idk i prefer to share all my recent symptoms to know if: any of y'all have ever been in my situation? I'm completely clueless about what's going on with my neck, if it was an infection (even untreated) wouldn't it disappear after all these months?

The relationship was going well and because we live in NYC and the coronavirus is getting very bad we can’t really come to visit each other. She also canceled certain times we were supposed to have a date prior to this but I’d assume it was because she had to do her own things. Two days ago my friend showed me her social media on Facebook (I don’t really use much social media) I looked more in to it and it was just pictures of her self until I went down and 4 months ago she posted a photo with a different person. I wasn’t really sure she was dating someone else but I looked more in to it in which I found a Facebook account with the same person with a photo with my girlfriend in it  and the person had my girlfriend on 20 photos in his Facebook. I saw them and it said things like “me and my babe” with some random emojis. This was the recent photo he posted which was 2 weeks ago. I wanted to call her since I was frustrated that she bothered to be my girlfriend knowing she already had a boyfriend who she was dating for 11 months now based on the information I got on the Facebook. I wanted to get revenge but I’m not sure wether to confront her about this. I love her so much and I feel like everything could work out but at the same time I need to realize I’m being cheated on.

This is just some of the reasons besides just enjoying yuri and nana from nana to karou being my waifu lol.

How can I know for sure if I am gay or not though? Is it possible I am just a romantic asexual? My dad thinks gay people are the result of sexual trauma and I have been abused in that way as a kid. (I do not believe the two are connected at all). Its just if it turns out i am gay I don't want him to think that way about me. I do not want to be defined by something that happened over a decade ago.

If it turns out I am how am I going to break it to my long term partner? How would I explain that? How can I make sure hes okay? How can I know for sure if i am or not? Can it be just a phase for me?",12Apr2020,3

853,"Hello all,


 I have met 2 girls at the beginning of university. Had some common experiences. Got wrong vibes right from the beginning, went out a few times anyway. Later realized they don't represent what I want in friends, one of them has zero idea on how to connect with me and has put me in uncomfortable situations in front of other people. Started acting more apathic thowards the relationship. I didn't feel like justifying myself. They never willfully hurt me but I just don't feel like staying friends with them anymore. They sometimes joke about hating me in the group chat, probably because of my lack of enthusiasm when talking to them or so. I just want to leave that chat but I mean I don't really have a good reason to. I don't even feel like I owe them an explanation. Sometimes relationships, especially not deeply developed ones fade away and I have been on that end, and I understand that sometimes people might just not want to be friends with you. I just want to part without causing trouble or hurt anyone. I just think this will be very awkward idk what to do.

I’m sorry I keep losing for help, I think this is my third one to this sub. But I’m just hitting a huge wall. We were together for about 6 months before we broke up for the first time. Actually I think we broke up on our 6 month anniversary. We broke up because she had a lot going on in her life and couldn’t handle us. We ended up getting back together a few times. I really thought we would last but then she ended it again about 2 days ago on our 7 month anniversary.  I think the reason it hurts so much is because we talked a lot about what was wrong and said we wouldn’t keep doing them. That we would last forever. And my love for her still lasts, it always will. She means the actual world to me and I’m so sad that she’s gone forever. She was my best friend and we talked every second of every day and now that she’s gone it feels like I’m all alone. I love her so much and I want to get back together with her but I’ve already accepted that it’s not possible. It also feels like she doesn’t care about what we had. The only time we’ve ever talked is when I reached out to her first. It feels like she let go of us so easily. The thing that hurts the most is that she’s the one that confessed her feelings first, the one who said the first “I love you” but she was the one to end it. She always talked about how nothing will come between us and how we have such a bright future, but then she dropped what we had so easily. It just feels like she gave up on us and didn’t give us any time to fix what was wrong. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to move on from her?

857,"I'm a 20 year old male living with my mother. We live on a corner. our driveway wraps around the house next to us and goes to both streets on the corner. Within the last 3 or 4 months someone new moved in the house behind us.

My mother and I both don't really like it and I'm kind of just hoping my mom catches him and says something at some point, but I still feel really weird about him walking through our driveway.

858,"So basically my freshman year of college (18M) I moved out of my home and lived in a freshman dorm. Each floor was separated by gender. My floor was pretty shitty because we had a bunch of trash all over the place and it was just messy in general. We also had people vomiting in the sinks, although, I don't remember if that happened before or after this incident.

Basically my friend and I got to see the different floors as we were meeting people one day (Orientation Week), and I noticed that one of the girls floor is super fucking clean, way cleaner than our floor. The following is what I'm having issues with, my memory is terrible terrible, but this is what I remember.

After this day (but still during Orientation Week), I was in the elevator with 2 other people. I got into a conversation with a girl in the elevator who lived on that super clean floor. I remember I said ""floor \[\] is my favorite floor, because it's so nice and clean"". Then I got off on her floor with her and I was going to go to the stairs (my floor was one above). She opened up her door and we were still continuing our conversation up till this point. I believe I stayed outside the room until I was let in (either by asking her which is what I think I did or by getting invited). We talked for a solid 20 minutes or so until she got a call from her friend, and she had to leave, so I left.

I was thinking about it recently and what I did was definitely kind of weird. My intentions were to just meet new people/friends, and not to creep anyone out. Throughout the conversation, it stayed friendly (what I wanted it to be) - no one flirted - and she didn't seemed creeped out at all because she was pretty receptive. However, I know with the recent #metoo movement, women can get scared and have a hard time conveying their emotions to men. I didn't touch her or anything too. A lot of people that know me say I'm a really charismatic and charming, so it's relatively easy for me to strike up a conversation with someone, especially someone from my dorm.

I'm just wondering if what I did was wrong? I feel like I'm being a bit over dramatic because a part of me feels like I also was doing the right thing, my intention was to meet new people, not to be weird/creep someone out. I'm just conflicted, and if it was genuinely creepy, I need help with the regret, because I hate making other people feel bad when it wasn't my intention to do so.",12Apr2020,2
859,"A couple of nights ago, my friend was sending videos of her in my friend group chat of her doing cocaine. I got extremely worried while my other friends weren’t taking it as seriously. She was saying that she thought I’d always be down for it since me and my friends always joke around about it, and said that she was hurt that she felt like I didn’t trust her with her limits. I 100% understand how that made her feel upset. But it honestly breaks my heart that she isn’t talking to me anymore. I hate that she saw me as “the lame friend who didn’t go along with what she was doing” and frankly I just wanted to make sure she didn’t go overboard with drugs. I didn’t mean to make her feel judged, and I fully trust that she knows what she’s doing, but I was just trying to make sure. Knowing her, I know she won’t trust me as much anymore and won’t feel open showing me that side of her which sucks because I was one of the only few people she actually trusted enough with her real side. I’m honestly just thinking of telling her to just tell me if she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. But should I actually go through with it?

862,"today my brother told me about what he thought he saw yesterday night and he normally jokes around about his dreams and stuff but you could tell it was quite serious and he was pretty scared of what he saw. he was telling me how he heard noises in our garden and thought someone was there, so he pulled the blanket over him. he needed to breathe so he uncovered himself and he told me he saw a woman around 8 feet tall with curly hair up to her shoulders, in a white gown, had sockets for eyes and jagged teeth. i told him it was probably just one of those things where something in your room looks like something its not, e.g. clothes on a chair. but he was genuinely concerned about this.

when we were younger, we always watched these creepypasta/ urban legend stories. it never really freaked me out but my brother being 2 yrs younger than me was quite scared, so we stopped watching them. one time, he was really scared about this japanese urban legend about a woman who was 8 feet tall and would kill you if you ever took notice of her or something like that. her name is hachishaku-sama if you want to read into it more. basically my point is that he was pretty much describing her.

my brother is 12, he's in his first year of secondary school. i think he's too old to have these imaginary sights, and he even asked if he could see some sort of psychiatrist once this whole covid-19 thing is over, so i'm a little concerned. it's probably nothing, but my brother means a lot to me and i don't want him to be traumatized or anything while he's still a kid. any advice on how to stop him seeing these things?

863,"OK so I have to tell a little back story. I'm (22M) currently living in the US. My family and I used to live here long ago until we moved back to Mexico, 3 years ago my brother and I came here again then the rest of my family followed like a year ago. We're currently renting an apartment here in California and there's 4 people in that contract: My brother, sister, mom and I, we all divide the rent equally. Additionally my dad who is a 55yrs old life long ashtamic was visiting at the start of the year before shit got real and decided to stay with us. My sister is an alcoholic and back to pre-COVID-19 she would regularly go out with her friends and get wasted and that would annoy us, but didn't cause much trouble besides that. 

Well, since COVID19 situation prompted stay at home warnings. She has been completely ignoring these warnings, she goes out at least 2 times a week I suspect to some of her friends' houses to get drunk, two weeks ago my brother and I had to pick her up at a parking lot because she was drinking there with some other guy and she was super high/drunk and couldn't drive back home. We've given up worrying about her, she just doesn't care about herself, but we've told her to at least think about our dad, he is within the most endangered demographic for this virus, we are living in Orange County where there's currently more than 1250 confirmed cases and she just doesn't care. I've tried to convince my mother and brother to kick her out before this pandemic started she's bringing just so many problems but they wouldn't budge saying she's family and we can't just kick her out, yet here she is, possibly fucking us all over. I'm scared for my dad, so is the rest of my family, my sister thinks everyone is being overly dramatic. Her birthday is in 4 days an I just heard her over the phone saying she wants to make plans to drink with her friends. I feel powerless, I've been considering moving by myself so I don't have to deal with this. But my mom and brother wouldn't be able to pay rent if I left. What would you guys do? Is it somehow illegal to go out, does it break any laws so I can at least scare my sister. Sorry I just needed to empty my mind. I'd really appreciate some insight.",12Apr2020,1

867,"TL;DR at the bottom sorry for the length, this situation is a little difficult to explain but I'll do my best.

I applied for multiple jobs before COVID-19 started to heavily affect the U.S. hoping I could get one in my field. 1 job replied back and set up a phone interview, but this was pushed back and eventually canceled because it was scheduled right at the beginning of shelter in place orders in Texas. I kept in touch and we talked about my future chances to which I was told that ""my information and contact details are saved and as soon as the company is allowed to rehire again that I would be contacted immediately but also to email weekly for updates."" This job is perfect for what I want to do in almost every way so I'm excited for the opportunity if/when it comes after quarantine is lifted.

A few days later a second job contacts me which is identical to the first one, or so I thought. They do the same job but instead of taking place in one location, they go to client's houses to conduct the session. This is where the problem comes in because this 2nd job told me I could start right away so I've been doing the onboarding program for it but there's issues that I've come across that make me seriously doubt the integrity and safety of doing this job. 

The issues include: 
1. I found out this job is a home based session job and with COVID-19 being really bad right now I dont feel safe or comfortable doing that because my partner has bad immune system issues and I could potentially infect her and her family. The company said the only prevention being done is making sure other family members stay out of the room and employees follow CDC protection like gloves and a mask which doesn't seem like enough for me but I understand they're doing all that they can.

2. I was told I would have 14 days to finish a 48 hour onboarding program (that is usually given 30 days to complete) However, I was only given 11 actual days to complete this training due to the fact the onboarding was given to me at 11:50pm which took away 1 day, the other 2 promised days were just never provided. On top of all that, I'm also in my last semester of college so I'm heavily focused on getting all my class work done. 

3. The communication is atrocious, I'm told only one person is in charge of my onboarding case but my emails were ignored so I moved to calling, which was also not answered after 3 tries. Eventually my communication is reduced to texting, the only way they'll respond to me at all and even then it takes 3 or 4 days to answer my multiple texts. This is a serious issue because I only have 11 days to do this onboarding program and I need answers to a lot of questions. And of course I was texting on weekdays only to be sure i wouldn't ask on a weekend when people arent working.

So now my dilemma at hand: do I try and adjust to this 2nd job right now until the 1st one contacts me again or do I not do the 2nd job at all and wait? This is mostly an issue because I have bills to pay like everyone else but currently have no income due to my job being closed from COVID-19.  I AM requesting unemployment payments weekly but I'm still waiting for them to arrive so I'm unsure on how much I would be getting. This 2nd job would provide me an income but I would be risking going to multiple people's homes and increase my risk of contracting COVID-19. 

TL;DR: I have no income and bills to pay, I could do a job but risk getting COVID-19 and spreading it and I'm unsure on what I should do. Another job is POTENTIALLY waiting for me but I have no date of when it'll accept new hires yet due to shelter in place order issues in Texas. I currently have a job but they've closed for the same reasons for now so i have no idea when it'll open up again yet.",12Apr2020,0

I recently moved into my own place after living with someone for 10 years. This person was my long time girlfriend where somewhere along the line we stopped being partners and became roommates. 

The relationship ended mostly due to my continuous lying about a subject very sensitive to her. Essentially I broke her trust one too many times and ran out of chances. But we still remained great friends and continued to live together until she found a place she could afford to live on her own. 

Right before this move she started to have feelings for another of her friends. Their relationship is unknown to me but I know she is very attracted to him and I have a feeling they are further along than she is letting on. (Her business completely)

So where is the needed advice? Well I still have feelings for her. In fact this whole experience has really sparked me to realize how amazing she is and how much I want to be with her. This is all great timing on my part but she has said she is open to considering me again which is some hope. Still I find I struggle some days getting tight in my chest thinking about her and her other friend. I am also often hit with guilt and regrets. Still I am happy to have a great friend and consider myself lucky to at least have that.

896,"I (19F) am starting to hate my mother (52) and I don't know if I'm allowed to feel this way. I don't know if it's my age, or if I'm the one in the wrong. I need advice, and I don't really know where to get it. Today was a breaking point for me because she punched me in the face, and this isn't the first time she's struck me.

Some backstory: Today, I was having a casual conversation with both my mom and dad about a conversation I had with my cousin last night. She has a very mild version of COVID19 and she and I were talking about chismosos (gossips). Our family is FILLED with chismosos, and the news of her sickness spread like wildfire within the hour. I told my parents about the funny comment that my cousin said, which was ""my mom is the first person to tell me to not say anything to anyone else, but she will turn around and tell everyone about my business"". I thought it was funny, so I told my parents about the comment and said, ""she knows the struggles. You're the same way, Mom"" and laughed, because my mother is the same way. My business turns into the family's business.

My mom got furious, and said that she never tells anyone about my business, and she decided to make some hurtful comments and was just being a jerk overall. I got mad and called her out for going through my phone, as well as my dad's. I remember I was trying to find a pic of myself on her phone (with her permission) and found pictures of my dad's phone with his texts, which I deleted because those were HIS conversations between him and his friend. I brought this up and she went absolutely psycho. She resorted to saying hurtful things and bringing up beef that she had with my dad, saying things about him, and I guess she was attempting to sound like some sort of badass by saying, ""oh, I know things"", and ""look, now he's acting like an angel"".

She would NOT stop berating us, and my poor dad was trying to tell her to stop and she just wouldn't. I told her to stop very firmly and said that if she didn't stop, she was about to get my apple juice all over her. She was being vindictive, rude, toxic, and overall abusive. She didn't stop, so the juice flew. She flipped and decided the best thing to do was to punch me in the face *hard* and almost broke my glasses. I tried kicking her back, but my dad got in the middle and prevented anything else from happening. I went up to my room and about 10 minutes later, she unlocked my door with not even a knock and started yelling at me again. She said that she has all the texts still and that she'll use them to do something and that ""I'll see"". At this point, I was even MORE livid than before, so I yelled at her to get out. She almost punched me in the face again, so I smacked her arm and slammed the door in her face.

&amp;#x200B;

She refuses to accept that she is ever in the wrong. My dad can be a major ass sometimes, but he provides for us, he goes to work, he takes us places, and he does everything a father and husband should do. The ONLY thing my dad has really done was smoke weed on occasion because he has a high stress job (and I don't think he even does it anymore), and clearly a really bad marriage. He drinks, but never to the point of getting drunk, but alcohol is apparently evil in any form other than hand sanitizer. My poor dad even bought tickets for my mom to go see her family in Puerto Rico as a surprise and she was telling everyone that my dad forced her to go.

I don't know what to do. I really am starting to resent my mom. I don't want her in my life. But somehow, she does these little nice things and it makes me feel guilty about feeling like this. I don't know if I'm allowed to feel this way about her. I mean, she's my mom. Aren't I supposed to love her, no matter what? I'm so conflicted. I'm tired of her behavior, and she refuses to go to family therapy. She refuses to go to marriage counseling with my dad. And she even told people that she was a victim of domestic violence because my dad didn't give her money when she was being a jerk (my mom doesn't have a job). Even my therapist is shocked at her behavior.

Everyone but her is wrong. Everyone. I'm tired of being blamed for things, and not feeling loved by my parents. I just need advice about how to go about this. My mental health is plummeting at such an alarming rate and I don't know what I can do to fix this situation. I hate her, but I'm feeling guilty because I feel like I'm not allowed to hate her.

I’ve been single for two years and I really didn’t think it would be so long. I’ve dated guys I didn’t like enough or they didn’t want a relationship. 

Meanwhile I see someone get divorced, date someone else and become engaged in that time. I see a guy who didn’t want a relationship because he was recently out of one, find someone else already. I see my ex get all he wanted, he got married had a baby got promoted and a house, while I live with my parents and my new job furloughed me for the rest of the summer (and he was abusive so I know he’s not actually happy but I also can’t help but wish he was failing and not me.

I don’t have really any super close friends any more, but my distant friends are basically all married and don’t really understand or have time to talk or anything.

I am in my junior year of college. Trying to get everything figured out for graduation and am struggling with deciding what I want to do.

I recently got shown the requirements for my local teaching license program and am debating changing my whole path to go into teaching instead. I still want to get my Environmental science degree but potentially want to go to a teaching prep school after my bachelors. Problem lies in the fact I will have to retake my least favorite subject of all time. I absolutely hate chemistry and it’s probably because I was in a bad place when I tried it before and got Ds. Now I will have to take two semesters of it and the thought just makes me want to cry. It brings back memories of almost failing. I’m not longer doing poorly, I have been in a good place and excelling. I just need advice on what to do. I could do chem and a bunch of other classes required and maybe not even go into teaching but at least then I would have the opportunity if I wanted to go after working for a while. Or I could go back to school later. Or I could just do it now. My academic advisor sorta sucks so I’m asking the internet for advice.

913,"(NSFW for references to sex)

Hi Reddit. I’m brand new to this and i don’t know how to ask my question delicately, so here I go! I need help writing a sex scene. 

Here’s where we are: Their friend has just left the house. They’re sat alone on a couch basically suffocating in sexual tension. The only problem is that I can’t rekindle the conversation! They’re sitting there awkwardly in silence. I’ve mulled over multiple possibilities, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to get from where we are now, to where we wanna be (in bed, WINK WINK).

 At least, this was the case until I asked my guy friend what a girl might say to turn a conversation from innocent and playfully argumentative to sexual, to which he replied: ‘make me’.

Thank the heavens for this phrase, this ‘make me’ that has such a driving power in and of itself that it proposed an abundance of ideas for the continuation of the scene. It was perfect. From ‘make me’ to the end of the scene, I wrote just short of 8000 words. 

But now I was faced with a new problem: The In-Between. I had written him ‘making her’, but in doing so I completely overlooked what he has making her do in the first place. Shit.

There are limitations: It cannot be physical. He cannot make her give him something or go somewhere, purely because he is faster and stronger than her, and could easily get it himself. It can’t be something threatening, heavy, or forceful. It has to be consensual, because obviously. 

I basically deduced that it would have to be verbal or psychological. a ‘tell me’.

I’ve wracked my brain thinking about this, desperate to write everything absolutely-completely-independently On My Own, but a week has passed and I have caved in. 

So, Reader, I am formally requesting your assistance. What is something you might want to know about someone who you think you already know everything about? 

TL:DR; What is something you might ask for which the appropriate response would be ‘make me’?",12Apr2020,0
915,"Hi. I left school two years ago and now study modern languages at university. I went to a school known for its tiny classes especially at A level. I had several incredible teachers who I'm still in touch with. One of these is my spanish oral teacher. She was amazing and deserves most of the credit for the fact that my spanish oral skills are extremely strong. My current spanish lecturer isn't that great and she hasn't helped with oral at all this year. I took the assessment via skype a few weeks ago (my university was one of the first to shut down) and got the mark back a few days ago. I am happy with my mark but not my feedback as it isn't that detailed which I understand as she's probably under a ton of stress at the moment and had a ton of presentations to mark. But I know if it was my former spanish oral teacher she'd have given me a long list of everything I'd got wrong and critiqued me strongly (not in a mean way at all I love that woman and if we said anything wrong she'd just go nooooooooooooooooo and make us repeat it until we got it right). On top of all this I have my capstone project proposal presentation due next week also in Spanish (also on skype) which is extremely important and it'd be helpful to know more of what I need to work on. In my former spanish teacher's latest email (she emailed checking up on me and my wellbeing with the current situation and this was her response to my reply) she said that if I need any help with spanish and prepping for the exam and whatnot she'd be happy to help as with exams cancelled she's rather indisposed right now.

918,"So here’s some backstory, I guess you can consider me the middle child (30) I have two older brothers A(41) E(40) B(17) . None of have a good relationships with our mom but it’s probably the best it’s even been right now. The oldest and youngest have the same dad ( He’s deceased now) ironically their dad and our mom dated on and off since HS and I grew up around him the most. He was a terrible man, he battled with drug and alcohol addiction, he was very abusive to my mom and I. As an adult I realized my mom was a victim but growing up our relationship was so bad because I couldn’t understand why she stayed with my stepdad. 
My mom claimed she didn’t know whose E’s dad was until he was a teenager and once they reconnected he died a year later. 
I’m a product of a one night stand, after my mom figured things out her and my dad tried to make stuff work but with his drinking,drug use and mental illness they didn’t work. 

So that’s our parent issues. 

Growing up I was always close to E, looked up to him as a father figure and I think that’s why I never actually looked at him for who he was. I just gave him the highest honors and I know that’s my fault. As I’ve begin to open my eyes I realized he wasn’t that great. He borrowed money from me and never gave it back.  ( a couple of hundred dollars) Months down the line I asked for the money back because I needed it to help pay for a surgery, he was mad and rude towards me for asking. Once the deadline came for when I needed the money he just stopped responding to me. We didn’t talk for over a year after this. I reflected on things and realized he was very selfish and self centered at times. He would always buy nice clothes,shoes and etc for him and his family ( not essential more so cosmetic items) but never attempted to pay me back. He could care less about how I’m doing. Once we reconnected I learned he didn’t take my medical issue serious,I told him I was diagnosed with a disorder that doesn’t have a cure and he admitted he didn’t think it was a big deal back when I needed the money, I moved out of state a few months later and the relationship never really went back to normal. 
As a younger sister I had always been there for him - my mom would kick him out a lot and I would always sneak him back in the house at 4/5 yers old. I wouldn’t eat so he could have my food, gave him my allowance, wash his clothes and etc. -  Our oldest brother A just moved back to the state I’m in now and he told me some of the things E said about me and I just can’t believe that my own sibling would bad mouth me. He talked about my relationships and friend choices and made comments on my sexuality ( Said I was only gay because our mom didn’t raise us right or teach me how to be a female) he’s also made comments on our younger sister who will technically be our little brother once he turns 18. He blames our mom for our sexual preferences and it’s not fair to her. 


A - I just reconnected with him after a 10 year break. While a freshman in HS my mom took custody of A’s two sons. My brother went to jail and the mom was a crackhead. Over the next 4 years I watched my mom struggle, when I say stubble I mean just that, we lived with no electricity for weeks because she couldn’t pay the bill, we didn’t have a lot of food, we all wore hand me down/ second hand clothes. He got out of jail and didn’t get the boys from my mom. He started a whole new life and had another kid. He was buying designer clothes,traveling and living life while I struggled with school and a job to help raise his kids. 2005 until last year my mom had his sons and he doesn’t even think to repay her or acknowledge all that she has done. I know it’s her issue but it still bothers me as well. 

Both of my brothers ignores our little sister, I don’t know why but I hate it because she hasn’t done anything to them as a child. They often say she gets away with too many things but wtf does that matter? 

My mom - we’ve always had ups and downs but most recently I had a suicidal attempt, when my partner contacted her hoping she would make things better but she made it worst. She was yelling at me and eating her food, my partner begged her to come over ( we live about 5 minutes away from each other ) but my mom didn’t come. I wanted her to come.... I just needed a hug or someone besides my parter ATM . The next day she called asking off things were okay with me because she lost so much sleep the night before because she was so worried about me, I didn’t believe the statement at all. But realized she handled the situation the same way she handled my attempt when I was younger. She yelled at me versus trying to understand what I did and eventually grounded me once I recovered so she could keep a watch on me.

I don’t think she realizes that I can hear her playing :(. And I saw that she was online so I looked at the thing on my ps4 and it said she was playing she didn’t even try to hide it. I would be fine with it because I mean she can do whatever she wants but she could just tell me and I’m sure she knows I would be fine. Sorry that this is so long and I’m sure it’s is stupid and I’m geting upset over nothing I just wanna know what to do. We call eatchother a lot I just wish people would stop blatantly lying to me. :( I’m not saying she’s obligated to do anything with me just wish she understood how it makes me feel.

I am 15 now and I was with my father all day today. (My parents had split from then to now, I had spent time with my mother yesterday). I got home and my mother wasn’t home, she was out with her boyfriend and his family. I get a call from my dad saying to hide the guns in my house because my mother was wasted. Today she came home drunk without her boyfriend, saying how he was a mistake and we deserve better. Apparently she was threatening suicide to my father or something of that sort. Things calmed down and I brought the guns out of my room. My mother is still tipsy and wasted, and it just hurt having to do that. I’d go with my father but he is living with my grandfather and there is no room for me. I will be moving in with him in September. What do I do until then? It’s in the middle of a pandemic, I live in Maine and we haven’t had power for a few days because of a storm. I’m stuck in the dark and today sucked. The second time this holiday has sucked.

939,"I'm a senior in high school, and I have a horrible relationship with my parents. My whole life I have wanted to leave home. Here is my situation:

Stay in my hometown: live in the dorms, have access to my car, be close to people I already know, crappy weather in my city, be expected to see my toxic family more frequently, not have to worry about paying for anything and have money for extra things because school is cheap

Go out of state: my parents are spending 10k more, no car, much better weather, meet new people, be away from my toxic family, probably struggle a little more for extra things (would have to pick up my phone bill and money for clothes, etc)

I do not have any savings which I take full responsibility for. My parents do this thing where they pay for all that I have, more than generous, but as soon as I stop kissing their butt or assert an opinion that is different than there's they pull the rug from under me. If I stay here, they will expect me to stay in contact, they'd even pop up at my dorms.

For example; she constantly has pains (which is normal), recently she was painting and cracked her back and was stuck laying on the floor unable to move until her mum came home and helped her.

944,"hi there

i’m 20F and i live with my mom in my childhood home in california while i finish my associates degree. i have a twin brother who lives 45 min away from my dad who lives in oregon. my parents are still currently married. 

when i was in high school, my mom would talk to me a lot about how she doesn’t see herself being married to my dad for her whole life because they just aren’t good partners for each other. they never really fought in front of us growing up but i don’t think i’ve ever seen them kiss or be affectionate. this divorce has been a long time coming and i’m not surprised by it. i also have had a lot of time to come to terms with their relationship, although seeing the plan come to life may re awaken those emotions (which i’m prepared for). 

when we were seniors in high school, my dad took a better paying job in oregon, which is why he lives there now. it’s been about 2 years of him living by himself in an apartment and he hates it. in january he stayed with me and my mom while he was interviewing for jobs in california to move back here. i’m not sure what the details are of his plans for the future, but he wants to move back to where my mom and i live now. the area we grew up in is the same town he grew up in, so this is his home. i have no idea if divorce is in his version of plans for the future. 

today, my mom told me that a guy she’s known since high school asked her to be a part of his life and he purchased a beautiful 5 million dollar home for her (and i) to live with him. this house is a 10 minute drive away from where my mom and i currently live. she decided to say yes to him and to divorce my dad. but my dad still doesn’t know about any of this. 

my parents obviously are gonna have to figure out how everything is gonna get split and since my dad plans on moving back to california, i hope that i can be there to help him through all of this. my mom obviously has her new “boyfriend” to help her with any of the divorce issues, and i would also be able to help her out. since she’s also the one facilitating it, she has the luxury of having more time to come to terms with the decision. 

however, my dad doesn’t have a partner to rely on with any of it like my mom will. if my dad stays in oregon for all of this, i’m worried that my brother won’t be very much help to him since he lives 45 min away and is going to school (oregon state). i’m hoping that my dad comes here to go through this process and i can stay with him in my childhood home while my mom lives in her new house. 

no matter if my dad is in oregon for this, or if i can be with him in person in california, how can i make sure that he knows everything is gonna be okay? they’ve been married for 31 years and my dad was married once briefly before my mom, so he at least knows a little bit of what it’s like. i just don’t want him to be in pain or feel really depressed about it. i hope that he can feel relief somehow, but what can i do to help him? 

sorry this was long, i was kinda just writing it out for catharsis but also obviously for advice. 

tldr; moms divorcing dad and living with new man. dad doesn’t know yet and i want to be there for him (and mom) when it’s finalized but don’t know how

945,"Hey y'all. Title says the short version. The long version is this:

I'm an engineer a year out of school and have been working in construction. My job is 100% travel, meaning I relocate to the job site for anywhere from a few weeks to most of a year, then move on to the next. The problem I'm faced with now is that I think the lifestyle is getting very unhealthy for me, and this isolation situation has only exacerbated it. I'm a thousand miles from anyone I care about and I don't know what to do. 

I have a history of mental health issues (have been on and off medications for years) and I can start to feel them creeping back in now, and at this point something I'm heavily considering is asking my employer if I can travel back home for a health issue so I can see a psychiatrist (I'd just tell them doctor) and continue my work for the time being from home with my family. The site is shut down and I've been working from a hotel room for the last month anyway so this will be no different functionally. 

The real question comes after that. I've struggled for awhile on and off for months with this and always told myself that I'd stay at least a year for the sake of resume strength, but now I'm terrified of this economic situation making it very difficult for me to get a new job that would be close to home without travel. If it comes to it, would I really be screwing myself over if I had to pull the plug on the job to get me out of an unhealthy lifestyle for me? I have the money to cover six months or more of my loans and expenses if I stay with family, but will that gap hurt my chances of getting a job? I just don't know what to do.

I miss having a normal lifestyle, with hobbies that don't change and routines that are static. I feel like I'm getting uprooted every couple of months here and I feel alienated from my friends and family.",12Apr2020,1
946," 

Hi Reddit, Normally I would rather talk to close friends or familly about something like this, but none of them are ever interested about talking about my relations so here I am.

Anyways to start this off we were together for a year and a couple months, everything was going great before the pandemic lock-down forced us to stop seeing each other. During this time, she was put through a lot of stress because she was not able to return back to her country due to the travel ban, so she was essentially locked in her college dorm room where she has little to no wiggle room/socialization. I understand the amount of pressure that this can put onto ones shoulders so I understood the change in the way she acted over the next few weeks.

During her isolation, she is not one who does well without socialization and this caused her to spiral into a deep depression among various other things that are bothering her. Throughout this I have tried my best to be a comforting person and to try to remain a positive figure in her life while she was going through hell. As the quarantine kept going on, her texts became more and more spaced out, from 6 hours, to 12 hours, to 24.... I could feel them becoming more cold and distant. Once I realized what was going on, I figured I would ask if her and I were still ""good"". To which she gave a lengthy response that she was going through a lot of mental battles and is in a very dark space in her life right now. I replied to this with any support and advice that I could help her with, finishing letting her know that I am here for her if she needs anything. Somewhere throughout that text, I missed that she wanted to ""be alone"", meaning she was breaking up with me. After this I was blindsided and had no idea how to respond. She went on to tell me the whole ""I don't want to be a burden/weighing down on anyone"" and the ""you were great and I still care a lot about you."" I read these and was abit upset that I did not even deserve a phone call to end this. I simply left the last two messages on read and I am lost with how I should respond to these, or if I even should respond to them.

For some background information, this was not our first break up, and she seems to have some kind of seasonal depression that she goes through. We have been together for abit over a year

TL/DR: Girlfriend who is in a dark spot in life broke up with me over text, I am unsure how to respond... or even if I should at all. Wondering if I should be upset over this or...",12Apr2020,1
948,"Me and my friend have had a long history of arguments but we usually got over them. Back in October, with as specially told not to be friends with him because of something he did. I became ok friends with him anyway 3 months later. We’ve had arguments after this and we usually got over it. We’ve been playing with someone else together over the past week and last night I told them I wouldn’t be able to play that much. When I did get on, they immediately started inviting me and I didn’t join. They started messaging me and calling me toxic. I said can I please get someone along time. They were both on the same side and were blaming me for starting the argument. It got to a point where he said just said fuck you because he was so mad. And I said no, fuck you because I’m not even supposed to be friends with you but I still risked getting in trouble. I know I probably shouldn’t have said that but they expect me to be alright with them judging me, and blaming me all the time. Idek what to do I honestly hope he gets what he deserves",12Apr2020,1
949,"All of these interactions happened online 

I have a discord groupchat that I frequently go on to talk with friends. I know all of them personally but with most I’m not close enough to them where I would privately message them so I talk to them on the groupchat. 

There’s a person in the groupchat who I’m pretty close with but she’s always so mean to me online. Her friend usually joins in on bothering me but I just assume that I just misinterpreted the messages  she would send towards me in the groupchat. 
She’s really sweet to me in real life but gets really angsty to me on the groupchat. I’m getting pretty close to this guy in the groupchat (as friends and it’s not romantic) because we found out that we have similar interests. 

We would always recommend different anime and mangas to each other on the groupchat because it made more sense to chat in the groupchat because the other people in there that are also interested in anime and manga. Whenever I message the groupchat she always comes in and complain how much we text on the groupchat or how irreverent the topic we were talking about was. 

I thought she was addressing the whole group but I’ve noticed she would only send these messages when I’m around. Things have been pretty rocky with her boyfriend and she didn’t get into her preferred school so I get why she’s upset but what I don’t get is why she’s taking it out on me. 

Her boyfriend is also in the groupchat and I joked about how he should get a screen protector for his phone because he drops it so much and she just comes for me. She knows I’m sensitive about my weight and acne scars but she tells me that I don’t need to tell her boyfriend what to do while insulting my weight and my acne scars. 

I just wanted to become invisible at that point so I just stopped talking. I was talking about a new anime I was watching with the guy I was talking about earlier and she and her friend comes in and starts practically attacking me. They say that they never asked for me to talk about anime and manga and how that nobody actually likes me giving out recommendations. 
They finished it off with my insulting my weight and acne scars. I just don’t understand why they keep attacking me for talking about interests when the others on the groupchat talk about their interests just as much. 

I feel like she has changed a lot since quarantine started and she’s no longer the person that I used to know. She used to bake cookies and make stickers for us and now she’s insulting everyone. I honestly don’t get how she’s such a sweetheart in real life but so mean in the groupchat.



Side note: I don’t get half the treatment that another girl gets that’s super nice. There’s a girl we both know and she’s so sweet but for some reason my friend absolutely hates her. For some background information the girls mother has cancer and her hands have pretty severe scars and burn from chemicals and my friend calls her “two faced” whenever she can’t hang out with them because she wants to spend time with her mom or is simply unable to do things because of the scarring on her hands. I don’t understand why she hates her so much but I feel like I’m not getting the full story and that’s why I shouldn’t judge but I don’t feel like this is a good reason to hate her and spread rumors about her but I would appreciate some advice on this too.",12Apr2020,1

But I can't ever remember a time when I've ever been able to do a single pushup, down and up. I can't do them on my knees, I can't do them with my elbows flared out, nothing. You must think I have absolute noodle arms, but not really. I try to work my arms out and everything is easy except for pushups.

I think I can't do them because I weight 140 pounds, all of it muscle weight (I don't have much fat on me) and not a lot of that weight is in my arms. I also have really weak shoulder and elbow joints (""double jointed"") that like to pop out and cause instability.

The second one is people I’ve met through one of my closest friend’s brother. He’s two grades below me, and most of the friends I’ve met through him (except one, who’s one grade below me) are in the same grade as him.

Since we are a group that has these different people, it makes sense that not everybody always gets along 100% of the time. A good example of this is one of the people I introduced to the group (who’s in my grade) was a complete and total asshole to one of the friends who’s two grades below me.

It was so bad that this person wouldn’t join our Xbox parties and not talk to us for a while so he didn’t have to deal with this other guys shit.

Now the problem was that none of us knew this was going on for a while until it was finally brought to our attention. This led to me trying to separate both of them, mainly talking to the one I know from school in school and the other one, who I know from outside of school, on xbox.

This didn’t last for long, as we all had a falling out with the “instigator” I guess you could call him. Everything between the rest of us is fine now, but I wish I hadn’t introduced the two of them as it would’ve saved a lot of people a lot of grief.
