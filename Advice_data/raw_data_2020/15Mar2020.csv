1,"She talks too much.

And so do I, I guess... BUT all of her stories are ‘you had to be there’ stories that to me just seems like she’s flexing the fact that she has a lot of school friends (I’m her only out of school friend).

In addition to that, she’s also a horrible listener, in the sense that whenever I tell her a story, she interrupts at least 4 times throughout, and worse, as soon as I’m done she jumps up with another ‘you had to be there’ story. It makes me feel like she didn’t give a crap about what I say, and as a result I end up shutting off and not listening to her.

I do have to give her credit, as bad of a listener she is, she always seems to remember every single thing I’ve ever told her. She’s also really fun to hang out with otherwise, but the stories thing is clouding all my judgement, and I don’t want to push her away because of something that dumb.

I tend to have a pushing away issue, so I texted her about the stories problem when I first had it, and we had a really understanding chat. But the next time I saw her(today), it was worse... and so I blatantly told her can we not tell school stories to each other anymore. Hopefully that’s the end of it.

I guess I need to learn to ignore any flaws of a friend, because if I continue like this, I’m going to accidentally get rid of all my friends",15Mar2020,1

My sister does liquor promotions as a brand ambassador at special events, bars, clubs, etc. She’s an independent contractor so she works for many companies and doesn’t get benefits from them of anything. To attempt to slow the spread her events or shifts keep getting canceled. Does anyone know how she or someone like her could go about getting any assistance or such while all of this is happening if it gets to the point where she is literally not able to work. We live in GA if that matters. Thank you!",15Mar2020,1

Lads,

I've been reading about this virus since January, and like most people, I was cracking jokes about it and did not take it seriously at all. That changed completely when someone explained the numbers to me and explained why we in Ireland in particular are in trouble. I have not stopped thinking about it since. You may not think that we are in trouble based on the number of confirmed cases so far, but we are.

I'm going to write this to you in an effort to explain what the fuck is actually going on and hopefully help in the effort. A lot of people are ringing me and asking me if I know anything on the inside. I don't know much more than what is in the news, but I have probably spotted some of the important stuff that you may have missed.

I've been tracking the numbers and confirmed cases in Ireland have been growing by 30% a day on average, which means the number of cases doubles every 2-3 days. Based on those trends, and without the shutdown, there would be 100,000 confirmed cases within a month.

But the situation is actually much worse. Based on what happened in China and Italy, the actual number of cases in Ireland is almost certainly in the thousands already. The problem is that with this virus, you can have it, not have any symptoms, and still be infecting everyone around you before you feel sick. The Government knows this. That is why they shut the country down.

On the international numbers, over 90% of cases will recover. But 9% will be seriously ill, and about 5% will require intensive care (ICU) and at least 2.5% will need ventilators. 

The Government has said between 25% and 75% of the population will get the virus. If 25% of the Irish population get it, which based on the numbers above is a very low estimate, that's 1.2 million people. 

5% needing intensive care means 60,000 people will need intensive care beds to stay alive.

We currently have 277 intensive care beds in Ireland.

I'm going to say that again:

At least 60,000 Irish people will need an ICU bed to stay alive.

We only have 277 ICU beds in Ireland.

If too many people get sick in a short space of time, many, many Irish men and women are going to die when they could have been saved. Ireland is a small country. This is going to be someone in your family or someone you know. Or their mother. Or their father.

The staff in ICU wards know the numbers. Their representative body released a statement on Thursday, which was in the Irish Times, saying that they know that they are going to be making choices on who gets an ICU bed or who gets a ventilator. They said they will be making ""challenging decisions"". I'll translate that: It means the staff are going to be deciding who lives and who dies. 

It has been happening in Italy already, and Italy has much better ICU care than we do. In terms of cases, we are 2 weeks behind Italy. The older you are, the less likely they are going to try to save you. Don't think this only applies to over 70s. If you are over 40, and need ICU, but a 30 year old also needs it, chances are the 30 year old will get it and you will die. If that doesn't scare you, you don't fully understand it.

It is absolutely nuts, but this is what is going to happen.

If we can lower the number of cases AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME, we lower the number of people needing intensive care AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME, then we free up more ICU beds, and we lower the number of Irish people who die in Irish hospitals. It is that simple. 

This could be someone close to you. Your mam. Your dad. Your partner. Your granny. Your granddad. Your brother. Your sister. Your aunt. Your uncle. Your neighbour. Your friend.

You do not want any of them dying because there was not enough ventilators or ICU beds to go around. It will not be the fault of the ICU staff. If you want to blame someone for that, blame years of governments giving tax cuts instead of investing in the health service. 

If you are furious even thinking of the idea of your loved ones dead in a coffin because a doctor thinks they are too old or are not strong enough, and giving a bed to someone who is a bit younger, then good, you are right to be. You will also be more willing to listen to what you need to do next to help stop that happening:

STAY THE FUCK AT HOME AND ONLY GO OUT IF YOU NEED FOOD. 

Watch Netflix. Read a book. Binge on a TV series. Go on Youtube. Eat food. Learn to cook. Learn to sew. Write a book. Do a diary. Figure out your life. Do press ups. Do sit ups. Do chin ups. Do zumba dancing. Do an online course in astronomy. Or Yoga. Or sports management. Or whatever the fuck you want.

Do whatever the fuck you want. You have absolutely no excuse not to keep yourself entertained at home. 

Do not go for pints. Do not have a house party. Do not go to a house party. Do not go for coffee. Do not go for a meal. Do not go for a chat. Do not visit your auntie. Do not visit your parents. Do not bring the kids over to their friends. Do not let friends come over to you.

If you absolutely have to get out of the house, go for a walk on your own or with someone you are living with. But in general:

STAY THE FUCK AT HOME UNTIL THE NUMBER OF CASES STARTS COMING DOWN.

If you want to be a hero in this, and want to save lives, but don't know what to do, stay the fuck at home.

P.S: The Brits are making a balls of it again and are not staying at home. Lots of them are going to die because they are not staying at home. Don't be like the Brits. Stay at home.

P.P.S: The more people who understand what is going on, the better. So send it on to whoever you think would benefit from it.",15Mar2020,1

5,"My sister (6f) started showing symptoms of Covid19 a few hours ago (fever, headache, sore throat, upper chest pain) after coming into contact with someone infected. She’s never had a flu shot or the flu so I’m worried that her immune system isn’t prepared for recovery. My country isn’t doing anything about coronavirus so it’s not like we can take her to a hospital. We don’t even have the room to quarantine her as she shares a room with our other sister. I’ve never dealt with the flu before and I have no idea what to do, I’ve been disinfecting multiple times a day but I’m pretty sure I’m starting to show signs of it as well. Do I treat coronavirus like the flu and just let her rest or should I be doing something else?? How do I even deal with the flu? Any advice would be massively appreciated, she’s in a really bad state and can’t even sit up as someone who’s never even dealt with the flu before it’s all just too overwhelming it feels like I’m doing everything wrong..",15Mar2020,1
6,"I have a six year old daughter and my ex and I divorced when she was four. She went to play therapy and seemed to handle it fine but at one point she was on a low dose of ADHD/anxiety medicine (off label and safe for kids). She seemed to improve and level out.

Well, her dad freaked out and dragged me to court. She ended up getting taken off the meds. He also wanted to stop play therapy. He doesn't believe in her anxiety, he thinks I cause it and she's just fine at his house. But he is so strict and invalidating at his house and she knows she can only make him happy if she acts tough, even of she's worrying a lot. 

Lately she has been a nervous wreck and really sassy. I thought it was because of the amoxicillin she was on but it has continued on beyond that. She melts down multiple times a day, when she is told to do something, she tries to talk her way out of it. She complains of pain that isn't really there and she wet her pants twice in a row! I'm really worried about her! My ex refuses to acknowledge that she is having issues. We live with my parents because of me going to school to get a career so when I have her they help out. My ex blames me being stressed and being too soft with her for her issues. Is it my fault? I've been stressed and was injured in a car crash (she wasn't in it) and I do have anxiety.

9,"My little sister is 20 y/o Head of Household, with my elderly grandma, my severely mentally ill mother, and my non-verbal Autistic brother being household members in their DHS case for food stamps. My grandma, mom, and brother all receive SSI/SSDI, but that's currently all of the income the family has.

This past summer, my sister got a job with an events company to bring in some extra money. She got laid off after a week, which was weird for obvious reasons. Her boss told her that he shouldn't have hired her at all, and that he couldn't afford another employee right now. For the short time she was there, my sister got a bad vibe that they were maybe not operating on the up-and-up. She didn't register as an employee with HR until the same day she was laid off, and the HR lady had asked her to backdate her new hire paperwork for a month prior.

After she was laid off, she had to basically fight the owner to give her a paycheck and it took three months just for her to get a personal check for less than she was owed, and no actual pay stub was ever provided. She declared the money (roughly $500) to DHS just incase but described it as being a job that had ended.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, my sister texts me asking if I can Venmo her money for groceries. She says she had gotten a letter from DHS a month ago saying the family's benefits were being terminated for undeclared income, explicitly naming the aforementioned company for whom she worked and been laid off. She called them to try and clear it up, telling them that she worked there but had been laid off. DHS said oh no, Business Name is saying that you still work there. You need to have them fill out this form saying you don't work there anymore if that's the case. She calls the business owner, and he makes up some weird crap that doesn't make sense about it being a clerical error but refuses to fill out the form. He continues to report to the IRS (who then reports to DHS) that she's making 5k/mo.

So my family still doesn't have food stamps with no resolution in sight. It seems like this company is doing some kind of tax cheating or whatever that may otherwise go unnoticed by my sister if it weren't for the fact that she receives public benefits.

I've got this friend who I bonded with over Greek Mythology and I thought it was just some casual thing like how I felt about it.

And so they told me they had built a shrine to one of the Greek gods and I listed off the kind of things they'd do in his honor and I was uncomfortable. I'm not an overly religious person and I'm not really into overly religious things, but hearing them say they were worshipping an ancient god just weirded me out.

We were married for 19 years and have three children together. My ex has taught at the same private high school throughout her entire career. Her first year of teaching was actually the same year we got married. 

Our relationship started falling apart around the spring of 2014. I work in construction management and was hired on to work the biggest and most stressful project of my life around this time. My ex would get frustrated with all the late nights I was working and we began arguing on a daily basis. The stress from both of our ends eventually led to a dead relationship. It got to the point where we had no feelings left for each other and would just ‘tolerate’ one another. I had always figured she would come back around eventually.

I made perhaps the biggest mistake of my life in November of 2014. After a night out of drinking, I slept with one of my female coworkers and that was the start of an affair that went on for a few weeks. I eventually stopped seeing her, after realizing what I did was terribly wrong. I signed myself up for marriage counseling and begged my wife to join me. She eventually agreed and during one of our sessions, I confessed to the affair. My ex was livid and any improvements we had made over the past few sessions were completely erased. I repeatedly begged for her forgiveness but she told me she was going to need some time to process things. 

During this time, my wife had started talking to another man. He was a senior and one of her students. I didn’t find out about this until she filed for divorce in April of 2015. Two months later, he graduated high school and they officially began dating. I was sickened by this news and the first thing I did was report it to the school. They told me that there was no proof that my ex did anything illegal and that it appeared the romantic part of the relationship had indeed started after he had turned 18. My ex later found out that I talked to the school and she vowed to take me for everything in the divorce.

Long story short, she did just that. I was so hurt and angry that I turned to some bad things during this time. Her new toy boy came from a very wealthy family so she had obtained a top tier lawyer that I couldn’t realistically compete with. I also knew the kids were going to favor their mother regardless of what I said. Putting all of that into mind, I essentially gave up and settled for the bare minimum. I had ended up losing my job over all of the stress and was going broke. 

I essentially took a plea and she got sole custody of the kids in exchange for a written agreement stating that I wouldn’t have to pay her anything. The last thing I wanted to do was give her full rights to the kids but my lawyer strongly advised me to take the deal that was offered and said that I could still maintain a relationship with my kids in the long run without the financial burden. I was in a deteriorating mental state at the time and I don’t think I could have worked at all. The little money I had saved would have went straight to my ex and I likely would have found myself homeless, although looking back I think I may have just ended things entirely before it got that bad.  

Since that time, my ex and her new man have gotten married, had 3 daughters together with a fourth on the way, and are now pushing for him to adopt my biological three children. I clearly intend to fight this in court but the fact that she has sole custody, a highly renowned attorney, and a husband who has spent that past four and a half years around the kids while I have not even been allowed to speak to them under her commands. I’m afraid all the cards are in her hand and that’s what makes it so terrifying. There’s nothing I can really do besides hope the judge has a heart and sees through all of the BS. The first hearing is scheduled for next week.

Just like any other human, I’m not perfect. I’ve made some colossus mistakes over the past few years and I live with deep regret every single day. I will never excuse my actions that played a role in the breaking of my family. However, I don’t believe the mistakes I’ve made should result in the situation I found myself in now. I wish we had a better family court system that wasn’t so pro mother and I wish we had a system that didn’t allow the wealthy to have an instant advantage in situations like mine.

As I said, I’ve retained the best lawyer that I can afford and I’m listening to everything he has said from a legal standpoint. However, I’m needing some support/advice on how to control my emotions in court. My attorney has suggested that the worst case scenario for me would be the judge asking the kids to take the stand. I don’t think I could control my emotions if that were to happen for obvious reasons. I also fear the moment I come face to face with my ex, the woman who has put me through a living hell the past five years. I fear that I won’t be able to keep my mouth shut when I face new husband. I don’t know whether to stay quiet or vocally put up a fight for my children. The last thing I want to do is upset the judge who already thinks low of me. 

All I want is to retain my parental rights while being able to speak to my children without being labeled as ‘mentally unstable’. I want them to understand why I haven’t been in their lives for the past few years and prove to them that I love them and would never want to lose the role of father to them. I fear that they have already been brainwashed into hating me and already see stepdad as their real dad.",15Mar2020,1
16,"My vulnerable and dependant other half has more mental issues than I can manage or cope with now. Based in England, UK.

We've recently added hypochondria and now yet more OCD, germaphobia and extreme paranoia on to a long list which I'm sure begins with some sort of distorted thinking/broken perception issues (e.g. like BPD).

Unfortunately I'm at my wits end, I'm just not able to help her any more. Over the years I've tried positively reinforcing good thinking, pushing her to better herself, helping her to assess situations in a mature way and so on. She's had a permanent disability since birth and an abusive childhood, and so never had the opportunity to grow up normally, and I think this is really asserting itself now. I should have really pushed her to see a psychiatrist earlier on, and maybe it would have averted this. I regret this so much now.

At the very least I need to get help to come to her as she won't go and get it - she is of course unable to tell much is wrong (+paranoia and anxiety). Most of the NHS resources are about seeking help or counselling for yourself, but really we need to talk sectioning her or something similar. She is a danger to herself in her vulnerable state, and her thinking is very unhealthy.

Our relationship has unfortunately died with this last round of issues (in retrospect it has been downhill for a very long time as her issues have increased), so my home has become an asylum now (which is now very damaging for my own mental health).

Don't worry, I have no intention of just kicking her out, her safety is (and will always be - I still love her) my biggest concern, but I do need to get her into a better place mentally and physically for us both.

- Does anyone know if you can get mental health care or sectioning for others in the UK?

- I will probably need to move her out, and I'm aware the state does provide housing and suitable care for vulnerable people, does anyone know who I ask or can point me to resources?

My girlfriend and I haven't been together too long, only 3 months but I got very attached quickly (which I normally never do). 3 months may be early but I know what I feel is love. Anyway, due to this I show her a lot of attention. Like wayy more than any normal 3 month relationship. Maybe more than a  2 year relationship.

Last week, she wanted to tell me something and told me not to take it personally. She said she loves the way I care for her and love her, but she wanted to let me know that in her past relationships, when someone showed her too much attention she got distant. She said that since her past relationships showed her so much attention, she knew that if she ever makes a mistake/screws up, it won't matter because she knew how attached they were and that they'd forgive her. She said she doesn't feel that way with me and loves how much I care her, but still wanted to make me aware of this fact. 

Recently, my two best friends that I've known for over a year did something that really pissed me off. Instead of giving them another chance, despite knowing them for years, I dropped them and it didn't affect me at all. Now my girlfriend says she has thoughts that I would be able to drop her easily if she made a mistake. I told her I love her and that's not true, however she says she still has that thought in the back of her head. 

So my question is, should I let her have that thought in the back of her head? Wouldn't it be good for her to know that if she does something bad, she wouldn't be able to just get away with it and that I won't let it slide since I love her so much? If she had never told me that, then I would clarify right away my feelings for her and how that could never happen.

I live in Switzerland and am currently an intern.

I've been sick for the past 2 weeks, the doctors suspect a gripal infect or something like that and said i shouldn't go to school or work for the next 2 weeks so i stayed home  and i should technically be able to go to work again cause 2 weeks have passed and i'm also feeling better now.

The system as an intern here in Switzerland is as follows:
2 Days of school and 3 days of work a week.

Recently they shut down all the school in Switzerland because of the Coronavirus which means i won't have to go to school up until like april 4th. 

As far as i've been informed i still have to go to work though. The next time should be on the 18th of march.

The situation in Switzerland is getting serious but it's not as bad as Italy.

My mother is really worried about the Coronavirus and wants me to stay at home until everything gets better again.

The thing is, i'm kinda worried about losing my job which would be a really really bad thing. Especially since i've already been sick for the past 2 weeks (i did have a medical certificate though).

I've told my mom about this concern and she absolutely doesn't want me to go and she says my health is much more important.
Even going as far as saying that she will personally call my boss and call in sick for me if i don't do it myself.

I work in bank but i wont be near (m)any customers while i work so i am not really worried about catching the virus.

I have many friends that have the same internship at the same place as i and as far as i know they're all going. And i don't think i'll be able to get another medical certificate for such a long time.


So as i said my biggest concern is losing my job but i don't know if i should try to convince my mother, not go at all or do something else. I just really don't know what to do.

Do you have any advice for me?",15Mar2020,1
31,"I love the people in my life deeply but the times I feel most at peace and content is when I’m alone. Even if I’m around my favorite person I get really drained quickly. It’s not like I do anything particularly exciting by myself, but it almost feels like I can finally exhale as soon as I’m alone, like I was holding my breathe or putting on a show for other people. Is this a normal introvert thing?

With all this talk from my family and friends about self quarantining and staying home, I realized that being stuck at home by myself doesn’t seem all that bad lol.

I guess I just want to know if anyone else feels this way? Like, having love for the people in your life but also always craving alone time?",15Mar2020,1
32,"So story time (note that this  happened some recent time ago)

there was this boy in my sports class that i thought that was very humorous. We exchanged phone numbers and started from there. We began talking about whatever, sending memes to each other, etc, and i started to grow a crush on him. We confessed to each other as we were both aware of how we felt towards each other, and we began dating. I felt a bit weird knowing he was older than me (by 3 years mind you) but i couldn't help but to be overwhelmed with happiness. 

And this is where the problem starts. As we both began to get more comfortable with one another, we began making some hella dirty jokes to one another, and even going into detail with it.  Like how hes gonna do this to me and how im gonna do this stuff to him, but obviously we didn't.Most of the time tho, i just talked about whtever topic i could think of or just simply be a cringey gf and say cringe stuff. i feel ashamed to even say this, but i went into detail like those smut fanfics, and also did he, yet again we did nothing related to intimacy(only sneak a hug). My parents began to catch notice on how i act and how i was always smiling and stuff and began asking me who was i talking to. I obviously said my friends, but they knew i was talking to him. My knee at the time (and still is) kinda weak, so i couldn't see him much or practice with him, but i would at least make an effort to sit down and just admire how strong he is. One red flag i noticed is that he asked me for nudes but i obviously told him to fuck off at that sense, and he never asked again. Back to the topic thou, this went on till one day he told me he wasn't gonna go, so i decided  to stay at my grandmas and just text him while doing my hw. Big mistake.

My mom came back from her classes and snatched my phone away, asking me if i was talking to him. Me not having that much gut to lie at this point said yeah and she began to read the messages. Once we got back home both my dad and her began shouting at me at how stupid i am to let him talk to me like that and have the nerve to continue on with his little games by putting myself on a tray for him (quote from my parents.) They were even more disappointed at the fact that i used such an explicit language (as cursing and saying dirty jokes) to not only with him but my friends. she read the messages out loud and i began to obviously be ashamed of just everything. we didn't really dirty joke all the time, we actually just talked about whatever, but it was still enough to make me feel embarrassed .

What they did as my punishment? Take my most favorite sport (because thats were i see him), my phone,not to talk to anymore boys (but i still do) and the trust they had with me. 

I soon began to realize how my jokes didn't even sound like jokes but me sounding like a horny fuck (and him too),and  wondered if he was just using me for his own pleasure since im younger than him, if he actually wanted to do the stuff he said and show off to his friend of how his gf is such a 'whore', or genuinely liked me. My parents say he only wanted me for show off and to do use me to later then spit me out like chewed gum, so i don't even know. They told me that they'll probably take me back there sooner  if he leaves and if i make an improvement to myself, but i don't even know. All i just want is for everything to be back to normal again with me and my parents, having my most favorite sports back, and just...want back normal. I know a way to contact him, but im not risking it knowing im still fuzzled with what i just did and what my parents told me. 

I need advice on how to keep on going,ways to make everything normal, and what to do with him. I keep on telling myself to not like him after what happen and have some self respect, but i still think about him and what happened

im sorry if i just seem all over the place and sound stupid, but im too scared to talk to this to anyone in fear that i'll be look down and seen as nothing but a whore (p.s getting yelled at to 'just stop thinking of him') Thank you for taking your time and effort to actually read this",15Mar2020,1

35,"Hi.
Tldr at the bottom.
Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I need advice, so I guess it is. Sorry for the length.
I'm in quarantine at the moment, and will have to remain here for another 14 days minimum. 
I suffer from depression, anxiety, bpd, and attention deficit disorders.
As a result of these, I lose interest in things very quick, meaning I dont have any hobbies or anything I particularly enjoy doing.
This quarantine means I cant leave the house or interact with other people at all, so going for a walk or the gym, which I liked doing and was a nice escape, is out of the question. 
I live with my husband, but he has his video games, and honestly, we're getting a bit tired of each other, and on each others nerves.
I feel like I'm losing my mind and I have so many negative thoughts rushing around my head, as I have nothing to distract me at all... I feel stuck and claustrophobic and all sorts of other things... and bored out of my mind. 
Does anyone have any advice for how I can cope, or hobbies that I can try out, or anything that may be helpful? 
Thank you.
Tldr; in quarantine and I'm going crazy... send help 🙃",15Mar2020,1
37,"I recently found out about my cousin being pregnant... we have all advised her to get an abortion as it would be the best decision for her age and situation. She and her mother don't want her to get an abortion. Some background information: Her mother is always away from home and from her kids and rarely takes care of them. My 70 year old grandma frequently babysits them while she is gone and would be the one taking care of this baby. My grandma is getting old and is in no shape to take care of a newborn. To add on top of it, we are poor and in no financial stability to support a baby. My cousin's reasons for keeping the baby is her boyfriend (who is on probation) and his family will help take care of it. The truth is, neither him or his family wants anything to do with the baby and my cousin is delusional. She has also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past and is in no mental stability to take care of a baby... she can barely take care of herself. I'm worried and genuinely sad for her. She won't listen to my mom or grandma about getting an abortion...How do I convince her to get an abortion?",15Mar2020,1

It sucks, because out of all people, why did I have to like him? He made me cry almost every night, called me homophobic and mysoginistic slurs, etc. 
They’ve been dating since January, and my friend is well aware of all the hurtful things he did to me. I posted about this situation on this sub, and many told me to just tell her. But I’m scared, because I’m afraid she’s going to leave me behind. And she seems happy, since she brags about him 24/7.

40,"So with the current health concerns being what they are, I am definitely concerned in working with kiddos at this time as they are 1. notorious germ carriers! 2. a vulnerable population in times of compromised immunity. My school division hasn’t closed at this time, although we are being told it may happen right away. 

I work once a week in a retail environment. I’m not in love with the job, and I’ve been there for about 3 months now. It’s pretty casual, no one ever gave me real “training” or even the numbers to call or protocol for taking time off. The whole hiring process was a bit of a joke as well, but again it’s one day a week so I don’t mind. 

I emailed yesterday afternoon to request that I take the day off if possible, as keeping my kids healthy and doing my part to limit exposure from the outside community (as per instructions from the school board) is the least I can do. I’ve only ever communicated with management via email, so naturally that’s how I thought to contact them. I never heard back so I was anxious but genuinely didn’t know who or where to call. I got an email this afternoon and my boss was basically questioning my motives for not showing up and is asking for information from my school board, yet low key berating me by reminding me that the government doesn’t feel it’s necessary to close schools at this time. 

I’m fucking annoyed and yes I didn’t show up, but how do I respectfully remind this person that I was never given the protocol for taking time off, that yes my priority will always lie with my full time career, and that I don’t appreciate being questioned. 

This isn’t the best environment, last weekend the onshift managers were crying, everyone is terrible to the reception staff at our store, and I don’t feel like justifying myself to these people. 

Am I the asshole for doing my best to socially isolate, informing my PT employer in the only way I knew how, and somehow getting that process wrong and now being reprimanded for it?

44,"I'm 27 years old. My parents treat me like a child. Let's go back 15 years ago, so you can get where I'm coming from first. When I was a teenager, my mom would call me fat, monster, ugly creature. She would give me food and say ""here, get poisoned"" she would tell me ""I wish you were dead"". 

I was never even fat. I've never been fat in my life. The most I ever weighed as a teen was maybe 48kg.

My dad wasn't really involved in the parenting. He used to play boardgames with me, but that's all about it. He works hard to provide for us. So he never really said anything about that, but he would sometimes say insulting things himself. I remember vividly when I was 6 years old, at the beach, on a vacation. I told my dad ""I wanna change the world and make peace"" so told me ""you are nothing. You live in a cave right now, you cant see anything. You will never do anything that will change anything. You're just dust"" while he's right, nobody really says this to a child. 


Back to the present. My mom changed in terms of her name calling and such. She stopped doing that after I gruaduated school. I live on my own now in a city an hour away from parents. Every little fart I pass, my mom must know about it. She texts all day and calls every day. She asks details. If I don't answer for 10 mins, she spams calls, she calls on apps. While I'm probably simply taking a shower. I call her back, she's pissed yelling where have you been. 

Both mom and dad call me stupid still from time to time. I'm a teacher with a double major degree from one of the best universities in my country. They always thought my majors are useless. Never really cared about them, although they did pay all the funds and my rent while I was a student. 
They belittle my job because the pay is low. They compare me to my uneducated cousin who does nailart saying she makes more money (which she does, but they are insulting me). 

I tried to finally speak up today, they started telling me I'm ungrateful, while stating the things they did/still do for me. 
I lashed out. Threw my food on the floor. Left to my room and starting crying for everything that's ever happened. Then I felt realllly bad. I felt bad because I might have hurt them. I love them. They are everything to me. Without them I am nothing. I don't want them to feel bad about this or lose sleep. But I am hurt and sick of everything. I don't know how to feel. :(",15Mar2020,1

I moved 7 years ago to another country, had to learn a new language and was bullied and still am being bullied. The bullying is extreme whereas before it was only physical whereas now it is mental and a little physical. The bullying is quite abnormal to typical bullying. I have experienced racism and bullying so far. I have tried my best to make good friends but ended up creating a whole new personality for school, outside, and at home, neither are really who I am. I am fit, not fat or uglie but am bullied for who I am. I am so done. I feel so sad and cry myself to sleep. I cannot express my feelings properly and I feel like I'm about to explode all the time. I have talked about it to one friend, but they forgot about it. I am stuck as I am deathly afraid of asking for help. It's so hard to describe what I really feel like. Why can't I be normal?

48,"Ok here me out on this. In no way am I trying to make it seem like my brother and sister are a burden in anyway. If I didn’t care for them I wouldn’t have paid for their stuff. 

So my mom asked me to babysit my brother and sister. I’m 21, my brother is 12, and my sister is 10. I said sure! I get to spend the week with them since I’m moved out into my bfs house and rarely see them (because of my mom). I had recently asked my mom if she could pay for my hair being dyed because it’s a horrible mess right now. I did the math and it is $120 for me to get my hair done. Well as of right now I don’t have a job and I’m currently working on getting one. (Please, don’t tell me in the comments how I need to get a job. I know I need one) but I’m working on it. Don’t worry. 

She said ok, I’ll give you $120 for me babysitting and some money for the kids to take them too the zoo. She ended up giving me $160 all together. The thing is my brother and sisters zoo tickets cost $32 for all of us, they wanted food which costs $18 at McD’s, and the next day they wanted mcds again which was $13, and $4 for snacks at the store. They wanted food so bad because my mom doesn’t give them any. She doesn’t have any food for them to make or eat. My sister woke up at 9am and didn’t eat until 4pm because there was nothing in the house. My parents are divorced and my dad keeps food for them at his house and knows that she doesn’t keep food. But if he says anything my mom will try to make it seem like he’s trying to get my brother and sister to side with my dad. 

Anyways, she gave me $160, I spent $65 rounded on my brother and sister in 2 days. I payed for them because I knew how hungry they were. But she still promised me that $120 and then kept asking me to pay for more of their things. So now I’m at $95 which technically I have $88 right now because I had to pay for my gas. I can’t get my hair cut or dyed because I can’t afford it now. And when I say my hair is bad it’s bad, like not professional looking at all to go into interviews. 

I want to ask my dad for a little money and see if he can help out but he’s currently paying for my therapy and I feel like a money hog asking him for it. He’s been pretty helpful with money and me in the past. I’ve never asked for it but he’s always offered. And my mom was complaining to my dad about how she “knew” I was going to bail out on her as soon as she paid me. I didn’t bail on her, I asked her if she wanted me to take my siblings to the doctor with me because I’ve been feeling sick all week. It felt like I’ve been swallowing and breathing in glass. So I wanted to get it checked out, she told me I didn’t have to watch my siblings one day and it was fine if I just went to the doctor by myself.....I told her multiple times I can watch them and take them to the doctor with me. I was just asking for permission to take them with the Virus going around. She said “no they can stay home alone one day, go to the doctor by yourself”. AND THEN SHE TURNED AROUND AND SAID TO MY DAD THAT SHE KNEW I’D BAIL ONCE SHE PAID ME?!??! That really upset me. So I can’t ask her for the right amount of money she told me she’d pay me but got taken away because she kept asking me to buy stuff for my siblings. 

Any advice? I’m really not trying to sound like a stuck up person here if it comes off that way. But I’m in need of a hair dye and cut. But should I ask my dad for some money or should I ask my mom? Also any side advice on my mom not buying my siblings enough food? She gets $300 a month in childcare for my siblings but uses it only for herself for her side money.",15Mar2020,1

I’m in a new relationship now and it’s leading down the road of marriage, family etc. 

Every serious relationship I’ve had I’ve been the breadwinner, same is true for my current relationship: he’s a student and picks up casual work from time to time however this is the last year of his masters and I really want a break. Namely to write, study, sew and do whatever the hell I need to do to destress and hopefully start a family. (I’ve been battling fertility issues also) 

We’ve talked about it and he’s actually excited to have all his meals cooked for him by me, the house way more organised than it is now, having someone to welcome him home and have all his errands done for him. I shared this with friend and she really put me down about essentially wanting to be a 50s housewife but I’ve argued I’ll also be studying or finishing a novel. Possibly even volunteering if I can find the right position.

I’m planning on flying out tomorrow night and staying for a while before things get out of control with coronavirus. For instance, I know if I were to try and fly to see him in a week, it would be more difficult. 

My family that I live with is upset and say that I’m selfish for going because I’m going to catch the virus. Which, I’m young and healthy, I ‘could’ get it.

She’s overweight and it worries me. We don’t have much money so we can’t just leave our family business for a bit while we wait and my dad now has to go visit his dad in big virus states. I freak out over everything and I need someone to speak to. My mom won’t listen to the fact that I can’t help crying and the constant worrying. The virus just made it worse and I just can’t stand this anymore. I get the entire thing isn’t that bad but for my mom it would be and my brother too. I just can’t deal with that. My brother is also really popular in my school and like uses it against me, I do one thing wrong and everyone knows because I’m his sister. I don’t know what to do anymore. We can’t do therapy and my mom doesn’t get that I need someone to talk to. I worry and I’m anxious all the time and I can’t deal with it.",15Mar2020,1
65,"I started a new job about 3 months ago at a fast paced tech company in the Bay Area. Since I started this job, my mother was sick with breast cancer. We lived 6 hours away from each other and I would visit her every weekend after work for almost 2 months straight. Unfortunately, she passed in late January and I took two weeks off.

When I got back into work, I heard from my colleague that my manager was complaining that I took too much time off work...Can you believe it?! Also, since I’ve been back i have been working long hours, like 10-12+ hours a day and sometimes weekends. I feel burnt out and I’m only 3 months in.


On top of that, I’m still grieving and have depression. I’m currently taking antidepressants to help me stay motivated and focused, but I also still feel sad because I’m grieving. Work has draining me emotional and physically. 

These past few months has taught me that life is short.. Sometimes, I wish I can just take a break from work, and find another job that could make me happier and more fulfilling. Should I start job hunting again or stick this one out since I’m only 3 months in?",15Mar2020,1
66,"[TL;DR] my life really sucks and despite my greatest efforts I still feel let down.

I [M14] have been feeling really down lately. I haven’t felt like studying, replying to my friends text messages, I’ve just been feeling downright sad these past few days. I recently had an epiphany and I realised I’ve spent my whole life trying to be like my friends and satisfy others and I cared about what they thought, so I wanted to change that and I guess I started cutting off most of the toxic people from my life in the least obvious way possible but I still felt down. 

People keep bringing up my past mistakes I’ve made in the past which I don’t want to talk about but it really wasn’t that bad but apparently people thought it was bad and it kinda gave me a bad name for myself, I’ve tried to keep that stuff in the past but even my closest friends bring it up knowing that it bothers me, and the worst part about it is that I had almost forgotten about all of it until they brought it up, and every time I think about it I immediately get sad, wondering why I even did that knowing how stupid it was even though it was harmless.

Another thing that happened is I found out that one of my close friend vapes, I don’t vape and am never planning on doing so but me and him used to talk about how stupid it was to vape and now he’s let peer pressure get to him. This guy has literally been my ~~friend~~ fake friend for the past 3 years, I’ve literally been a fool and the whole time I knew it deep down, I was always following him and the only time we’d ever talk was when he was making fun of me, this is literally a toxic relationship and I think at one point I even called him my best friend, well I guess I was wrong.

My family hasn’t been helping at all with any of this, literally today our kitchen sink got blocked and my mum slapped and blamed me for doing it because apparently I removed the think stopping too much waste from getting into the sink, to top it all off when my dad got home he fucking slapped the shit out of me, I wouldn’t even have minded if he had killed me then and there because I really was just fed up of everything. I offered to try and fix it myself because I’m pretty good at fixing and constructing things but he said if I ask him that then he’ll slap me. Last month he fucking called me hitler for being rude to my little sister even though she was being stubborn and it was over the stupidest thing ever, he went on a rant again even though all I wanted from my sister was a marker to do a job which my dad himself assigned me to do. Anyways this night I tried to unclog the sink myself so my parents wouldn’t have to waste any money on a plumber because my dad went on about how he works for more that 12 hours a day just to provide for us and shortly after he had beaten me up my mum and him were arguing (most likely because of money), the argument ended with my mum yelling at him calling him a wicked person. So while I was successfully unscrewing the plugs without  damaging them and finding what was clogging the sink, my dad walks in (I thought he was asleep because it was so 12:30 am and he tells me to stop everything I’m doing and go to bed, I tried to explain to him that I was on the right track but to no avail.

So now here I am, in bed writing this as my will to even exist slowly fades away despite my greatest efforts in trying to fix my mistakes and prevent them.
My family isn’t poor as my mum has an iPhone 11 Pro Max yet she refuses to spend money on most of our needs most of the time.
I don’t know where to go about from this and I really doubt anyone will actually take the time to read my pretty depressing life story so I’m just gonna go and sleep.",15Mar2020,1

I’ve been battling with bad mental illness and he always reminds me that yesterday is behind us, today is another day, and tomorrow is coming.

77,"So I go to the gym usually everyday. Run about two miles, and do heavy weights on my lower body and lighter weights for my upper. I’m basically not allowed to go to the gym because of the corona stuff, which I’m an adult (student) and can just not listen and go lol but I honestly also don’t want to risk it for my parents who are older with health issues. 

I can squat about 140 and am trying to move up in weights for my lower body. Yes I’m one of those girls lmao but mostly because my body is not curvy at all and I’m working towards that with all kinds of work outs (not only squats.) I’m mentioning how much I can squat so you can get an idea of amount of weight I need.

Does anyone have any tips on how I can get, not the exact same work out, but at least a little bit of the same kind of work out? Like in terms of heavy weights? 

I have resistance bands but they’re not as heavy obviously, and some dumb bells but again, not as heavy. Will it be just as effective with more reps and sets and the lighter weights? Or not really

78,"Hi, I’m not a frequent flier so I just wanna make sure I’m okay. I’m really sorry if this is a dumb question, I just worry too much, and this is an active community :( I’m just looking for some help. So the email says:

“We are seeking volunteers willing to take a different flight in exchange for a Travel Voucher. Your existing itinerary will not be changed until you review alternative flights at the departure gate. Check–in to submit your bid and you will be notified if you are selected at the airport. “ With “check-in” highlighted in blue (I’m not sure if it’s a link but I don’t want to click it and take the risk of it volunteering me).

I really don’t wanna do that, by any means. There’s no other links in the email, so how would someone even go about volunteering themselves?

Weds she messages me asking if I had been feeling “sick”, I responded with “no” because I had been feeling normal. She states she is on the IUD, and when we had sex I used a Lambskin condom as well as pulled out and ejaculated in to the condom * about 3-5 seconds after I pulled out* Before I left her place I checked for holes but filling it with water. She messaged me today saying she has been having an irregular bleeding spell which started like an hour after we had sex. Now she keeps saying she doesn’t believe she is pregnant but whenever I hear “oh I’ve been bleeding weird” or
“ have you been feeling weird since we had sex?”. Sad part is we hooked up while I was in her town for an event and live half way across the US. My friends think that she is starting this to set me up for the whole pregnancy scam and I should block her from whisper/Snapchat. We never even exchanged full names nor phone numbers.

89,"I'm an age regresor, and have been with my partner for almost 3 years. During the last month of our relationship I have been exploring my age regression and coming to terms with who I am and what I need in my life to be happy. During the last month I have been going to scout meetings for other littles and age regresors and havent been happier. I havent been this happy ever. My partner is vanilla, and does not participate in my lifestyle. I understand that it's not his cup of tea, however I would also love to have friends who I can relate to and play with nonsexually. 

It took a lot of convincing and trust to be allowed to go to the meetings, as my partner was very concerned. I travel over an hour to these meetings, and he does not approve of meeting people online. Hes very weary and doesnt understand why someone in a relationship would go about seeking others for this.

With the current virus going around, all of the meetings for this month have been canceled. I broke down hysterical as I have been looking forward to coming out of my shell. I don't have a lot of friends, and this was my main form of socializing, with the support of my therapist. Our scout leader said there would be a small meeting at their place, and I asked my partner if I could go.

I have been asking him permission constantly to go out with people from this group and he says he is being overwhelmed and gets upset when I bring it up. He doesnt feel comfortable with me going, even though others have gone and have been safe. I dont know how to express how much age regression means to me and how important it is for me to make friends that accept me for who I am.

92,"So my S.O. Is very close with one of there teachers. They go out to eat with them and they spend lots of time both in school and out of school with them. My S.O. has deemed the teacher their friend and has been hanging out with them for forever (around 4 years now) This teacher picks favorites and has a tight knit of a few seniors that he’s very close to and practically treats them like they are his bestfriends/ kids (one being my S.O.) This teachers particular class involves a lot of time in and out of school to achieve there big goal and they are always seeking help to achieve it and get there quicker. Today I went to drop my S.O. off and I was going to help them do things (for a class that I am not even in )which I have previously done things to help in the past without my S.O. to show that I am willing to help even when they aren’t there. They always complain that no one helps them. Well this particular teacher ( is not married or have a S.O.) doesn’t like couples. My S.O. claims that the teacher likes me ,but I have been noticing sly comments being made towards me. Today when I went to help my S.O. pulled me aside after not even being there for 5 minutes and told me that I needed to leave. They said that I was being too distracting to a particular kid(which I was not , I was waiting for them to tell me something to do ) and the teacher just doesn’t like couples. The teacher had put my S.O up to this rather than being an adult and saying it to my face and giving me legit reasoning as why he wanted me to leave. Keep in mind when I go to help I do not pay attention to my S.O. at all because I want to be able to help without being kicked out.  The thing is there are many of other students that would also be going to help later on but I had to leave because I was someone’s S.O. The teacher has made sly comments towards me and also under his break such as “I’m glad it’s okay with you”, and “ this has got to stop” after I barley touched my S.O. I am also suppose to be helping with something later in the school year for this class but I no longer want to do it after being treated like I was unwanted until they are dependent on someone.

95,"Got my student loans paid off last year, and am eligible for Pell grants again. Should have enough to swing a bachelors, I'm hoping. Trying to figure out what to study.

Need a career. Have no idea what to choose. I've been dwelling on it for a few months now, and am no closer to where I started. I paid the full 90 bucks for MAPP suggestions from [assessment.com](https://assessment.com) but nothing particularly jumps out at me. [Here are screenshots of the results.](https://imgur.com/a/eMHiHw5) If more of those results would help I can provide them. Also open to other test recommendations. My last job ended up being a 58% match on that list, and it blew up in my face even though I really liked it, so I figure it makes sense to add at least ten points to that.

It's becoming clear that I'm not going to find anything that checks all my boxes. So here's a little bit about me and I'm hoping people can provide suggestions for how to make the best  of the situation.

I carried mail for four years and loved it, but ultimately ended up leaving because it was crazy high pressure which led me into irrational ways of thinking, and because they wanted tremendously long hours. 

For that reason one of my top priorities is work-life balance. I'm okay with putting in the overtime when shit hits the fan, I get that, I'm not unreasonable. Lots of companies end up relying on that though, and I'm not okay with that. I am a work to live not live to work type.

I'm hard working, and dependable but I'm an anxiety case and don't care for confrontation. I don't want a job where somebody is manipulating me to leverage me for as much efficiency as they can possibly squeeze out. There needs to be an environment of mutual respect. I really want to fall into something that isn't going to take over my life.

I smoke cannabis. If I have to I'd consider giving it up but I wouldn't be very happy about it. Not at all. I hope it doesn't come to that. Id much prefer one of those companies that piss tests once to appease the insurance companies, or, even better, a company that judges me by the quality of my work rather than the content of my urine.

Because of the previous two paragraphs I figure most major corporations are ruled out. I've also ruled out government work based on my time at the postal service, I've had quite enough of that, thank you. I feel like that doesn't leave much, if anything at all. Obviously I have to be willing to compromise on some things, but I want to minimize that and I'm trying to figure out the best way to do so.

I can be content with anything that amounts to &gt; 15 an hour, if all the other boxes are checked, but take into considering that I'm in a rural area of a rust belt state with a decent cost of living when I quote that number. Speaking of that, I'm willing to relocate if I have to, preferably to a weed legal state, but only if the jobs pay well enough to justify that. I'd also really prefer to not live or work in a major city. Small or medium sized cities would be better. I'd probably commute from somewhere even smaller than that.

Needs to be something I can google and find jobs available. I'm not willing to invest in my education without a fully fleshed out plan. Less competition, less obstacles is better. I don't want to do a 2 year unpaid internship. I'm in my thirties and don't have time to go for a master's. I want something practical that will lead to a career to stand the test of time.

I'm not 18 so most companies won't apprentice me. I'm open to the idea of certification courses or trade skills if it's actually going to lead to an appropriate career. I have a meeting set up soon with a nearby trade school for a network technician class, so that's one option I'm considering. Open to getting a bachelors or an associates. I've looked into all the nearby community colleges and trade schools, knowing that those guys choose the programs they offer based on the local economy, but nothing really stood out to me except the network technician program mentioned in this post.

I loved being outside for my last job. I put real though into trying to become a park ranger, but it appears to be pretty competitive, I'd have to work for the government, and I'd be at risk of accidentally becoming a cop, which doesn't sound like my cup of tea. 

I enjoy interacting with people for work, but it's not a talent of mine and I'd be just as happy working independently. I am not a persuasive or sales minded individual. I will crash and burn at that.

I was putting thought into something like environmental science, but I'm having trouble getting a clear picture of where that can lead, seems to mostly also be government positions. There are private ones but I'm not seeing many.

I also kind of interested in economics and political science. Not sure where either those could lead to positions that fit my traits. I looked briefly into being maybe an auditor or an actuary but wasn't seeing much availability on the indeed. Seems like most of the practical applications of economics requires a masters.

I'm capable of putting in some physical work, but its not my strong suit. I smoke cigarettes a bit too often to be honest (and that rules out healthcare), but I did walk 13 miles a day for 4 years, under heavy pressure to move faster, faster, faster. I'd probably still be doing exactly that if they hadn't gotten completely out of hand with the standards they were demanding. So now I'm looking at lots of lines of work and thinking ""could I do that at postal speed, for 12 hours solid?"" The answer seems to be no to everything. I'm worried I may just not be a good fit for the modern working world at all. FWIW I did enjoy the exercise and the challenge, a lot. There just needs to be an upper limit somewhere.

I've tried studying computer science in the past. I have an understanding of computer programming but it's not a deep understanding. It's not a talent of mine. I'm interested in it because of the demand for developers, the flexibility of many positions, and the introverted nature of the work, but my gut says I should look elsewhere.

I'd love to break into the cannabis industry somehow. Multiple attempts have already failed though. I'm only qualified for a CSR position, and those don't pay well enough to justify moving to the other side of the country and other states have certification requirements specific to the state, and there's going to be more experienced competition in states that have had legal cannabis longer. Would be open to trimming or something, and I've applied to nearby positions for that but lets be honest, many people are going to want to work with cannabis. I can't rely on that dream.

Thanks very much if you made it through my wall of text. I can't blow the last of my Pell grants so this is a very important decision for me! I value any feedback folks are willing to offer. It's killing me. I need to make a plan and start applying to schools.

I'm in Ohio if I sound like somebody you'd consider interviewing. I get that most people wouldn't for whatever reasons, cultural or work related, but I know there's folks out there who would.

96,"The title says it all. 

About two years ago I (F14) saw smoking, alcohol and vaping as all pretty disgusting things.

I live in Switzerland and am currently an intern.

I've been sick for the past 2 weeks, the doctors suspect a gripal infect or something like that and said i shouldn't go to school or work for the next 2 weeks so i stayed home  and i should technically be able to go to work again cause 2 weeks have passed and i'm also feeling better now.

The system as an intern here in Switzerland is as follows:
2 Days of school and 3 days of work a week.

Recently they shut down all the school in Switzerland because of the Coronavirus which means i won't have to go to school up until like april 4th. 

As far as i've been informed i still have to go to work though. The next time should be on the 18th of march.

The situation in Switzerland is getting serious but it's not as bad as Italy.

My mother is really worried about the Coronavirus and wants me to stay at home until everything gets better again.

The thing is, i'm kinda worried about losing my job which would be a really really bad thing. Especially since i've already been sick for the past 2 weeks (i did have a medical certificate though).

I've told my mom about this concern and she absolutely doesn't want me to go and she says my health is much more important.
Even going as far as saying that she will personally call my boss and call in sick for me if i don't do it myself.

I work in bank but i wont be near (m)any customers while i work so i am not really worried about catching the virus.

I have many friends that have the same internship at the same place as i and as far as i know they're all going. And i don't think i'll be able to get another medical certificate for such a long time.


So as i said my biggest concern is losing my job but i don't know if i should try to convince my mother, not go at all or do something else. I just really don't know what to do.

Do you have any advice for me?",15Mar2020,1

100,"So I'm not sure if I should post this on r/EatingDisorders or not. I don't want to trigger someone by posting this on there so that's why it's here I guess. Sorry I'm kinda new to Reddit. Anyways as a forewarning I will be talking about potentially upsetting things.

I've always been a little weird when it comes to eating. Not something I ever really put a lot of thought into though. Lately I haven't been eating as much as I should be. I know part of the reason is because I work early mornings and I'm just not hungry when I wake up. The problem is I really only have time to eat when I get home. Normally I will eat one meal and go to bed so I can wake up in the morning.

I've heard of people having EDs and not knowing it but idk if that was just some bs the internet made up.(I say that as I ask the internet for advice lol) I don't really think I have an ED. I mean I don't feel bad when I eat, I just don't think about it or just don't feel like it even though I know I should.

Maybe I'm just in denial, but even if it's not actually an ED I would still like advice on good ways to help yourself eat when you don't want to.

Thanks for reading and sorry if this was upsetting in anyway.",15Mar2020,1

102," I don't really know how to title this as it's quite unusual in my opinion but after I explain it hopefully everyone can understand.

So like I'd like to say around 1.5 years ago I met someone online through a game and we've been friends since even after stopping playing the game. However, I recently think it's taken a bit off a big turn as she has recently been a lot more attached than before, like she would complain if we don't talk too much on that day (3 hours or so), she expects to talk like 8 hours a day and then still claims it's not really that long, which I'm simply not willing to do.

This talking often happens at quite late times as well due to time zones so I often end up talking with her till 2-3 am and have to wake up at 7-8am, this massively decreases my productivity. It's also common that when I'm trying to focus on things such as studies or other important things in my life, it can be a common distraction.

In addition to all of this, she's also tried flirting and all of that stuff while I do not want an online relationship(she lives like 7 hours away, by plane), she's also claimed she would like to meet physically, which I'm unsure of.

I'm considering just ending the whole relationship to be able to focus on my own life as this takes a ton of time out of my day, while I don't think it produces much gain as it is online. I thought of this as a normal friendship while just playing a game which when we stopped playing we wanted to keep in contact, now this is happening...

107,"Hi, so I’ve had these feelings for a very long time but only just got into Reddit, found this subreddit, and thought it couldn’t hurt to ask for advice. My sister is really toxic, she has been awful to me since she was about 12, and I was 10. Six years later, she’s still the same, and it’s only gotten worse. Before you ask about my parents, she’s extraordinarily toxic towards them and although they’ll admit that to me, they have never been proactive about trying to stop her. I’ve watched her hit my mom and I, call our entire family the worst names you could think of, break things, pour out entire bags of food, blackmails, threatens and still no punishments they put in place they end up going through with. In fact, often she ends up getting whatever she initially wanted that started the fight. If I was the parent, I would have forced her into therapy years ago, but it’s honestly too late now to fix her, she’s too spoiled and has learned that being awful will get her whatever she wants. I’ve wanted to distance myself from her for years, but she makes it very hard. Often in the middle of the fights (I usually try to just get up to my room and lock my doors, but she’ll pound on them and scream) she says that I’m an awful sister and she won’t speak to me ever again. I say fine, and am secretly happy about it all. However, often hours later she will come in acting like nothing happened, and as I am a very passive person who genuinely hates conflict I act civil so she doesn’t start yelling at me again. I think she may love me, and sometimes she great. But she certainly doesn’t know how to love someone, and the vast majority of the time she is men to me, mean like no one I’ve ever met. For a long time I thought I had to love her because she’s family, but the truth is, I hate her so much. I’ve never gone to try and be diagnosed, and I don’t mean to self-diagnosis here, but often I find myself with very high anxiety and I can easily fall into long depressions, to the point I’ve seriously considered taking my own life. It’s hard to know exactly what my life would be without her, but I genuinely believe that I would have never gotten to such bad mental places. She has a way of heightening whatever negative emotions I’m feeling, I just really really want her out of my life. I thought next year she would go to university and I’d barely have to see her, but she decided to stay in the city. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can try to distance myself from her? Whenever I try to honestly confront her she hits me, yells at me, or makes me feel like shit. Sometimes she’ll even text my/her friends really shitty, untrue things about me. Most of my friends know a bit about the situation, but it’s still so embarrassing. Also, I hate her friends think I’m this awful person when I truly do promise I’m not, I’m no saint, but I know that I’m a good person. My mom and dad are also great people, and I hate how mean she is to them, I hate having to watch my mom cry. Anyway, I’m not sure this anyway to get myself out of this situation, but I was wondering if you guys have any advice? After all, that’s what this subreddit is for. 

TLDR: My extremely toxic sister still lives with me, and I want advice on how to distance myself from her/ remove her from my life (please read though, more details in there).

Sorry if this seems like a rant, or if I seem awful for saying I want how out of my life, but I’m just so tired of her making me feel like garbage.",15Mar2020,1
108,"I'm really trying to do this thing but I find it kind of hard to keep the motivation going. I don't know if this is stupid or pointless but I just really wanna know what you guys do to keep going, or what's the best way to lose weight? Intermittent fasting? Certain workouts that work best? Cheap diet tips?  Like I'm a 20yr old college student and I'm on my own monetary wise. I just feel like the junk food is so much cheaper than the fruits and vegetables I genuinely like eating. So whenever I go to the store I instantly just go to the canned pineapple and the chips. I also have no time to go to the gym with work and school. So I took a step today and made myself a set schedule to work by that I'm going to start following on Monday. I don't really know what workouts to do tho. I was just kinda gonna do cardio for 35 minutes and then some targeted weightlifting. Not sure if thats the proper way to lose weight. I'm 220 and my goal weight is 150.

109,"(Sorry that this is pretty similar to another post from a few hours ago, but I think it makes a difference that I'm in college, and my school has decided to send almost all students home.)

My university is ordering students to go home due to the coronavirus, unless they face serious health risks at home, are international, or have nowhere else to go. 

I'm from a suburb of Seattle with few coronavirus cases, though the county it's in (King County) has been hit the hardest in the whole state. I'm worried that I have a higher risk of getting the virus if I go home than I do staying in the LA area (Pasadena), and I'm also worried about transmitting the virus to my parents, who are in their mid-50s. I don't have symptoms, but I could be carrier, and I could also pick it up while traveling. I submitted a petition to the school administration to remain on campus on those grounds, and it got approved. 

My parents are pushing for me to come home because they think that my risk of getting the virus is low if I just stay at home (though my mom works at the bank, so there's some risk there). It will also be a lot less expensive to stay at home than to pay for room and board on campus.

I am conflicted about what to do. It's impossible to say how the Covid situation will evolve -- maybe the risk of getting the virus in LA will be just as high in a few weeks, and if I stay, I'll just be stuck here without my family to support me. And worst case scenario, if things get really bad, I might never see my parents again if I don't go now.

Any thoughts on what I should do?

Thanks!",15Mar2020,1

113,"So about 6 weeks ago I [M18] met this girl [F20] on tinder. We went on a date and we vibed really well so i kissed her in the end (it was my first kiss btw). However, she was not looking for a relationship because she had an abusive ex. I was not looking for a relationship either because I did not want the commitment and I did not want to feel limited to just one person, especially now that I am in college and I am surrounded by so many women of my age. I end up losing my virginity to her (i was stressed out and had to explain to her that it was my first time which really surprised her). We have sex 2 more times and I improve a lot and then spring break begins. Three days into spring break and I am drooling at the thought of having sex with her again, but then we receive an email by the university that it's going to have everyone move out of campus and that its going to transition to online classes due to the corona virus outbreak. This means we wont come back for at least 5 months. After we both hear that she tells me that she would like to visit me if its okay with me. When she said that it really touched me because she lives 4 hours away from me, and a girl like her could easily hook up with any guy back in her hometown, so its apparent that she is looking for more than just sex from me. And tbh, we built lots of trust between us in the few weeks that we spent together. And i feel like i am developing feelings for her now, but the problem is she lives 4 hours away. Moreover, we have no privacy in either of our homes so when even if I do see her, we wont have sex as easily as we could back in college. I plan on asking her whether she actually has feelings for me but i wanted advice from you guys first. I really want to see her again but I am afraid that it can't work out, not at the moment at least. And I am afraid if we try to make it work, we will both end up hurting ourselves, and I dont want to do that to her. I also dont want to finally find love for the first time only to get hurt by it right after. Do you guys think we should try to make it work? Or should we start over once we get back to college? The problem is that I need her more than she needs me, she can find someone during these months lot easier than I can. My parents moved to a suburb right after I went to college, and I cannot drive here (which is crucial in suburbs) until I get my passport, temps, and then license which is a year from now. I cant go around the place to hookup with girls on tinder to distract myself from her the same way that I could when all the girls and the places to hang out with them were 5 minutes away back in college.",15Mar2020,1

127," Hello I am seeking advice to try and help a good friend of mine. About three months ago I met a gal from Hong Kong on a video game and we started chatting a lot. After a couple weeks of just normal chatting she started to really open up to me in ways i didn't really know how to respond. She has been bullied most of her school years and now she doesn't even go to her classes. During the day she just goes up to the roof or hides in the bathrooms to avoid her classmates all day. Over the course of the years she has switched schools 3 different times, but always ends up being bullied because of the way she dresses (they are very harsh in Hong Kong schools). Lately she has been asking me to allow her to die and she has been cutting her wrists and thighs may times. She is 18 now, but when she was 14-16 she was in such a bad place that she would literally try to cut herself with everything. She was admitted to the hospital and wore a shirt that wouldn't let her move and was tied to the bed. She was afraid of the dark and would sit there for hours everyday driving herself insane. She feels guilty for being alive and cuts herself because she feels she needs to be punished for still being alive today. I try to ask her what she wants to do in life, but she has no idea what she enjoys. I also keep telling her I am here if she needs to talk and I care about what she has to say, but it doesn't seem to be working... She has been depressed since she was 9 and is currently seeing a social worker and therapist, but she says that it not helping her and she needs someone to save her...

132,"title makes me sound bad but hear me out please :) tldr at the bottom

My tutoring centre charges around $75 per lesson including materials (like the booklet of homework they give us). It’s sort of expensive because our class is taught by the owner of the tutoring centre so it’s kind of “prestigious” to be in that class and I guess you have to pay a premium for that. Note: it’s not pay to be in his class, his class is the “best” one (in terms of having the best academically achieving students) so you have to work your way up to be in his class.

There have been major concerns regarding the coronavirus so the tutoring centre has cancelled all physical classes and has changed them to be online. So basically a video is uploaded every Friday and stays until Sunday and we watch it in our own time, take notes, and print the homework ourselves (or write it in a book) and do it. We will hand all the homework in when physical classes resume but they don’t know when it will start again. 

My parent’s and my issue (and a lot of my friend’s and their parent’s) is that these online lessons are not worth $75. The tutor in the video for the online lessons is not even the owner of the centre, so why should the kids in his class be paying extra? Plus, an online class where only a video and a pdf of the homework uploaded is just really not worth $75 unless it’s a livestream (which even then, I still don’t know if it’s worth it). PLUS, the $75 *includes materials*. They’re making us print/write our own homework yet still charging us for material that we are not getting. 

I understand that the coronavirus is nobody’s fault and it is a difficult time for some, and having the centre cancelling physical classes is probably in everyone’s best interest and they are probably doing their best to make high quality videos and to be accommodating, but charging the same amount per lesson when the lessons itself are of lesser quality than before? Idk about that. 

My parents are busy and I don’t think they will get around to complaining and I don’t want to rely on anyone else’s parents, but I don’t know if it’s in my place as a student there (and not a parent) to complain about the prices. Should I complain? Who do I complain to and how do I approach the topic?

TL;DR: tutoring centre cancelled physical lessons due to coronavirus concerns, now all it is is a youtube video and a pdf of the homework uploaded onto the portal that we complete in our own time, and many people including me think that is not worth the $75/lesson. Should I complain?",15Mar2020,1
133,"It's been 2 years now, but I still think about the people all the time. 

I dated my ex-girlfriend for 7 years, from when we were 23 years old until we were 30...

We had a great group of friends, we all went through our twenties together, watched each other start careers, get married, grow into adulthood (grow up essentially)

Since the break-up, I have slowly lost touch with almost everyone in that group. Some of them have even removed me from Social Media.

Those were literally some of the best days of my life, and it's like the entire 7-year period never happened.

It's really hard, it really hurts.

I am over the girl, but I am not over that time of my life. I just can't move on...

(I’m 21f)
Friend is (28f)
She has 4 kids 

We have always lent on each other and hyped each other up, I’m normally with her most weekends and have helped babysit free of charge on multiple occasions, I love her as a friend and think that our friendship really means a lot to us.
I know that she leans on me a lot and I lean on her a lot so this will mean that we both have to live without each other, something We haven’t done in over 2 years.

She unfortunately has had some issues with people who have just up and left her and so I worry that if I say that I’m going to move she could say things she regrets (I’m moving 6 hours away by car) 
Or I could say it wrong and she think I’m leaving her for good (I’m not)

Does anyone know what I can do so I make this less painful or should I just rip the bandaid off quickly so we can get it over and done with?

He asked, “Is that the worst swear word there is?” I replied, “Yes, you never say that!” The rest of the evening I was busy wrangling him and his brother. By the time they finally left, it slipped my mind. He’s a sweet kid, and I think he was just curious/fascinated with swearing/hearing swear words. His parents are very loving and caring, but they also tend to overreact. I want to tell his parents in a way that they won’t overreact and punish him.

138,"I think more than advice (which I do need), I just really want a hug, because right now, everything hurts and I don't know where else to go.

I'm 26F and in therapy for anxiety/depression for the past couple of years. It's a blend of CBT, talking therapy, and exposure therapy and I currently have a session a month. I'm also having to re-parent myself because I was failed in those areas, and more besides, growing up. It's tough - really tough - but most sessions, I leave feeling bolstered enough to continue striving upwards. Despite the anxiety attacks, malicious inner voice, and days where everything felt too much, I was trying. And that's what mattered.

I'm seeing a therapist - and struggling - because my mother abused me, from my very earliest memories until I left home at 23. It was constant and it was awful. I've cried out a lot of the stuff she said and did to me in my hourly sessions and untangled the threads around those pretty painful memories.

But I'd always console myself (in a weird way) that though she was physically, emotionally, financially, and mentally abusive, she left me alone, sexually. I had been left well alone in that respect.

Turns out, I was wrong. She didn't. And it feels wrong to say it. I wasn't ""molested"", and so in my eyes, I have no business even using that word. My therapist believes otherwise. Strongly believes it, after I recalled a few memories from childhood that I'd never told anyone before.

What I went through was degrading. It made me feel unsafe at home. It made me ashamed of my body. It's the reason I struggle so much with sex and how I view myself and the severe lack of self-worth I have. I just feel so angry and betrayed; my own mother destroyed me in every single way and yet denies any of it happened. And I don't know how to cope with everything I'm feeling so I can function again on a daily basis.

I've been in a really dark place since my last therapy session - in tears, unmotivated, preferring to sit alone at home while my husband runs the errands for me (he's aware of what's going on), retreating from my writing and writing groups because the only thing I genuinely loved doing, just feels all wrong now. The words aren't coming, the characters are staying far away from me, and *nothing feels right anymore*.

I want to know what I can do - anything, really - between now and my next therapy session to keep my head above water. And to be honest, if anyone has a trick for how to stop crying, please hook me up, because my tear ducts are working overtime.",15Mar2020,1
139,"ATTN: ALL KOBE FANS: THE 2 LESSONS I LEARNED FROM KOBE BRYANT AND MY KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN

PLEASE PLEASE READ UNTIL THE END :

Hey guys, I just want to say I am incredibly grateful for anyone who takes time out of their day to read my message. I appreciate it. I really do. Would love to hear any feedback whatsoever, whether it be negative or positive! Kobe meant everything to me. Not just as a basketball player but in many other ways as well. Considering I’m not the greatest with words, attempting to describe his impact on me is almost as impossible as it was for him to try to not play on a torn achilles. I judge a man or woman based on the music they are able to create. Whether that’s the music of a single mother raising three children from the projects or in this case, the music of a man plagued by his work ethic who refused to give in and submit. “When you create art through your actions, humanity is not only the audience but also the beneficiary”. We were all watching Kobe, thank you. Occasionally the most profound messages are given without having had a single syllable spoken.  When you decided to venture into directing, I asked myself why I was limiting myself. Why was I shying away? Why I was hiding? Life really is one big contradiction.  Even more so, life is one big hide and seek game with yourself.
We hide our feelings yet we seek love
We hide or passion yet we seek purpose
We hide our haunt yet we seek help
We hide our honesty yet we seek truth
We hide our voice yet we seek ourselves
We hide ourselves yet we seek happiness..
Lesson #1-  Courtesy of Kobe, I decided it was time for a change. NO MORE HIDING.
 
 
The other day I caught myself miserably watching Dear basketball over and over and over again, looking for an antidote to my aching, the slightest resemblance of his to keep his spirit alive within me. But I was going about it wrong.  You don’t keep in touch with those who have left this world by grieving their memories but rather by mirroring their behaviour. So, I thought to myself, why not invoke his competiveness essence by attempting (key word=attempting) to make a better animation than his Oscar winning work “Dear Basketball”? I was faintly familiar with the website Kickstarter at the time and wanted to pitch my idea to family first to see if they would be interested. Insert my brother in law and his friend. Seeing me mopey around the house following Kobe’s passing away and hearing me suggesting that I want to honour him with an animation, they laughed at me and stated” who in this world will give you money to make an animation about a guy that took money from everyone  because he could dribble a basketball”. His words, as ear-piercing as they were, helped more than hurt. It was at this moment I understood the two types of people in the world. Those that are educated beyond their intelligence and those that are intelligent beyond their education. Those that make love with their words and those that just dry hump.



This is also where I lost control. I started working like a maniac. A passion overwhelmed me. I called in sick to work. I stopped showing up to the gym. From there, I started brainstorming ideas for characters. Then I started developing some scenes. Then I had my script completed. Then I contacted animators, illustrators, designers, editors, and the list goes on.  I fell in love. With the work and oddly enough with working itself. This was almost a revelation for me. I learned we shouldn’t be so concerned with the pursuit of happiness but rather the happiness of pursuit. That happiness is a result of pursuing things you cherish. The feeling of blissful joy, the engulfed passion.
Lesson #2 – Courtesy of Kobe. The pursuit of happiness leads us chasing bigger, faster, better and more. A never ending destination and so thus a never ending pursuit for happiness. You taught me to fall in love with the process.  
 
So with all this being said, it is this exact process that I shamelessly need help with.  I have never been comfortable asking for a helping hand, whether it be because of an insecurity of mine or because a cockiness of mine. However, In order to fund my surprisingly very expensive 3D animation, I do need help however I refuse to ask for a handout. I will be posting a Kickstarter campaign within the next 2-3 months. Instead of treating my relationship with pledgers as a transaction, I want to extend all the love I can possible give. I promise everyone will be delightfully surprised with both the physical and emotional incentives provided. I would LOVE to hear any feedback from you guys and if I can count on anyone when I launch.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING. I OWE YOU ONE.",15Mar2020,1

144,"Ok so i know this is stupid but like its starting to scare me a bit. Now a little detail about me: i have a very active imagination and I’m terrified of zombies. I wont tell you guys the dream because at this point it have a full plot because at this point, my dream has  a more intricate plot than the harry potter movies and its past me trying to explain it. But like, it has fully developed characters with names, personalities and backstories, and its people I’ve never met before. The story is fully developed and has all the ips and downs and jump scares a zombie story needs. The zombies have lore, and they are exceptionally unique. But what scares me is: every few days to weeks or so.... this dream repeats itself, sometimes it pick up where left off sometimes new areas, but same characters, same lore and usually by the time i wake up it will have tied its self to the previous episodes. Is a dream supposed to be so... movie like? I mean id understand if it happened one night and stopped. All my dreams usually only repeat once.

149,"Hi all, this is a throwaway.
So basically when I was a bit younger I went through a huge depressive phase. I was 17 going on 18 and started doing very irresponsible impulsive things like masturbating on omegle to men and getting into online relationships with strangers and sending them nudes.
With that out of the way, I am currently in a very loving relationship with my boyfriend. I can see a future with him and everything. When we initially started dating, I never even thought of bring up those acts because I considered them in the past and they didn't make me into who I am today. But about 3 months ago one of the online relationships I was in leaked my nudes in an online community and someone got a hold of them and threatened to leak them. I removed myself from social media and consider the issue dealt with (although I still think about it a lot). When i told my bf about this, he was more upset I hadn't told him about the guy versus me being threatened with nudes being leaked.
We talked it out and it was all fine and dandy, however, I had failed to tell him of three intimate experiences I had before him. It had honestly slipped my mind, but you can imagine how upset he was hearing of it after the fact. 
I feel so guilty about having not told him about the intimate experiences, it makes me think I should tell him about the omegle stuff too? The only difference is that it was during basically my rock bottom where I was on the verge of dying (I was severely underweight) and I look back on that time in my life with a deep sadness. I feel like I dont HAVE to tell him, as it will never come back to me, there will never be a mention of it again. It's also something that I feel doesn't define me as who I am now, as I would never dream of doing it again (it's been two years btw) and I just dont want him thinking of me as that person when I've taken so many steps to improve myself.
I deal with a lot of anxiety alongside my depression, so it's really making me feel like a terrible person for having done those acts and it took a bit of time for me to move on from it.
Now I just want to know whether I really should tell him, or if I can just leave it in the past? Thank you and sorry if there's errors, I'm on mobile.

TLDR: I used to do naughty stuff on webcams and am unsure if I should tell my boyfriend of my past because of his reactions to other things I've told him and the fact I would rather forget about that time in my life.",15Mar2020,1

(this happened during and even after we dated). i really tried acting like even when i was confused that i wasnt til this day i do the same thing even if ik the person is only trying to help i still feel dumb and feel like they are just going to laugh at me and make jokes about it. im very scared like seriously. now im like this with every situation no matter what.

But just like every other couple we started getting into arguments but always worked through them. Then a year and 2 months in, he leaves for the military. The day before he leaves he comes over and tries to break up with him. I begged him to stay with me. I had already braces myself for the time apart and I wasn’t ready to lose him. He stays. The next two months of boot camp go by. I couldn’t get out last day out of my head the whole time but I flew down and seen him graduate and he made me feel like I was the only thing in the world that mattered to him. Things for the next two-three months were even better than the honey moon phase, even tho it was all over the phone since we are in a long distance relationship. But one day he work up and didn’t want to be with me. For two weeks straight i begged him to not leave me. I did everything I could to remind him how happy we are. He decided to stay with me again. Things are still rocky after that. He was gone for 8 months. First two Being boot camp, 6 months of schooling. We struggled for half of it. He never made time for me, always went out and partied and got mad at me for being sad for never being able to talk to him. He would say I couldn’t handle the distance but it was him who couldn’t. After all this, I broke up with him. For about two weeks. We never stopped talking but I think breaking up made him finally take me seriously. Because he changed. He was the man I fell in love with. We got back together and things have never been better. It was better than the honey moon phase. He came back home and I see him as often as I can. I do everything I can to make him happy. Then after two months of being home he told me he feels our relationship is boring and stale. This breaks my heart bc I thought everything was perfect. I love this person more than anything in the world but now he doesn’t want to be with me. Today my friend told me he was on a dating app. I called him immediately and ask wtf he was doing. He comes over and I tell him to give me his phone (I never ever go through his phone bc I TRUST HIM) I found messages of him calling girls cute, and flirting but he wouldn’t let me look though everything so I still don’t know if that was all. I love him with my whole heart. I love him more than I have ever loved anything in the world. I love him so much I forgave him. It hurt me so much. I feel very insecure now, I feel gross. And worst of all he won’t delete the girls in his Snapchat. The trust is definitely a little broke but who can blame me.

I am currently in Year 11 and am going into sixth form next year. I live with my mum and my brother, as my Dad is working in Dubai to pay for our school. I have been in the school I am in right now for 10 years, and I’m very comfortable in it socially and mentally. 

However. My brother is going off to uni next year, leaving just me and my mother living here. I love my mum and am very close to her, however I fear it might get lonely. I’m accepted into the school in Dubai, and the dilemma is right now - should I move to live with my Dad or stay for 2 years in school and live with my mum? The reason why this is a dilemma is because I am comfortable in my school right now, and I fear that there’s no time to look for social connections when I make the jump between A Levels and Sixth Form., which is why I’m anxious about moving schools. However, I love my Dad and want to live with him too. What should I do guys?",15Mar2020,1

She asked me to check it out so I could earn some money but the link is a dead end. Now I'm trying to explain to her that It's a scam and how the guy and his website doesn't even have license to operate an online business. Very big red flag in my book, and the $250 is way too real as well. She argues that there's nothing to lose because they're not asking for money but I don't think it's money they're after. They could possibly be after personal information, sensitive info that they can use as leverage. After explaining all of this to her, she still argues that it's legitimate without prior proof.

Every time I go close to her it always feels like she would burst at any moment. Hence why Im always in the room.

She then said that I went around to go and search for free sex and shit. When I tried to attempt suicide , while I was in the peak of dying ,  I heard very clearly that my mom wanted me to die , that my Father and my sister shouldn’t bring me to the hospital. At times whenever I walk past her , she’d call me a prostitute or a slut and namecall me hence making me afraid to get out of my room.

171,"Title describes it. I have one older sibling (24) and one younger sibling (21). 

Older sibling experienced a lot of trauma in college, stemming from a series of unfortunate events that led them to graduate from a decent college in our hometown when they were qualified for Ivy Leagues (got in, but our family could not afford it). Because of this, they don't realize how truly smart they are. They graduated with high-honors, but never recruited for a full-time job during their senior year. They have stayed in retail jobs for a few years since graduating, and put off searching for full time office jobs until recently, mainly due to anxiety. This has perpetuated their job-finding problem, because now they are a few years out from her education. They are having trouble accepting that they will likely need to go back to school or accept a 'stepping stone' job in order to get the job as a retail buyer or product developer that they want.

Younger sibling grew up without consequences and without responsibilities as this was how my parents raised them. They struggled in high school and got into an okay school before dropping out at the start of the second year.  They struggle socially, and I think they might have Asperger's Syndrome. They often make inappropriate and uncomfortable jokes, and aren't in tune with the conversation. They have struggled with suicidal ideation and are depressed. They are EXTREMELY sensitive to people letting them know what they said was inappropriate. They are struggling to be dedicated to finding the right career path.

I can be a very straight-forward person, and both of my siblings are in incredibly hard places. I want to support them, and let them know that I will support them however I can. I have let them know this, but neither have come to me for help. How can I help them through this?",15Mar2020,1

173,"Ok just ask for extra details if I leave something out.

My stepdad was the first to move into a newly build housing division about 25yrs ago. His deed agreement was for 10yrs then he could pretty much do whatever with the land. He purchased 2 lots side by side the house is on one. As of about 6 months ago a group of old birds decided to send him a letter telling him he needs to sell/move his RV and a project car he has on the second lot. They even gave him a time limit before they claim to ""have him removed from the neighborhood"". Hes 67 and the driveway is infact an eyesore but the county and city have said he isnt breaking any rules. The deadline has passed and they have started banding other neighbors (only the ones on his street) together to have meeting about ""the neighborhood"" (I went to one and all they talked about was his property for over an hour. They dont know me but he showed me a paper his nice neighbor gave him about it so I had all the info to show up as if I was part of neighborhood.) Now he has received another letter giving him 30 days to move his RV and have added numerous other things they dont like about the place. I looked for any form of legitimacy that this committee is real and found nothing. No city or county files. They just made it up to harrass the old man that has lived there longer than anyone else. (He built the first house in this division and everything else built up after. Most original residents have moved and now this is starting to seem like plain old bullying. What can I do to help him more with this (I've helped him clean it up very well but they keep finding more they dont like. Nit picking.) Is this even legal? What can he do to get them to just leave him alone at this point. Hes an old man with health issues and they are stressing him out making things worse. 

Sorry for typos, mobile format,and anything left out. 
Also the ""president"" of the committee wanted to buy my dads project car (corvet) last year before this started and he said no. Making this seem very much like retaliation.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",15Mar2020,1
174,"Okay obviously my life isn’t the absolute WORST and a lot of people are going through terrible things right now but I really need help. This is quite hefty as well, I apologize.

So my school shut down for a week amidst the corona situation. Prior to that we were told “all activities with over 50 people are postponed/canceled until further notice” which wouldn’t typically effect me very much because I’m not big into things like most clubs or sports for my school. 

Since I’m in eighth grade (my final year of middle school), I have been looking forward to a lot of cool things that I haven’t had access to before. 

This includes:

- My field trip to New York City with my select choir (we were going to see Wicked on Broadway)
- My school musical (music is one of the only things that gets me through the day and since I’m an eighth grader I got a bigger role than I’ve gotten before)
- My semiformal dance (aka the first higher end dance I’ve been allowed to go to)
And finally, 
- My field trip to New York City with my regular choir (we were going to see Frozen and were supposed to get to see my favorite Broadway actor in it) 

Ever since all of those things have gotten canceled/postponed, my anxiety has gotten worse and worse. I cried in front of my musical director and I’m really embarrassed about it.

In terrified of the more global effects of COVID-19 as well...

My mind has been racing and on top of that I have stress about what’s going to happen with our school work (I kind of hate working online) and social stress such as my close friends getting cut off because we don’t see each other during musical rehearsal and over this week off because most of them are not allowed to go out. My friends who are allowed out are spending much more time with their significant others than me or any other friends (one of them just got out of the hospital and I miss her too).

Not to mention prior to all this my anxiety was getting much and much worse and I don’t know how to deal with it because I didn’t ever realize it was this bad before. 

Does anymore know how to help or cope with anxiety in a time like this?",15Mar2020,1

178,"I've tried controlling it and being more distant, from crushes and friends but it ends up with explosion of crave for attention and love. I've always lacked emotional support from my family and i keep trying to forget that, it's tough man. Now I feel like I'm torturing an innocent cat just to feel my void, which I don't think will ever be in a while. I never talk about this because i can't. I really wanna have safe attachment style and express at least a little bit emotion to my crush. I just don't know how to open the door for emotions and care. I keep teaching myself charisma, i read and practice but my crave is still there and I don't know how to get rid of it.

I broke up with my first girlfriend because i was too needy, i would call her every 5 minutes, literally. The second gf i had i would text her every now and then, call her, but she would never do that and i slowly stopped texting. We broke up because she thought a was hitting on another girl, she didn't let me explain so i said ""if we don't have trust i think we should break up"", over text, she said ""okay"".

The third gf i was also too needy and we broke up because of that, i would always cry to her in the phone because she wasn't picking up or responding. The fourth gf was my second, we tried again and it was my longest relationship, 1 month. I never texted her nor called her, i didn't want to be needy but her sister said that she's getting sad when i don't start a conversation but i still didn't text her, only when she would call me to go out. On the last day something was bothering her and 15-16 yo stupid me didn't try to make her feel better. I was having family issues those days and i was pretty sad and angry too. After that i left, we didn't even celebrate the 1 month anniversary. She asked me if we should break up and me thinking showing emotion would be weak i said yes. I fucking cared about her, really deeply and i lost her for the second time.

With the fifth gf everything was going smooth but she started distancing herself and then my neediness turned on and i kept calling and texting her. She was fucked up too, she was playing with me, and then i tried to commit suicide. My brother rushed me to the hospital, i got better. I realized what she was doing and i blocked her everywhere so I don't make another mistake.

Ever since then I show no emotion to anyone, even when my dad was unconscious i felt nothing. I know I'm not a sociopath. I've had 2 and a half years to reflect and now i see everything i did wrong. Even tho i think I'm ready for a relationship, I'm not. When I get a girlfriend I'll again get needy or something else will happen. Is there a cure for this?

182,"Over the past year I’ve been working on understanding relationships (romantic) better. My mom isn’t married so I’ve never really had a good example of what I should look for in a partner and how to make a relationship last. As a result I’ve had a number of partners to try and figure that out on my own. 

After my most recent relationship (about a year ago) and the tragedy that was our breakup I’ve done a lot of growing and learning and healing within my own mind. I made a lot of big choices and moved a lot of emotional boulders for myself. It’s safe to say that while I’m still learning, I think I’ve got the uncertainty figured out. 

I’m still working on self confidence as a result of emotional abuse growing up. I’ve always seen other women as ethereal and powerful and earlier today I think I was able to put the correspondence to a relationship into words: I’ll be ready for a relationship, when I don’t need my parter to tell me how great of a person I am. They still will because they love me, but if they don’t I won’t be moved by it because my self worth is not validated by other people or my significant other. I will be a whole person and 100% aware of it. I’ll know in the deepest part of my being that I am beautiful inside and out, hardworking, and incredible. It won’t have to be something I remind myself of, the knowledge is there, always. Until then ig Im single. 

I’ve first hand seen what my lack of self love can do to a relationship and I have no doubt in my mind that a relationship at this very moment would go very differently than the one I had a year ago because some very drastic changes have taken place. But until I have the ability to define myself as myself, a relationship will only end in problems. I might be able to have a longer relationship this time around but it’ll have its limit. 

So when I no longer have to congratulate myself on small victories I notice I overcome throughout time, and when I’m sure of myself I’m sure I’ll be able to love someone the way I want to without any part of it being toxic. That’s more than likely the secret to love for many many circumstances",15Mar2020,1

I’m in college and I know sometimes adult friendships taper off and you may not speak to each other/see each other all the time, but we went from texting consistently a few times a week and spending time together often to not speaking whatsoever. This is someone who has cried on my shoulder, told me how much they cared about me, and said how happy they were to have become friends.
This same friend has admitted in the past to being bad about replying to texts/reaching out to people because of mental health which I completely understand, but then I see on social media that she’s spending time with and talking to other people. I can understand how mental illness affects people’s ability to socialize, but it seems like she does just fine reaching out to other people.

190,"#  Let me set the scene

*(skip it if you feel like its too long)*

Me \[M20\] and my girlfriend is \[F19\]. We met online (2017) and were just chatting for a year. Then we met and shortly after started dating (our first relationship). We live an hour and a half away from each other, and we both live with our parents. 

Our parents are the exact opposite, hers are younger, 40+, mine are almost 60 thus my parents are more conservative, and they have some preexisting conditions not related to lung but still. They worry about their safety and health, and my grandmother's who lives close by to us.

My girlfriend wants to be independent. While we can't sustain-ourselves and won't be able to for at least a few years. She wants to be free of her parents and mine too. She would already love to separate from her parents and be far away from them. (She's not in a very good relationship with them, nor with mine)

&gt;!\*BOOM\* Coronavirus!&lt;

# NOW

My parents want me to stay inside till the outbreak ends (a few months), and they think We shouldn't have any physical contact until then. (Usually, we meet every weekend) My girlfriend says that she cannot bare more time apart and If I continue to do just what my Dad says she will break up. I tend to agree with my Dad most of the time and sometimes not with her (I'll agree with her if I think she is correct tho).

My Dad doesn't want me to travel with public trans. **Yesterday** all of us agreed to if her parents drive me to their place I can go and be with her.

But **Today** at 2 AM my father sent me an email that the virus is really close to us now and I can't go anywhere. (A few kilometres away an office building is getting a *preventive disinfection cleaning* because there was a *tertiary involvement,* I don't know what that means, probably not good.

The number of infected in the country is around 30, but we live in the capital where all of them is.

My girlfriend (and her parent's) point of view is that what my parents are doing is nonsense. She thinks they can't block us from each other and can't decide for us, we are over 18.

# My question:

What do I do now?

It isn't as simple but,

\- I could be with my girlfriend and risk my parent's health, or they won't let me inside the house or something like that.

\- I stay home for however long and my girlfriend will probably break up with me.

I’ve had a vacation to Hawaii planned since the beginning of this year, and I’m set to leave this coming week Tuesday. With the trip around the corner and the rising panic of COVID-19, I’m starting to doubt whether or not I should take this trip. I had planned to stay on the island for a week, flying back on Sunday. I’m only in my twenties and in good health, so I’m not so much worried about me catching he virus, but I don’t want to contribute to the spread.

On the other hand, I really want to take this vacation. I planned this as a vacation for me to de-stress and take time for myself. I was really looking forward to it and have even committed to going despite the COVID-19 panic.

193,"So I moved to my current city due to a kinda shitty situation with my job. I figured, what’s the worst that could happen?

Fast forward and I am _miserable_ the first few months. Constantly thinking of moving back. While the city itself is nice, the culture is vastly different. It’s very hard to make friends. The weather, while nice when I moved here, is insufferable in winter. I don’t really have anything to do in the city and get bored out of my mind

I started dating someone and things picked up. With her at least I feel way less lonely. After that I kinda feel fine here. Not great or comfortable, but... fine. As for her I’m not really sure how long term of a thing it actually is. But I’ve still made very few friends 

I got an offer back in the city I was in before and all the sudden feel uncertain but I’m not sure why. I do miss it greatly and almost every day I was here, I was thinking of moving back. I miss my friends, I miss a lot of nostalgic things, but for some reason I feel like I’m leaving something behind here, even if I’m not happy

Any advice?",15Mar2020,1

195,"Over the past few years my physical and mental health has been rapidly declining. I can feel my body physically starting to die and try as I might it's hard to find ways to keep my head up with each passing day. 
I'm tired. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of having to face whatever is around the next corner. I'm tired of trying to stay warm by the ever dimming flickers of light I hold onto in the dark. I never really have ever lived for me. I taught myself that putting myself under others and just not caring about myself helps with rolling with the punches. But, and I dont know when or how, I reached my breaking point and after years of shouldering my burdens I finally collapsed. And for reasons beyond my comprehension, the amazing people in my life caught the weight and stopped it from destroying me. And I feel like no matter what I do one way or another I'll never really be able to rebuild myself. 
I'm content with the idea of dying. It's not my responsibility to build the next world, it's not my responsibility to even survive this one. I look at the people I care about, the people I've had the privilege to call my true family and I couldnt be more proud of them. They have their roads paved in gold and that's more than enough for me. For the longest time I was their anchor, their support, or maybe even just a box to check from time to time, but the fact I was even a footnote in their lives is more than enough. 

And yet, as if my life is a cliche ridden story created by a awful author, a person, a very important person has come back into my life, and try as I might I can feel myself gravitating towards their warmth again. Theres a gentle hesitance in our movements together and I'm terrified of it. As much as I just want to be intoxicated by this person I know deep down that they're only back in my life because I'm probably the most interesting person to them at this moment, but like it did before and will again, that interest will fade out and they'll be gone. Atleast that's my biggest fear, and I dont know if I should push them away or shove them out and keep my distance. As much as I would love the idea, this isnt a story where we save eachother and I dont know what to do.

197,"I would like someone to listen to this dumb but somewhat weird problem that I  got in trouble for. I just want advice on if I did the right thing from someone elses eyes. Sadly no one cares about going to school to learn it seems like.
Alright to start im 17 in a very bad school academically and area wise, I'm trying my absolute best to type proper just bare with me. 
So this mf slammed this girl into a metal pole and she hit her head, she came running to me last week saying it happened and who did it. I was pissed, It was during passing period at the end of the school day and I went looking for him but couldnt find him. It was last friday. I said whatever unable to find him, Id just wait until Monday to find him. but no, come saturday she posts on social media about the bump and bruise she got from it. I was angry and couldn't wait, I texted him and addressed the issue. Instead of understanding and being cool he bit back at me acting tough. Keep in mind I'm a biracial 6'0 kid that has been in the streets for my whole life (I'm not proud of it) and hes a rich 5'9 filipino kid that has never had any type of bad situation happen to him at school and he claims to bang. I dont know what he had to gain acting so tough against me when he isnt that type of person deep down. Anyway he acts tough with me and starts bringing up irrelevant things so i say alright. Monday last week I found him and he was alone and I addressed it in person and he was quiet like a punk not saying anything bold at all, and from what I thought it was resolved with no violence. Now yesterday, The whole week he kept up his tough guy antic and I kept hearing more and more shit so my anger was spiking. the hallways at my school are every crowded and annoying so most people just push their way through, I did the normal and I ended up pushing him unintentionally out of the 600 kids I could of came into contact with it was ironically him. I didnt even know it was him until i went to weight training and the girl came running to me saying he told her he was gonna punch off on me and that ""I was egging shit on"" which was genuinely not true. he didnt punch off on me because at that moment he was alone and a punk. He texted me during that class acting hard once again. I had enough. Class ended and I went to my last period, he followed me to my class and was outside the door after maybe 2 mins with hella people for no reason. He was asking around for where I am. Seeing this i get up from my seat and make my way to the door because I'm angry and obligated at this point. I say ""what's the issue"" and his punk ass sucker punches me and later on i found out he had rings on,anyway the second i got hit I blanked in anger and instantly started punching off at him in the hallway and dominating him, he ended up grabbing me but I swept his leg and fell ontop of him, I sit up ontop and start hitting him while hes on the ground defensless, until hall moniters run to tackle me off of him quickly after. I ended up being arrested and brought into the cops room at the school. I am suspended for a week and I got court next month, I have a cut by my eye from the rings that he used like a punk (no black eye swelling though). I thought good would come from it as hed learn his lesson but supposedly he is trying to make excuses saying he whooped me and ""put me in my place"" which is definitely not the case! It pissed me off when he said that on a post, he made a long paragraph yesterday on his story saying bold shit after I whopped him but removed it 4 minutes after he posted it. The video is all over our schools student made ""drama"" page on social media (immature kids that post fights online) and it shows me clearly man handling him, embarrassing him. Yet I believe and know he is still acting cocky just because he didnt get any major Mark's or bruising out of pure luck and from the moniters saving him. Did I make the right decision? Should I have went against my nature and not even gotten out of my chair to make myself known? (Even though I'm not known to be a punk and I'm not one) I just didnt want the drama to be taken to that specific classroom cause the teacher i had was one of few that I actually respected on a higher level. 
I am extremely angry still even know just thinking about him acting like hes the shit after he lost the fight.
When i come back to school on the 20th should I beat him up again if he acts tough and dumb passing fake stuff around? Or Is it not worth addressing his cockiness or fake confidence at this point? should I just stay back now?
 Hes a fake tough kid and I admittively have problems with anger, he might very well knowing him continue drama after this which is what I dont want happening. Any thoughts on what I should do or not do? It might seem like dumb drama I know. but I've been having a internal conflict with myself for a month now even before this problem, i just haven't been feeling the same since 2020 started.

198,Ok throughout my relationship with this girl that I love very much. I would randomly get thoughts about her past. I know that when I get these thoughts that i know there stupid and not what I actually feel. She would tell me that she used to party alot during 9th and 10th grade and for some reason I hate her that she did. I also overthink about her past relationships and her not being a virgin. She tells me that she knows that she was naive before and I know she wouldnt be the person I love if it wasnt for her past.  But I also get mad that she smokes but not that much anymore. For some reason I get mad about her past probably because it's so different from mines or I get confused to who she is. I really love her but I hate myself when I think this I dont know if I'm jealous insecure or what. I understand that it's in the past but for some reason it still bothers me.,15Mar2020,1
199,"Tl;dr - essentially gonna be alone romantically rest of my life because of me being scared in the past and I feel like I’m running out of time 


First time posting, I’ll try to keep this brief while being detailed, I (20 M) am KHV who’s last relationship was in middle school but that hardly counts and did some e-dating with success surprisingly (I know it’s cringe, I cringe back at it now too trust me) but might as well say I’ve never been in a relationship and I think it boils down to my lack of confidence and being scared. While I am a shy person I’ve never had problems with making friends at all (though I have a knack of losing them after awhile) but when it comes to talking to girls I just can’t do it at all.

And I think it comes from being to shy and scared to do anything with the girl from my middle school relationship and that shyness towards girls got amplified or something, so when I asked a girl for her number in 10th grade and got rejected I think it crushed all confidence (I know, pathetic to still be hung up on it) and I know rejection is all part of it but I still can’t help how I feel, and because of that shyness there was this girl I knew of, we’ll call her Jessica, I had a crush on her, and looking back she was a lot like me, I could tell, but anyway, had a crush on her my last 2 years, I never once had the courage to talk to her once, I didn’t even attempt or think about attempting, even tho I wanted to, and I think it’s essentially all one big domino effect.

Fast forward to now, I regret everyday not talking to her and it’s got so bad I got hit on by a group of girls in a drive through while giving me my food, and I was so autistic I panicked when they asked me for my number I said I had a gf, making it even worse, and now I’m too scared to try because I feel like my inexperience will ruin it and so I feel like I’m in a hopeless loop I can’t escape and just too self conscience even tho I’m not the worst looking dude.

What do I do to escape this hell?",15Mar2020,1

With corona virus ravaging the world it’s really got me rethinking my plans in the next few months. The last few years I’ve spent doing a lot of traveling and seasonal jobs and I’ve really enjoyed it. I have a seasonal job coming up at the end of May that I’m really looking forward to. It’s a going to be a great experience in an awesome place. It will be a nice chunk of money, around 10,000 net, for just under 2 months of work. 

That being said I have a pretty good job right now. It’s nothing great but the pay is decent. I just got a raise. I’ve got full benefits and there’s no chance of the virus affecting my pay/hours/job security. I don’t necessarily hate the job but I don’t love it. I know I would enjoy the seasonal job so much more but in the long term I’m wondering is 10 grand worth having nothing lined up when August rolls around. 

Is the job market going to be terrible then because of the virus? Will I have a really tough time finding work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

203,"I need advice for my wierd situation of being a wierdo and fix my bothersome habit.

Due to Corona virus there has been shortage of handsanitizer and other things. It started 7-8 years ago where I started reading up online about healthy eating, exercising, chemicals, germs, etc. Anyway I developed a obsession of avoiding things I deemed dirty/not healthy/ not safe to which lead to me washing my body constantly. I developed a rash from all drying from my skin which lead me learn about topics of how chemicals harsh on skin and yada yada stuff. Anyway i gave up on shampoo and soap entirely but I started getting greasy/smelly that lead to instead to replacing with handsanitizer for my hair, face, hands, etc. This habit than lead to me having ritual revolving around handsanitizer everyday.

 Whenever I wanted go outside I would wear specific clothes for ""dirty"" situations. Once I come back home I would quickly take those clothes off and avoid contaminating my home that I deemed clean by quickly throwing in washer. I proceed than handsanitiz  my face, hair or any place I feel have been contaminated with germs. I also handsanitiz my phone if I take with me. Anyway this habit of mine been going on for years and it's been a burden with going to gym, college, commuting, etc. It might not seem extreme but it's hard explain how bad the situation is without seeming like a total wacko.
 I been considering now getting aloe vera as way clean my self but maybe some where someone can help me get out of this cycle. I tried telling acquaintances  about this but no help. I don't know what to do honestly don't know what to do.

206,"I can confidently say that in the only 3 months that her and i have been dating, I have done nothing worthy of getting upset over. And she agrees with this, she even tells me that ever time we fight it's because of something she did. Never something I did. That still doesn't stop her from randomly getting cold and distant to me then telling me she needs time to think. I try and tell her that i'm her boyfriend. She should be able to talk to me about anything just like how I always tell her the thoughts and emotions that I'm feeling regarding our relationship. I tell her it's important to communicate with me and to not bottle up emotions.

Nothing I say matters. Some days she will just start acting very cold towards me the entire day even when nothing has happened between us that day. Today is one of those days. Earlier today we couldn't stop telling each other how much we missed each other. We finally got on the phone, talked for an hour and shared laughs. Then towards the end of it she started acting very cold. I finally got home from work so we hung up so I can shower etc. and then I called her again after. When I called her back she wasn't saying a word, every time I asked what's up or what she's doing, she would respond only with the word 'nothing' making it impossible to have a conversation with her. Then she tells me that if I'm not going to talk then she's gonna hang up to go do her homework. I tell her that she responds with 'nothing' every time I try to start a convo so that's why I'm not talking. She says okay and says bye then hangs up.

Normally she would call me after she finished her homework, but she didn't. I texted her the same night asking how it's going and she tells me she finished 30 minutes ago. I said I thought she'd call me after and she just says she thought I'd be busy (bullshit, she knew I wasn't) then she just said she's going to sleep and good night.

First I just said good night, but I care so I texted again asking what I did wrong and why she's being cold. She says 'Just thinking. You haven't done anything wrong'. I tell her that she doesn't normally get distant to 'just think' and I say there must be something that happened for you to be doing this. She just says 'its ok to think about stuff, that's pretty normal. I'll be fine, we'll be fine, I just need some time. I'll be fine by tomorrow'. I told her it is okay to think about stuff but I said we're teammates and she should share her thoughts with me, especially if they're about us. She just says 'Like I said, I'll be fine.' and I didn't bother replying.

Why does she do this? What can I do to get her to open up to me? I'm the guy, stereotype says I'm the one that should be bottling up my emotions, not her. I'm just frustrated and don't really know what to think.",15Mar2020,1

In the meantime I assume most of their finances are covered by their parents. I think it’s tacky to ask personally how they handle their finances or how much they get and where from as it’s none of my business. However, when we hang out in public places I’ve fallen into the pattern of paying for drinks, covering transport (I drive and own a car) ect. 

We recently went to a festival and saw a show. I booked a hotel for two nights for myself as I live far away from the event and wanted to drink. I offered them a place to sleep the night of the show so they would be taking public transport home drunk. 

Maybe I’m just too attached to my alone time and personal space. So her happily and excitedly accepting to stay in my room bothered me. Then they asked if they could have a few glass of my wine (I brought a cask with me for the two nights to ease the cost of city drinking for myself) and I reluctantly shared. Then came time to go to the festival. I paid for the food. I paid for the ticket in advance too and then some more drinks after as we made our way back to the hotel to sleep. 

It was agreed she would pay the cost of her  ticket. However, I feel like if I don’t bring it back up, neither will she. I’m not comfortable with this. It sets a precedence that I’ll always cave and I can be counted on to foot the bill and I want this behaviour to stop. I have an incredibly hard time making friends and have serve trust issues.

212,"My fiancé and I have been together for about 3.5 years. We’ve always been happy and generally a great couple. 

His parents are wonderful people. His mom and I are incredibly close. We do a lot together, and go out a lot. I even stayed with her in the hospital once, and never left her side. His dad, when I first met him, was a super funny guy. He cracked jokes and seemed to be in good spirits. 

His dad has always had an alcohol problem. He’s been an alcoholic for years. It’s gotten much worse over the last year or so, to the point I’m uncomfortable with the amount of alcohol he drinks. 

In the last year, his alcoholism has skyrocketed. He’s drunk/drinking 5/7 days of the week. He’s beyond lazy. He doesn’t do basic things asked of him and goes off on tangents when you ask him things. He is extremely passionate about President Trump, and isn’t afraid to tell anyone who will ask. He gets very loud with his opinions. If you were to bring up a seemingly normal thing, he starts raising his voice and explosively telling you why he’s right- and you’re wrong for liking them. 

I was watching a movie- Monster-in-Law- and he noticed Jane Fonda was in it. He made me pause the movie so he could berate me on how he hates her as a person and actress, because she “killed US soldiers”. I said I didn’t want to get into the politics of it, just that I liked her in the movie. He started griping at me that she killed people and is a racist SOB. 

Another time, his parents bought us some beer. It was a 16 pack, and we had 2. We went to drink another and they were all gone. Every single one. We were kind of upset, because they were ours. I kindly asked him to not drink ours unless he checked with us first- and he threw a fit. Acted like a toddler who just got told no- and then had the audacity to tell me I was disrespectful. I was made to beg for his forgiveness and apologized numerous times. 

He’s also very hypocritical. He’s been sitting on his recliner all day- watching TV and playing on the PS4. My fiancé’s mom asked him to clean the pet’s cage upstairs- and he said he’d do it later. That was at 8 AM. It’s now midnight and he hasn’t moved once. Yet when my fiancé came home from work, he gave him an entire lecture on “responsibility” and doing the job you’re given, because he went to work while the trash wasn’t full and came back to an overflowing can. 

Overall, my fiancé’s dad isn’t the same man I met 3.5 years ago. And I love him unconditionally, but I honestly just don’t like him anymore.",15Mar2020,1

My girlfriend and I are both from Canada, she's currently under contract as a performer for Carnival cruiselines and obviously working out of the states. The last cruise finishes on Monday, and from that date on she's isolated on the boat for 30 days before she can return to Canada. 

The huge problem is, she's running out of her anti-depressants and birth control, both of which can have serious consequences on her physical and mental health if she runs out. The symptoms are that of heavy withdrawals, and there's no people on board that can prescribe or give meds.  Would there be a loophole for her to return early? or a way to be contacting her doctor to try and get medication in the US (albeit costly)? 

I'm really trying to hold it out strong for her, but i know how dire the problems can be, and the reality may look like she won't be able to leave and return to Canada, even under quarantine. ANything helps. just need to vent and see what advice i can bring.

Anyway, when I was watching, there was one scene where these two guys were passionately making out, and it aroused me. I even used the mental image a few times when masturbating.

Recently, I remembered the scene and decided to look up the show. I then realised that the actors in question were 16 and 17 when the scene was filmed.

222,"I am 16 year old male and a junior in high school. About 7 years ago I meet a girl about three years younger than me. I met after my little brother and sister became friends with her and her little sister. They lived like 3 houses down from us. Our little siblings went to the lower elementary while we both we to the upper elementary so they rode different buses than we did and their bus came earlier than ours did. Her mom had to go to work after the 1st bus so she would come to our house to wait for the second bus and we would hang out. Through this we became best friends and started hanging out all the time we could. Honestly I fell in love with her before I even knew what love was. That might be taking it a little far but that's how I feel. But about a year after we became friends I find out she's moving away. Needless to say I was devistaded. We had no contact info to exchange. So we hung out until she moved. The last time i talked to her little sister I told her that I liked her older sister in a romantic way. That was the last time I talked to either of them before they moved. 
I have never been able to forget about her since then. I have always just wanted to see her again. Even though i know that if I saw her again I might now even recognise her and she probably wouldn't even remember me since we were so young. I think about her all the time.

223,"All right, buckle up fellow readers, cuz this is a fucking shit show you're about to read. Basically, I want to know the best way--in terms of how spectacular it would be--to kill yourself in private. Pretty fucking simple, I do not care how painful the method is, I want it to be unique; I would prefer that the method includes knives or blades, those are pretty fucking cool. If you're really that fucking curious about why I want to do this, it's a long-ass story. The short version: I'm a fucking retard. Now, that's pretty brief, so here's the long version. In fact, this started to really fucking piss me off a few days ago, but basically, I'm a fucking piece of shit that's not really good at doing, well, fucking anything. 

Firstly, I don't necessarily excel academically in a specific subject, I have been doing pretty fucking bad lately. I want to get into a good university: University of Waterloo, which is a well-known, very reputable engineering university. I want to get into the computer science program, but looking at my fucking grades and how shit they will be, I don't think I really have a fucking chance anymore. A few days ago, I completely failed a portion of a test, which will drastically bring my grade down, ruining my chances of entry into Waterloo. Basically, my carrier is already fucking ruined. People say you can ""boost"" your grade with any upcoming tests, even if the results on this one will be shit, but even so, I could not get my grade back on track as to how it was.

Secondly, I'm a fucking pussy, meaning that I cannot communicate with any humans of the opposite gender in a way, mostly because I'm too fucking scared to do it, or because I do not find a point in it anymore, as I already know it's gonna go to complete fucking shit. A few days ago, I missed a party which my friends attended--of course, cuz I'm fucking retarted--because girls were coming to it, and I did no longer want to further embarrass myself with my retarted social skills in front of everyone. For whatever fucking reason, I now feel bad for not going, even tho I know that it would've been a lot worse if I'd had gone. I do not understand why I would go to anymore of these parties, as I have friends--multiple--who excel better than me in every fucking aspect, including flirting, and just simply fucking socializing with girls. In specific, I have a friend who fucking pisses me off because, despite him being interested in only one girl, he fucking feels the need to impress all the fucking girls with his amazing confident personality, he really fucking pisses me off. Therefore, I will no longer be attending these events anyway.

As I have realized over the years, these are just some of the fucking things that I was either born with, like being a pussy, or have failed to achieve my goals for, like getting into a fucking decent university, fuck man. I want to fucking die, at the beginning because of my academic status, but now because of the second main reason that I have talked about. Basically, I don't know why the fuck I wrote so much, just give me advice on a creative way to kill myself, because I want this to be the only thing that I will not be a pussy in. Also, if you can, tell me how I should tell my family and friends about this--in the form of a letter--and explain to them that it wasn't, and will never be their fault, and that I love them, even tho I have this ""hate"" towards some of my friends.

TLDR; Give me unique ways to kill myself, that preferably include knives. I do not care how painful the method is. I want it to be spectacular. I want to prove that I wasn't a pussy when I killed myself.",15Mar2020,1

230,"It's a long, mostly irrelevant story how we got here but I've been under employed for about a year. I just received a job offer in my industry in another city and my spouse has asked me not to take it because it would mean being apart for at least a few months while they looked for a job, they make way more than me, they're up for a promotion, and there is no guarantee that they'll make as much or have the same upward mobility if they change jobs.

I would be willing to look for a different job- the problem is that I just can't expect to get a job in this city because it's really bad for my industry.

I don't care about the money, I just want to get back into my industry. I've been staying at home for so long I'm also eager to financially contribute again-  I take care of the housework and dog stuff but it still makes me feel like a lump. The idea of getting a (probably menial) job outside of my industry is also distasteful to me- makes me feel like it'd be harder to break back into my industry and I'm also used to being valued by employers and clients- I feel like the amount of disrespect I'd endure in a menial job would diminish my already low self confidence. My spouse is fine with the current arrangement, they make enough that it is not a struggle financially, but is obviously supportive of me getting a job because it makes me unhappy to be at home.

Mostly the issue is how I feel about myself/the value I feel I bring to the household without a job. I'm looking for a path to be OK with it, in the event that I need to stay at home while my spouse waits to hear about the promotion or looks in a new city first so we're financially stable before moving. I haven't decided whether or not to turn down the job but I'm running out of time to decide.

Is anyone else a stay at home spouse with no children **or** have been un/under employeed for a long period **or** have a job that does not yet provide an income (writer, entrepreneur, etc)? How do you feel about it? How do you describe what you do when people ask? Do you feel guilty about spending money on yourself?",15Mar2020,1

Was suddenly terminated on 3/4 due to an HR complaint raised by another coworker. No coaching/write ups previously, stellar performance reviews complete with raises and bonuses. Living paycheck to paycheck due mostly to medical/credit card debt.

232,"I'm almost 18, and I've been having this feeling that I've been separated from the love of my life, even though I've never fallen in love or even had a crush. 

I would wake up in the morning and I'd have that feeling that people describe when they miss their partner. A sense of loneliness and a sense that something, or more accurately someone, is missing.

I would have dreams of that person, I would spend the day with her, or lay down with her, it would never be sexual, just the two of us spending time. Every time I would dream this I would try to see her face, thinking that maybe my cognition knows this person without me knowing her, if that was even possible. However every time I would be able to see her face.

I've woken up to me passionately kissing my pillow thinking it was her. I've become a grade A weirdo. I'm genuinely terrified that one day I'll see a random person on the street, or on a billboard, or online and my brain will just connect every dot I've been accidentally lining up and turn me into a full on stalker.

234,"When it comes to vaping, it pays off to take a closer look at the ingredients found in the typical electronic cigarette. Most e-cigs contain flavorings, commonly made up of diacetyl, which is an artificial flavoring. Thankfully, some scientists got curious and decided to take a good hard look at it. One such study found that diacetyl “caused many respiratory problems by increasing oxidative stress” (Frontiers In Physiology). While this may seem not even remotely connected to acne, oxidative stress is exactly the process that causes the body to lose its antioxidants. Losing antioxidants, in turn, contributes to the clogging of skin pores, creating whiteheads and blackheads, which are the first link in the chain that causes acne.

What’s more, the good people at Harvard inspected a total of 51 different flavors of electronic cigarettes and found that 47 of them contained artificial flavorings. Of those, 39 contained this problematic, diacetyl compound. An interesting detail is that all of the products which contained flavors boosted by diacetyl were targeted at young people.",15Mar2020,1
235,"Because of the Covid-19 outbreak, my school is shut down and my senior year is a bust. Originally, I was going to receive a MacBook Pro for my graduation present from my parents + myself. However, my current computer is just being so annoying. I’ve had it for 6 years and it has been good to me but I need one that can run programs and software needed for college. But since I’m home now and need to run multiple programs at once, my computer has been chugging. I don’t have room to download updates, but I only have two things downloaded and some pictures, I can’t open email because I can’t update. But using browsers causes it to overheat so I can’t hear what people are saying on calls. It’s just time for a upgrade.

Should I buy the computer now? As in tomorrow?
On one hand I don’t want t be stranded with this thing for any longer. Especially if I get put on lockdown and can’t leave.

On the other hand, I can easily survive until June to upgrade. All the problems can be dealt with, I just wasn’t sure if it was worth putting in the time and effort when I’ll need to upgrade later anyways. But I also don’t want to spend money unnecessarily if we are about to see an economic collapse and all that. Anxiety brain has me listing all the horrible things that will go wrong if I buy a computer I need for school and have saved money specifically for. Ugh.

237,"Hi there

I'm worried. My father is going to travel by plane this Tuesday. We're from Europe where the coronavirus has become a very big issue. More airlines are cancelling flights because of it. But my dad is very stubborn and doesn't think it's going to be an issue.

His trip is not a necessity, but more like a family visit. He has already existing medical issues: diabetes, high blood pressure and muscle- and chronic pain disease. Moreover, he's 64 (almost 65). He will visit my grandmother (his mother) who is 89 and very fragile (I feel like a cold will wipe her out already).

I'm scared my father will catch the disease during his trip and spread it to wherever he's going, including my grandma who I'm sure will not survive COVID-19. In addition, if my father is going to be hospitalized abroad, there's a huge chance I won't be able to visit, because the regulations in my country change everyday and I wouldn't be surprised if the airport locks down upcoming week.

I have been busy all week to tell my parents to cancel the flight, but because it already cost a lot of money and the insurance will not compensate for COVID-19, my parents are not cancelling the flight because to them it will be a waste of money (they're not poor, but I wouldn't say they're middle class). I told my mother to call a doctor for advice in my dad's situation, but I feel like she's not going to do it.

I'm pretty sure he shouldn't travel at all by now. What else can I do to tell him to stay home? I'm at my wits end. Thank you in advance.",15Mar2020,1

244,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I really only have one friend and are birthdays were this month (March). 

My birthday came first. The plan was to hang out at his house to get drunk, then go to our local bar/club that opened recently. Around 10 o'clock (both of us were drunk by this point) he decides he doesn't want to go out because then he'd have to put his dogs in their cages while we were gone. So I said whatever, we stayed in and had a good (yet pretty boring) night. I wasn't too worried because we were planning on going all out for his birthday anyways (since we'd both be 19 and could go to the casino in town).

This weekend was his birthday. I had already booked off work ahead of time after confirming with him that we'd be going all out. Around 8 I message him asking when we'd be going out and he replies that he's ""at his brother's place having drinks"" and he ""doesn't really wanna do a whole bunch tonight"" ie. Plans were off.

Now I'm upset because he changed the plans on my birthday, then cancelled plans on his birthday without telling me (I had to ask). Is he being an asshole or am I being over dramatic?

From 8 to back my life is very blurry. I'm actually going trough the third year of high school.

My mom doesn't have the money to help me with that as we are struggling a lot with debt (I think things are getting better soon but I'm not sure and I don't know how much better). and I don't really have any means to prove to someone that this is really happening, as I don't have control over what I forget and what I don't.

There is some strange things with that too.

Also, learned to edit in various softwares that I don't really remember even downloading, I know how to draw really well most of the time but from time to time my mind just snaps and don't work to do even a simple drawing

Everyone has bad sloppy nights, but they seem to be sloppy every time they get drunk.  We all used to be friends with someone who always complained about not wanting to “baby” drunk people and she would just leave our drunk friends to figure it out themselves. I used to judge her for doing this but I’m starting to understand.  I would never just leave them to drunk fend for themselves but when I drink I’m afraid of getting too drunk that I can’t take care of them at the end of the night.

Both of my friends usually blackout and don’t even remember me taking care of them so I feel like they don’t even appreciate my efforts.

There is a lot of emotional abuse my parents have put me through. My dad cheated on my mom many times, threatened to leave, and was hardly there. The was a lot of verbal abuse from both of my parents. I remember when I was young, my mom told me it is all my fault that she is sick and other stuff like that (she has chronic illnesses). My dad has threatened to beat me. They’ve done questionably sexual things in front of me. Which jacked up my mind and caused me to do some stupid mistakes as a hormonal teenager. I also remember my mom sexually touching me a few times when I was younger. And I didn’t understand at the time, but it fucked me up. And it is probably also part of what caused me to do the stupid stuff I did as a teenager. I don’t know if she was on her meds or what when these things happened. But when I talked to her about it, she says that it never happened, and that she would never do that and yada yada.

On top of all this, I was homeschooled and socially isolated all throughout my teenage years. Therefore, I have no social skills, and I don’t know how to make friends or talk to people. And I’m extremely lonely. 

They’ve also made me work for them from a young age. From the age of 11 or 12, I would help do construction type work or work on cars etc. and now at the age of 18 almost 19, my knees are jacked up and my health is deteriorating, and overall I just feel like an old person. 

Speaking on health, they’ve also never taken it seriously. I haven’t been to the dentist in over ten years because they didn’t take me to even get them cleaned all this time. And now I have a mouth full of crooked teeth and cavities, and I need to find out how to fix them since I’m 18. 

I’ve also noticed some symptoms building up and I’m getting worried. Ever since a young age, I’ve had a swollen lymph node behind my ear. I’m starting to have difficulty swallowing. I’ve noticed that I have double vision. One side of my face is dropping as well.

This has me worried because I have a family history of Muscular Dystrophy, Autoimmune Diseases, Arthritis etc. my mom has multiple chronic illnesses including Myasthenia Gravis. My Grandpa Died from ALS. My uncle has fibromyalgia. My grandma died from cancer.

I just all around have horrible genetics. And I’m worried that there is something wrong with me as well. And I can’t get checked or anything because I just simply can’t afford it.

There is also mental issues I’m dealing with that I can’t afford to get checked yet. I’m sure I have ADHD, obvious depression and anxiety. And who know what else.

Everything just feels hopeless. I don’t know what to do. And I just can’t take it. I feel like I’m cursed to live a life of pain. And I honestly just want to end it all. I really just want to die.",15Mar2020,1
266,"so I am sort of upset because I have this friend group, my ex has been cuddling my roommate she is religious so I never got to sleep with her doesn’t mean I still didn’t do some things. I don’t mind him being with her but in some ways it bothers me and bothers him just a little bit, we are friends but flirt fairly often. Then there is our other friend who is married but her husbands in japan, she has a future with him, it’s frustrating now because the sexual jokes occasionally in our group such as rubbing one out or her sitting on my lap just my knee cause nowhere else always making fun of me in a playful way. I can smoke weed with her and cuddle her I think I’m starting to develop feelings with her but I can’t be with her. This coronavirus is straining her relationship and I feel bad cause I almost like that like I don’t I want her to be with her husband but I think this points are a bigger issue, I wish I had someone and when people I’m affectionate towards get close to me and I can’t be with them it upsets me, this has happened several times and I am trying to figure out how I can better deal with it because it’s

267,"Long story short i work as a key holder in a video game store,the kind that don't give alot of credit for games,you know the one. 

I've been working there for nearly two years,everything was swell during the first year,i'm friends with everyone,i know almost everything in my field of work and i end up having the best sales and being promoted from seasonal christmas employee to part time,then to full time then to key holder. 

A few months ago the manager accepeted a better offer in a different store,we were told the assistant manager would take his place and i'd probably be bumped to assistant too,until another manager comes up and starts running the store. 

At first i didn't have a problem with the guy,sure he was annoying but nothing much,until i realized how little work he did,on big days like boxing days or game launch day he wouldn't touch the register all day,would walk around and stress everyone out and be paid twice our salary


Everyone dislikes his work or lack there is,all the employees without exception but nobody tells him,they just play buddy with him. The assistant manager talked to district manager about it but nothing came out of it. So i told the manager how his employees felt and he didn't like it. Telling me i was a liar and that he'd have fun with my yearly evalutaion and would set things straight. 

Now the store has been massively shafted in hours due to game releases being pushed back,i went from 40 to 10,i can barely affor groceries with this,let alone rent. I love my job,it's my passion it's what i'm good at but this guy is killing me,what should i do?",15Mar2020,1

270,"Hello, I am a healthy 23 year old in Los Angeles. Currently, we have about 58 cases with 1 death of an elderly person who traveled here. I usually go to two places, work and school but recently my classes moved to online. This just leaves work. I go to work 4 days a week and I usually catch two busses there (mildly full), and a bus/train/bus combo back(full). 

Recently I made the decision to go to work an extra day for a music lesson being offered on a day that really only 10ish people will be there. I know these people, I already work there. I have no flu symptoms whatsoever (and I'm a mild hypochondriac) and have   not been I'm contact with any sick people. 

Here's my problem: I'm not too concern about me. I do have a 1)diabetic roommate 2)a roommate who is 30ish but uses a oxygen tank full time and 3) a roommate who is 70. So serverly immunocompromised people. I'm only going to 1 location but I do have to go to Ralph's tomorrow and get some rice and canned goods (not stocking up per se but like a week worth of food).

271,"So I’ve been talking to this guy since Saturday (not yesterday, the Saturday before) and he lives 350 km from me. I came to see him by flying here yesterday. I live in Warsaw. The prime minister has closed airports even domestic flights according to my taxi driver yesterday.

Before i came, the guy was saying we can go on walks around here. I explained I’m not looking for sex but we can be good friends. He assured me that he understands.

Last night he texted me saying we cannot go outside, not because of the virus, but because he only wants to have sex. He said we’ve already talked a week. I told him I don’t want to have sex and that it was not nice of him to lie. He then said we don’t have to but have to stay in the hotel all the time.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I believe him after he already lied once. Also it would suck if he did pressure me into sex. I have painful purple marks on my stomach, waist, arms, and legs from when the zookeeper pulled me out of the baboon enclosure on Friday.

277,"I’m currently in a 4th year German class and I have two years of school left, but only one more level left to go before I can’t take German anymore, as the school I’m at only goes up to 5th year language courses, if that makes sense. Our 4th and 5th year classes are in the same period, so I can see the work the 5th year students are doing and it seems like way too much for me to handle, as I am involved in time-intensive extracurriculars and other IB classes. I would be taking four IB classes next year, including German, and I am already stressed with two this year.

On top of the potential stress it would cause, I just don’t enjoy it anymore. Going to that class feels like a chore and, although I like my classmates, I find the content we’re covering boring. And my teacher has always been quick to anger, but pretty much since the beginning of the year he’s been especially bad-tempered. There are one or two kids in our class (basically fluent speakers) that like to prod at him sometimes, which isn’t nice, but he has snapped and started yelling at them, repeatedly saying that he’s “ready to be fired” and sworn at them in some less-than-professional insults. It happened again on Friday, but this time he made one of those students cry. I never could have imagined this student upset before that class period, he’s one of the toughest people I’ve ever met, but months of being insulted can get to you, I guess.

That was the final straw for me and the one that’s making me seriously consider dropping the class. My parents really want me in language courses and I don’t want to lose the German I’ve learned, but I’m already in Spanish language and literature (pretty much what you’d do in English class) and if I drop German I’ll be able to take choir, which is something I’m very passionate about. I don’t know whether I should just stick it out or drop the class.

Apologies for the length and thank you for reading,
A concerned student",15Mar2020,1
279,"I turned 18 around 3 weeks ago, and I've been trying to find a job. Before, I didn't because she said I wasn't allowed to and should focus on my studies. Now that I'm of legal age, I don't need a work permit/permission from anyone. I told my mom I was going in for an interview thing on Monday, and instead of being supportive she straight out said she disapproves. She said I have plenty of time in the future to earn money but now is not the time, and I shouldn't be going ANYWHERE because of the pandemic. I think this is ridiculous as there's no active cases within a few city's radius from us. I know she's only looking out for me and I should be careful, but I want to get a job and save money. Would I be a bad daughter if I went out and got the job? My parents constantly control everything, I still get my electronics taken away on school nights. I feel like I just need to start living life for myself, and not let them treat me like a 12 year old anymore. I haven't told my dad yet because I know he'll back her up.

280,"This is a pretty niche problem so I understand if no one can help but I really just need to talk it out so I feel like i'm not holding this in anymore...

So I like to stream on Twitch and I started last August and found it to be really fun even though for majority of that time I found myself streaming for 0-2 viewers at a time. One of them usually being my girlfriend. I eventually was able to convince my girlfriend a month later to also start streaming because I believed that she would be a great streamer as well. A couple of months pass again and my girlfriend reaches Affiliate status (Basically means people can start making money from streaming) and I was super happy for her. At that point, even though she reached it before me, I did not feel any form of jealousy or envy because I was confident I would get there eventually. And I did a couple of weeks later. Fast forward to now, and my girlfriend and I just streamed on our own channels playing a game with each other. She streamed to an average of 10 viewers. Doesn't seem like a lot but if you know the scene, it's hard to get even an average of 3 viewers. I, on the other hand, streamed to an average of 0 viewers...

I am SUPER happy for her please do not get me wrong. I was so excited for her when someone gifted her 10 subs during her stream (equivalent to a $50 donation) and was trying to hype up her and her chat when it happened but at the same time, I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough. Being a streamer/content creator has always been a dream job for me but it is really hard to not feel like I am incapable.. I know deep down that I am fully capable and entertaining enough to be a streamer but just because you believe in yourself, doesn't mean you will see results.

I haven't mentioned this to her because I would HATE to take this happy moment away from her just because I'm being stupid so I've been trying my best to keep it to myself so she doesn't have to feel any ounce of guilt. But a little bit of my feelings came out earlier when we were talking about what she should do with her newly acquired Twitch money. I may have gotten a little too excited and started acting more like her manager and not her boyfriend and she got a little upset at me for being a little too controlling. I quickly backed off and apologized after realizing what I was doing but it was too late and she ended our conversation and went to bed...

I now feel like shit because I realize that I was selfishly trying to enjoy her moment by living vicariously through her but in reality, I should just let her do what she wants because she is her own person. I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for but I really just needed to vent.

TL;DR - Want to get rid of jealous feelings for girlfriend who is a more successful Twitch streamer than I am because it makes me feel like a bad person. I'm super happy for her but can't help but think I'm not good enough because of my lack of success compared to hers.",15Mar2020,1

 It's been a real journey and i realized i always been the victim of my life, blaming others for my unhappiness, i'm the reflection of my parents and I'm changing that myself first little by little, but today we start a conversation and she said stuff about what was doing her with all of the problems we we're avoiding, i literally told her she was being the victim, she needed therapy and to let go things from the past in all the conversation we had cuz it was long and we made our points actually, i told her those things in a good way and with the best words to make her feel like i'm here cuz we're really don't seem to be a family and complaining about everything that happens to us is selfish and brings hate to our hearts.

I find myself avoiding her and it’s awkward when we interact since I know her “secret”. But she’s my mother and I want our relationship to be normal again.

She insists that she gained weight and that's the problem but it's not, I think she's extremely sexy and I want to have babies with her. I feel like the only thing that will get her to finally stop is for the test to confirm I have low T but she said she doesn't want me taking the supplements because she doesn't want my voice to get deeper and likes me the way I am.

In hindsight this was extremely weird we had known eachother for about 2h but then she asked for mine, I hesitated and she used the I sent one you send one card so in the spur of the moment I sent one without my face. Afterwards I freaked out a bit and explained to her and we both agreed to delete all the chats and we both sent screenshots confirming this. However Kik doesn't notify you if pictures are saved, as a new user I had no clue and it's entirety possible that she saved them before deleting the chat. The more I look back on it the more I think it could have been a scam although lots of things make me also think she is real as after I said to delete all my pics and not save them she wanted the same thing for her pics (which I respected and didn't save) .

In short: I let my dick think for me and sent faceless nudes to a girl I met two hours earlier on Kik after she sent me one, we both deleted the chats but she could have saved them although she said she did not want to but I'm still stressing out",15Mar2020,1

It has been a problem for my family for a long time. When he’s drunk, he yells and curses at my mother and I.

One of her kids has even said she doesn’t like being around him. He has never been physically abusive, and I don’t want to say he’s been verbally abusive either, but he gets extremely emotional and angry when he drinks to the point that it has been a horrible negative in all of our lives.

It came to a boiling point tonight. He was telling my mom off after just returning from a trip and I told him to stop. He continued to be rude and then walked outside after telling us to go fuck ourselves. I just felt this rage take over and I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed a mason jar of moonshine he had, walked outside and threw it at his head. It broke on him and blood started pouring out immediately. I screamed at him hysterically to never treat us badly again, to never drink again etc. while he yelled back. I left to a friend’s house while he went to the ER, got stitches, and returned home.

My family discussed things like an intervention or rehab, though my dad has rejected things before. At some point, probably tomorrow, they will expect the family, including me, to talk to him. I can’t even imagine what will take place when that happens. He got 5 stitches in his head because of me. I don’t feel ready to confront any of this.

294,"Ok so I have this friend who I met about 5 years ago through social media. Let me start first by describing our friendship. I’d say we’re fairly close friends to be honest. We’ve been through a lot of shit. At first when we started talking, we got in to arguments over the stupidest reasons, we don’t argue anymore as we learned to get past it and matured. She tells me anything because she trusts me. She even would tell me how much she admires, appreciates and love me. We used to text each other paragraph after graphs exposing how we feel and occasionally we have deep intellectual conversations which I we both enjoy. We would stay up and text or call each other almost every other night and talk about anything. We’re a bit older now and don’t talk as much because ya know... responsibilities. But that’s life and I still consider her a close friend and I’m glad I met her. I’d say we’re pretty much the same in terms of common interests. The crazy part is that our birthdays are in the same month!! Our birthdays are in April, but mine comes a day before hers. Mine is the 26th and hers is the 27th. Coincidence? Maybe...sometimes I like to think we were meant to cross paths and she says the same thing too. Also we both been wanting to see each other in person in a few years, but I’m not sure how I would tell my parents about her. Yeah they don’t know her and I’m worried if I do tell them about her and say that I want to meet her, they’ll say no. Even if they do meet her and get to know her,I still think they’ll hesitate. My parents are kinda protective over me when it comes to people they don’t know. I know they care about my safety and all, but still I feel like they should allow me to travel and my parents have become a bit more lenient towards me and what I hat I do outside the house. Back then, they were kinda strict. But anyways, do you guys have any advice on how I should handle this? And side note I’m 20 living with parents sigh",15Mar2020,1
295,"I am in my 20's. I live and work on the west coast of the US and am having a hard time deciding whether to travel to the east coast for 1-2 weeks to see my family.  

I do not have tickets yet.  I would not have considered traveling if not for the changes to work/life/flight prices because of the covid-19 outbreak.

My work is 90% remote until April 3 (at least).

If I stayed, I would save some money, be able to attend physical therapy sessions, likely get more work done, and spend time with friends who are staying in town.

My friends and family on the east coast are eager to have me home but I am mixed on whether to go because of the following:

1) I was recently broken up with and have spent a lot of time moping. I think it would help to get away from being near my ex and our mutual friends but I may just continue moping.

2) a friend I grew up with passed away earlier this year in a tragic accident. I think being home would help me with the grief but admittedly I am afraid I may grieve even harder because the last time I was on the east coast was for her funeral.

3) being around my family can be difficult.

4) if domestic travel is banned, I may get stuck on the east coast.

298,"Ok so, here's the thing: I write a bunch of stories. In one of those stories, there is a female character who, to cope with some really traumatic stuff, studied physics and martial arts. Like, she literally hooked her brain up to the internet and copy-pasted a bunch of Wikipedia articles into her memory so she knew why those people died, and how to kick the guy who made her go through this into next century. 

Anyway, to streamline her thought processes, she created personas, with their own speech mannerisms, postures and whatnot, which she uses when talking about a certain subject. The idea is that these personas became more and more defined and unique as time went on, starting as figurative paper plate masks and moving on to become more like Hollywood-level masks for big movies. 

She has two of these personas, and my original idea was to have them be alternate personalities, but then I realized that I had no idea how to write this sort of thing. Like, what problems she would have, or how she would feel when another personality took control. 

So yeah, I need help working those things out, and I know from personal experience that movie/TV depictions of such conditions are mostly stereotypes played up for the plot's sake. I don't want to write that kind of character, ever. I want a character who is genuine and has a real condition with real difficulties attached to it. 

What I plan on doing in my story is that over time, this character's masks become so well-defined that switching between them happens automatically, and the masks develop on their own, without the character's control. I know this probably isn't how this works, but I'd still be happy if people with this condition could offer their two cents, like how it feels if another personality takes control, or how other personalities felt the first time they were in control. 

Any kind of info on this type of condition would be really helpful.",15Mar2020,1

300,"I also posted this in r/depression


I’m in college and my friend/roommate (let’s call her M) has pretty severe depression.   Last year before we lived together she was saying she was going to kill her self and my other friend had to call the police on her because she couldn’t get into the building that she lived in at the time.  The police just said “she has no physical signs of harm so we can’t do anything” and then left.  Her parents don’t believe in mental illness and live on the other side of the country so they weren’t much of a help. 

This year we live together and for a bit she started to get better then spiraled down again.  She was crying on the floor saying she wanted to die and all I could do was sit with her and try and tell her to go to bed (we were both drunk).  She also has anger issues.  Her road rage is very scary because she screams in the car at other drivers and sometimes I’m afraid someone’s going to shoot at us when she does that because we don’t live in the safest area.  Any time something doesn’t go her way she gets so angry and stomps around even in public. She uses her mental illness to guilt me and our other friend/roommate so that she can get exactly what she wants.  She says stuff like “if i don’t get this I’m literally going to have a panic attack.” I’m afraid of making her angry because her anger can quickly turn to a panic attack and crying.

She is on medication but does not go to counseling anymore.  She has said she doesn’t think counseling helps her.  I have been very depressed before and seeing her breakdown and say she wants to kill herself is starting to make me depressed again.  I want to be a good friend but at the same time I get extremely angry when she thinks her mental illness is an excuse to boss me around/get whatever she wants.  I don’t know how to handle this because I can’t continue doing what I’m doing because I feel myself starting to slip back into depression again.",15Mar2020,1
301,"Hi, I 32 F , work in a big city (NY). I know it may sound strange but I’m a masseuse at a gentleman’s club. I work 3 nights a week. I come in contact (and touch) men/women from all over. This has been a concern of mine since this virus started circulating. On top of which, the dancers, bartenders etc are also from other countries, sometimes come work for a few weeks and leave. The point is, I know for a fact the owners will NOT shut down/close temporarily unless they are mandated to. I was sick this past week and spoke with the manager about what precautions when I return, and all that was said was “make your own sanitizer if you can’t find any and use it after every massage” which was already a rule- but that doesn’t stop coming in contact/massaging someone sweating, coughing, or asymptotic.
This industry is cash and They easily replace you if you decide to not work for an extended period of time. Even during a pandemic. So I’m in a tough spot. I personally don’t feel it’s safe to work, but I wanted to ask for other opinions..Thanks in advance.",15Mar2020,1
303,"The more I think and grow the less of a personality I seem to have, and the less goals I seem to have. I think the cause of this is chronic indecisiveness. Let me explain with some examples:

Music:
When I first really dove into music I listened to a single genre of music and thought I hated everything else. Cage the elephant and similar sounds where the only thing I could appreciate. I thought I hated country, pop, rap, etc.

But as I've listened to more and more I have learned to appreciate the purpose of every song out there. My personal taste has all but disappeared. I've explored most genres out there and even if they're objectively bad, I can still find appreciation for them. An example is the band paper ceiling. The vocalist is often off key, out of breath, and barely uses dynamics. It sounds very bad simply put. But somehow I still made it through all of their albums with only intrigue. That's my overwhelming feeling with listening to anything recently, not enjoyment but intrigue.

Politics: 
At this point I have no opinion on any political topic, movement, party, etc. Everyone has a reason to believe whatever they belive in right? So who am I to say they're wrong. I used to be very strongly in favor of one set of ideas, and now I legitimately can't decide on anything. I find myself playing the role of ""the other people"" in any discussion about politics. Because everyone has a point and the world is too complicated for absolutes.

People:
It's easy to come to a quick conclusion about someone based on little information. You hear one story and all of the sudden that person is written off as a jerk or boring or whatever else. But everyone has a story. Everyone has a long list of events that caused them to be the way they are. So why pass judgement so quickly? Everyone is constantly trying to adapt to their surroundings, and everyones surroundings are constantly changing. For every time someone acts there is a set of circumstances that lead them to make that choice. And you can never know everything someone else knows, so its flawed to judge them for that. My point is that I have almost no opinions on anyone's character. 

This trend continues is nearly every aspect of my life. I play devil's advocate with myself until I end up confused and exhausted. The more I think about things the more indifferent I become towards them. To the point where I have no opinions at all. I see people all around me who seem to be born with a purpose. Alec Steele is a blacksmith, he's been doing it since he was very young and has turned it into a successful career. Many musicians began playing when they were as young as five years old and have carried that passion with them for their entire life. I know an artist that paints the most incredible ultrarealistic paintings and is only 17 years old. 

I've jumped from hobby to hobby, never getting particularly good at anything, for my entire life. I want to pour my heart and soul and creativity and time into something I really care about, but I always end up picking something else up, or wasting my time.

How do I find my calling and stick to it?",15Mar2020,1

hey guys im really conflicted on what to do right now.

i recently got accepted into a competitive summer program i applied to. if i accept, i have to fly several states away for 6 weeks for the program. despite it being from june to july, im still a bit afraid to fly amidst the coronavirus pandemic. either way, this program is designed for what i want to pursue in the future so it's very beneficial. my friend attended this program last year and she had a great experience and made a lot of friends so she highly recommends it.

i told my brother about this and he told me it would be a waste of time to accept the program (i have just 24 hours to accept or deny my spot). according to him, if i won't be receiving credit or anything for college with the program, im just better off staying at campus and doing what i was originally going to do: mentor kids at my lab, take community college courses for credit, and continue working at my current job that is in the field i want to pursue in the future. after he told me this, i kinda agreed with his perspective. but i spent a long time on my application and was really excited about the program.

both options are great and are awesome for my resume but im still conflicted on what i want to do. im starting to lean in a bit more on my brother's POV. what would you guys do? do you think there is an advantage in either option?

Let me first express that I’m not normally a worrier. But I find myself anxious about the level of panic people seem to be experiencing. And to be clear I’m definitely not as worried about the virus as I am about the panic.

For some background on me, my in-laws are extreme dooms day preppers, going so far as giving me a bug-out bag for my daughter when she was born. This constant discourse of end days has gotten me pretty on edge about the topic. Not that I think it’s end of days. But it’s rather like nails on a chalk board to me at this point. Which I believe is adding to my feelings right now about the Coronavirus. 

Now as I watch my daughter’s school close, our library close, and the local shops run out of supplies I find myself getting anxious. A feeling I’m really not familiar with.

311,"I have a heart and mind for making things! As a once musician turned creator of leather things (@rhythmicleatherworks on Insta!) and wanting to dive headfirst into prop making, special effects fabrication and so on, I have noticed I ALWAYS become super reserved and almost tongue tied when wanting to talk about my passions and love for things. 

Riiiiight when I’m on the precipice of my excitement and eagerness to share the things I have done, made, am making, or wanting to make, I feel like I’m snatch away from it. I instantly feel myself recede back into my mental safe space, terrified that the person I’m talking to might have something negative to say or, worse in my mind, be totally uninterested.

I want to get over this thing but the more I try to just SAY the thing I want so badly to say, It never comes out the way I wanted it to. I always get so anxious and find myself over-simplifying what I’ve done, even if the thing I did was wonderfully complex and amazing!

312,"After seeing some of the other posts here, I don't know if this is worthy of attention, but I'd appreciate any advice I could get.

Last month I resigned from my startup, after 7 years working there and getting acquired by a major player in the industry (I build robots). Quick recap- new ownership chased out old CEO, my boss (old COO) became the new CEO and went on an egotistical power binge. Two important points to this binge- (1) he invited me over to his house unknowingly (to me) so I could teach his kids how to solder and program a raspberry pi, and after I tried to back away from this ""assistance,"" (2) wrote an incredibly negative and false review of my work. My job position was put on the company website as hiring and I knew either I'm training my own replacement, or I choose to walk. So- I wrote a 15-page response to his review, with emails, dates, and proof of my work, sent it to the founders of the company and HR, and asked to have an exit to the company as I no longer saw a place where I could work and grow. I was offered a role working under the CTO (who still reports to the now very bitter CEO- who apparently has been telling people I am negative and my ideas are poisoning the company). I declined and walked away.

I live in California (Los Angeles) if that helps with potential support programs/situations. For the past month, I've been pulling myself out of this weird funk, after severely overworking myself for years. I realized how much crap I bought, as a way to distract me from being severely overworked, and have been purging everything and donating to local charities. I have lost any motivation to return to working just yet. Very much burned out. I'm lucky to have saved for a doomsday situation and have a few months of living free ahead of me before times get tough. I guess, here are a few things I wish I could get advice on:

1. Health insurance. I'm guessing the best/cheapest thing to do would be to go healthcare.gov, right? Or I could go without, and backpay COBRA if anything (God forbid) were to happen? I'm 32, and keep relatively good health. There are no longer tax penalties for not having health insurance, starting next year.

2. I always understood that I could not get unemployment If I quit a job. However, reading up on California- there is a chance I could get unemployment if I were to quit for a ""good cause?"" I don't need unemployment right now, but it would be a bit more comforting to have the cushion (especially with how expensive everything is out here). Don't know if anyone has any experience with this.

3. Is there anything else I should be doing with my life? I have a couple of side projects I'm starting to build out, but nothing is bringing in money just yet. Helping out some friends on passion projects, and catching up with mentors. Meditating.

4. Last thing, and maybe a strange one- does the coronavirus change anything here? Is there some ""doomsday virus is here, everyone unemployed/gig economy gets free steak!"" programs? I figure I might as well ask.

Ever since i was born they’ve been die-hard christians so having strict parenting tendencies is nothing foreign to them.  Anyways one day me and some buddy’s threw a party at a friends house.  my parents knew this friend who had a reputation for doing reckless things in my town so i told them i was going to a different friends house for the night.  the night was a blast but we lowkey trashed the place.  I felt bad for him so the next day i skipped my last period class and went back to help him clean the place.  the only problem was before i left the house that morning my mom had set up some way to track my phone and see my location wherever i was.  i wasn’t aware of this so promptly went to my friends house.  my mom saw my location while at that kids house and immediately assumed i was smoking pot w him.  i came home to very angers parents and a drug test which i failed even though i didn’t smoke that day i had the day before at the party. All this to say they grounded me and immediately put me in home school.  that was last year around christmas so for the next semester i did homeschool.  over that time i slowly stopped seeing my friends less and less often.  it was hard being away from them throughout the week bc all the stuff they’d talk about had happened at school the week before. i just slowly had less and less in common w them.  that semester sucked and so did the upcoming summer.  around july was the last time for a while that i hung out w them.  i will see some of them here and there but i am really no longer apart of that group which sucks and wasn’t my intent.  i tried to stay friends but constantly having to invite myself to functions and stuff for awkward and tiring.

They want me to leave it and go to Dubai to my aunt TOMORROW! They decided that JUST TODAY and have booked my ticket for tomorrow without even talking to me or hearing me out about my decision. 
I tried convincing them and talking to them but they won’t listen. My friends called them and convinced them, they just hung up on us. I’ve been getting bad anxiety as I already suffer from anxiety. I don’t wanna travel. I was self quarantining myself completely and it was going smoothly until today. I’ve been crying the entire day. They literally ruined my birthday too..it’s been horrible :(

329,"I have been secretly in love with a girl for a few years, since the final year of college. We started to hang out, there was a mutual connection, even our colleagues saw we are always together and one close female friend of mine told me that girl definitely likes me. The only problem was she had a long time  boyfriend so I thought I don't know... Never asked her out, never told my feelings. 

We finished college, stay in the same city, but our contact was very limited. A few years passed by and from her social media I understood she is not in relationship anymore. 

I have reached out to her a few months ago, we started going out, regularly texting each other, getting closer again etc. She liked my company, she could have easily said no or ghosted me, but she did not. 

Last week I asked her out and used such a subtle form she definitely did understand as a romantic encounter and not just going out for a drink. We had a few drinks, talked for a few hours in a bar, and when we got out, I told her my feelings and that I like her a lot. 

I got rejected and she told she was suspecting I am in love with her, although I have never said anything. So, basically, the answer I got is that she likes our conversations, but she does not see me that way and there is no chance of us being together. 

Period. It was not even the polite rejection, no smile, no word of support, clarification or comfort since then - especially since she suspects I have a very hard family situation, which I do - no message she still likes me as a friend etc. I can not look her that way, so our relationship is most probably over, but like... 

If you don't want to me to stay friends (never reached out after she told me no), if you don't like me as a boyfriend, why would you start interacting at all? Both then and now? Especially since she obviously guessed I have feelings for her. 

I feel both confused, hurt, and like cheated. 

There were girls who were interested in me during college and I saw with my bare eyes she took me under her wing and ran them off. She started interacting with me again, she told me about some mental problems she had and liked the way I listened and accepted them, although I was pretty surprised to hear about them. 

And now she just gave me a hard NO and does not even bother to reach out and ask how I feel. 

I am so confused because I both like he as a female and a person, and dislike her because of the way she is handling this, and planning to get her over as quickly as I can since this is not going anywhere, and not realising what the fuck is happening besides her obviously saying NO (I still hear her voice in my head). 

I got friendzoned, right, or what? 

What should I do?",15Mar2020,1

337,"Background, I’ve know these ppl since elementary school and have been (what I thought was best friends) with them all years since then. Well 2 years ago I was constantly trying to get into contact with 2 of them (who we will call A and T) I was texting and snap chatting to try and meet up or just talk you know things that friends do. It’s not like I was texting them every month and I also would ask if they had work or school so we could work around that just trying to hang out (up until this point we were good and would text like normal best friends did after school ended) &amp; sometimes they wouldn’t even reply and if they did it was like one sentence I thought this was odd behavior and felt like I was bothering them (mostly cause I was going threw tough times I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety) so I stopped but I would still see them hanging out with each other and posting on their social media’s and it hurt like ouch they didn’t even invite me ( this was going on even before they stopped talking to me). This really upset me because we use to be best friends and to be excluded was harsh. Eventually I tried once again to get into contact and A eventually started replying and it progressed from then. Well the other day I went over to T’s house and another third friend of ours (that we will call S) our other best friend was showing me a picture of all of them hanging out and was like you should of been their and then S was like this was before we started hanging out with you and T was like we didn’t even invite her. They were basically suggesting that the fault was on my side that I was the one that was distant with them and basically referring to me like I wasn’t their best friend throughout all our school years &amp; this is what bugs me because I tried my damn hardest to get in contact I was going threw the harshest time in my life I felt so alone and all I wanted was my friends to be their like I was their for them. I’m not mad at S because I never tried to get into contact with them but I tried my hardest with the other 2 and their all part of this group so if I was to stop talking to one of them I would be essentially cutting them all off.

I lived with this guy for 4 years, recently in the last 6 months we have definitely had our last straws with each other. He has made a point to kinda fuck me over when he would get the chance. 


I have know he was secretly gay for awhile due to accidentally coming across his search history, however it was validated when our mutual friend has discovered a male lover and confided this to me.


He currently has  girlfriend, that does not know he cheats on her with both men and women. 

My problem is idk if I should talk to him about this because more and more people are starting to find out (12 or so) and he can become mentally unstable and do stupid things, possibly harm himself if he were to have his life be outed by the wrong person. (Another teammate)


I don’t care for him as a friend anymore due to his very selfish actions and ways he has treated me over the years, but I feel like I owe It to him to give him an idea what’s going on since many people I care about would not do well if anything happened to him.


 I also feel like it is not my place and shouldn’t come from me because our current standing with each other.

Within days of knowing him, I felt bad for him because whenever we'd go out to eat, he'd go to the bathroom pretty soon after, sometimes staying for a long time.

Sometimes when we ride in the same car I notice he smells a little off too. Then recently we went out. He had something to eat and we went out for karaoke. He kept ordering water and then two or three times went off to the bathroom. That's when I noticed how *thin* he'd become since I'd met him. And I wondered if I'd been missing something.

341,"So I feel like the company I work for is not doing enough regarding the situation. I am an engineer for a global electrical company, specifically working at one of our plants in the US. 

I, along with a lot of our office, have the ability to work from home. But we’re limited to 6 days per year in efforts to try and be at the office to support the factory floor workers on the orders we engineer. 

It would seem at this time, they would understand that unless we start closing things now we will end up like Italy and have to close later. I feel confident that my company can afford to pay the factory workers who can’t work from home for a 2 to 4 week period. At the very least, those who can WFH should be doing so now. But we aren’t. AND we’re still having meetings in person at the office with close contact. This is in an area that is right outside the metro area of a major city with around 25 confirmed cases. The protocol is basically unless someone at our office is infected or government requires shutdown, it’s work as normal. Supervisors and even our safety lead discuss this as not being as serious as the flu in order to downplay. Company wide policy being put out doesn’t talk about how they’re paying people if closed but puts emphasis on what we can and can’t share on social media.

342,"Reddit: Would you forgive your friend?

Just to warn in advance, this is going to be a lengthy question/story.

About two years ago, my spouse and three kids and I purchased a new home in a little bit more of a rural area than I’d have liked (have always considered myself city-folk). We didn’t know anyone else that lived in this city, and it was a good 30+ minute drive from where we worked, but we could get a lot more house for our dollar the further out we went. As soon as we moved in, we immediately befriended two sets of neighbors; a younger-than-us couple who had no kids, and then a family down the street who had five kids of their own, all in very close age range to ours. The couple, Sarah &amp; Jeff, were our first friends in the neighborhood. Sarah had added me on Facebook as soon as we moved in, before we’d even met them face to face, and we came to find out that we had mutual childhood friends. The couple with the five children, Brittany and Chad, we came to be close friends with once their kids and ours started to play with one another, considering it was summertime when we moved in and all of our kids were outside often. While we became good friends with both of these couples, they did not know each other well at all. Surprisingly, although both couples had lived in the neighborhood for about a year before my spouse and I moved in, they had never spoken with one another or met. 
The third couple involved in this situation, Christine and Caleb, lived somewhat behind my spouse and I. Christine and Caleb had come over to introduce themselves to us the day we moved in. Of anyone we met in the neighborhood, they were the most off putting, though. Upon their first introduction to us (the day we moved in), they had spoken badly about various neighbors we had not met, and that was a bit odd, so we had already had a bad taste in our mouths regarding them, but they had two children that were similar in ages to two of our children. 
So for the first three months after we had moved into the neighborhood, we maintained close but separate relationships with both Sarah &amp; Jeff, and Brittany &amp; Chad. Separately, Christine &amp; Caleb were good friends with Sarah &amp; Jeff. With Christine &amp; Caleb, we waved to each other when we would drive in and out of the neighborhood, and our kids would go over to play with theirs once in a while. For some reason, they did not ever let their kids come over to play with ours, and despite it being summertime, they rarely let their kids play outside. Anytime our kids wanted to go over and play with theirs, it could only be inside their house. While odd, we didn’t think a ton of it. I had at one point maybe two months into living there, had asked both Sarah and Brittany separately about it - Sarah told me that Christine and Caleb were both just “very protective of their kids”, and Brittany had told me that she and Christine actually did not get along. 
Within the first three months of us living there, we had had a few bon fires with Christine and Caleb and their kids here and there, and Christine had invited me to join a “moms” group on Facebook, so we chatted quite often on there and via Facebook and text. I thought she was very gossipy and rude, so I decided early on I wasn’t going to get close with her, but would be cordial. One day, about three months after we had moved in, my husband had left for the grocery store (which was roughly one block from our house), and I doing some cleaning between the front porch and the foyer with the front door open, with our three kids (ages 5, 7, and 9), and two of Brittany &amp; Chad’s kids playing in our front yard, had two police cars pull into our driveway. I asked what was going on, and the two police officers had said that “a concerned neighbor called for a wellness check because they saw our kids playing outside with no adult supervision”. My children had never had any interaction with police before, started crying thinking their mom was being arrested... has still scarred my son to this day. The police were incredibly kind and apologetic, saying that it was obvious there was adult supervision, and that they had to respond to every call like that. Now, at this moment in time, I already knew it was Christine that had called the police. Despite being friendly with her and Caleb, Brittany had told me prior to that, that the majority of the neighborhood had at one point in time had the police called on them for something incredibly asinine by Christine. However, my spouse and I really considered Christine and Caleb well enough acquaintances/friends, that we would’ve thought if they really thought our kids were in harms way for some reason, that they’d just walk over to our house and come talk to us. They couldn’t see our front yard from their house, as their backyard kind of kiddie-corner backed up to our backyard, so you could only see the back of our house and our backyard from their backyard. So they wouldn’t be able to see if someone (myself) was on the front porch. So while I had my suspicion it was Christine who had called the police, I decided to try to give her the benefit of the doubt and I texted her saying, “you will never guess what just happened! Someone in the neighborhood called the police on us saying that our kids weren’t being supervised, even though I was on the front freaking porch!” She responded faux-shocked, only asking what the police said. I told her they apologized profusely and said that we “apparently had a busy-body neighbor”. She went so far as to say “oh my gosh if someone did that to us I’d go knock on every door to find out who it was!” 
Anyways, long story short - a few days later my spouse and I confronted her and Caleb, they finally admitted to it, they stood by what they did, and they turned out to be literally insane people. A few weeks after the police incident, they put up a swimming pool in their backyard but I guess it was too close to their property line by city standards and the city came out and made them take it down, so the next day they called the police on us AGAIN and claimed that we made an anonymous tip to the City about their swimming pool. 1. We didn’t. 2. The police were like “even if they did, your pool was violating city code and a safety hazard and there’s nothing we can do about it”. At this point we realized they were insane, and we blocked their phone numbers and social media accounts. A few weeks later, Christine got into it with yet another neighbor who lived down the street, who I did not know and had never met, whose name was Hannah. Apparently Hannah and her got into it via Facebook, and for some god forsaken reason, Christine called the police for a third time and claimed that *I* was the person behind Hannah’s Facebook account, and that I was “using fake social media accounts to harass her”. She had literally met Hannah in person several times, and knew that Hannah was indeed a real person, and not someone I had ever met. It was at this point my spouse and I decided to take out a harassment restraining order against Christine and Caleb. In doing so, we went to the police station to request all of the police reports they had filed against anyone, or any times they had called the police, in the last two years (the amount of time they’d lived in the neighborhood). They had called the police THIRTY FOUR TIMES in 24 months, and that was only the times that they didn’t call anonymously. Because police reports are public record, we were able to gain a copy of them all, and the reasons these two insane people called the cops on neighbors were absolutely asinine. Anyway, we were granted the HRO after having to go to court with them, and utilizing Brittany and Chad as witnesses. Sarah &amp; Jeff stopped being friends with Christine and Caleb as well after seeing how insane they were. 

Fast forward about 6 months or so. At this point, Brittany and I are really good friends, and my husband and Chad are really good friends. Their kids are bff’s with our kids, we spend a lot of time with them, hang out a lot, have bon fires, kids are in sports together, etc. 
Sarah &amp; Jeff are still friends of ours, not super close or anything, but friendly. In this time, Sarah gets pregnant and has her baby at 6 months. The baby is healthy after spending a few months in the hospital, Sarah &amp; Jeff are doing well. Everyone still thinks Christine and Caleb are freaking insane, as they still do insane things like drive past all of our houses numerous times a day, they leave gifts on Sarah &amp; Jeff’s doorstep for the baby and Christmas gifts when Sarah and Jeff have made it abundantly clear to to them they do not want anything to do with them anymore, etc.
Once we’ve been living there about a year, we decide that we just are not rural folk and want to move back to the city. While it’s a tough decision, because we love all of our other neighbors other than Christine and Caleb, the school is awful and we want to move back. It’s a little tough on our kids and on Brittany &amp; Chad’s kids because they’ve become so close in the last year, but I had recently gotten Chad a job with my company, and we were only moving about 30 minutes away, and Brittany and Chad were making the decision to homeschool their kids now, so we were able to promise our kids they would still see Brittany and Chad’s kids.
A little piece of backstory on Sarah &amp; Jeff, is that they used to be body builders. While they are no longer competing body builders, they are still the type of people that go to the gym every day of the week, sometimes twice a day. Sarah is someone who the way her body looks, is her entirety of who she is as a person. It’s all she posts on social media about, all day every day, is her body and what workouts she’s doing. She’s someone who bragged about being “back in her pre-baby jeans 6 days after birth”. Which is all fine and well, it takes all kinds of kinds. 
Brittany, however, was not the same kind of person. However, Brittany was still in good shape, and beautiful. But Brittany had terrible self esteem issues. She talked often about comparing herself to others, losing her baby weight, being obsessed with carbs this, grams of sugar that, talked often about how much weight she felt she needed to lose, and spoke down on herself often. 
A few days after my husband and kids and I moved, Brittany texted me saying she had seen Sarah running in the neighborhood, and Brittany went on this hour long rant about how she wishes she could look like Sarah, and that it’s not fair that Sarah looks so good immediately after having a baby (Brittany had also had her baby about two months after Sarah, except that Sarah’s baby was 3 months early and Brittany’s baby was full term). I got so fed up with Brittany being so down on herself so constantly (almost to an obsessive point), that I told Brittany of course that she was beautiful and that she didn’t need to lose a pound, I reminded her that Sarah had her baby three months early and that’s why she was able to drop her baby weight so quickly, and that she really needed to stop comparing herself constantly to Sarah. Brittany continued on. Now this is where I made a mistake. I was apparently stupid enough to trust Brittany enough to tell her that I felt that while yes Sarah was very fit and athletic and skimmed down quickly after having her baby, but that I didn’t think it was healthy for Brittany to compare herself to Sarah all the time because I worried that Sarah might actually have some disordered eating habits. Part of me really did feel this way - the way Sarah obsesses about her body and it’s all she talks about and posts on social media about, a part of me genuinely did worry about her having some sort of disorder. Whether that was some disordered eating habits or some form of body-dysmorphia or something. But part of me also said this to Brittany so that she would just stop comparing herself to Sarah constantly. The way Brittany constantly compared herself to Sarah was bordering on disordered itself. I felt that Brittany and I were close enough friends that I could be that candid with her.

The next day, Sarah went on a flurry of a rant on social media about how she “heard a jealous woman thinks she has an eating disorder and that just because other women are unhappy with themselves doesn’t mean she has an eating disorder and women are constantly out to destroy her”. While I initially nearly swallowed my tongue because I was like there is no way that this is just a coincidence, in the next breath I felt fine because I was like, Brittany doesn’t even talk to Sarah, I can’t even imagine a scenario in which Brittany would even run into Sarah in the last 12 hours and have a discussion about this, nor would Brittany do that to me. So I took a few screenshots of Sarah’s social media rant, sent it to Brittany, and I said, “I know that this can’t possibly be about me because you don’t even talk to Sarah, but talk about timing and coincidence haha”.
About 12 hours later, Brittany finally texts me back and says “oh my god I feel like the worlds biggest ass right now, I can’t believe it got back to her, I’m so sorry..” I’m like “wait what? What are you talking about? When did you even talk to Sarah and why would this have even come up??” She then tells me that while her and I were texting the night before, that she “had a few friends over and were drinking and was talking about what I said and someone who knows Sarah must’ve told her”. I asked her why she would even tell anyone I said that, especially people I didn’t even know (I don’t know any of Brittany’s friends). She then finally tells me that CHRISTINE of all people, was over there. First she tells me that Christine was only there to pick up her kids because her kids were over playing with Brittany’s kids. I tell her that I know that’s not true because Christine doesn’t let her kids over to play with other kids. Then she tells me well Christine was actually dropping Brittany’s kids off back at home because Brittany’s kids were playing over at Christines house. I say, “if she were just dropping them off, how in the world did she stay long enough to overhear you start an entire conversation about Sarah, and how in the world would that not have been intentional considering you know Christine has been trying for how long to get Sarah to talk to her? Not to mention I have a freaking harassment restraining order against Christine and she would just revel in the fact of knowing I said something ill about Sarah?!” Brittany apologized, tried to play the victim and said she was a “shit person and didn’t know what the hell she was thinking”. I basically just said to her I felt incredibly betrayed and that I would’ve never in a million years thought that not only would she think so little of me as to openly talk about what I said about Sarah, but that I never in a million years thought she thought so little of me to wait until I moved and then all of a sudden befriend the person I have a harassment restraining order against. And then that what she really did was selfish because now my daughter and her daughter will no longer be friends, and they were inseparable best friends. I ended up just simply blocking her phone number and blocking her on all social media. 
I of course immediately profusely apologized to Sarah. I told her that only a very small part of me felt that she had some issues around body image and eating, and that my thoughts were rooted in concern, not jealousy or malice in talking about her behind her back. I told her about Brittany’s constant comparing herself to her every time she saw her in the neighborhood and that I just couldn’t handle it anymore so I thought if I told Brittany that Sarah wasn’t exactly healthy about how she gets on with her body, that maybe she would stop obsessing. Sarah very reluctantly accepted my apology, but we’ve barely spoken since. This situation happened about almost a year ago now. I have not spoken to Brittany since. My husband and Chad are still friends who see each other once in a while. I’ve also come to realize that I don’t think Brittany has ever told Chad that we fell out and haven’t spoken since, because like I said I got Chad a job at my company and when I see him every once in a while, he talks about us all getting together as if he has no idea that Brittany and I don’t speak.

So it’s come down to this: my kids ask constantly about Brittany and Chad’s kids, and Chad just recently texted me a few days ago asking about all of us getting together. While I don’t do this drama sh*t, and I’m one who tends to just let things go, I feel like I can’t trust Brittany and will never be able to. Not only did she do it all to begin with, but then she tried to lie about it a few times. I still don’t think she’s told me the total truth about the situation. Do I unblock her number and reach out to her and say “listen, our kids miss each other and we’re bound to eventually see each other, let’s either discuss what happened or get over it for their sake”, or do I continue on having written her off and just let my husband take my kids to go hang out with theirs without me and never think about it again? This is about the only dramatic situation I’ve found myself in since about college 15+ years ago, so I can’t decide how to navigate.",15Mar2020,1

She’s constantly calling him asking him where he’s at, if he’s not home by 9 pm she’s calling him to see when he’s coming home because “it’s bed time soon.” EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS! When we’re leaving the house, she used to ask him these questions but she realized he was getting annoyed because he started answering with “none of your business” so now, instead she asks ME. Because she knows I’m not going to be rude. And it’s not just one or two questions, she asks a million. “Where are you going, what are you gonna be doing, who are you gonna be with, Dont you think it’s kinda late to be going out, when are you gonna be coming home” sooooo many questions. And it’s not just this. She asks me all these personal questions about my boyfriends business because she knows he’ll get mad for her being in his business. Me and my boyfriend never get alone time together, and everyone is always in the living room watching tv, so when everyone’s in bed we go downstairs and sit in the living room to watch tv and hang out, which she knows btw. Now we can’t even do that because we’re sitting here at 3 am watching tv and she decides to come up and sit in the living room with us so we can’t have any privacy.

Recently a kid from our old high school has decided to harass Ally. Even going to the lengths of creating a fake memorial service for a friend who isn’t even dead claiming they are. The harasser has fake phone numbers and has somehow gotten pictures of our IDs. He sent out a mass text of people saying “sending this it’s proof that it’s me” (the id) and trying to get everyone to meet him. A lot of people got in contact with the real ally but some people are just going with it blindly. We’ve filed a police report. The police say they can’t do much. We know 100% friend is alive and doesn’t know what’s going on. 

Right now the harasser is sending out new mass messages under the “dead” friends account saying Ally has child pornography. 
He texts non stop, even calls. He’s made threatening messages in the past saying “I’d hate for you and your friends to end up dead like said friend” We don’t know why he’s chosen ally they never spoke plus harasser moved schools after one school year. 

He’s banned from our campus but i’m fearing for my life and Ally’s. He claims this is funny and a joke to him and has no plans of stopping.

357,"Writing on mobile, so wouldn't even know if formatting is off. Sorry. 

Just like in any other country, my country has started to report higher number of cases, maybe due to increase in the number of tests etc. They weren't taking it seriously a week ago, when it wasn't in our country yet. They had plans to travel by train across the country and what not. But now they are following the news and understanding the severity of the situation. They have several other age related health problems and they go behind our (me and my sibling who stay out of the city) backs and take risks and do things that is generally considered not wise at their age (no regards for dietary restrictions or eating and sleeping time after being diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, dad still chews tobacco after getting hospitalized once a month for pancreatitis, etc). They have gotten to a point where we have to be extremely vigilant, without letting them know, or else we don't get to know what they are doing.

With the Covid19, I belong to a state which typically doesn't report pandemic cases or deaths due to political reasons. The number of confirmed cases is in 100s now, which means it's a matter of time before people near us get it. Only way I see to avoid it is staying at home in isolation. But guess what, my dad *has to* go out everyday at least once. He does not believe in sanitizing his phone/purse or washing hands immediately after coming home or general practices which have been considered safe.

I am sitting at home now, working from home, playing spy to check on my parents.

I am out of my mind, he is too adamant to understand, and it just increases with age, and he influences my mom. If we request anything of them, which sounds restrictive it become forbidden fruit for him.

I was best friends with a girl who was my ex fiancés sister. He cheated on me and emotionally abused me for three years and she supported me through the breakup. Fast forward months later, I am with someone new and get pregnant randomly. She doesn’t seem to care much, which is fine, but out of the blue sends me a video of a woman sobbing over a miscarriage. No education, no context, just a sad video that my ex friend claimed was to help educate me on what could happen. I was very upset by it and my boyfriend ended up calmly explaining to her how that was kinda low key inappropriate and she absolutely flipped out. She told me I was being immature, which I later apologized for, and ended the friendship of three years. I was hurt by the video but more hurt by the end of a friendship over something so small so I apologized for months, and only got ghosted. My ex fiancé ended up dating the girl he was cheating on me with and my ex best friend became besties with her after our fallout. I tried not to be too hurt but it ate at me for some stupid reason. Years ago I had relations with a guy who messed with my head and guilted me a lot for not staying with him, and my ex friend knew of this.

364,"Hi all, I'm sorry in advance as I know there are many questions about this. 

I live in Canada, and am considered immunocompromised - plus I have asthma and am pregnant. A family member visited England for a few weeks and came back on or around Feb. 23. At the time, things did not seem as severe as they are now, so we were just thinking ""be mindful of symptoms"". They seemed fine and visited me on March 7. This would have been around day 12 if the 2-14 day incubation period mentioned. Everyone seemed fine and healthy before and after this.

That family member mentioned on March 13 that they had upset stomach/diarrhea and were feeling tired, unsure if it was something they ate. I understand upset stomach is considered a rare symptom, but given their travel (now more than 14 days ago) is there a chance this is COVID and that I may have been exposed to it??

Also, a relative went shopping on March 13 when everyone was rampaging grocery stores for toilet paper and other stuff - lines of 40+ people per cashier, crowded store - do I have to worry about seeing that relative this week??

366,"So I bought this necklace for a girl I have been seeing for quite some time. She is very special to me, and we said to each other that it’s a gift of God that brought us together, since for both of us we were talking to other people and it seemed for each of us, we could not grab a connection until we met each other and it’s been great ever since.

So since she lives in another city that’s about 6 hours away from me, when I am heading back home to see my family, I would usually go see her and then drive an extra 2 hours to go see my family, instead of just driving 6 hours to see my family every time I go back home. I thought as a gift when I see her, I would get her something nice. So I was looking up necklaces and I saw this one with the word “God” not in English on it, but it looks cute, it’s heart shaped and you can open it. I decided to buy it but after a few hours I had buyers remorse so I requested to return it, but the seller already shipped it out so it was too late but I could still return it now since I received it.

But now that I have it, I don’t know if it’s a good gift or it’s a tacky gift for a girl. I wanted to find a necklace with her name on it but there doesn’t exist one with the same quality as this one I got, also I paid a little more money for this one too.

So recently I’ve been having some very intense dreams, and one I had a few nights ago bought up a flood of memories from High School, and I suddenly remembered how much of a bully I was. 

I grew up in a pretty bad household, my parents chose alcohol over me frequently which resulted in me trying to seek attention elsewhere, wherever and however I could, which wound up me becoming a path a logical liar, and just treating people in an awful way. 

There was this girl I knew and I ended up making her life hell. She’d done nothing wrong to me until I treated her bad. I made fun of her name, the way she looked, and set her up for failure multiple times for my own mental satisfaction. I wasn’t the only one who bullied her, but I definitely didn’t help. I was supposed to me her friend and I let her down. 

I totally turned my life around at the age of 19. Stopped lying as much as I could, went to counselling, and started to become a much nicer person. I can honestly say I’m a completely different person now to how I used to be, but I can’t stop thinking about how poorly I treated people/this person. It’s eating me up inside knowing I was once like that, and that that’s someone’s opinion of me

throwaway, obviously.

im the stereotypical gay (cis male) kid. friends with all the girls, kinda popular, dresses fancy, has the gay voice... you get the drift.

despite all the stereotypes ive insisted on heterosexuality. ive only really liked girls (one of which im trying to ask out) and ive tried my best to stay like that.

however i have been having an increasing amount of thoughts about what it would be like to date a guy etc. and im fine with having them at the time but later i realise 'ah no, that's gay'.

its not like ive got any thing against gay people, i have numerous LGBT friends and try to actively support the group's at school fundraisers, parades etc.

but idk man I just don't want to be bi. i don't want to feel like other people knew me more than i did, or that ive fallen right into the stereotype everyone put me in. when im older I want to marry a loving woman and have kids, raise a family. but the feelings and thoughts towards relationship with the same gender are hard to ignore and it pains me. 

it's really hard to explain but yeah. i don't want to be the lgbt boy. i don't want that to be me. but i also don't want to lie to myself anymore. i just kinda wish i was 100% straight. it's a horrible thing to wish but life would be so easier if it was. but i don't think I am and i don't know how to accept that.

There's this girl who seems to be like the Class Rep's bestie and well, idk that well if she really is into me or she just likes teasing me, i just came to notice it recently and well... she has had complimented me in many ways [the very first time as i recall was when i hugged her after she cried (i just don't like to see people being deppresed, sad, or crying, i feel like i need to help in some way) after i hugged her while we were seppararing she told me i smelled good (it might be obvious since i put some type of fragance before i go somewhere (no exercise related), but that caught me out of guard), once she tried take me a pic but i said no cuz i said i'm ugly and she told me that i'm actually pretty attractive; she even once told me i have quite booty (even though i stopped working out 1 and a half year ago), and recently she started by calling me out like OUT LOUD by ""handsome""], the other day a male friend of our class and the classrep were talking bout ex's and my friend as a joke told her he was her ex and she said no, but i could apply/count as one; about a week and a half ago she started to get clingy and asked me if i was bothered by it, i said no since i am used to loving female friends who are, but it came to the point she was resting her head on my shoulder while in class, and outside of class she wrapped herself around my arm, yesterday she touched my back while saying goodbye; sometimes she calls me out just so i stand in front on her and she opens more her eyes (i haven't payed attention to her pupil though) as if contemplating my height (even though i'm just 5'10 1/2"", i'm estimating she's about 5'4""). I don't really know if to trust her since there was a girl who met me in my prime physique who got as clingy as her (That other girl even asked me my number) happened to be all cute with me but ended up that she just tried to play with me. Another girl who had a crush on me, i didn't noticed her feelings until a year later, ended up hating me and talking trash about me, still makes me feel bad cuz i developed feelings for her but i couldn't tell her; so if this new girl really happens to like me, how do i reject someone without them hating me and without being a cruel asshole?

I'm in a group which estimates me for either my knowledge or my physique, to the level almost everyone who came to know that i've never had a gf and was once rejected, were surprised, i'm trying to not make enemies on anyone even on other groups and just being as nice as i can.

There's this girl who seems to be like the Class Rep's bestie and well, idk that well if she really is into me or she just likes teasing me, i just came to notice it recently and well... she has had complimented me in many ways [the very first time as i recall was when i hugged her after she cried (i just don't like to see people being deppresed, sad, or crying, i feel like i need to help in some way) after i hugged her while we were seppararing she told me i smelled good (it might be obvious since i put some type of fragance before i go somewhere (no exercise related), but that caught me out of guard), once she tried take me a pic but i said no cuz i said i'm ugly and she told me that i'm actually pretty attractive; she even once told me i have quite booty (even though i stopped working out 1 and a half year ago), and recently she started by calling me out like OUT LOUD by ""handsome""], the other day a male friend of our class and the classrep were talking bout ex's and my friend as a joke told her he was her ex and she said no, but i could apply/count as one; about a week and a half ago she started to get clingy and asked me if i was bothered by it, i said no since i am used to loving female friends who are, but it came to the point she was resting her head on my shoulder while in class, and outside of class she wrapped herself around my arm, yesterday she touched my back while saying goodbye; sometimes she calls me out just so i stand in front on her and she opens more her eyes (i haven't payed attention to her pupil though) as if contemplating my height (even though i'm just 5'10 1/2"", i'm estimating she's about 5'4""). I don't really know if to trust her since there was a girl who met me in my prime physique who got as clingy as her (That other girl even asked me my number) happened to be all cute with me but ended up that she just tried to play with me. Another girl who had a crush on me, i didn't noticed her feelings until a year later, ended up hating me and talking trash about me, still makes me feel bad cuz i developed feelings for her but i couldn't tell her; so if this new girl really happens to like me, how do i reject someone without them hating me and without being a cruel asshole? I know the feeling of getting straight up rejected so i don't want to crush anyone's feelings, i've trust issues aswell and i just don't feel like in the mood of being in a relationship rn.

P.S.: Sorry for that such long script but i felt lke i needed to let it out

Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. For reference, we’re all from California. I’m a college student.

There’s a lot to unpack. I (24f) dated someone I met on Tinder (24m) for a few months. It was a short relationship but it was really intense. It didn’t work out, and we broke up.

I met my current boyfriend (27m) when I was with my ex. I knew he was into me, but I didn’t act on it for obvious reasons. I liked him a little bit but not enough to break up with my ex over. 

When my ex and I broke up, we decided to be friends after we had the chance to process the breakup and get over eachother. I didn’t see him for almost a year, but we eventually reconciled and became really good friends. We’ve been friends for more than two years now. 

Meanwhile my attraction to my current boyfriend continued to grow. I asked my boyfriend out and he said yes. So when my ex and I reconciled I was already with my boyfriend and my ex was happy for us. My ex was dating around at this point and I was happy for every date he went on but he was having a little trouble getting second dates and he was feeling sad about it.

So I had the brilliant (sarcasm) idea to introduce him to my other friends, including my boyfriend. I introduced him and they folded him in right away. My boyfriend and my ex hit it off and they’re friends now. 

My ex brought the friend group to a spot by the ocean that he frequently brought me to when we were dating. And my ex and I had the time of our lives at this spot (when we were dating, to clarify.) At this spot was when we first had sex and when I told him I loved him.

Being back to that spot flooded my memories with what happened there. And I fell for my ex that day. 

I’m really scared and overwhelmed with these feelings. I’ve never wanted to get back with my ex. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years and I love him with all my heart. We’ve been through everything together and I’m certain that this is the man I want to marry. But I can’t shake the feelings I have for my ex. What do I do?",15Mar2020,1
381,"I'm a team leader and there is one member of my team who keeps speaking for me. When someone comes to discuss something with me, he'll stop his work and join in the conversation.  If someone calls out to me with a question, he'll answer. If my manager walks up to my desk to get a status, he'll answer for me and I have to wrestle to have my say. If someone calls me to their desk to discuss something,  he will follow.
 I'm finding it suffocating and need to establish boundaries with him.  

P.s. He is a nice guy and I know he doesn't  have any ulterior motive, its just a bad habit.

How do I handle it?",15Mar2020,1
382,"So, I’m in 7th grade and I don’t really see the point of dating while I’m in middle school. However, my best friend decided to finally have her first boyfriend. She seemed really happy at first, so I didn’t mind how much of an asshole he was to the rest of us. 

He just got more and more horrible to her over the months. Calling her a bitch right to her face and pressuring her, just overall making her upset. And when confronted about anything wrong he’s ever done. He brushes it off as if it was justified, and just demeans me and my friends if we bring it up. It’s gotten to the point where I think he literally has no regard for anything or anybody.

But lately, my best friend has been crying a lot to me because of this issue; recently a school dance came up and she was going because she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend. Throughout the night he was constantly pressuring her to kiss him, acting as if he was entitled to it and making her feel guilty because she didn’t, he gave her dirty glances and started saying stuff like “I spent 200 dollars on this suit and you’re not even going to kiss me?”. The next day, she called me crying and said that she tried to apologize to him over and over that she just wasn’t comfortable or ready for that. But when he called her, she had to go to sleep. So he took that as a sign that she was ignoring him, so he was extremely cold to her and ignoring every apology she sent him. I, obviously, kept advising the idea she should break up with him. But I’m inexperienced in this area so I need help on how I should word this, or what I should say to her.",15Mar2020,1
384,So we (17f)  went to visit my boyfriend's (18m) sister and husband and her two sons because they are moving away in about 2 weeks. They mentioned that the older one (8) was sick and now the younger one (2) has a snotty nose and I said it was up to him if we went because it is his family. So we went and then as usual he forgot about us and didn't really talk to us or pay us attention. Then I asked him a few times to hold our daughter and when he did he didn't pay attention and the younger boy came and wiped a booger on our baby's head. I should mention the younger one is a bit of a terror toddler as he was always spoiled and they never told him off or gave him consequences for his actions. So anytime I ask him to do something he ignores me but he listens to my boyfriend. Anyway so he wiped a booger on her and I quietly went a bit ballistic at my partner and whisper yelled at him to pay attention and stop that sort of stuff from happening while we wiped it off. And then he kept talking and the kid kept sitting super close and touching her. (He had been told multiple times to stay away but the parents were on the deck having a smoke) and so I took her off him to get her away and then the kid came over and coughed in mine and the baby's face like 3 times and my partner still didn't even notice or do anything. I talked to him about it that night and he said sorry half heartedly but doesnt seem to really care. And now I'm sick and I think our baby is too and I'm really mad at him and he's saying that I'm being stupid for blaming him for us getting sick. AITA for blaming him?,15Mar2020,1
385,"Hi everybody, I went to a school dance last night with a lovely girl, everything was going great until we got to the after party at a nightclub. I'm not very big on nightclubs but I was happy to go because she wanted to go. When we got in the floor was sticky and the atmosphere was very hot, we tried to dance but I gave up when I kept getting pushed around. I sat down on one of the couches trying to relax. She went back to dance. After a few minutes I had decided that I had had enough and was leaving. I said goodbye to two of my friends but I couldn't find her anywhere. I gave instructions to my friends to look after her after I had left. I woke up this morning feeling absolutely terrible about what I did.

387,"My partner has severe PTSD and he has super frequent night terrors (I'm talking like 5 nights a week at LEAST). He lashes out in his sleep and I usually take the brunt of it. Typically I tell him in the morning what went down. Lately though his night terror outbursts have been getting pretty bad. He won't wake up and he'll just keep doing whatever his subconscious instinct is telling him to (which usually involves hitting me or pinning me down because he thinks I'm his abuser).

 I've also noticed that he has been distancing himself more recently and I'm certain it is because he feels guilty. We have been together for almost a year, we communicate about this (mental illness issues) ((and everything else)) effectively. 

I love him to an insane degree and we are both on the same page ( personal growth wise, as well as our future goals). We work very hard to keep constant open and clear communication so that is not the issue. 


I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to reassure him that I know it's not intentional, and that I harbor no harshness or animosity towards him for anything that happens because of flashbacks, as well as maybe some calming techniques for people that have severe PTSD. 

(If it matters I also have severe PTSD, for completely different reasons, and our symptoms often manifest in different ways. He also understands this and supports me in every possible way. We have a great relationship, I'm just lost and need help finding new ((better?)) ways to reassure him that I'm in this for the long haul and I'm not upset with his subconscious actions.)

Side note: he has other PTSD related outbursts during his waking hours but he is more concious and contemplative of his reactions when he is concious. This is something we constantly communicate about and work through on a situation by situation basis. He is exceptionally receptive to suggestions and coping mechanisms while he is awake, it is only the unconscious responses that are an issue.",15Mar2020,1

397,"So the situation is as follows, I (18F) am living at home with my parents. We have all expressed concerns about the position my grandfather is in right now. My grandmother died from dementia about 5 years ago now, and not too long after, my grandfather (in his 80s) found someone else who's in her 70s. Let's call her Val. 

Val has displayed controlling behaviour towards him, which is not a new character trait of hers as it surfaced that she had previously thrown boiling water over her last husband (also an elderly man). I suspect she has mental health problems as she is very restrictive about what kinds of food she eats and at what time, and as a consequence, lives almost exclusively on a diet of fruit and vegetables. Any other food she eats will be a tiny portion size that would not even sustain a small animal. Surprisingly, she is healthy and can still run even at her age (perhaps owing to all the vitamin supplements she takes?). 

She also has other violent tendencies towards animals, but that's not the main subject of this post. My concern is that she, the owner of a large farm, puts my grandfather to work outside a lot of the time, something that he also enjoys. However, he cannot be sustained on the food that she provides for him (the same portions and food as she serves herself) as he is male, and also doing labour, both of which require him to eat more. He cannot get his own food as she does not often allow him out of the house. Sometimes, on the rare occasion she lets him go to the supermarket to do errands for her, he buys some meat or cheese, however if she sees them she will dispose of them. When he is allowed to family outings, she will be next to him carefully controlling his food intake. 

It is only when Val permits him that he is allowed to go places of his own free will, so he used to come to us (his family members) for a large warm meal whenever he was allowed to, which was around once a week (but always had to be back before the time she set otherwise I presume there would be consequences). Needless to say she is also very controlling with money, and will turn the electricity supply off completely when there are no guests coming round, so it gets incredibly cold in the house. We buy thermal clothing for my grandfather, but she will throw them away if she finds out they are not his 'normal' clothes. Therefore we have to buy ones that look just like the clothes he wears already, so she can't tell the difference. 

She is a gold-digger, as although she already has a large amount of wealth stored away, she has changed my grandfather's hospital form so that she is his next of kin, his ""wife"", when they are not actually married. My family speculate that this is so that she can ""pull the plug"" if he is in a critical condition. She is also getting him (or has already) to change his will to leave everything to her.

As well as all this, now the Coronavirus has hit, she is now additionally not allowing him out of the house of his own free will, and this means the weekly visits are stopping. This means he is not getting enough nutrition to an even greater extent than the existing circumstances. 

My family constantly gossip about it with no intention of doing anything, it feels like they are seeing it as a bit of entertainment rather than a serious issue and I don't know what to do. I have talked to my mother about it and she said that there's nothing we can do because my grandfather is 'making his own choice' and is of a sound mind. I also feel trapped because if I did anything independently, I know my family would react badly and I'd get a lot of hate. I'm moving out officially on June 12th, but my biggest fear is that it might be too late to save him.",15Mar2020,1

401,"[sorry about the poor formatting, i’m on mobile but hopefully it doesn’t look too horrendous on web]

Hey guys! As you can see from the title from this post, I want to clear a few things up and tell you what I’m going through. (It may be long so read my TLDR on the bottom of the post).

I’m a 22 year old man who at first seemed very kind, positive and had a different perspective on life (or at least that’s what people thought of me). But lately I think I may have changed into someone I never thought i’d become. 

Just to get some background context, i’m a “devout Christian” and I have been going to church my whole life. I recently ran into a recent bout of doubt relating to my faith. As far as I know, I feel like I can no longer sustain a good and valuable Christian life (even though on the outside I take it all in stride and head to church every Sunday). To add to this point, I consider myself an “introvert” who is somewhat shy in certain situations (eg. conversing with people in crowded spaces, speaking in front of crowds, not being able to express myself and thoughts clearly) - basically being self conscious about the way I speak and come across to people.


I want to address 2 main issues in this post:

1. My shyness and how it’s affected my life

2. Current situation and how I conduct my life and “treat people” (where the subject in my post title comes in)


1. From the time I was a little kid, I will always remember being extremely shy. I was that one kid in class who got paired up with that other kid last because all the other kids would buddy up with their best friends before I could find a partner. Growing up, every time I got asked why I was shy, I would blush and barely mutter a word or just say ‘I don’t know’. For me, being asked that very question didn’t help but fuel my shyness even more because people noticed. As I grew into my teens, I felt a little more comfortable with myself and I slowly let go of my extreme shyness (although now it has translated into more of an awkward, introverted type). I feel my shyness as a kid set me back so much and as a result I am currently not happy with my life. I feel I have ruined all the possibilities of a good life because of how I let this one thing control me. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I was extremely shy, but even though I am less shy now, it has caused some side effects on me as a 22 year old. For the most part, I tend to overthink and my mind is riddled with endless thoughts and scenarios on how I’m not doing good enough/not good enough and overall just being negative about myself. I am extremely self conscious on how people see me and I usually overthink it and wonder if certain people hate me and such. I know it sounds simple but I feel like it’s such a burden and I feel like wanting out of my life/situation, running away and starting all over again. But with being a Christian it’s hard to have negative thoughts clash with my beliefs and I feel if I bail out of my faith I will let everyone I know down, my family and church family especially.

It hurts me to know I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I just want to give up everything and leave home for a new beginning elsewhere, but that’s where I’m at at the moment. Now this brings me to my second point...

2. I’m currently working full time, stopped studying for at least 2 years now and might be going back to Uni next semester. Right now I feel like a complete let down, I feel like i’ve become somewhat of a different person. I feel lazy and don’t know what to do with my life. Unmotivated, unwilling and full of empty promises, I always try to seek something that I want but I can never get past a roadblock - my thoughts. My thoughts have controlled my life and it has taken me to a lot of dark places.

Ok, so with all this being said, I feel like maybe I haven’t been doing a good job with how I “treat” people. Being a Christian, having a giving heart is one of the greatest assets one can have (give and you shall receive). I’ve had many people in my life give, help and be good to me and it seems I haven’t returned the favour. I feel like I am not doing a good enough job. Sometimes I feel like I’m busy with my life so i tend to forget those who were there for me or helped me in any way shape or form. I had my oldest sister scold me over the dinner table because apparently all I do is “receive” and not bother to give. Now I feel extremely guilty and I cried in bed because I felt so let down, that I wasn’t doing a proper job as a Christian. Was I bad for not being responsible? Am I somehow ungrateful? Am I selfish for being self serving? Was I rude? All these questions popped inside my head as my sister went on about the issue. Recently I’ve been saving my lunch money for work and she felt the need to mention why I don’t at least use some of it to buy something for someone that has given me money often. It has never popped in my mind to return the favour (as crazy as it sounds) i’d forget about those who helped me in what ever way. 

In one way I feel maybe I should be responsible as a Christian and sow a seed to those who helped me and in another way, my life has been hell for me (especially with my  mind) and I let it get in the way of me being a good person. I feel really fucking messed up and I don’t think I’m the type of person who likes to give - maybe because I’m awkward and shy and get social anxiety at times being around people, or maybe thats just a fucking excuse and I need to sort my shit out. 

Sorry if this post seems long and unnecessary but I felt I needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to comment and give some advice as I don’t know the best way to approach this. 

I appreciate all advice, and if you read all the way, thank you.",15Mar2020,1

My dad has memory and coordination issues due to advancing Parkinson's disease (doctor diagnosed, early onset), and my mom has compitsy issues (very easily confused/taken advantage of in some cases) due to past trauma and current stress associated to my dad (not medical y diagnosed, but noted by me), while I have general anxiety (GAD), severe asmah, and depression (Medically managed) due to all of this, and being unable to assist in general.

-History in a bit more detail-

*My dad*

He was a boiler operator for just short 30 years between two company's, till january 1st 2019. He was ""Forced"" retired from his position, due to complications from his condition (It's complicated to explain, but federal protections did not aid him in keeping the position) and since then, his Parkinson's has progressed quite rapidly, got into a heavy depression, been forced by his son and wife to stop driving, and gained a pretty large amount of weight.

*My mom*

She grew up with a very strongly ""bickering"" (arguing) mother and father, and had to deal with me growing up. I would obsess on food, OCD about it, spending cash I don't have, and was mis-medacated. She also had to cope with the knowledge of abuse by an older half brother, and her parents giving a lot more attention to her alcoholic sister.

*Me*

Gonna be rapid fire here, lots of fun

Abused when little (age 5 to 9ish), bullied in school, extremely closeted (pansexual, demi-romanitic) with many cover lies, weight gain, internalized depression, unsteady support system, near iddetic memory (hard to forgive), social awkwardness, severe asmah, anxiety, and a very logical view on the world.

-The issue-

My parents, as I can see, are in over their heads with life right now. To keep specifics out, I wrote a small contract (to which we all signed and we had noterized.) basically allowing me (since they panic when they call places like this, and can not handle being on hold) to make an estimated 20 min call to a govt agency to correct an issue on their end, that caused her to panic, (as I can see someone, a few years ago, obivously transcribed a number on a sheet incorrectly that makes it seem like they owe a good bit to an agency, which they don't/shouldn't.) about ""funds owed"" that would literally kill any savings they have. They need a new roof and have modifications made to our house for my dad, while they also need to replace his bed that he keeps nailing his shin on, and has difficulty getting out of (he needs a medical bed and the matress is almost as old as I am, lol)

Also, they refuse to even look at the healthcare marketplace (I got them to apply as a safety net, and they have an extended window), and they prefer to ""just pay $550"" for my dad and her. They spend money, they don't understand that can be cut and/or reduced, and then stress out about it all, which causes immense stress on me, because I love and care about them so much, it overwhelms me.

I have tried my best to inform them of charity's that can help them, financial aid on bills, charity pharmacys (my dad's medications, like my inhalers, are ungodly expensive, AFTER INSURANCE) and other services out there, but they ""Don't want to take advantage of those places, other people need them more."" while dad is on SSD, she barely makes anything, and bills still chip at savings. 

I want to help, but as a security guard, making $1050 a month, after taxes and insurance deductions, with $6000 of various debts from the shitty previous year, requiring about 40% of the monthly income just to cover my overhead in bills, even though I don't pay them anything to live here. 

I'm an hour from my job (Gas), constantly seeing my dad's condition get worse (We literally joke about his sleeplessness and falls, which are very small and the worst is a surface scrape, when he is lucid of course, as it is done ""lightheartedly"" with no actual offence, it's a coping mechinism), and I want to socialise with people/live a bit more than [SEDENTARY] at home, but half of my days off are helping them or trying to cope with the stress of all of this shit by going to church, playing games to distract me, or messing with my beardies/cat.

So, people of reddit, I'm at my wits end here. What can one kid (I'm actually 20, but feel like im 17 here by word, and 30 at work) do to help his dysfunctional family, or at least himself. I feel like a damn phycoligists here to prevent them from destroying themselves, as I have to mediate and also ""fight my fight"" too. It's fucking hard.

So please, help me with advice, if ya can. I don't know what the fuck to do.

*NOTE*

Before anybody responds, there are three things I can't do, for moral or personal reasons.

1. Dip in the middle of the night. I cant just abandon them.
2. Give up my bearded dragons and cat to move into a low income apt. They keep me sane, and out of depression. 
3. Help them more in ways than I already do. I can definitely reassess how much time I dedicate to any task or cut time to add one, but right now I help them clean and do minor labor (again, severe stress induced asmatic), and in some petty cash cases (I.E. buying a gallon of milk/eggs, driving my dad to an apt., changing a light bulb, etc) I don't ask for requop. I have to live too and in the past I overextended my offers of help to people (Not just them) and it shredded my mental health. So I set days/times that I lock down to be able to breathe, just enough for the next week.

Also, im going to bed very shortly after I post this, so likely I'll respond to whoever, whenever I wake up. Thank you.",15Mar2020,1
404,"About six months ago I have been asked to become admin of a Facebook page which is about nonsense humour. I was asked because I made some pics for fun and they told me I was good. Plus, I had already been admin of a big Facebook page that had more or less the same content, so they knew me.

But now I haven't created anything in the past four months and I'm still an admin, and also in the admin chat. I also stopped communicating with the other four admins.

After I started university lessons, working and playing in a band, I can't no longer find the time or will to sit down at the computer and create content (pics or videos). It takes too much time and I'm not even paid. Plus you need to be a lot on social medias in order to get ideas for new content.

Admins in the chats are texting everyday talking about what content might work or not, how many likes it could get and so on...

But I also feel it would be a pity to stop being an admin. This Facebook page is popular in my country (some people from my social circle already knew it) so it could give me status, in other words, contribute in making me more interesting. Also it's kind of a creative hobby.

I am certain I can get away with making only one pic or video a month and still be an admin, because I had already told them I'm busy, and they said it's ok. That would only take me one or two hours a week to do. I feel like I already answered myself. But I also feel like it's ""work"" and not ""fun"". Maybe I should do something that makes me love doing this again.",15Mar2020,1

Now with the issue of coronavirus she has been forced to cancel, and I feel so sad for her that she's going to miss out and will have to wait even longer to visit her home and her family. Is there any way I could make her feel better? I was thinking about maybe giving her a gift that reminds her of home, or making some food from her home in order to cheer her up, but I haven't the first clue on what the popular stuff is over in the Philippines.

409,"I live in a condo/townhouse and this year had some bad neighbors move in next door. Tonight I got woken up in the middle of the night and I heard a lot of yelling and screaming, banging of doors (possibly? Hopefully?) I heard a woman’s voice screaming a lot and saying “stop pulling my hair”, and other things along those lines. I also heard a man’s voice but couldn’t make out what he was saying. I know a couple and their kids live there—didn’t hear any of the kids. Went on for 20 minutes then things went silent.

This is not the only time this has happened. The other times I just didn’t hear it, but there are at least 2-3 other times my roommates have heard it. They’re rooms face the backyard, where most of the yelling happens. Once, the cops did come for whatever reason. We know the man next door was on parole at that time, and because they refused to open the door, he had gone away (idk where) for a couple weeks. 

I’m not sure what he does for a living. He’s always in the garage, smoking, blasting music and up from the hours of 10pm-5am only. 

I wanted to call the police but I’m afraid, because I think they’ll know it was me. I’m the only one connected to their unit. They are the end unit that faces the street otherwise. Not sure if the neighbors across the street or neighbors in front of our unit would hear them.

What can I do? What should I do? How can I best address the situation? My HOA is useless regarding noise complaints, and I doubt they’d step in. These people are for sure renters, as I met the neighbors who previously bought the place, and on Zillow don’t see that it’s been sold again yet.",15Mar2020,1

I have a load of paper with sensitive information on I need to get rid of. I paid a shredding company to take away the last lot and was wondering if there is a cheaper way?

I’ve tried soaking it in water and bleach to remove the information but it doesn’t seem to have worked. Shredding seems like it would take a lot of time due to the paper being crumpled up.

Hi. I’m 18 years old and moved to England in September by myself to attend university. I am a US citizen and can return home under the travel ban, however I’m worried that that wouldn’t be the best idea. My university isn’t closed so I’m not sure I’m even allowed to return home but I emailed my course leader and am waiting for a response because I can easily attend classes online. My family desperately wants me to come home and quarantine with them, and I was planning to return at the beginning of April for Easter, but my initial concern was that international travel will be limited and airports will be shut down in the three weeks before my flight. Now, I fear going in an airplane and dealing with the crowds I’ve seen recently at the airports and contracting the disease and giving it to my family. I feel like it would be safer if I stayed here where I can isolate and quarantine myself, but frankly I’m scared of something happening and me not being with them. My grandmother, who I’m extremely close to, insists that if I don’t fly there, she’ll fly here to quarantine with me. She’s 75 and I definitely don’t want her to expose herself to anything in an airport but I also don’t want to bring anything to her. I feel like I’m rambling at this point and idk if I’m making sense but i’m panicked and alone and I just need some advice please.",15Mar2020,1
416,"My flatmate really dislikes me and I don’t know why. Every opportunity he gets to talk down to me or treat me like an idiot and he takes it. It’s getting me really down, my self confidence is shot, and I just don’t want to be around him. A few examples of things that have happened:

  - for fun we calculated how many kilos of mayo another flatmate eats (he was in on it, this wasn’t anything mean) and I go into the kitchen and say ‘X eats 15.6kgs of mayo’ and instead of being like ‘sure’ he tells me I’m wrong. We used a calculator. He wouldn’t let it go that I was right until we calculated it in front of him. 
- flatmate was complaining about being cold and I suggested he use a blanket I brought downstairs and he talked to me like I was an idiot and said it wouldn’t help him. His tone and everything made me feel so upset I ended up apologising to him. 
-  he said that Jeffrey Epstein got jailed the other day, when I said ‘that’s Harvey Weinstein’ he told me ‘no that’s another story’. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead several months. I didn’t say anything because he shot me down so quick. 
- we were talking about the homeless issue in our city. I said that it was a shame, and that there are people who have lived out on the streets so long they are vulnerable. I also said there was high amounts of mental health issues amongst homeless people because of their isolation etc. He told me this was an ‘extremist point of view’. It’s not - it’s irrefutable scientific fact. My flatmate said all homeless people take drugs with the money they take and apparently that wasn’t an extremist point of view?

  Why does he think I’m stupid? Why does he always try to correct me? What do you even do with someone like this? I just don’t want to be around him.",15Mar2020,1
417,"Hi Reddit, I'll try and keep this succinct but I think I'll probably fail! I would really appreciate some advice because I'm pretty upset right now.

For context: I'm a master's student, and I have an RA-type job as a welfare advisor where I live and work in student halls. It's a team of five people (+2 coordinators), so as you can imagine when problems in the team arise it hits quite close to home.

There's a guy at my job who started at the same time as me who I find absolutely insufferable. At first I thought it was just his personality, which is unfortunate but not something you can do anything about, but things have come to more of a head and I'm beginning to wonder if that's still the case.

I'm quite shy, but I've always considered myself to be pretty proficient at holding conversations and debates, and I have a number of academic accolades that mean that even my imposter syndrome can't make me feel like I'm unintelligent. Before meeting this dude, I've never before felt like I'm intellectually inadequate, but this guy makes me feel so fucking stupid in the way he interacts with me.  He has this air of disdain in response to everything I say, and will pick apart any comment that I make in a way that feels incredibly undermining- and I haven't noticed him doing this with anyone else on my team. It might be worth noting that I'm one of two women on this team- this guy is 8 years older or so- and the other woman is already doing a phd, same as this guy. I'm also pretty much the only member of the team with a semi-regional accent. I don't know if this is just me projecting my own insecurities onto this situation, but I honestly dread every interaction I have with this guy because I always come away feeling shitty about myself. And these are really not insecurities I normally have, and this is not a way that I've felt with anyone else I've ever met.

However, as time's gone on it feels more personal than this guy just having a bit of a shitty personality. He keeps on doing this thing where he'll say something where it's impossible to tell if he's telling the truth or not, and then if you believe him he'll act like you're stupid for being gullible.  He's made ""joking"" comments referring to me and one of my other collegues as libtards, and if I ever need to hand something over to him or liase with him 1-1 he'll just take whatever item we're exchanging and shut the door in my face, or hang up on the phone abruptly. The other day I was running an event for the students where I gave out plants and had a petition involving local environmental democracy to sign, and he walked by audibly laughing at me and my event in front of the students, which was incredibly undermining (not surprisingly, he thinks it's stupid that I campaign against climate change on  a local level in our city).

But this has truly come to a head this morning (and sorry but I need to give some more context)-  I'm immunocompromised, and over the weekend I had to go to hospital for a precautionary checkup because I had some slightly scary symptoms that were adjacent to coronavirus. The doctors confirmed that I definitely didn't have coronavirus, and that these were other symptoms from a mild viral infection that my immune system couldn't shake off, but I was told to self isolate where possible for my own health because I'm in an at risk group for the virus. Due to a situation that happened in our halls I ended up disclosing to this guy that I was self isolating, and over messenger I explained why, and asked him to not spread this information around because I didn't want to cause unnecessary panic for anyone who's been in contact with me- information can get misconstrued, and I don't want anyone thinking I have coronavirus when I absolutely don't. He then started having a go at me, saying ""and yet \[I was\] quite happy to tell him that I was self isolating"", and that I needed to tell my managers. I responded saying that I already had, and said that he didn't need to act like I was being irresponsible in who I was telling, especially because I was isolating for my own health and not because I was at risk of passing the virus onto others. He then responded saying ""Shut up, you're not the only one with an underlying health condition"", and I just said that I didn't understand why he was being so rude to me because it was completely unnecessary. He then blocked/muted me on facebook, so I couldn't send any more messages (not that I particularly wanted to).

So I don't think it's unreasonable for me to assume that for some reason, this guy absolutely hates my guts. I could deal with pretty much everything else but this is the final straw, especially after having a pretty traumatic weekend where I had to go to hospital, and I've just been alone in my flat properly crying about this. I'm so torn over what to do, because I want to speak to my managers about his behaviour- they can be a bit useless in terms of their organisation and efficiency at accomplishing things, but they're generally quite empathetic people. The problem is that if I tell them about this and show them these messages I don't want it to look like I'm telling tales on him like we're in primary school.

I've tried to give as honest an account of this as I can- does this seem like just someone's unpleasant personality that I should just put up with, or something more untoward because this treatment feels very personal? I work and live in close proximity to this guy, and I don't know how much longer I can put up with this.",15Mar2020,1

421,"TL;DR at the end.

First off, I’m sorry for bringing up this disease, as though it isn’t talked about enough everywhere you look. I’m just super stressed out about this and really need some advice.

I live at home with my parents, and so does my sister. Two weeks ago, despite everything with COVID-19, she went on a trip to Japan. She’s coming back later today.

Two weeks traveling in a level 2 (or whatever the terminology is) country, taking packed public transport everyday, going to a million different places, eating out, going to the airport, etc. She must have been in contact with thousands of different possible sources of the virus by now. I feel like the chances of her contracting it are decently high.

I’m young, relatively healthy, and have no pre-existing health conditions. I don’t think I’ll die if I contract it. However, the chance of dying if I do get it is going to stress me the hell out, not to mention I don’t want to be miserable for however long it takes me to recover from it.

More importantly, my parents are older. I think my mom will be fine, but I’m worried about my dad. He’s older than my mom and definitely not healthy. I really don’t want him getting it.

Knowing my sister, she’s not going to take a single precaution when she gets home. She’s probably going to hug our parents the second she gets back, and then unpack her suitcase in the living room and show us all the shit she bought. We’re going to be using the same kitchen and living in the same house, and she’s going to want to rant to me about how her trip was.

I don’t know what to do. Should I just hole myself up in my room for two weeks? It sounds dramatic as hell, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. I doubt I could get her to quarantine herself in her room for two weeks, but maybe I could convince my parents to do something about it. I don’t know. I just don’t want to do *nothing* in case she does have it. What would you do in my position?

TL;DR: I live at home with my parents and so does my sister. She went to Japan two weeks ago and is returning later today. I don’t want to get COVID-19. Should I hole myself in my room for two weeks? Ask her to quarantine herself in her room?",15Mar2020,1
422,"So I have two good friends that I’ve known for a few years. They’ve always lived together with one other guy in a three bedroom apartment. Back in November the third guy decided to not renew the lease at the end of April leaving an empty bedroom.

About a month ago another friend of ours also needed a place to stay and so we decided to go look for a 4 bedroom apartment. In this time my two friends decided to throw a party and keep it a secret from me since my ex would be there. They didn’t want tension so they never told me about the party. 

I was mad at them for about two weeks and we all eventually got over it and are fine now. Well in the two weeks I was upset with them they resigned the 3 bedroom lease and added the 4th friend instead of me. 

I feel abandoned now that they decided to choose the 4th person who only asked about a month ago instead of me. I now currently have no plans to live anywhere and I’m not sure what to do.

They know my troubles and they try not remind me of my singleness when I'm around. I don't have much female friends. I have mild social anxiety but still I try to interact with new people and make friends, yet most girls just either take me for granted or keep me as the *insignificant* friend in the group. I really don't know what to do. Sometimes my mom also teases me saying that her friends' sons &amp; daughters are dating and asks me why I'm not dating anyone. It's not like I don't try... and besides I'm planning to do Computer Science so it's not easy to find friends who are girls in the future. My mental health is deteriorating and I don't want to end up alone. I don't want to be jealous of others. I don't want my parents to think I'm a social failure. I just want a sign that it'll be alright.",15Mar2020,1
436,"This is a tough one. My MIL  is a narcissistic and emotionally abusive woman and has been to my fiancée (/gf) for all of her life. The main issue I am having recently is that my gf has recently gotten a part time shift at a local cafe and the MIL hates it. 

For her whole life my gf has been doing exactly as her mother wanted in an effort to make her proud. This includes doing a degree she hates and makes her unhappy, and never being allowed to work because it would ""distract"" from her studying. Her mother is always saying stuff like ""you'll never be able to get a job bc you don't have experience"" even though it is her fault that my gf has never had a job. She has recently applied and gotten a trial shift for a local cafe and her mum is very against this.

My gf's uncle and grandad birth have cancer and her dad takes care of them and her mum is convinced that by working in this job she is going to get the current popular virus and pass it to her dad who will pass it to her uncle and grandad who will then die and it will be my gfs fault. 

We tell her that she is more at risk going to uni where there is 30,000 + people. Our housemate was in China over the Christmas holiday and is literally being tested for it. Her uncle lives with his wife and daughter who could give it to him. MIL literally makes her dad go to the shops every couple of hour or so where thousands of people have been touching shit and could spread the virus. Her dad could literally self isolate with his grandad. There are so many other ways the virus could be passed on but with my MIL it all comes down to my gf having this job. She keeps saying that her grandad died of pneumonia bc her mum gave it to her and she had to live with the guilt, and keeps saying that my gf will be the reason that they die.

My gf saved up for ages and bought herself a dog 7 years ago. She loves that dog more than anything and recently he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer which is untreatable in dogs. We don't know how much time he has left and MIL keeps threatening to ban my gf from seeing her dog in case she spreads the virus to her dad and grandad and uncle. Yet at the same time she will guilt her for not spending enough time with him and threatens to put him down without telling my gf if he is getting worse by her standards. 

This is unfair and total BS to me. Imo its all excuses in an effort to control what my gf does and its really getting on my nerves and I don't know what to do. Please help.",15Mar2020,1

438,"I first met her in mid of 2018, where she offer sexual service. She is originally from China and came to work as prostitute at the country where I work (in asia). She is in her early forties and I am younger than her a few years. I visited her many times and sometimes I spend the whole night with her (paid service). She went back to China after six months later of her work. We have some casual text through via WeChat app. 


I missed her so much (not for sex) and I decided to visit her home town in China after three months of her return. She accepted my visit and accompanied me during my three days stay at her home town. We had unprotected sex. I think, she knows I like her since then but I didn't talk much. She also told me that, she divorced a few years ago and she had one son. Before I came back, I gave her $3000. 


After I came back we had more often text and sometime video chat. After two months from my first visit to her home town in China I made second visit to her home town again. I bought flower and I made breakfast for her. She told me she likes me and she also knew I likes her. I didn't say much about relationship because I don't know how to handle the relationship with her. She told me that she is not working as prostitute at her home town. Before I came back, I gave her $2000. 


After I came back, we had more and more exchange text messages and video calls. I made my third visit after two months later form second visit. At my third visit, she told me to stay at her apartment, where she lives a lone. I told her that I love her at my third visit. She start to open about herself and her life. She told me that she is working at one of the small retail chain stores at her home town (later I found out it was true and she even had some share on that company). I gave her $3000 before I came back. 


After I came back from my third visit, we had exchange text messages and video chat on daily basis. One day,  during the video call she told me that she love me too. She kinda knows I feel worried about her and I feel insecure, She told me that, she will only contact her guy relatives, guy colleagues and she will not contact other guys in general because of me. We discussed about our relationship and even for future plan. She was worried that I will not to get over with her past. Sometimes, we had some small fight over text or video call. I admit, I am jealous and feel insecure. One day, we had big fight over video chat. I was worried so much and on the next day I flew to her home town and settled our argument. 


It was considere my fourth visit. I had good and bad experience at my fourth visit. The good thing is, she introduced me to her family members and friends at her family gathering party and her son birthday party. I also met her son but he didn't know that I am his mum boyfriend. The bad thing is, I found out she was still having chat on WeChat with her some old clients, who treat her well in the past. At the night of my last day stay at her house, we discussed about those chat (with her some old customer) and she told me that she will change. I gave her $1000 during my stay before I came back.


A few weeks later after I came back, she told me that she had opportunity to open one shop at her home town and she will have to share with her company (company invest 50% and she investe 50%). She asked me whether I could help her and she told me that if I can't help her, she understand. The amount she need to invest was $25,000. I didn't think much as I don't want her to go back to the place where I get to know her just because of finance, so I helped her. (I am not rich guy, the amount I gave her was half of my saving) 


I made my fifth visit on during Chinese new year in 2020. I stayed at her house for sometime as it was long holiday. I found out, she was on chat or phone call with one older guy frequently and I asked her and she told me that after she divorced she went to another big town in China to work at clean massage shop (I don't think it was clean massage shop) then she get to know one older guy and that guy supported her son's school fees and supported her financially. They were more than friend and they had had sex before. She also visited him a few times in a year. She also told me that, she didn't promise that guy anything and according to her that older guy also told her that if one day if she meet one good guys then ask her to get married. 


She told me not to worried too much because all her family members and friends know me as her boyfriend. She also told me that, she doesn't want expensive things and she wants normal life (have food to eat, have enough money for child (if we have child, one day), have enough money to pay for our parents if one day if they get sick. (Her dad passed away after two years of her married and she couldn't save her dad due to not enough money for good medication). 


I admit and she knows, I think a lot, I have high jealousy I feel insecure (I guess is normal because of her past and the older guy). 


She worried that I will not get over her past and she told me once that if one day if she decide to give up our relationship is not because of I am not rich just because of me not able to get over her past and high jealousy. 


Some of my friends told me that I am negative thinker but I think I am neither optimistic or pessimistic, I consider myself more of practical person. I even have my own quote ""hope for the best and do your best but also prepare for the worse"". 


One day, while we were on video chat, her another phone ring and I asked her to answer the phone and turn out to be that older guy phone call. 


We are also planning to visit my home town and meet my parents in next a few months. 


My questions are as below (I know it's wired), 

1) How to know does she loves me or she just using me? 

2) Is there any technical way to test her or any sign to look out for her behaviour? 

3) What will you do if you were me? 


Thank you in advance and I really appreciate your opinion. ",15Mar2020,1

 So basically I have a lot of friends but not really any close ones, I see them all going out together but I’m never invited, I don’t know what that means. In school we talk loads and have a laugh but as soon as schools over I feel lonely, I don’t really talk to them outside of school but I want to, I just don’t know what messages to send without seeming desperate. Basically I just want to know how to speak/message/keep in contact with friends outside of school because I’m worried that once I leave school I’ll not speak to any of them",15Mar2020,1
441,"Hello guys, 
Okay so before I ask my question I should give a little backstory. So I work in a company and there is this girl I liked so I  express my feelings to her and she wasn't interested. This made me sad and a little bit angry with her.During this time I avoided contact with her verbal and not even looking at her . But after some time I was normal and wanted to set things straight  I went to her and greeted her (in Arabic because she is an Arab girl) and she didn't respond just smiled at me. And since than she has been avoiding me a lot and it seems she doesn't want to talk with me anymore . This tension is affecting my work as  I freak out when she is around and my heart starts beating faster  . I think she's creeped out what should I do ? I just want things to be normal between us the way it was before .",15Mar2020,1
442,"I have an older sister who’s 30. She’s the eldest of us siblings and always seems to get her way ever since we were young. She’s an academic achiever (and I’m not) and has always been a popular girl, having a seemingly “perfect girl” facade for the longest time, even my friends like her (because I never tell them the truth). Unknown to others, she’s really righteous, hypocritical and stuck-up. I feel like walking on eggshells around him and my other older sibling.

She went away for college making life peaceful for me but went back after (ugh). She married 3 years ago, she and her husband are both doctors. They had a luxurious wedding ceremony (they paid with their savings but both their families also helped with some finances). However, they didn’t save for a house so they ended up staying here with my family. 

I thought she’d be more mature now that she’s married and has a son (who also lives with us) but she still throws tantrums, states that she’s a “hands-on” mother but complains and even fights with my mom on why my mom never helps her take care of her son as well as shout so loud like a crazy person at my mom, when her son could literally hear and be traumatized by her. I am (as well as my other sister) so sick of having her in the house, her husband is pretty nice and well-mannered but she’s really crazy. 

She would even meddle with our personal lives and would act as if she’s the owner of the house (when my parents own the house), always complaining and if she doesn’t get things her way, would result to tantrums and do really ridiculously bothersome things like shouting at people, slamming doors so loud it disturbs the whole house, etc. But then when she regains composure, she’d act like she’s have her life under control. Ugh. She doesn’t even work full time daily and usually just stays at home (since she didn’t take up residency yet, and her husband works for them mostly).

I wish she’d have used her money up for a house instead of a very impractical wedding. Mind you, she doesn’t even help pay bills for our house, my parents does and even my mom pays for some of her son’s needs sometimes so that she could save up money. I’m really fed up sometimes. What do you think me and my other sister should do? My other sister’s just high school and I’m single and going to take up a second course in college.

Overall I think his personal hygiene isn’t fantastic, as I’ve seen him ‘wash’ dishes with the same cloth he dries his hands with.

I’m afraid he might get infected with corona virus and in turn infect me. What is there to do? Should I act like I’m his mom and tell him how to wash hands properly? Of course I can’t force him to stay inside. We share the bathroom and kitchen but that’s it.",15Mar2020,1

448,"So my Boyfriend (We'll call him Boyf) is a super duper sweet and fun loving guy. Super smart and has his heart set in the right places, very easy to fall in love with. He and his best friend (Tommy) grew up together and have a friendship of 7+ years. Tommy and I are very similar and connect really well, and all three of us are seriously amazing friends and hangout pretty much all the time. (Of course however, Boyf and Tommy hangout on their own too.)
I didn't even consider the thought that maybe Tommy might be into Boyf until one day, while Boyf had to run to the car, Tommy and I had a weird talk. At first I thought he was messing around like we always do, but then there was that weird moment where he wasn't laughing. 
The conversation went a little like this: 
Tommy: ""what's on your neck??"" 
Me: (There were hickies on my neck but they are so unbelievably faint I didn't feel the need to cover it with makeup.) Me, thinking he's joking around, starts to laugh and cover my neck and says ""nothing don't worry about it!""
Tommy: ""Nonono what's on your neck?"" 
Me: Awkwardly realizing he's not laughing. ""uhm? What?""
Tommy: ""When you're around me, you and Boyf aren't in a relationship anymore. You guys are strictly my friends."" 
I am very confused at this point, kinda staring at him while awkwardly laughing, hoping he was kidding. 
Tommy begins to explain with his hands that we are all the same level and when we hang out, our relationship basically shouldn't exist. I laugh it off and as Boyf returns, the subject is dropped completely. I seriously pay no mind to this at all for a while and kinda just go about doing our thang, hanging out and what not. I dunno why, maybe the weird talk put me on edge a bit but I started noticing a lot of Tommy getting upset with Boyf and I for showing affection. He put a strict ban on affection at his place and will hardly even let Boyf and I hug. Often times, Boyf and I hold hands when we leave the house or plant quick kisses on each others cheeks. Not excessive PDA but cute little things. Tommy would often shout ""NO PDA"" really loud, gets in between us or even make a point to firmly grab Boyf hand and hold it, even after Boyf tells him to stop multiple times because Tommy is holding on THAT hard. Tommy will smack Boyfs butt and will jokingly say things like ""you know you like it"" after Boyf tells him it makes him uncomfortable. He's done this a lot and I didn't pay any mind to it much before as I thought that's how they mess around. (Spoiler alert, its not)
 I sat down with myself for a moment and thought, Tommy is constantly joking about seeing Boyfs penis, pulling my boyfriends pants down when he obviously doesn't want him too. After Boyf kisses me Tommy will exclaim ""where's my kiss?"" and will grab Boyfs face and try to kiss him as a joke.
 I've told Tommy I'm uncomfortable with him being ""overly touchy"" with my boyfriend and Boyf has voiced his concerns too. It doesn't seem to stop. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm not sure how to stop it. Boyf and I have not and will not stop showing affection around each other, but Tommy has become increasingly irritable. He's getting upset with Boyf and I over the smallest things and kind of carries a negativity with him that both Boyf and I seem to notice. I fall silent when I'm around him now because I don't know how to act. I want to respect him to the best of my ability but not give my ""relationship rights"" to do so. 


TLDR; Best friend (Tommy) doesn't want Boyf and I to be in a relationship when all three of us hang out, continuously makes uncomfortable gestures to Boyf (such as lewd comments, cuddling, spanking and trying to kiss him). We've voiced our concerns but things only got worse.",15Mar2020,1

452,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old college drop out and I'm stuck with my parents due to not having the financial means of having my own house. My mom is really disgusting and I've asked her repeatedly to change but she doesn't, for example she doesn't want to use the bathroom until she pisses herself then runs through the whole house and slams the door and pisses with the door open then finally closes it while pissing, in the progress she pisses on the toilet seat, sometimes pisses in the backyard when coming home and I'm pretty sure she pisses in the shower too because I always hear her get up and shower but not use the toilet. The bathroom is on the other side of my wall so sadly I hear everything that happens near that room. She also picks her nose with her fingers and puts her snot and slime everywhere, doesn't wash her hands, doesn't clean anything in the house and puts dirty things back in cabinets and stuff. My dad doesn't really give a shit because he's also not the most clean person and he's used to it and is generally just really relaxed about it all. But every day I feel disgusted and annoyed. I know the standard answer is to have a real conversation about this but I have done that multiple times and it doesn't help, she refuses to change.

453,"

So basically, I was friends with this group who are known to follow the so called leader of the group, let’s call him Harvey, no matter what. I was friends with some people Harvey didn’t like so he demanded I stop being friends with them and I refused so Harvey decided to spread a rumour about me. I hope this gives a good picture for the type of guy Harvey is.

I introduced my friend, let’s call him Mike, to the group and invited Mike to some parties at my place. Harvey starts to act strange around Mike and it’s clear there’s some sexual tension between the two. Harvey is gay and Mike was straight from my knowledge at the time. Anyway me and mike become closer as friends until we’re telling each other everything and Mike tells me that Harvey has asked him out 3 times and he’s said no every single time because he’s still trying to figure out his sexuality. I thought Harvey was wrong to do that in all honesty but I couldn’t really confront him about it.

Skip to about a week ago, and we’re all at party at one of our friends house. Mike comes up to me and tells me Harvey forced him to do stuff with him before coming and tell me he wants to kill myself, I brush it off initially (which I feel terrible about now) and he goes back to Harvey. So at about 2 am, I’m talking to some girls at the party and we hear a massive bang from the other room. It’s mike slapping Harvey, Harvey was forcing himself on Mike and Mike said no multiple times. At the time, I didn’t understand what was happening but I knew Harvey probably tried something.

I left the party as soon as I could, and got a message of Mike asking me how the party went. I was more concerned about him and asked him if he was okay and what happened. He told me everything (not going to list any of it here in case ‘Mike’ actually sees this) and he told me that Harvey was forcing him to go to dinner with him that night. I told Mike not to go but it was too late he went.

I had a trip planned with Harvey, Mike and another friend for the next day but I couldn’t go because if I saw Harvey, I don’t know what I would’ve done, so I stayed home and went to college but I couldn’t not do anything. Harvey couldn’t get away with what he had done. 

So I reported it, and I got an angry phone call of Mike that night, calling me all sorts of names and shit like that. And of course angry messages of Harvey, which i ignored. Another thing about Harvey is that he holds grudges and can never accept he’s wrong. 

I apologised for causing Mike hurt but I thought my actions were necessary. Mike told me to fuck off and Harvey told me to never speak to any of my friends again (he’s quite controlling) and even sent me a video of them chatting shit about me.

456,"Some background information: my grandmother was schizophrenic and she ran off with my mother and raised her alone. bc of that my mom has a lot of issues and her biggest fear is to get diagnosed with a mental illness of her own. She has been to many professionals before but has always stopped going to the sessions for reasons i don't know (my dad says they told her things she didn't like, if this is true i assume they told her she needs to work on her trauma). 

tbh she has terrorized this family to the fullest. I feel completely exhausted but i can never rest or calm down bc i am the only one who can help out if my mother is having trouble/fights with my younger sister. Things have escalated before (I am talking about people being left alone in another city with a sick dog by their side and no phone/money). I feel like if i am not around bad things will happen. My sister is normally responsible but has a difficult time rn as well and add to this my mother being completely delusional and exhausting sometimes my sister just snaps and I have to intervene. 

Bc of the CORVID-19 outbreak my mom has yet another topic to freak out over. She is conviced that i infected her with it when i was meeting a friend. Everytime i talked with her about this she says she never mentioned corona, then she says she feels like we don't take her serious. She agreed with me that she probably does not have the virus but that she is otherwise sick and should not go to work. I drove to the doctor for her to get the notice. 

Today my sister overheard her on the phone talking to her friends. She told all of them she has the virus and that i infected her through a friend of mine and that my friend spends a lot of time with asians (pls be understanding people, she is just delusional not racist). I don't think I have to mention how this is total bs and neither my friend nor I do have the virus or any of the symptoms. I got a minor cold right after i met my friend but that was all and it only lasted for a single day. My mom got sick a day after and still has what i believe is maybe at best a stomach flu. Any fact checks are wasted on her, everytime i try to work on her delusions she will just tell me i am right and behind my back talk about it again. I feel like i should be angry. Or want to be angry at her but i don't feel anything. This is just another sunday.

What can I do? Should i try to bring her to talk to a professional again? What is the best strategy to move forward from here? She also has this imagine in her head that meds are only for sedating people. Idk what to do anymore.

tl;dr: my mother is maybe mentally ill and terrorizes everyone in the family. I am at my limit. How can i get her help? She always stops going to therapy.",15Mar2020,1
457,"Guys I have a bit of a conundrum and I really don't know what to do.

So basically, I am a 23-year-old postgraduate researcher. I have an active life and active social life, where I try to always be on the go and doing something or socializing.

And like most people, corona has thrown a wrench into things.

My parents really want me to leave my town and come home due to corona (mostly because they're in isolation and lonely). They are both in high risk categories, meaning if one of them gets it... they will both get it... and the odds.. won't be in their favour.

They are basically in total isolation at the moment, and they want me with them. The trouble is, if I go home, I will not be able to go out and do anything myself, because I risk getting it and infecting them. At 23 I will probably be okay if I get it, but they won't.

They are isolating for 3 months. If I go home with them, I will have to drop everything and stop my life, and be basically house-bound, for 3 months. I will have to suspend my studies and everything, and I won't even be able to go to the shops or do ANYTHING for 3 months. And I seriously can't do ANYTHING as I risk catching the virus and giving it to my at-risk parents. I will be totally locked down for 3 months. As an active 23-year-old, that prospect of dropping everything and staying at home for 3 months is terrifying.

I should add my father is retired and my mother mostly works from home and doesn't really see that many friends anyway, so neither of them really leave the house much anyway.

But my parents are almost BEGGING me to come home and be with them over their isolation. My parents can be a little dependent on me sometimes because they do not get on with my sister at all, they both have no siblings, and all 4 of my grandparents are dead. I feel they NEED me. The trouble is, my parents also fight a lot as well. And I mean, a LOT. They've been together nearly 30 years and... well... half of that time has been fairly loveless. I'm often roped into their fights and spend hours trying to pick up the pieces after they have a fight, which absolutely drains me mentally.

If I stay where I am, if I get the virus, I do not risk infecting anyone at high risk and can isolate just for 2 weeks until (hopefully) I've recovered. It's 2 weeks alone in my town or 3 months alone with only my parents not being able to leave the house or see anyone or do anything.

I really do not know what to do.

Am I being selfish for wanting to continue my life and not wanting to drop my life for 3 months to be with them for isolation, or are they being selfish for wanting me to drop my life for 3 months to keep them company when we can video call any time? 

What should I do guys, should I go home or stay where I am?",15Mar2020,1

I will tell you the company I work for is massive, and has plenty of money. They are refusing to let us work from home, saying that it is not possible and that everything is business as usual. They have no plan in place. They have not cancelled unnecessary meetings, they are still packing tiny conference rooms full and shutting the door. When the question came up of “what will we do when someone in our office gets it?” The answer we got was; “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” 

My partner is very high risk with auto immune disorder. I am scared to go to work. I have been using my paid time off to avoid the office. It seems like the CEO and higher ups do not give a damn if us or our families get the virus, they just want to milk every penny they can. I truly do not know what to do. I keep taking days off hoping I get an email that a plan was put in place. On a day I did go to the office last week, two people who I work near showed up with flu like symptoms.

I went into the office on a Saturday because nobody is there and it is the only time I feel comfortable going. I am a young adult and this is my first corporate job, does anybody have any advice?",15Mar2020,1

463,"Is it normal to want to be in relationships that last forever? Ever since I was 15, all I've wanted was in to be in a loving forever type of relationship. To only have eyes for each other and unconditional love. I wanted to fight through tough times and have that reciprocated. Well in each and every relationship/ situationship I've had, I've felt that I've been more of a ride or die than my partner. I've been used for sex, harassed, told that they never thought I was attracted, sexually assaulted. I am now in a long term relationship 1+ years, 20, and I'm struggling with the fact that my partner doesn't seem phased losing me. He always vocalises his thoughts about leaving me, when I've asked him, he's told me he would have sex with x girl, and that even when he doesn't feel like having sex with me or I don't feel like having sex with him, it doesn't mean his sex drive is eradicated (he would still like to have sex with other people, not just me). Idk I'm not explaining it well, basically I'm not the only one who he is sexually attracted to but he is the only one I would want to have sex with and I just feel so hurt. It's not the fact that he can picture himself having sex with other women, it's the fact that I can't picture myself doing that even if I was single.

468,"He talks to himself all the time. A couple of days ago as I was on my way to dropping him off at work, we stopped by the gas station so he can put gas in my truck. As he was standing out pumping my gas, I looked through the side mirror and I noticed he was mouthing to himself. I asked him, ""WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!"". He told me, ""I'm thinking out loud."" The reason why I looked out my side mirror because a car pulled up behind him to their gas pump, and I noticed he didn't look behind him to acknowledge its presence. And as I was looking I saw him talking to himself.

I gave him a tirade that morning because seeing him talking to himself was freaking me out!

What if the guy from that car behind us would've just came out and came up to my son and put a gun to his head and shot him, while he's just standing there talking to himself?!

He does it at home as well. He's been doing it for a long time. I remember when me, him, and my other son went on a road trip a few years ago and he was doing it quietly to himself, but loud enough to where I can hear him. I flipped out and said, ""IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT, I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO GO SEE A THERAPIST. IF YOU KEEP TALKING TO YOURSELF, AND ONCE SOMEONE SLAPS THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, YOU'LL SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT."" He once again said he thinks out loud.

My son did admit that he has Social Anxiety and possibly ADHD. I ask him, ""Are you sure you don't have Schizophrenia? Do you hear voices in your head?"" He says, ""I am positive I don't have schizophrenia and I don't hear voices in my head.""

He tells me he thinks out loud, but talking to yourself is not a good look. I don't think he's just thinking out loud, he is literally having conversations with himself.

He told me that he has been dealing with Anxiety all his life. Within the past year, he has been trying to make efforts to turn his life around. He started working full-time, he has gone to therapy, he is working on getting his driver's license, etc.

He is trying to look for another therapist, because he thought the first one wasn't a good fit.

I don't really know what to do with him at this point. He is making these changes to his life, but is still doing the same bad habits like talking to himself.

Don't you guys think it's weird to do this? I don't want people to think that he's crazy or mentally unstable.

How can I help him stop?

**tl;dr: My son keeps talking to himself, and it's driving me nuts. He does it all the time and has been for a long time. It's so weird and looks very odd. Every time I catch him doing it, I flip out. How can I help him to stop.**",15Mar2020,1

475,"I (28F) have been living with my (now ex) boyfriend (28M) for 2.5 years. Our relationship has been going downhill-fast. We have an apartment together in middle Tennessee, and we are both on the lease. From what I understand, no matter the circumstances there is nothing I can do to kick him out, even though he hasn't paid any rent or utilities since August 2019 (a total amount owed of $4,800 with just his half of back rent, not including water and electric which would add about $800 more). He is an alcoholic, and he's mean when he drinks, whenever he does violent fights erupt and the police have been called on numerous occasions. However, the police can't do anything unless someone is arrested, and there is never enough proof. My big (but younger) brother has recently moved in from Michigan, so that has been a tremendous help. I have told him I want him out on numerous occasions, giving him 30 days to leave And he refuses, saying it has to come from the apartment complex-but there is nothing they can do since he is on the lease and rent is paid. I have a friend of mine looking for house rentals. I have been working extremely hard to work on my credit and finances, in just a couple of years I've been able to reach a 700 (I would love to buy but my job is spread over the state and I am not sure where I would live just yet). 

Would you leave the apartment knowing the other person on the lease would not be able to afford it or care to pay for it? (He is unemployed, he cannot hold down a job and has been refusing to get one. I know a real winner). How much does an eviction effect your credit and chances of renting again? Is this something I would be able to fight if the complex was to take me to court over it?",15Mar2020,1
476,"long story short it’s this girl (T) that I’ve been cool with for years. we always been cool just never close. I was in middle school when I met this other girl (K) we were dealing with the same guy we got cool and was calling each other twin. FFWD 12th grade (K) babydad did me a tattoo and was crushing on me. somehow she found out and started not liking me. (T&amp;K) grew very close. I would be over my boyfriend house (K) and her babydad (my bf friend) (T) and her boyfriend (my bf cousin) would all be at the house chilling... (T&amp;K) wouldn’t say nothing to me but on social media we was cool lol until one day (K) was talking shit saying she and her friend will fight me. I use to always be with my boyfriend at his cousin house (T bf) one day (T) brought (K) over after the Facebook shenanigans. All in all I beat (K) ass and I wanted to beat (T) ass for bringing her.. like 3 years went by I’m pregnant and (T) message me on IG saying how she wants to be cool so our kids can play and she wanted to be there at my gender reveal. She came to the reveal. She rarely interacted and after the reveal she asked me to send a picture of me and my bf. I asked why she said her sister wanted to see who I was because somebody with the same name stole her baby pictures ... I’m like wtf no you just trying to show (K) FYI (K) dated my bf years before me so I sensed she still like him and just wants to be nosey. Now we here in 2020 she says she wants one close friend but she thinks I tell my now husband (her bf cousin) everything we talk about I’m thinking that’s must what she do so she went on and on to say she want a genuine friendship with me she have spoke on me before because “I act like somebody scared of me” as she say and “I changed” as she say. So she follows me on Snapchat and Facebook I don’t be on Facebook posting so people think I don’t be on it at all. She copies everything I do. Like I said I be on Snapchat far as she know so basically I feel like she post shit just so I can see it. She doesn’t watch my snap UNTIL I watch at least one of hers, she cooks what I cooked the previous day or days, whenever I post anything like I want to go to Vegas in May she’ll go on facebook(where she think I’m NOT) and make
A post saying Vegas in May or ill post some like “I’m on my boss shit staying down til I come up,” she’ll go on Facebook and post “boss friend me please?” she just copies everything even my hairstyles, poses &amp; the way I sing songs on Snapchat. I told her I was going to Miami for spring break. She didn’t post on snap but on Facebook she posted a beach and resort. She was faking like she was in Miami whole time in Biloxi Ms. I did say some jokingly to her the last time she copped my hairstyle. I said, “I got you feeling that blonde.” She was like if that’s what you say we just think alike I’m like ooooook!

477,"Before you read, just know that I don't self-diagnose; I don't go around telling people I have BPD. It's just a very high suspicion I have. Also, sorry this is a lot to read &amp; that there's no tl;dr 

I used to just say I had anxiety and thought I had depression all while growing up, I just knew something was very wrong with me (I honestly think my mom has the same issues I do), and then one day my boyfriend – that I was friends with for about 5 years before dating, so he knows me quite well – asked if I could be bipolar. He wasn't being malicious, just genuinely concerned because of my patterns and behavior. I always assumed it was just anxiety and depression fueling how I was. 

And I don't think I'm bipolar. But reading about that led me to read about BPD.. and I started crying as I read more and more. 

I was already realizing I've been going through ""cycles"" almost my entire life. I first remember feeling ""the bad feelings"" after we made a big move, and we settled into a horrible place where I was rejected by the small friend group I managed to make. It was the first time I felt kind of bullied. 

The bad feeling has always been a heavy weight on my chest. Sometimes I'll feel claustrophobic, completely overwhelmed, which is normally when the ""cycle"" kickstarts – whenever that feeling gets too much to ignore. 

We moved after my parents divorce, too. A very bad one; we witnessed domestic violence, and my mom &amp; step dad's lives were almost taken by my drunk, angry bio dad. Long story. 

*But* we moved states and ended up moving to different towns a lot. I won't get too deep into what happened in each town, but we'd normally stay for about a year and then leave the next. I never really figured out how to make &amp; and keep connections with people, and then I started to *like* that we'd leave after a year. It gave me comfort. Maybe because I didn't connect with anyone, I disliked people more than I liked anyone (I'm kinda an insufferable person sometimes, an extreme introvert that's picky with people - probably distance myself cause of my own insecurities and how other people tend to make me feel worse), so I liked to get away and start over. I liked the idea of being someone else in each new town, but I'd frustratingly always be the same shy, quiet girl. 

Here's the cycles that have impacted others: I decide that isolation is best for me. I get extremely upset until I do so; I'll irrationally convince myself that people are better off without me, or that I'm better off without them, that life would just be so much better if I only focus on myself and I'm not impacting anyone's life, and no ones impacting mine. And then, after I've burned my bridges and I'm alone, I go through euphoria – I'll suddenly feel lighter, and I'll normally get really obsessed with something during that period of time. *But,* of course, the euphoria dies down and my emotions feel less intense and irrational, so I feel lots of shame and guilt. I can't tell you how many accounts I've deleted and remade because of this process; like I try to disappear from people's lives completely during this time. 

My boyfriend has dealt with this from me the most. I used to stop talking to him for months during my isolation and euphoria stages, but also stalling more before going back to him because of the shame and guilt over how I acted. Most people won't stick around after this but he's always been here for me. 

My emotions just consume me, eat me whole for awhile. It feels like they control me. I have gotten better at handling my romantic relationship; when my emotions get sorta unbearable or I think I'm being irrational, I take some space and journal because writing about everything helps me see things for how they are, I guess. I can read how ridiculous I'm being and correct my mindset, etc. 

But I have to work really hard to not be controlling and emotionally abusive, just from projecting my own insecurities and worries. I'm really thankful I'm in a stable relationship cause these issues were so much worse with guys I've dated in the past that would cheat and be dishonest in general. But I still struggle a lot. 

I still don't know how to make friendships work, but I'm coming to terms with that. I can accept that I'm an extreme introvert that enjoys being alone, and with my few favorite people. I don't think I need to force myself to make friends, they will happen naturally or they won't, fine either way. 

I noticed my anger has gotten worse over the years. It sometimes just brews on the inside when I'm having some irrational emotions, *but* I'm getting better at taking a step back before acting on the anger by hurting feelings/saying things I don't mean/breaking things. 

The worst thing from all of this, is that I don't feel like I can trust myself. I don't know which thoughts &amp; emotions are rational, which ones I should or shouldn't act on. It's really frustrating to feel like I can't even take myself serious or make my own decisions. 

I'm always second guessing myself. 

But wow, while writing this, I've realized that acknowledging I have an issue has helped me a lot. I stopped writing things off as ""it's just how I am"", I started working on things when I learned I could change these things about myself. For example, I stopped sending my boyfriend hurtful angry messages that I'd regret after sending, picking fights just cause I felt off and unsettled. We no longer breakup all the time (cause of me &amp; my usual cycle), since I take some time to think and process how I feel and what I truly think about the situation when I'm being rational. 

This isn't all I could write on this topic, but I've done enough and I'm about to fall asleep.. Does anyone have any theories of what's wrong with me, or if I could maybe be right or wrong when it comes to the BPD thing?",15Mar2020,1

480,"Hi, I have no idea if this is the right sub but I really hope so.

**Some background info**: I'm 1,5 year into a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. We're both in our early to mid 20s. I most likely won't be able to see her again for a few months because of the corona virus.

She lives in a toxic home and has both depression and an eating disorder. She's had it for the whole time during our relationship, but the three past months it has progressively gotten worse to the point were she's now suicidal everyday. I do my best to support her but I know I make mistakes sometimes.

**The problem:** Two days or so ago she begged me to please let her isolate herself for a few weeks or so. She said she wanted to just be alone and think. I was a little hesitant and asked questions but wanted to respect her wishes. A few hours later she came home from finally visiting a mental health professional again, and she admitted something to me: The isolation was a plan to make people ""stop loving her"" (her words) so that she could kill herself easier in a month or so. *She then begged me to don't let her kill herself and don't let her isolate even if she says she wants to. She suggested that I could call her and talk ot her instead if she ever wants to isolate again.*

Yesterday which was about 2 days later, she said she wanted to isolate again. She made a video where she explained her reasoning behind it. She said that she's too sad to talk to anyone right now and that she wants to just think about what she has, what she is and ""start a journey"" with herself. Something like that, I don't know how to summarize it. But well, she's begging me to please let her do this if she I love her. She said ""I promise to not to anything"" and ""we will meet in two months if the corona situation has gotten better, and we will travel together"". She also said that she will text me good morning and good night every day so that I know she's there, and that I can send her texts and pictures but shouldn't expect her to do the same or even answer. She said that she want to do this for a few week or even MONThS.

If the circumstances were different I would just respect her wishes without questioning them. But I'm really scared that this is just another plan to kill herself. Even if it isn't, I worry that her being almost totally isolated with just her toxic family will make her depression worse. And oh, her country is quarantined so she won't go to work or see any friends at all for at least 2 weeks.

I'm really worried about her. She's saying ""I'm gonna isolate now, bye. Talk to you soon again"" and things like that. She seems really determined but I don't know if I should let this happen because of what she said 2 days ago. And now she just texted me ""please pray that nothing will happen to me"". Wtf this is giving me so much anxiety. I don't know what to do, I don't want her to kill herself.",15Mar2020,1

483,"Hi, this is my first post so sorry for mistakes. I (18F) have known my best friend “David” (18M) for 14 years. We went to the same primary school and now we go to different secondary schools but it’s likely we will end up at the same university in September. 

My family have always assumed we are dating but up until last year I never felt any romantic feelings towards him. My feelings are made even more complicated by the fact that 4 years ago I realised I like girls and have been struggling for a long time to identify myself as bi or lesbian. I have told him all these worries and he was very supportive. Last April he started dating a girl from his school, let’s call her “Jane”. I don’t recall feeling jealous when he told me or at any point during the length of the relationship which is why I doubt whether my feelings are truly romantic or if I just want a relationship. 

David and Jane dated for about 6 months during which time I figured out that I am bi, not gay (thanks, Tom Holland). Anyway, they broke up horribly. They absolutely hate each other now, never stop arguing at school, and she’s very manipulative. I never met her in person but I really don’t like her because of the way she’s treated my best friend. 

During the time they were dating, I suppose any inkling of romantic attraction I had towards David was pushed away simply because I knew I wouldn’t have a chance while he was with another girl. But after they broke up I started hanging out with him more and more and wanting to hang out with him more too. We would do things like go to sweet Christmas markets together and he’d buy me milkshakes and hold my hand and sometimes I would just want to kiss him. 

Bear in mind I am 18 years old and have never kissed anyone, male or female, so I’ve always been very nervous about initiating anything. On top of that I’m just awkward as hell. 

This is where things change. We are both very affectionate/romantic types but usually too awkward to initiate anything beyond a friendly hug or hand holding, the latter usually excused as a practicality on busy streets. But last night he came to my house and it was different than every other time we’ve hung out. I showed him Ferris Bueller’s Day Off since he hadn’t seen it and we watched other 80s movies too. It wasn’t a sleepover but he ended up staying long after my parents had gone to bed, playing truths. 

I wanted to gauge whether there was a slight possibility he could have a crush on me, so I asked if he has a crush on anyone right now. He said no, and like I said, it was truths but I don’t know if he was actually telling the truth. But I took it as it was and told myself again that there’s no way he likes me. 

We messed around for a bit then went over to the sofa where he promptly laid down and I laid down beside him. Then he scooped his arms around me and pulled me across his chest so I was laying on top of him. It was really nice. He stroked my hair and back and even asked if he could lift my shirt, I said yes and he kept rubbing my back, he could also feel my bra strap. He also did the same to my legs and butt. Just to clarify, I really enjoyed this but it was a hell of a lot more intimate than anything we’ve ever done before in our lives. Our heads were practically touching and I wanted to kiss him or at least ask him if it was okay if I could kiss him, but in the end I chickened out because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. I was also afraid that either of us wouldn’t like it which would make things awkward, especially as I haven’t kissed anyone before. And like I said, I don’t know if I actually have feelings for him and I didn’t want to kiss him only to find out that I don’t. At about 3am he (begrudgingly) called an Uber to go home. 

I don’t know. I kind of regret not asking him at least, but at the same time I’m very unconfident and was afraid he’d say no, so in a sense I’m glad nothing has changed between us. He’s texted me today as normal. 

Do you think there’s any chance he likes me? How do you know that you like someone? And should I tell him the way I’ve been feeling? Sorry for the long post!",15Mar2020,1
484,"I’ll try to keep this short: 

I am a solo female, 24F. I work full time for a remote company. Entered Buenos Aires in January, took a trip for a week to Santiago, Chile this week to see family. While I’ve been gone, Argentina has locked down and no flights to high risk countries (including to the U.S., where I’m from) will leave until April 17. My returning flight was postponed by a couple weeks on American Airlines until May 7.

My parents are freaking out (naturally) and want me to return to South Florida and shack up with them. However, they are not under quarantine and they do not think it is necessary. They said that the people they work with do not present symptoms. I replied that people are asymptomatic for several days and still highly contagious before symptoms show. They believe going outside is a risk everyone has to take, and do not agree that quarantine is essential for everyone.

My plan is to return to Buenos Aires (where all my things are), gather needed supplies, and self isolate completely until this passes or abates. I do not have health insurance here but I do not expect to get the virus if I don’t leave the house. If I do, there are free public hospitals to lean on. I presented this as an option but my parents and some of my other family are outraged and calling me stupid for even considering it. 

But I think dropping $800 traveling back now to a non quarantined house, where my parents may get it and spread it to our family, and leaving my things in Buenos Aires is risky. Plus I’d need to drop an extra $500 to get back to my suitcases later (thankfully I have a cousin there that can hold onto them for me).

Unfortunately my parents have a history of not regarding me as a full adult, viewing me as irresponsible, etc. even though I paid for college myself, graduated from a prestigious university, work full time, and handle my money well.

What do you think I should do? 

TLDR; I want to stay in Argentina for COVID because I think it’s the safest option, but I don’t want to completely ruin my relationship with my parents. At the same time, I don’t want them to guilt me into staying with them.",15Mar2020,1

497,"Tl;dr: (In US) Priceline refuses to rebook, give me credit, or refund me for a flight I called to reschedule/refund after the Coronavirus restrictions placed on March 12 2020. They said that bc I was a no-show for my flight, I lose my claim to refund, credit, or rescheduling. I filed a BBB complaint and a chargeback on the credit card. What else can I do? I will call Lufthansa later today (March 15). 

Story:
I bought round trip tickets to Portugal through Priceline in January 2020 for March 12, 2020 scheduled to return on March 19. The flight was at 530 pm EST at IAD; the airline was Lufthansa. US announced travel restrictions to Europe on the evening of March 11. I woke up at 3am on March 12 to read the news and my wife and I took the steps to reschedule /refund our flight. We called Priceline at 330am and the wait time was over 14 hours; we left our number for a call. 

In the meantime, I called Lufthansa. They said that Priceline, as the ticketing and booking agency, is the only one that can refund my flight; Lufthansa can only rebook. The rep said that my flight is eligible for refund under their current waiver policy. But I didn’t know when and if this pandemic would abate, so I opted to wait for Priceline. 

Around 330pm Priceline calls back, first telling me that I’m eligible for nothing since I was ticketed in January. I immediately argue and the rep says that I am eligible for waiver per Lufthansa’s policy but I’m not eligible for a refund and I need to reschedule. I wanted a refund so I continued pleading my case. National security, global pandemic, health and safety, etc all the while reading Lufthansa’s website regarding Coronavirus waiver and policies. It clearly said that I could reschedule free and just pay any difference in fare. It also said that if there were any restrictions, Lufthansa offers free rebook and refunds. I wanted a refund first and foremost. Airline credit was 2nd. 

I get transferred to supervisor and at this point I’m on the phone for nearly 2 hours. She wants me to reschedule on the spot since she says I need to make it before my departing flight. I have no idea what’s in store and if this pandemic will still be around, so I say I can’t make a decision given what’s going on, would you give me a credit instead? She refuses and states that Lufthansa’s policy does not allow credit nor refunds since I bought a nonrefundable ticket. She says that they can only go by what policy Lufthansa gives them internally. My flight is taking off in about 15 minutes, I obviously have no intention of going on the flight since I’m calling to cancel it. So I give her random dates for rebooking; I dunno what is going on over there but it takes her 10 minutes to look up flights and prices and says that I have to pay additional $400 since that’s the fare. I’m dumbfounded by what I’m hearing up to this point. I looked at Google flights for the same dates and i tell her the flight number listed on google and its price. She tells me that the price Lufthansa gave her was $400 more expensive. It’s 6pm at this time and I’ve had it. I say what they’re doing is illegal, that they’re going by policy that they can’t show or send to me, this is a global crisis, taking advantage of those affected by a pandemic , etc. and that I will be contacting congressmen, filing complaints, and filing for chargeback. The call ends around 6pm with nothing set. 

I call Lufthansa and tell them what Priceline told me. She said that our tickets, despite being non refundable , are refundable under their current policy issued March 12 and I should tell them to call Lufthansa’s support center and ask for the authorization code to refund. I say ok but that’s probably not going to work. 

I call Priceline the next morning (3/13) only to hear a 31 hour wait. Great. Leave our numbers and they call back that night at 1230am on 3/14. I miss it and called yesterday to leave our number again and they call back this morning (3/15) at 330 am. I answer it and the long and short of it is that since I was a no-show at my flight, I’m eligible for nothing and my money is lost. I say that I’m wasn’t going to go to the airport for a flight I want to refund! I told them what Lufthansa told me about the authorization code and she said that a 3rd party can’t listen to a conversation between the 2 parties. Sounds illegal and seedy, at the very least . Given the current situation, I wasn’t about to get caught in the Coronavirus scare. She said sorry and hung up. 

Please I’m stuck and I don’t want to be out the $1300 for absolutely nothing. What steps can I take? I filed a BBB complaint and am attempting a chargeback for the charges. I can’t help but think what Priceline did was illegal, if not at least unethical.

498,Hey I’m new to Reddit and I need advice. So I met this girl on an app (Hily) and we’ve been talking for weeks on end. So a few days ago I asked her if she wants to go on a date and she says yes and I go to tell my mom about it as she’s the only one with a vehicle and it’ll be an hour just to get to the girls house. This is my moms response” it’s good that you have a date but you’re not going unless I’m going.” I look at her baffled and she doubles down saying that’s she’s gonna go if I go. This was going to be my very first date and I wanted everything to go smoothly and not having supermom watching my every move.

507,"I recently volunteered for an event and in the job description, they had listed down that volunteers would recieve a certificate as a reward.
In the job, I had already noticed that there were inconsistencies in their handling of us, the volunteers. 

Despite the many listings of our responsibilities in their email (e.g handing out pamphlets) we were placed in a location and only told to ""guide"" the guests and told to ask for further inquiries of a senior volunteer. They provided no prior briefing so the majority of our day was spent having no fu***** clue how to help the guests as we were told virtually nothing, even simple information like where to guide guests who lost their belongings or even where they can buy fu***** water. The senior volunteer who apparently had prior experience had to call the person responsible for us multiple times since she was just as clueless as us.

On to the main issue, it has been 2 weeks since the event and they have yet to give out our certificates, when asked they simply said they'd get back to us when they're ready. I'm not familiar with this so I dont know how long it takes to issue simple certificates, but it shouldn't be so damn hard that they cant even tell us when it will be ready. I have tried contacting them to ask for a specific date or steps I need to take to finalise that certificate but no response, and this was days ago. I have a problem with the late a** response because they had no issue responding within a few hours when it came to other stuff.

I'll get right to it. I have pretty severe hyperlordosis, had it for years now and I feel like it's getting worse (mainly because of my desk-job). I've talked to several physicians about this, I've seen orthopaedists, I've seen chiropractors, I've done physical therapy.

515,"My husband and I over the summer had a 3 some with a friend of ours, really his ""best friends"" ex. It is something we had discussed over about a year's time and he actively started looking for a unicorn. We made ground rules, which were simple, we don't talk to the potential person without the other being able to see the conversation, we don't meet up with anyone without the other there and we both have to feel comfortable for anything to happen. It happens that at this time he started a friendship with his best friends ex, who still lives with his best friend. I had always liked her but during their break up I didn't go over cause they fought alot and felt uncomfortable and I really just lost touch with her. So when he purposed that she were to be our unicorn I had mixed feelings about it, at the time I had asked to see their messages between one another and he said no cause there was a lot of flirting and thought it would make me a little crazy. 
The night it happened was a little strange, was fun but felt like I was the one out. Over the next month we all hung out (not sexual) and even went camping together near the end of the summer. 
After that things felt strained between my husband and I, we were already dealing with problems, both had a drug problem and he had a gambling problem on top of it. Since about September our relationship has been very strained, I grew suspicious of him cause I knew he was still talking to her and seeing her as he sold her weed. Anytime I brought it up I was told I was paranoid and crazy. Reading into it too much. He has always been super diligent to make sure any of his devices we're password protected and never left his phone face up around me. I have made choices in the recent months to get healthy get off the drugs and get my shit together and have been trying to get him to do the same (there is a post I made as he started to detox about odd withdrawal symptoms he had) and I have locked him out of my bank accounts etc to ensure I can pay bills and put food on the table etc which started yet another fight about how everything he does he does for me, that I am being selfish and paranoid and just looking for an out of this relationship. Maybe I was, maybe I just know things felt off. He would disappear for hours at a time, take off to another city and get ""stranded"" there. 
I needed a laptop to finish some work at home this week during my vacation and he set me up an account on his laptop to do so. My intention wasn't to Snoop around and ""hack"" his account, but I couldn't help myself. He has his account password protected but I know the usual passwords he uses and opened up his Facebook which was already logged in. Their conversation was at the very top, and I started to delve into months of him asking if he can come over. Some are pretty usual texts between friends, how was your day, how is life with shit head (her ex, his friend who she still lives with) but some cross a line for sure. Asking her to find a babysitter for NYE so he could take her to a kink party, sending her pictures of an air mattress in the back of his truck asking for a quickie. I know he has seen her face to face but I don't know if anything has actually happened because most of her responses are silence or sorry just saw your message now, it can't find a babysitter etc. But the messages from him show actively trying to hook up with her. There is also text messages on his phone I am sure but I don't have access to them.

What the fuck do I do? I sent her a private message asking her if he is trying to hook up, also asking woman to woman if anything has happened between then without me. I didn't tell her I read the messages either, hoping she will be honest with me and tell me the truth.",15Mar2020,1

As of now he’s still supposed to go to into work tomorrow as normal. No screening of patients was done last week. Nothing besides extra hand washing on his part. 
Apparently now they are supposed to be screening patients over the phone before they schedule them. Useless if you ask me. He touches patients on a regular basis, he has to. There is no social distancing happening at the office. I really don’t want him going in.

519,"
Hey all! So I am getting the feeling my cousin, who lives with us currently, is a sociopath or narcissist. Now these are pretty strong words, so I wanted to see reddit’s take on it. 

I was born/raised in the US. But my parents were born in an asian country, moving here when they were between 19-22. Most summers we would spend in our country of origin. We lived a relatively comfortable life in america. And these trips taught us siblings a lot about our culture, family, and just how lucky we are to be in a free country. We would visit our large family, and enjoyed meeting/playing with many cousins.

One thing to note is there was a revolution in this country that occurred just after my parents moved away. Many tell me the behaviors and culture of the people was much more pure before that. Openness/honesty being the main thing lost. My parents are quite genuine, but over time we found out some of our fam is not. They were scammed by a sibling of theirs for ex.  Not to say they are all bad tho, most of them are great people. 

Parents made an effort to green-card sponsor their siblings. This is time consuming, costly, and is like a 10+ year process. But did it out of love. I have other fam in the other states, but most back in asia. 

Recently my cousin (dads niece) was able to gain residency in december. Her, my sister, and I are in mid 20’s. I work in my family business. My sister does not and is finishing up training for her phd level job. We all live at home. But our home is large enough to have separate rooms. I work in my family business. We are not a huge company making millions a year in profit, but we do ok for ourselves. Also have the potential for large growth. 

My cousins undergrad field of study is related to the work we do. And my father has stated to her in the past that he could help her gain experience in that field when she is able to move here. She came from a not so good household, where her father would emotionally/physically abuse them. Her parents are divorced. And she has lived on her own with her sis since 19 making her own way with some support time to time from her dad. 

My sister was closer to her as a child than I. But we all enjoyed each others company as kids. She gets here and my dad is excited to help her start a new life. He visioned a future where we would all work together as our company grows to be more successful. 

When she came here we were all very happy. She has her own room. Got her a new phone, computer, and other things so she could work better. Us siblings have also have taken her out to explore american life and have her meet our friends. She can seem very nice at times. But she doesnt really talk much about herself or plans unless we initiate. But she seems to talk a ton on the phone to her friends and 1 other cousin in the states.

Here are some odd things I have experienced with her. 
-Sis was telling me how she decided not to start a convo one day while they were out, and cuz said nothing at all. When they were gone I invited cuz out with my friends over text. And she never told my sister (we all know the same people). When they got home I naturally told the plan to both of them and my sis felt odd that she never said anything about it. 

-This cousin was arrange married briefly, then divorced. This makes it difficult to gain a greencard. She somehow managed to remove the legal history of the marriage. Even her own sister does not know how my cuz did it, and was flustered as she was not able to come to america due to her own previous marriage. 

-When she got here she was telling my sis how she is looking for a bf. this is fine. We later find out she has a courter who has intention to ask her hand in marriage. These 2 went on trips with one another, and she still talks to this guy. He even was accepted to a local uni here (by chance) and may move here. This gave me a bad feeling she is leading on a man, while looking for a bf. Keeping options open i guess? 

-one day at work she tells me she is going to the grocery store to get some baked goods. I give her my card and ask her to buy me a snack as well (she has her own debit card btw and some money, but I pay for her wherever we go as the dollar is worth much more than their currency). She is gone for an hour, but the store is right next door. The next day she says the same thing, I peer out the window and see her go in the opposite direction of the store. She then comes back 10 mins later. Grabs a paper from her desk. Then rushingly leaves again without a word for a while. I suspect she went to the bank to apply for a credit card. This is fine. But not sure why all the hiding/lying. This broke my heart as we brought her into our very open and honest home. And if she wanted a credit card i could have guided her to get approved by a good one. 

-she is on the phone a lot. And talks a lot to other people. But not much to us. My sister pays for her everywhere out of unconditional love. But she never offers to do so in return (not obliged to), and no thank you’s either. 

-we have seen signs she wants to apply to firms in her field. We do similar work, but not exactly the same. I offered to help her write a resume. She said she would email it. Never did. This is ok. But she got help from a random friend in asia. Which again is ok. But my sis and I are more experienced with resume customs here. 

-the other day we talked with her to see what her plan is. And how we could help her reach her life goals. She is working with us now, and can continue to do so and potentially be very successful. But she is free to do anything else she likes as well, and be successful. We just feel her not being clear and vague leads us to invest time and hopes in her staying with us long term. But we do not feel this is her agenda. Which again is fine. We just want to be clear so we can act accordingly to help her on her own journey. She tells us there is no reason/need to give her plans to us at all. Finally she says her plan is to get her degree paperwork sent over in a couple months. Then apply for internships and jobs in her exact field. I say this is good she is telling us now. And list off several todo’s so such as getting certification for topics in her field, and how she can structure her experience in her resume. I tried to tell her this is a good thing she is more open. As we can assist accordingly. 

-one day she comes home from work. Gets ready. Then leaves to go out. My mother sees this and says bye to her, and out of conversation asks where she is going. she says she has plans with my mothers niece. If we did not ask she would have just left no word. Which is fine. She does not have to share her plan with anyone. But just the gesture of saying bye would be nice and is what we do in america. 



Now she may just not trust us. Where we come from people have become untrustworthy in general. The ppl and even my own relatives gossip a lot. Talking negatively about others behind backs. Things so bad such as suggesting my own mother killed her mother for american insurance money lmao. My grndma had zero insurance. 

Right now she seems like the kind of person to constantly use others, and jump at the chance of better opportunities. Which is smart. But also cunning and not genuine. There is no need to really hide any of those intentions. And we made it clear if she wishes to go elsewhere that is fine with us. We will not hold anything back, and will help her along the way to the next step. Maybe she is afraid others will not help her if they know she will leave? Social politics type stuff. Or maybe she is actually a sociopath lol. 


Sorry for so long and no tldr :/",15Mar2020,1
520,"Hey Reddit. This is a throwaway account as you may have inferred by the name. I'm too embarrassed to send this on my main for fear of my friends seeing.

I'm currently a student in the USA pursuing a career in game design. I am in my second year of university and have practically gotten a free ride. I've been real lucky for that.

Last year, I failed classes in two out of my three terms. This year, I was considering dropping out before the first term, but I decided to try and stick it out and see if things would improve. I did somewhat okay last term,  but this one I've done absolutely horrible in. For some reason, I find it extremely hard to garner motivation for any one of my classes. I love game design and I want to make my own game some day. I'd like to think I'm not someone who just talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk, because in the past I've been able to dedicate myself to projects and produce what I think are amazing results. So I don't think it's that I'm not interested in game design. I just don't know why I can't get myself invested into my classes. I've thought that maybe college just isn't for me. But I don't know if that's the truth, or if it's just me being lazy. I don't know anymore. I don't THINK I am lazy, because like I said, I've worked on games before and have gone nuts with developing someone I am inspired by. I do have lots of motivation, it's all there, but not motivation to work on any of my classes. 

I've been constantly debating with myself whether I am to blame for this, whether it's a bad work ethic or not. I think/hope I have a good work ethic, but I have nothing to show for it. Never held a real job apart from some small volunteer service over the years. If I want to do something, I can dedicate myself to it entirely. I don't sit around playing games all day unless I feel exceptionally depressed or if I'm feeling unmotivated with game dev (it does happen from time to time, as I bet it does for everyone. but in general, I'd say I am pretty motivated to work on game dev.)

I fear that if I dropped out of college, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. My parents would be disappointed for sure, but I wouldn't have to worry about them kicking me out. They'd probably make me get a job, which is a double-edged sword in my opinion. I recognize that it would be very good for work ethic, and I already kinda feel like a leech of society for not having a job at the age of 20. I try to make up excuses for myself by saying I do community service, or that I work on volunteer (free) games, but I don't think those cut it. If I got a job, I'd be making some income and would get work experience. But it would take away my time from learning game development by myself. I trust myself enough that, if I were to drop out, I wouldn't use that time playing games all day and browsing Reddit. I have a few passion projects in mind that I would put my heart and soul into if I dropped out. But I'm just so conflicted with everything stated above, that I just don't know what to do.

If I could get any advice on my situation, I would greatly appreciate it. If you have any more questions just ask and I'll respond. Thanks.",15Mar2020,1
521,"Hey guys, i can hear my neighbor in the next room cry for weeks now almost every day. I don't know her or anything but i am very concerned. Sometimes she is crying quietly and sometimes she is arguing very loud (on the phone i guess), i don't know about what tho because i don't speak her language. I really don't know what to do. I also live in a big town, so i think going to talk to her as 'the friendly neighbor' is kinda weird. And she is also thai and I am not, so i doubt she would open up to me. Is there anything i can do?",15Mar2020,1
522,"So to start I'm 17M, currently a junior in high school. 

Lately I've realized that I don't really love my parents. There's nothing wrong they did, they raised me pretty well, provided me with a lot, care for me, and I'm grateful for all of that. But I just can't feel love towards them. There's no connection between us.

I don't really share any interests with either parent, and spending time with them can be exhausting. I know they love me and want to have a relationship with their son, but I just can't reciprocate that.

I feel really guilty because of it. I'm not sure what to do, it's not like I can just tell them ""Hey sorry but I don't love you"". 

Any advice?",15Mar2020,1
523,"My mum is completely ignorant of how dangerous this thing is to her. shes 60 a smoker has diabetes and on cancer meds, the virus is confirmed in our county and she cant seem to grasp that 1 confirmed doesnt mean there is only one person with it, any time i try to warn her she makes fun of me how do i make her understand if she gets it she will probably die",15Mar2020,1
524,"I found out my younger sister 10 years old is depressed, self harming and having suicidal thoughts. I’m unsure of what I should do. She is not aware that I know. I know on my own I cannot do much to help her I’ve tried but I just honestly cannot. I don’t know if I should tell my parents because I don’t know if they can handle it properly or if it will just make things worse for my sister. She is so young so I’m unsure if it’s a phase she’ll get through (her best friend recently moved away) or if this will effect her in the long run. All help is appreciated",15Mar2020,1
525,"Hi I’m new to this so I’m sorry if this is a weird topic to ask for advice about. So I live a three story building with a neigh directly beside me, and a neighbor directly below me. The one below me recently moved in, but I’ve never ever seen him. He doesn’t seem to have a vehicle either. The windows to his place used to be see through, but he replaced them so they’re opaque. He bought brand new blind for the door window as well. Some people like they’re privacy I know, but kind of sketchy. So the real kicker is, almost every single night, I’m woken up to this man screaming/yelling in horror/pain. Just once or twice then it stops. It used to scare the crap out of me but I’m getting used to it. I just want to know why he does this and if I should try and ask him? I’m scared of him to be honest.

527,"When I was 10y/o I befriended this girl. She was funny, witty and very smart. I enjoyed spending time with her. She moved out, due to this we didn’t talk or have any contact at all for over a year.

Then a friend of her who I barely knew gave me her number, because she wanted us to hang out again. I was happy, because I had been waiting for this too and I had missed her. We were about 12 y/o at this point.

That’s when it starts to get annoying. She would message me every single day. I didn’t ignore her messagee because I felt bad for her, she had some mental health issues -she doesn’t now. So I kept answering and pretending to not feel annoyed by her insistence. I felt guilty because I thought I had to enjoy texting to her -and still feel like this nowadays. So we hung out like maybe once every six months and she was still great to hang out with.

Until a year ago. These last times we’ve been hanging out have been shitty. 

She doesn’t care about what I want to do. I remember one time she got mad because I didn’t want to go for a walk. I tried to explain to her that it was summer, it was super hot and extremely crowded. She wouldn’t listen. I gave in and we went. She said “OK, I’ll find another friend to go with”.

She doesn’t understand how to treat people. I made a realistic drawing of her for my birthday, painted it with Copics (expensive markers) and gave it to her among with 20€. She proceeded to tell me how shitty the drawing was, multiple times. As an artsy kid, this was hurtful because I did my best to create a decent drawing. Plus, it was a present I spent three hours doing.

Another time she came over to my house and proceeded to tell me like ten times how “Your sister has stolen all your beauty”. Wow, thank you bitch, my self esteem has skyrocketed. She told me to get a nose job too! Who the fuck says that? Also, she won’t shut up about how beautiful she is and how pretty she looks with natural makeup. I find pretentious people extremely annoying. Don’t stop reading, it gets worse. Last time we had a sleepover at my house. She wound’t keep her hands off my IPad. She’d use it as a toy, recording while running around the house like a little kid would do. IPads aren’t exactly cheap, and she knows that, but its not her’s so who cares? She also forced me to crush an organic cucumber -which was meant to be eaten- to make a dumb face mask. She knows I have trouble sleeping and that night I went to sleep at 5am. She woke me up at 8am because she was hungry. Who the fuck wakes someone with sleeping problems up? She then proceeded to go downstairs and accidentally make the alarm go off, waking everyone up. I wouldn’t have cared, because this is something that can happen by accident. BUT she went to bed like nothing happened instead of telling my dad. After breakfast, while I was sleeping, she took my sister’s sketchbook and drew on it without asking her. It annoyed me a lot because that sketchbook was a present I made to my sister, and the pages are sewed, so after she teared the page off the other pages came off, ruining the sketchbook. She would follow me everywhere in the house and invade my personal space constantly. It was draining as fuck and it took everything within me to not get mad and tell her to fuck off. This last sleepover was the last straw for my parents, who have always found annoying how she wanted to invite herself to my house, and they told me she can’t come over to our house ever again. And I don’t want to her to come over either. You are probably asking yourselves if we are still 12, but we’re 16! 

She only messages me when she’s bored to hang out and ALWAYS asks to come over to my house. Plus, it has to be the time she wants which is usually having lunch. What I am saying is that I’d rather have lunch at home and then hang out a couple of hours, because I enjoy it more. But she doesnt’ bother to listen to what I want to do. When we hang out most of the time I feel bored, because I don’t feel there’s “friend chemistry” between us anymore. When I go to her house I feel very uncomfortable because her stepdad is a kinda shitty person and I can’t help perceiveing him as a threat. We don’t have school for two weeks because of the coronavirus thing and she has been asking daily if she can come over to my house to have lunch. It is hella fucking annoying. I don’t understand how she doesn’t get that our friendship is dead.

I am tired of this situation and don’t know what to do. Talking to her in a reasonable way is something I can’t do because she won’t listen at all as I’ve said before. I feel like fucking shit because I don’t want to be the one who breaks up friendships, I know that shit hurts because I have experienced it myself. But I honestly feel like this is too much. She even wants to rent a flat and live together when we go to university, which I find delusional.

If anyone knows how to solve this, I’d be super thankful.",15Mar2020,1

531,"Look, I love my mom a lot, and I know everything she do is because she's worried about me, but she never gave me the opportunity to grow up inside, and  looks like she will never let me.
For a little more of context, yesterday I went in a date with a guy that I already knew, it was really nice and I was surprised she even let me go in the first place. The guy took me back home and its was 7pm, still early in the night. When I saw my cellphone, there was a lot of messages and calls from her. I went to my apartament and talked to her how the date went. But she got angry at me because I said that I kissed the guy, she started saying how she couldn't trust me, all because of a kiss, I got a little mad, like, damn. 
I don't want her worrying so much about me, I love her but I can't stop thinking how much I make her stressed when I'm out, but I really want to have a life. In my last relationship, I could never hang out past 22 PM, because she wanted to sleep and didn't want me coming back late in a uber or let me sleep in my boyfriend's house. If she trusted me a little and let me sleep in my bf's house, she wouldn't had to think about getting out of home to take me back when she wanted to be doing her stuff. Everytime I hang out, I think I'm a burden to her, and I don't want that. I know so much girls that are always hanging out late in the night and the are always fine.
I don't want to lie to her anymore, all my last relationship was a lie to her because she didn't let me do nothing, I'm a tennager that's is going to be 20 years old this year, I want to do what I want now. The guy I'm hanging out lives in another city, not so far away from mine but a little, and I can't see it working if I don't go hang out or sleep in his house sometimes. I'm young, of course I may be a little horny, but I don't want to hide it from her, I don't want to take a bus to next city, worrying that she will find out and will never trust me again. How can I gain her trust if she never let me do anything? I too scared to talk to her about it because she's so crazy about everything, I don't know what should I do...


TL;DR: I'm a 19 that want to do young people stuff (no drugs of course) with the guy I'm hanging out, however, he lives in another city and asked if I wanted to sleep in his house someday. Mom never let me sleep or visit in my Ex's house (Wich I had a 2 years relationship with.). How to gain her trust if she never let me do anything or never talked to me about sex and stuff.

533,"Hello all.  To make it short and sweet, I am 21 and my parents are very unconvinced with my ability to be an adult.  Their attitude always destroys my motivation and confidence that I can make something for myself.  Especially when it comes to money.  I have 2 credit cards with 3-5% cashback on gas and groceries I have always payed in full, and on time.  I have a credit score of 705, I have thousands in investment’s I’ve had for close to a year and I have yet to lose money.  And I recently flipped 3 cars netting $6,000, selling off my gas guzzling SUV and buying myself an extremely fuel efficient Audi diesel.  They’re fully aware of all these small victories but are NEVER impressed.  Now I’m not sure if they’re stuck in their ways but my mom especially recommended (always with a tone implying I can’t handle it) that I not get credit cards, not invest, and instead buy everything with cash like a fool.  My question to you IS, where can I find someone to build me up and recognize my capability.  I love my parents and I’m not here disowning them but moving forward into my professional life I would like less input from them and more from a positive voice.  Can anyone help?

However, I can’t help but realize how much worse I am than him. I’ve even made a list to see how many things he’s better than me at. My problem is that I always get a bit jealous and I’m very happy for him, but I just want to be able to be good at something. My brother made the varsity rugby team his freshmen year and I also tried out this year and became a lower end bench player for the JV team. He’s popular at school and is friends with so many people even people in my grade who would never associate with me. Meanwhile, I have no best friend and only hangout with 0-2 people most of the time. He has a girlfriend and is very good looking while I look nothing like him and even others can never tell we’re brothers. Looking at his freshman year, he took much harder classes than me scoring a 4.00 gpa both semesters while I got a 3.86 and probably a 3.7 or less this semester while taking easy classes. Even my friends tell me that “you’re brother got all the good genes”. Not to mention a time when my own grandma told me that I was ugly compared to my brother. Now I’m not trying to be petty or anything, but I want to know how I can start to lose this feeling, excel at a certain thing, and start enjoying my life as I watch him have so much fun in high school while I’m wasting it away crying myself to sleep each night thinking about why I’m not anything like him.",15Mar2020,1

C1- younger cousin owns the purse)
C2- Older cousin
Ef1- entitled friend 1

We told EF1 that it was out already and he couldnt hit it, but we told EF2 that she could hit it because shes not much of a fiend. Fast foward, EF1 told me that he looked through her purse and saw that the pen was half full. EF2 saw that he was looking through it but never told him to stop. I texted my C1 and C2 that he looked through the purse. They were livid, so they told their dad (Uncle). 20 minutes pass by and Uncle comes into my room and says, “If you ever go through my daughters purse again you’re gonna regret it” EF1 has a mental breakdown and starts clenching his fists. I leave the room and go back to my cousins. They leave and as the day is ending EF1 start texting in our group chat saying how I’m fake for telling my cousins he was invading her privacy  Im thinking more and more.

Torn between staying in PA or NY.

I recently moved to a tiny 2 bedroom in New York with a random roommate in apartment complex filled with college students. The school was closed down and dorms evacuated. I left in a panic one week ago and asked a friend to pick me up to stay with them temporarily. 

In PA, I'm in a suburban house in the woods. Its isolated here but few stores in the county. 22 confirmed cases are here! I'm with my friend who still visits parents and others, so my social distancing is pointless.

The first confirmed case in my city was yesterday. I know it is going to blow up there, which is why I left.. only for it to blow up HERE. I dont trust my roommate or friend since they are not social distancing or self quarantine. 

I miss grocery delivery and our walks outside in New York. But dread the tiny apartment complex where people are unavoidable. Yet seeing people is refreshing as I am a loner. Still its ""my"" apartment and close to feeling like home.

In Pennsylvania i like having a backyard for my dog. I like having the company of someone here, because in New York i dont know anyone yet. My friend isnt fun and doesnt interact much with me, so even though it's nice to have him here, it's bad energy. 

I'm depressed and this feeling goes with me wherever I move. I'm always searching for home and each place is a trade off.

543,"Ok so I have this friend who I met about 5 years ago through social media. Let me start first by describing our friendship. I’d say we’re fairly close friends to be honest. We’ve been through a lot of shit. At first when we started talking, we got in to arguments over the stupidest reasons, we don’t argue anymore as we learned to get past it and matured. She tells me anything because she trusts me. She even would tell me how much she admires, appreciates and love me. We used to text each other paragraph after graphs exposing how we feel and occasionally we have deep intellectual conversations which I we both enjoy. We would stay up and text or call each other almost every other night and talk about anything. We’re a bit older now and don’t talk as much because ya know... responsibilities. But that’s life and I still consider her a close friend and I’m glad I met her. I’d say we’re pretty much the same in terms of common interests.


The crazy part is that our birthdays are in the same month!! Our birthdays are in April, but mine comes a day before hers. Mine is the 26th and hers is the 27th. Coincidence? 


Maybe...sometimes I like to think we were meant to cross paths and she says the same thing too. Also we both been wanting to see each other in person in a few years, but I’m not sure how I would tell my parents about her. Yeah they don’t know her and I’m worried if I do tell them about her and say that I want to meet her, they’ll say no. Even if they do meet her and get to know her,I still think they’ll hesitate. My parents are kinda protective over me when it comes to people they don’t know. I know they care about my safety and all, but still I feel like they should allow me to travel and my parents have become a bit more lenient towards me and what I hat I do outside the house. Back then, they were kinda strict. But anyways, do you guys have any advice on how I should handle this? And side note I’m 20 living with parents sigh",15Mar2020,1
544,"I'm currently learning how to drive, and unfortunately I'm apprehensive about still having them due to the coronavirus. I'm 23, currently at university and living with my nan. While I have asthma, my nan unfortunately has COPD and is 77 next month. She has problems with her breathing due to this, as well as other issues like coughing. I'm already very careful about catching anything. At university I'll wipe down keyboard and the mouse before use, always washing my hands and making sure to stay away from ill people (which I'm extra careful about now). But my driving lessons are 2 hours long, and my driving instructor has mentioned he has a lot of students from university who he teaches. This makes me anxious because I'm worried he might catch it and pass it onto me. A student at my university has caught the virus, and there are more cases around my area but just undiagnosed.  I do wash my hands after driving lessons to be safe, but being next to someone for 2 hours would surely pass the virus along? 

I have pre-paid for 10 hours (5 lessons), I have another one booked for Wednesday but none after that. I would not ask for a refund because I do intend on carrying on learning how to drive, but I'm unsure if I should postpone my driving lessons? Also I don't want to come across as silly to the driving instructor asking if we can postpone and it's making me nervous to ask about it. Any advice about what to do in this situation, how to go about it and if postponing driving lessons is too much? Thank you :)",15Mar2020,1

Some people seem to assume I have a disability and act sweet and careful with me. Dudes who wanna smash don’t care.

So we commute to work together, see each other at work, but I’ve lived independently since I was 22 and now live with my boyfriend. She lives alone but sees her boyfriend several times a week, but doesn’t really have a social life. That’s her choice, because she enjoys spending time alone and being an introvert. We also see each other usually at some point during the weekend. 

But I reach little breaking points sometimes where I feel really annoyed with her and just overwhelmed. I wish she wanted to get out of the house more or that she had friends to do things with. I’m never “forced” to hang out with her, I truly want to, but sometimes I need a break but she would never feel that way about me.. So I feel like an awful person for feeling smothered at times. She is amazing mother and has always put my brother and me first. I’ve also felt such extreme guilt for moving out at a young age (basically 18 bc i went to school) but she’s always assured me that I’m free to do whatever I want and she’s never made me feel badly about it. I’m forcing this guilt on myself. Question is: how do i get over all of this guilt??

So while I was on reddit the other day, I commented on a girl’s r/toastme post. Just to give them support, the cliche things. Since then, they’ve been privately messaging me a bunch.

Plus, she’s sent me a couple pictures of herself (nothing bad, just asking which way she should style her hair), and that’s really making me feel uncomfortable. 

I feel really bad though, because she talks about having no friends. But she wants me to message her every day. Besides the awkward age gap, I honestly just don’t want to talk to an 11 year old all day, every day.

It started in 2014, after the death of a loved one and then being a spectator from afar of a friend's death after an accident. Tried to get help once, had a bad experience with the therapist and didn't try again. Over the years I've had the depression manifest into physical symptoms like aches n pains, skin problems, sleep issues and what not. Intrusive thoughts are constant, and even though I've gotten much better at dealing with them, they still suck the life out of me. 

I've always been a very sensitive and empathetic person, which is what just makes everything exponentially worse most of the time. 

Lately I've been dealing with another issue which I don't understand. I have sudden moments of feeling like this is all a dream. I suddenly feel disconnected from the moment and question if this is really happening... like maybe I'm not really here or looking at this from the outside. This happens randomly during the day and started about 3 weeks ago. 

What's happening? Am I getting worse? What do I do when I just don't want to do anything?

Okay, here’s some context:
I’m a 19 and my ex broke up with me on New Year’s Day this year. Since then, we’ve had a friends with benefits sort of relationship. We still are very good friends in the way we still hang out at least once a week and the fights we’ve had are very civil and end pretty well. The reason we broke up was because my parents don’t want me to be in a relationship and we were a secret for 10 months. Throughout our relationship we went on a “break” where he was talking and doing things with another girl while I was off in another state for military training (where I didn’t want mess around with other guys even if I wanted to). And right after we broke up literally at the beginning of this year, he immediately started talking to another girl who he was interested in for years and was still interested in when we started dating. Here’s the thing that makes my head hurt even more when I think about how to approach this. He still talks about wanting me back to the point we’re still talking about marrying in the future. I can’t be living in the delusion. The relationship he has with the new girl he’s been seeing has to be a secret because they’re both supervisors at their work place (they work at the same place) and they could lose their jobs for it if word goes around about them since their job strictly doesn’t allow relationships between people in higher positions. The girl has expressed to him that she doesn’t want a relationship with him but he answers all her calls, calls her anytime he can, and texts her whenever possible. I’ve tried to keep my distance and express that I’m not okay with him doing this to me but I also respect whatever is happening enough to keep it civil. I accidentally slipped and told his mom about it the other day when he was out of the room. I told her not to tell it to anyone including him. I love her to bits and pieces but, she has a hard time keeping secrets. I still want to have him in my life if possible because he is a really good friend. He’s helped me through a lot including a time where I’ve been suicidal.

581,"This will be a little lengthy because of backstory. I (M 30) met this girl that’s significantly younger about a month- month-1/2 and we hit it off immediately! We had great chemistry and conversations. We went on 2 dates and they too were amazing dates. However after realizing we had different views on life and sex and how to carry one self, we decided that friendship would be best rather then starting a romantic relationship, that would not doubt be amazing but I’m sure take a spiral into a pit of flames. 
I do still have some lingering feelings for her, but I realize there is absolutely 0 chance of anything happening which I’m fine with. Unfortunately she started talking to her ex bf again and she’s shared with me that in the 4 times they’ve hung out he’s intimidated her in one way or another. He threatened to take her phone I guess that he’s paying for, which is a weird connection between them, anyway, I guess he didn’t hit her but gave her a hard shake and and cornered her, and then pressured her to have sex. 
I try to tell her that if he’s doing this already and he’s actually trying to get you back, what’s going to happen when he has you back?

She shrugs it off and says he’s being more communicative and being nicer, then I find out she’s moving in with him to be able to afford an apartment. I tried to tell her how bad of an idea it is and even offered her to be my roommate or to help her find another college student to be her roommate. 

Should I directly spell it out for her the danger of moving in with someone that is abusive and the toll it’s likely to take on her life? Or should I stay out of it and let her figure it out? So far she hasn’t taken much if any of my advice and I’m worried I’ll chase her off and when the time comes she really needs someone it won’t be there.

I'm not a druggy but I do smoke weed sometimes and that's how that stuck.

I graduated from college in May of 2019. 
I was blessed to be able to line up a job before I even graduated. I’m working as a documentation administrator for a mid size company in Uptown, Charlotte. I make decent money....$42,000 at age 22, not bad, especially in Charlotte. 
But I’ve been here almost a year now and I’m just not all that happy. 
Working a desk job M-F from 9-5 is no fun. I don’t really talk to any of my coworkers so there’s no way to have a good working culture here either. 
 I feel like my work offers no real value and I’m not helping anyone except the owners and salesmen get richer by the day. 
Should I explore other career opportunities? Even though this is the only real professional experience I have. Or should I learn to appreciate the 9-5 desk job?

I’m wondering if anyone can give me any advice. What you would do in my situation. What you’re doing in your own. If this is the wrong kind of post for this sub I apologize. It’s definitely personal finance but also I’m just looking for advice.

With corona virus ravaging the world it’s really got me rethinking my plans in the next few months. The last few years I’ve spent doing a lot of traveling and seasonal jobs and I’ve really enjoyed it. I have a seasonal job coming up at the end of May that I’m really looking forward to. It’s a going to be a great experience in an awesome place. It will be a nice chunk of money, around 10,000 net, for just under 2 months of work. 

That being said I have a pretty good job right now. It’s nothing great but the pay is decent. I just got a raise. I’ve got full benefits and there’s no chance of the virus affecting my pay/hours/job security. I don’t necessarily hate the job but I don’t love it. I know I would enjoy the seasonal job so much more but in the long term I’m wondering is 10 grand worth having nothing lined up when August rolls around. 

Is the job market going to be terrible then because of the virus? Will I have a really tough time finding work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My father hit 70 this month and he is slowly becoming more and more difficult. I am a late child and I live with him, mainly two of us, sometimes the woman that took care of him when he was heavily sick visits. 

I don't think I can recollect beautiful family memories or a good supporting conversation with him, but nevertheless he did his best to be a good father. Never could I imagine that by 70 he would become an internet addict. He spends all his free time (which is about 12h a day) at Facebook, adding friends, reposting images and laughing. He doesn't have real friends and loves being a loner, but those ""friends"" at fb make him feel successful. The sad thing is now he lies all day, doesn't go outside, claims that he has an headache, visits bathroom with the laptop,and overall, his physical and mental health deteorates. 

I installed blocksite and stayfocused plug-ins to limit the time he spends online up to 4h, but now he spends this timeline intensely and can be very angry with no reason. 

Never thought my life would come to this by 2020. Does anyone have the same experience, what shall I do?",15Mar2020,1

For some background me and my gf work in the same family owned company, work is totally bs and they are beyond disorganized, I have been working there for about 6 years or so because they used to pay me real good compared to anything else from the poor country I'm from (venezuela). Since we are working there to the present my gf and I have been saving most if not all the money we get to move abroad and start a new life, so to make that happen quicker besides our regular jobs with the company we also took jobs house sitting and dog sitting our bosses house/pets, with the promise on their part that they would be our visa sponsors to move abroad and cover our relocation and housing costs, that was our golden ticket sort to speak.

Fast forward they provided us with money for food alone for 3 years, but no salary for any of the job with did but the promise that we would get paid in full when we moved. They stretched definitively the plane ticket to move there until i proposed that we could buy our own plane ticket there and they could repay us the cost once we got there, they said it was a terrific idea and at the moment they didn't have to repay the ticket but in a week they would have a lot of cash due to some big projects.

Bottom line we arrive to see that they are broke, the apartment they let us stay in has the rent due 4 months ago we could get kicked at any second (I think we don't get kicked because the owner knows our situation), the company is as we speak going bankrupt, no proof at all that our visa or working permits are actually being processed. we haven't gotten paid the 3 months that we worked on site in the new country(plus the other 3 years of work), their bank is taking their asset and they have police detention order for fraud.

I am incredibly burned out from working and studying non stop for I don't know how long and this floored me, I currently been struggling a lot to think of a solution or a plan on what to do next but it's like if my brain took a vacation, can't think more than like 1 hour ahead or what could i do to eat the next meal.

Been trying to the best of my abilities to get out of this mess and doing things to improve me and my odds of success like polishing my resume and studying some coding online, polished my CV, submit it to get new job offers(none yet), I go to the gym often, meditate, try to read or do things to get my mind off things, but quite frankly this is overwhelming and my brain is totally unresponsive and I dissociate more than I stay present (talked to my therapist on the phone about it, she gave some consultation on the phone for free, but then she got into problems of her own and can't do it anymore).

Maybe I got scammed, maybe it was a series of unfortunate events I don't know.

598,"So this is a throwaway as I am going to be sharing a lot of details. 
Tldr at the bottom 

My mother has quite an odd education/work experience in her life.(I'll explain on that later)

Currently she's working in a job that makes her stand for 9 to 10 hours trying to sell creams and high end facial stuff to people who pass by their stall. Kind of like a promoter but a permanent one. 

The salary arrangement for this job is a very strange one. She doesn't get a monthly income. It's all based on her comission and how much product she sells. At first I thought it was some kind of MLM cuz I never heard this type of job. But it's an actual company and a very bougie one that's in most malls in this country.

In the end if she doesn't sell she doesn't get paid at all. 

So there are many problems as you can see with this job but it doesn't stop there. She barely gets holiday and sick leafs. 
She gets about one day off from the week and one week off every 5 - 6 months.

She comes home everyday like a zombie and just eats and sleeps. Today we had a major fight becuase of some reason and she began telling me how stressed she is everyday and how business is hard because of the virus. 
So I asked her why doesn't she quit as I do many times but she gave the following reasons. 

1 - visa: she needs visa to stay in this country (Asian country) and most local companies don't give jobs and visas to foreigners so since this company is Australian they give visa with ease. 

2 - her English is not that good to work in an office job 

3 - her experience is mostly in retail and her education was in dance so it's not that useful anymore. She's done retail jobs for over 15 years. Its her expertise. But it's a very tasking job for her age right now so I want to steer away from retail jobs and get her something different.

4- she has very very low technology information. She doesn't know basic things like word and Excel and so on and to what I understand she believes it's impossible to learn at her age. 

So all these are the barriers to why she can't get a new job and I honestly don't know what to do. 

I can't support her as I am still in university and am struggling with some mental issues. (she doesn't know) 
 And my other family members aren't at the best state of their life either. 

I have no experience on work and I really don't know what she can do. She's working herself like a horse and has many psychical and mental problems right now. 

So I want to help but idk what jobs I can look for. I can help her find a new job I just don't know what job she would be suitable for. She also wants a job that can pay the bills but honestly I don't want money to be a priority at the moment. My father is paying my rent for uni and she is staying with me not paying rent and I already pay for food so she doesn't have much bills to pay for. 

I just want a job that she can have so she can just start saving money for herself till I finish university and also be able to stay in the country with the visa. 

So can anyone please help ! 

Tldr: mother has a very tasking job for her age. She can't find another becuase she has work experience in retail and nothing else. Bad at technology and English.

605,"So this might get a little long bear with me.

To start off ive been unemployed for the past year. I’ve been looking but this has caused me to stay with my not so great parents who I would like to get away from. I keep having interviews and all that but nothing has come through as of yet. Which is greatly taking a toll on me as again, I would like to move out. My home life is kind of a mess and my parents are in the midst of potentially divorcing as well as my dad not being able to keep a steady job. It’s not good.

So essentially to cope I mostly hang out or talk to my friends or I work on a creative project. Sometimes I’ll collaborate on a project too.

Here comes the problem:

Prior to me not having a job, I was working on a project with a friend. This was about two years ago. They were planning on moving out of state towards the end of the year. I took it slow but then things happened in their own personal life to cause them not to want to work on it.

I was fine with that and just wanted them to take their time as they’ve had their own fair share of issues.

Fast forward a bit and they find out that they can’t move and are also now unemployed. So while dealing with this they essentially like told me they didn’t want to work/finish the project. (They told me this while we were dealing with a fallout in a friend group)

We talked it out for a bit and they said we could finish it once they were all settled with everything. I said okay just let me know.

Fast forward once again to summer. I’m supposed to have surgery. After my surgery, while I’m still recovering, they ask if I want to work on the project. I told them no as I’m in immense pain and I highly doubt I could focus long enough to work on it.

Fast forward a couple months later, and they’ve gotten a job. However when I ask, they say that they’re not in the mood for it. I still really want to finish it but I’m getting sick of this so I just stop asking them.",15Mar2020,1

* Me (M27) and my girlfriend (26F) are moving in together this october. We have several months more to prepare for that (currently we are 8+ months together).

* We are both debt free, she has a stable job (1,5 years so far) and I have a job (7,5 years) that I'm considering leaving for another with the same pay. I make 230-250k HUF a month, she makes 185k, rent would cost 110k a month + we are buying the excellent furniture for a third of it's original price costing us another \~250k roughly (we searched for the retail value of each individual item specificly and it's combined value is around 680k)
* Renting the flat will be all documented and legal with a lawyer present, no catches
* The home is in excellent condition save for a cable hanging from the wall where they planned to put air conditioning but decided against (since they are moving to another country) and a few wall painting damages they'll fix up. Otherwise clean as it can be, no fungi in bathroom, good heating, and all.
* We have a shared google doc where we try to keep track of things (costs, what each of us want to bring or can bring if it's a neccessity from home).

613,"TW: Eating disorder 

This is going to be a long post, but I'll try and make it as short yet informative as possible. 

First, I am a minor (though I think I'm old enough to make these decisions), and as far as I know I can't refuse inpatient treatment if my parents decide to go that route. 

As for why they're wanting to send me off to an inpatient facility, it's a long story. I have a few mental health issues, such as anxiety and social anxiety. I would also consider myself depressed, though I avoid talking about that with anyone, and I've been handling it myself for years now. I'm not suicidal. 

The main reason they want to send me, though, is because in recent months I've been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. It's more ""atypical anorexia"", I would say, though in my opinion my problem isn't serious enough to be labeled as an eating disorder. I'm not underweight, I eat more than three meals a day, I still have my monthly cycle, etc. I am aware that in the past year I have developed some eating habits that aren't best. I am willing to cooperate and work on it, in fact, that's what I'm doing now. I visited my nutritionist for the first time in a few months a little over a week ago. They said that I had lost weight and gave me some food ideas to eat in addition to what I'm already eating, and I'm doing that every day.  Last I checked though, I'm maintaining my current weight but I'm not gaining any. 

I thought that was good enough as a starting point until I saw the messages between my parents, other family members, nutritionist, and counselor that works with the nutritionist. They're all in agreement that I should be sent to an inpatient facility. The only person to talk to me about this was my other therapist whom I've been seeing for a couple of years now, before any of this started. She told me that it was being considered, but she made it sound like I had a choice. However, from what I've read today, if my weigh-in with my nutritionist this week doesn't show that I've gained 4 pounds, then chances are they're sending me to inpatient. 

I can't really express how much I don't want to go to inpatient. I'm willing to work to fix whatever problem they believe I have, but throwing me in an impatient facility for over a month isn't going to fix the problem. I did outpatient therapy at a mental health facility for my anxiety last year, and we were in the same therapy groups as those who were in inpatient. It's akin to prison. You're confined to one space until someone else decides otherwise. You share a room with someone else. You're treated with little respect. Nothing from the outside world is allowed. Your family can only visit you on certain days and within certain time periods. Literally everyone there was miserable and said that being there wasn't helping. 

Honestly, I'm scared. I'm terrified. I feel like everyone in my life has banded together against me. I can't imagine being in inpatient, especially for that long, which is why I'm willing to do whatever it takes to avoid it. I mean, I went to summer camp for less than a week and I hated it. I've got a car, and I've seriously contemplated just driving away from everything should they tell me I have to go. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I don't really even know what advice I'm asking for. I just need something.",15Mar2020,1
614,"Some backstory  
We met online a few months ago, at first it was all formal talk and such, just a few texts here and there. But pretty quick we got much closer, started discussing about how our day went, what we had for breakfast, what we gonna have for dinner, plans for weekends and such. Pretty soon we started delving into more private matters, sex life, relationships, family stuff, friends etc.   
From texts we moved to talking on Whatsapp and Snapchat, sending pictures, videos and such to one another and at this point we spend up to 8h a day talking to each other. Our timezones are very different, so we usually have time talking in the morning and in the evening and...over the day I miss them. Like I've never missed anyone before, I mean its just a couple of hours before I can talk to them again but I got so used to it that at this point I think I got too attached to someone I never even met in person.   
I know pretty much all about them, their childhood, closest friends, family members and so do they about me. And I am pretty certain that I am in love with them, but I am not sure if its mutual. We did discuss how we would love to meet each other one day and that is my current goal. To be able to save up enough money to visit them soon enough.  


Now I am scared to get attached even more, because I am afraid that If I tell them my true feelings it might get too awkward and we would end up drifting apart. So I am stuck in this place where I would want more but too afraid to speak up.  


What should I do? Do I have the right to tell them about how I feel? How would I even approach such a situation, we are legit on different continents

She won’t talk to me, I’ve tried to be nice to her but all I get in return is her practically yelling at me(on a call) and being very rude and mean and he lets her treat me like that. When I’ve asked her why she doesn’t like me or what I did wrong, she says she doesn’t have to tell me. He doesn’t know the reason either. I’ve seen how this affects him and he’s also tired of this and I feel for him. I expected him to be more distant now that he’s in a relationship but I never expected this. I’ve done everything I can to have a normal friendship with him but I’m exhausted. Should I cut them off or continue in this very dramatic situation? I should also mention that this is a long distance friendship now so I haven’t even met her. It’s like he moved and just forgot about everyone in his “old life”. I hope I get some replies here because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.",15Mar2020,1

What does it mean when someone tried to change the story to when they weren’t around or you weren’t around?

618,"So I’ve been dating this guy for a month or so and I’ve recently started moving. I’m moving into my grandmothers house as my mom is kicking me out. I’m 18 btw, I can’t afford my own home. So I struck a deal with my grandma, I fix the room and I can move in. So I have to take all the wallpaper off, sand the walls of glue, and then paint. I’m in the sanding stage and it’s taking forever, so I asked my bf if he could help me move. The only problem is I’m very, very weak. I have a lot of old sports injuries (a dislocated shoulder that was never fixed properly and a knee condition) so it makes it a lot harder to fix up my room when I’m in pain from moving around so much. 

So he came over and basically sanded the entire wall for me while I tried my best to sand one spot. I usually use the electric sander but my grandma was sleeping when I got off work. But I felt really bad that he helped me and it made me embarrassed he didn’t even seem to have a problem and didn’t break a sweat. I don’t like seeming weak and he made me feel weak so I got annoyed. I bought him food because of how badly I felt for having him do the entire thing basically by himself. I should also clarify this isn’t a normal room, it’s really big, it used to be the family room, so it made me feel worse.",15Mar2020,1
619,"My best friend and I have been best friends for 10 years or so. But lately, I don’t feel like we are the same type of friends. I was arriving at her place last night for a small party for a mutual friend, there were already 5 people inside. As I’m about to go in, I hear laughter and then realize I’m the subject of discussion. For awhile I had been considering stripping temporarily due to a job loss. I had told her and her boyfriend because I considered us to be close and wanted support, not that I got it. She made it very clear she felt like it wasn’t a good environment and I wouldn’t want to do that. But either way, it’s not something I would want people I don’t know at all to know. It would be more of a private thing for me. So they’re talking about how I was going to do that and that I was supposed to show up for a shift and then just didn’t go (the manager texted me multiple times asking me when I was coming in and kept calling me doll after I submitted my photos, I just got the wrong vibe). Her brother is laughing saying “oh that sounds like a very —— thing to do.” She also said that they all wanted me to do it, which definitely doesn’t reflect what she had said to me. At this point, my stomach is turning into knots.  She offhandedly mentions I’m going to be there soon. This was right after they were talking about a drunk situation involving me and her brother’s girlfriend who I did make a mean joke to while very drunk because I was weirded out by their dating situation (he was 23 and she was 18).  I felt bad about it at the time and wasn’t proud of myself for acting that way and had talked to my friend about if I should apologize to either of them, and she said it wasn’t a big deal. Yet here they were laughing at another moment I wasn’t proud of in front of people I didn’t know. It wasn’t like they said anything intentionally cruel, it just felt like I was the joke. And this isn’t the first time this has happened either. I’ve heard her and her mom laugh about me while talking to her and her boyfriend for something else while in another room and they thought I couldn’t hear. I personally just don’t talk about my friends in that way when they aren’t around or think I can’t hear them. Is it just me or is this weird behavior?",15Mar2020,1

621,"Hello Everyone,

I’m 22f, I live in a tiny town in California right on the outskirts of LA and Bakersfield. Basically right in the middle of civilization is a place where I live that’s just desert and it’s basically hell.

Anyways I’ve been living here for 7 years now. I moved here from Oxnard when I was only 15 and have literally had every mental illness under the sun since coming here. Needless to say I was able to get it together graduate and through a lot struggling and ups and downs I’ve become a supervisor at an amazing job. 

When I turn 24 I will receive 100,000$ from a rust fund that my grandfather left to me. I turn 23 in June so I have basically one more year til that happens. As soon as it does I AM OUT. I am transferring my job over to LA and getting the f out of here. But here’s the problem...

I have one more year here and I feel like I’m falling apart. I have no support no friends no one to talk to. Everyday I try to work as much as I can because I’m so unbearably bored it’s ridiculous there is LITERALLY nothing to do. The people here are gross drugs are everywhere. I feel trapped I don’t know if I can do another year I don’t know what to do with myself during this time. I’m so depressed. 

And I don’t even know where to begin with getting all my stuff together to move to LA. I have an eviction on my record so that worries me.

Where do I start? What steps do I take to make this thing really happen? Just lost right night. I don’t know how to get through another year without messing something up or falling part I guess. Just need advice.",15Mar2020,1

623,"Hey Reddit, I need advice about my terrible bar manager. So they have the worst way of working in an even remotely sanitary manner, and on top of screwing us over for shifts or literally taking money that wasn’t tipped out to them, I’m at my wits end. With this whole pandemic going on they don’t give a crap and continue to re-use glasses if a customer is getting another beer, as in puts the inside of the glass up to the taps so it’s touching. They scoop ice with glass when there’s a plastic ice scoop RIGHT THERE in the bin to use (unhygienic as well as super dangerous!!!). They leave the soda gun *IN* the ice bin instead of putting it back on the holster. Sometimes it even falls into the sink, which is our hand washing sick and literally our slop bucket to pour out old drinks with old fruit and straws. We don’t have a three panel sink so that’s what we use. They rinse our rags to wash tables IN THAT SINK AND TOUCHES THE BOTTOM OF THE SINK! They hang rags to wipe tables literally over the side of the sink, half in half out. It’s the one thing I told them the other day to stop doing this please, it’s super unhygienic, and I come in a day later and there are three rags hanging off the side of the sink. Wtf. And they put bottles in the actual ice bin, if they need things to get cold faster or if they open a beer without meaning to, hoping to resell it to the next customer that orders that kind of beer. So the bottom of bottles are touching the ice that people drink out of. They don’t label juices which legally must be done, they re-use shakers that they just rinse off instead of putting through the dish washer, they get pitchers of soda ready for customers that just hangs out near the slop sink so she doesn’t have to bother pouring later, the list goes on and on. 
They’ve been working here for like 30 years so they’re super set in their ways and I don’t know what else to do.
I’ve talked to higher management about issues with this person regarding the scheduling and tip scenarios, but they are in the middle of changing the whole venue right now so it’s not really on the top of their priorities right now. I know if I bring all of this up too, it will just be swept under the rug (for now at least, which greatly upsets me because this is the time in which we need to practice good hygiene as much as possible). 
Any advice? Thanks a bunch in advance.",15Mar2020,1
624,"I was in a band and some of the closest fans of the band naturally messaged me on social media.

However, one night i was exchanging pictures with my girlfriend and I accidentally clicked on the 17 year olds name on Facebook chat instead of my girlfriend. She received naked pictures of both me and my girlfriend. I panicked, naturally. I told her that it was a mistake, that I clicked on the wrong name and asked if she could delete the pictures. She said she deleted them.

I’m only worried because my mom is putting my portfolio together soon and I need to decide what to do soon, if I go through with the GED thing she’ll have to write a letter and do all kinds of paperwork to have my file removed from homeschooling. 

I’m not very intelligent, I can barely make it through algebra and I am just the fudging worst in science. I mostly blame this on my lack of motivation and focus to learn complicated subjects, but my parents think that my heart just isn’t in it and I’d be better off focusing on getting a job and my learner’s permit. 

I’m disappointed in myself for being a ‘dropout’ and I think mom would feel ashamed if I didn’t just finish my last two years of school, but if I got done with school I’d have more time for work and driving practice. I’d also have more money for when I’m 18 because that’s when my parents decided I’ll be paying for my own phone, one or two bills, and my share of the rent (we rent a trailer.)

The owners of a pizza place downtown asked if I can start work in the summer time, I just need to fill out the form first, so I at least have somewhere to start if I go ahead with this.

He has a history of taking devices and not being able to control himself and not sleeping, so he has to even turn his cell phone in to either me or my parents when he goes to bed. I was really disappointed to see that he had snuck into my room at some point during the day and taken my old cell phone so that he could use it during the night, and on top of that he was using it to watch porn. I know that his age is the normal for wanting to explore sexuality and all that jazz, but he has an obsessive personality and I know that if he gets fixed on it that he might find himself not being able to stop.

634,"I live by myself in an apartment building with 12 units in a complex with a ton of buildings managed by a leasing company. One of my neighbors smokes  A LOT of weed, but I don't know which apartment it is. This has been ongoing since I moved in a few months ago but my work schedule has such weird hours that I'm only occasionally at home while they're smoking. Cut to coronavirus, and now everyone in the building is home all the time, and they're clearly smoking all the time. I woke up around 9:00 this morning and immediately could smell it. Yesterday it was every 3-4 hours like clockwork, the smell started again.

Here's the problem: I'm allergic to weed. Buzzkill, I know. I won't go anaphylactic from their second-hand smoke, so my life isn't in actual danger, but the smell makes me incredibly nauseous. I can smell it regardless of if my windows are opened or closed, and being outside on my balcony is now basically impossible (which fucking sucks because HELLO WE'RE ALL TRAPPED INSIDE AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN USE MY BALCONY). 

Weed isn't legal in my state, but I'm not going to call the cops. Not an option.  I truly do not want to get my neighbors in trouble (I support marijuana legalization and reduction of sentences for people in jail on nonviolent drug charges!), I just want to not feel like I'm going to vomit 24/7 for the next 3 weeks straight while I'm trapped in my apartment. I looked into getting air purifiers, but an air purifier that's big enough to be of use in my apartment costs $75+ and money is tight right now because my industry has been hit really hard by all of the closures and cancellations. 

Should I leave a note on everybody's doors, since I don't know which apartment it is? Process of elimination says I can narrow it down to 3 apartments, should I just leave notes with them? Should I tell the management company? All of the people I've interacted with in the leasing office have been either rude or idiots, so they don't give me much hope. And I don't want to cause a big passive-aggressive war with my neighbors now that we're all stuck at home, but I'm seriously miserable. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",15Mar2020,1

643,"Okay , so to make things clear I'll start off from the beginning.

We met each other on a twitter group and people around us started shipping us and soon, we actually fell for each other and got into a relationship. Now , with time i started liking him more and more. He liked me too. He never used to talk about himself or his personal life, never told me about him, but i thought it's a matter of time that he'll be comfortable with me and would start sharing things. Now , everything was normal until 14th Feb, we loved each other like we did until this time. Let's call my bf A.

I messaged him on 15th he was a bit cold to me and wasn't really talking . So i thought maybe he isn't in the mood rn. This continued until 17th when i actually cleared up everything with him where he said that he was getting too much possesive and protective towards me and this was something, he didn't like so it was a time period where he was figuring out things.

Now around , 24th feb i somehow had an hazy idea about him liking this person(B). Fast forward to 28th evening , i see his message ""Hey, i want to talk"" , i talked to him and in the conversation he told me how he loves me too much and is getting attached like never before. So, maybe it's the time to break up and part ways, he also told me how it was toying up with his mental health and the conditions at his home weren't too great too. It was very difficult for me to let go my love, but i agreed with him because i couldn't see him like that and thought this was the last conversation we had. I was lost , sad thinking about him. But next morning on 29th we talked again and told each other how much we missed each other (Note that we are still broken up) , now in the evening of the same day. I finally asked him if he likes this person B and he agreed to it. I was literally shattered , speechless i couldn't type anything, my hands were shaking , my heart was racing , thumping . That conversation was the most difficult conversation of my life, he kept blaming himself of how he ruined everything , but i told him how it wasn't anyone's fault but they're just situations and we can't really control our heart. He told me how that person B was sad and came to him to talk and slowly fell for each other(now to consider that B is a real life friend of A's online friend, so , that real life friend suggested B to talk to A). He told me how he shared all his problems with B even when we were together, which hit me the hardest. Upon asking why he hid those problems from me, he told me that he wanted to present his best side in front of me. The next day A and B confessed their feelings for each other , they weren't in a relationship till that time.

I didn't stop talking to A and i still do. It is very hard for me to pretend being happy and act like nothing happened , i had conversations with A about this, but nobody can help it. It is extremely hard for me to watch this person loving someone else. On 10th march A messaged me to tell that he and B got into a relationship.

I really want to move on now. Now that i know he doesn't love me anymore , i need to forget him and move on. It really hurts me to watch this person , who was once in love with me interacting and loving that other person. Please tell me tips on how to move on and forget everything. It'll be good for me and him too

I'm on good terms with everyone but would hate living in an uncomfortable environment or hate if I had to scramble to find a sublet since we already all signed a lease. It makes me sad they keep arguing and finally stopped talking. I acted as the mediator for the last fight but I don't want to meddle again for my own mental sanity, but am getting frustrated and sad. It's like I'm losing the only support system I had and I don't know what to do",15Mar2020,1
646,"I just broke up with my boyfriend who I have been with for the past 7+ years.

 I (22F) was 14 when we started dating, and my boyfriend (23M) was 15. We have had an intense relationship with ups and just as many downs. He has struggled with an alcohol addiction for past 3 years, and has struggled with his mental health for as long as I’ve known him. He is diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and although he is on Zoloft and goes to therapy, he still lies excessively and has betrayed my trust beyond repair. 

Despite all of this, he loves me very much. He is almost infatuated with me. Which is why it is so hard for me to stand my ground on my decision. He has been contacting me nonstop begging and pleading with me to give him another chance. He says he will do absolutely anything to make things right with me, and that he can’t get better without my support.

The problem is I have heard all of this a few times before, and things always end up cycling back to the same result. I resent him for his constant lying and drinking and I don’t think I can ever truly trust him again. 

Since he has been suicidal in the past, and he doesn’t have a lot of friends/family support, I end up feeling like I have to keep in contact with him. But every time I talk to him, he just pleads with me to take him back. It would be easier to agree to it, but overall I know I can’t handle this relationship for the rest of my life. 

I guess I am just looking for advice on how to approach this situation because I feel very conflicted about responding to his texts.",15Mar2020,1
647,"Friend of mine called into her store to ask if she needed to be quarantined after recent travel. She did not visit a ""high risk"" country, but the health units are suggesting anyone who has travelled stay in isolation.

Manager told her to call the health unit for their opinion, she did (or tried, all lines were busy and she did some deep dive googling to multiple sources to see if she should be in isolation) and called back to tell work that she should be placed in self quarantine.

That being said, she's not asking for payment, but the managers (after placing her on hold) told her she needed to call in for today, and then get a doctor's note, which seems wrong to me?

Why should she have to go to a medical centre full of sick people for a note to take a precaution? Are there other steps she should be taking?

TLDR; friend's managers want a drs note for self quarantine, is this proper procedure? What's steps should she be taking to protect herself?

648,"So a couple of weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me. She was kind of abusing me both physically and mentally. She hit me on multiple occasions and threatened to hit me sometimes. She got pretty mad at me whenever I did something with friends, making me decide between her and them. She threatened to break up with me if I didn’t do something she wanted me to. She cheated on me with her ex. She often told me about how she wished I was her ex and on one occasion I was laying in bed next to her and she said she’d prefer if her ex would be there instead of me. She threatened to kill herself sometimes when I was out with friends. People told me I’d be better of without her. I kind of realize that what she did to me is wrong but I still love her very much and would have done anything for her. I miss her a lot but we can’t have contact or anything like that. Since January I’m also feeling pretty depressed again and the situation with my ex on top of that is really fucking me up. I’m seeing a therapist but my next appointment is going to be at the end of April. I just went there on Wednesday for the first time and it was for the purpose of getting to know me so I’m not on any medication yet and she didn’t have much advice yet since she doesn’t really know me. Right now I’m having a bad phase and birthdays are something I in general don’t enjoy that much and right now I just don’t know what do to. My friends said they’d be here for me but my birthday is coming up tomorrow and hardly anyone seems to even know or really care about that. I was on the verge of commuting suicide a couple weeks ago,  I wanted to jump off the school and what stopped me were some people that were hanging around there. I feel like I could come to that point again and right now I’d just like to know if there’s anything I can do to prevent myself from getting to that point again. It’s hard to explain; I don’t enjoy life right now but I don’t want to come to that point where I want to commit suicide. I’m not that old yet so I still have some hope that things will get better again. I’m just a total mess at the moment and I don’t wanna exaggerate or seem like I’m looking for attention.

I finally got the courage to ask him out the other day, and it took him hours to even open my message and respond (you can see on SnapChat). When he did respond, he said he was down and wanted to. He said he would have to check and see his plans for the weekend and get back with me. Well, he never has messaged me back.

657,"Hi everyone, 

I don’t really expect many people to read this but here goes anyway.

So my biological dad died when I was 6, and I’ve been living with my biological mum and step father since. My step father has always been rough and aggressive, at least in my eyes. 

I remember specifically that when I was young, he would take me by my neck and throw me into the garage if I misbehaved. I was a mess back then, and probably would still be without my step father, but I feel that he’s caused me incredible psychological damage because of his actions, instead. 

I guess I just want to ask everyone reading if the following things are normal for a now 15 year old: 

1. Feeling like you never want to be at home, but that you have to be anyway. I feel like my step father is constantly doing things to hurt my feelings behind my mum’s back and he doesn’t really care about me. He sees me as arrogant, idiotic and has threatening me at various times (not something that I have proof of however). 

2. Feeling forced into everything. I feel no enjoyment and I have depression, I think. My step father ignores every sign or possibility that my behaviour could sometimes reflect on a deeper mental issue. 

3. Wanting to run away, commit suicide or homocide. 

I guess after having written all that out I have stumbled upon my answer, but what should I do now. 

P.S. 
I don’t want anyone telling me to stop being dramatic or trying to minimise my feelings. Please only respond if you have actual, genuine advice for me.",15Mar2020,1

My mom married a really nice guy who is 10 years older than her but I really like him, but my dad literally married the first woman he found, she already had a kid so I guess he is my stepbrother. Since my parents are divorced and my dad is a captain who works for 3 months then comes home, I live with my mom when he is away, and with him when he comes back. I prefer living with my mom because she sees me as an adult and not a child. In the last 2 years my dad got 2 kids with his wife and Im really not a person that likes kids. 

So today I asked my dad can I go to my moms for 2 weeks because of online classes and I tried to explain it to him that I can't concentrate in his apartment because of the kids and the constant noise. He started crying and I started to panic so I told him that I dont like kids at all, then he started crying even more and then I just said that I dont like his company. At this point Im all red and scratching myself, feeling anxious and he is crying while his wife is just holding the kids in disbelief. Finally, he said to me if I want to go I can go. 

The reason I want to leave his place is because I dont have the freedom I have at my moms and whenever I want to do something he needs to approve of it and needs to know where I am at any time of the day while my mom trust me and knows Im a responsible teenager.

I do check my emails first thing in the morning.  Everyday.  But I often don't get through all of them because I simply have so many piled up and I can miss some buried beneath 30 others until later.   I could explain this to him...but why bother?

For the record, he is utter dog shit with emails and misses them constantly ...so the irony here is magnificent.

We work together and the process has begun of him doing less and me doing more.  He spends far more time out of town golfing and works remotely, I'm in the thick of the shit dealing with launching a new office, hiring new staff and now dealing with a bear market in the stock market.

I have taken off three days from work in the past four weeks, mostly just to restore some willpower to solider on.  Days are usually 10 hour days since its tax season in addition to all the shit going in I mentioned previously.  There is a massive disparity in the time we spend working, but thats not really what irks me.  It's that he asks idiotic questions such as ""why are you working so late?"" He doesn't seem to understand the workload and doesn't seem to care to try.

It's not a secret, we all have work schedules avaliable to each other and you can look at mine and visually understand how insane things are right now for me.  

I have already stopped behind honest with my mother, who has undiagnosed mental issues yet has put herself in the epicenter of several family crisises such as a cousin dying from cancer, someones failed suicide attempt and a issue with my brother that i wont even attempt to explain.  When she calls me at 7pm i just lie and say im home already.  She is crazy, and therefor she drives him crazy, and its just a neverending cycle of stubbornness and emotion.

Mom aside, it's hard to now accept that I cannot deal with my father directly either.  I feel it's the first step of treating my parents ""special"" and having to keep the truth from them.  I am close with my parents, and it would be great if I could open up with them and seek their advice.  But it's only going to exacerbate their situation.  

They have enough shit going on in their lives that I feel like I should just shut up and lie about how I feel about my whole life right now.  I work nonstop.  Have no social life.

Recently some things happened with the neighbors and overall safety if the community we live in. Two of my roommates, a couple, keep pushing to move out and keep proposing different places to move to and look at. 

At one point, because I had a lot of money saved for  grad school, I got qualified for a home loan and started looking around but nothing was decent enough or stable enough for me to be willing to throw all my savings at. They kept pushing me and pushing me and I eventually had a minor breakdown and stopped the search because I ultimately couldn't afford it. I told them to give me a while to save more but they keep pushing it. 

Since then my financial situation has gotten worse because my boyfriend of 6 years has been fired and I've had to cover all expenses by myself and I hardly get enough hours to provide for myself. I started working more to make up for it but that's just made university so much harder and I'm falling behind because I can't keep up with the other students who have the time to improve and study properly. I'm constantly exhausted and my depression has skyrocketed. Every day I'm terrified of what expenses I have coming up or what could ultimately happen. My anxiety has me in tears constantly. I can't focus, I'm getting sick from lack of sleep and from the toll on my body. I get so sick sometimes or spastic emotionally I can't bear to walk in work. I've even had managers send me home when I try to work. 

I have savings, I know, but I want them for grad school because I won't be able to afford it otherwise. But those saving are also hurting me. I can't afford health insurance yet the state won't help me whatsoever even though I don't make more than 400-600 a month due to the hours I have to take at school. It's all due to the savings I have have for grad school, but they don't care.      Therefore, when I'm sick and in need of medical care, I can't receive it. I also can't go see a therapist which I really want to do because I feel out of control of myself. I constantly have drastic mood swings out of nowhere and have episodes of apathy. 

Today, my roommates declared they need to talk to us about all of it and I know they're leaving. They've been leaving and staying with family more and more over the last month. In fact, they're coming back today from their parents. I'm absolutely terrified. I cannot do this, I can't afford this. Without them, I'll be forced to pay everything myself minus one roommate who we've already talked to and who has agreed to stay and help me. It'll drain my savings and ruin my chances of grad school. I can't leave where I'm living do to work and I have pets, which restricts my renting options. I refuse to get rid of them, they're family and the only thing that keeps me sane. I do everything for them. I can't go home, there is no home to go back to. 

I feel so broken and I have no clue what to do. I don't want to quit school but I might be forced to in order to financially support myself and get the help I need. I just don't know, I really need advice. Please, anyone. I'm so scrambled so please ignore my organization.",15Mar2020,1

They are 50/50 about the legitimacy of the actual virus. THEY BELIEVE THAT THE VIRUS ISNT EVEN REAL! Or if it is real, then it was started on pupose. Both my granparents are still alive, and are both over the age of 65. Since my parents dont believe in the legitimacy of the virus, they dont care about social distancing. They will probably visit my grandparents soon, and might even have a gathering to have their own little church thing. 

I am pissed. Hundrends of thousands of people are infected, an entire fucking country in quarantine, and thousands of people are dead! And my parents think that this is fake and nothing more than a way to give rise to the antichrist. 

I am afraid for the health of my grandparents and parents. I dont know what to do. I cannot just stand by and let my parents keep going on like this. What should I do?",15Mar2020,1

683,"I just turned 17 and my mom is 40 for age context. Generally we’re pretty good getting along but every time she feels like I’m parenting her (which is basically any time I request any change in her behavior in any way). But I’m not. I’m just asking her to do things that would help all of us? For example the current situation is that I was kind of upset that she didn’t want to go buy hand soap for her bathroom so she can wash her hands every time she goes to the bathroom (I know it’s a bit excessive but most people I know do it every time and with corona very close to where we live I just don’t want us all getting sick and then since our immune systems are fucked we die of corona lol). Plus other people use her bathroom. It’s just hand soap? But she became convinced I was trying to “parent” her and started yelling at me and slamming cabinets next to my head when I was trying to make coffee at the counter. It’s just so often and she gets so fucking mad at me I don’t want her to scream at me I’m so tired of it. Then she gets angry at me for raising my voice a bit back. In her head she can yell at me all she wants but if I do it in any way it’s blatant disrespect and proof I’m trying to parent her, that I need to control my emotions, etc.
I’m so tired of this. I love my mom so much but I’m sick of this it’s always something. This “you’re trying to parent ME” thing has only come up last year. Before that she had this idea that I’ve always tried to manipulate her by crying/getting upset. No I’ve never tried to do that I’m sorry she gets angry when she see crying but I’m not trying to manipulate her and I never have. This finally stopped last year when I brought her attention to it, which was wonderful, but now this idea that I’m trying to parent her is stuck in her head so now I’m not allowed to have strong opinions really. I know I’m almost an adult but I’m still young why is she getting mad at me for “not controlling my emotions” when she’s 40 and doesn’t do it?? Well she does lots of the time. It’s just she expects me to have full control even though I’m young and mentally ill but I have to be understanding when she loses her temper. I’m sick of this I’m so tired. I try to be understanding but it’s never worth it. 

I’m sorry if this is really hard to follow I’m extremely upset about this right now because it just happened and I’m on mobile. I just would like to know if anyone else has been in this situation and if so how can I help convince her I’m not trying to parent her and maybe help her understand that me crying and her yelling at me are not the same? Maybe I’m completely wrong and am trying to parent her subconsciously idk maybe that’s what happens when your your moms personal therapist most of the time. All comments are appreciated.",15Mar2020,1
684,"Bit of background- I (26M) live with my longtime friend (26M) who recently adopted a 4 month old puppy (Boxer / German Shepherd Cross) from a breeders. My roommate has always been impulsive and irresponsible but it has never affected another life quite like this. 

A few weeks after being broken up with, my roommate came home with this new puppy and has been completely neglectful of the puppy since. 

He has put no effort into training it and when it relieves itself on the floor he simply wipes it with dry paper towel, leaving stains and odors all around the house. He also started working again recently and has been leaving the puppy in a kennel that it has already outgrown all day long. He doesn't walk it or exercise it apart from 20-30 minutes of attention when he gets home from work. 

From an outside perspective this puppy was an obvious ploy to regain affection from his ex (an avid dog lover) but it seems since that hasn't worked he now has this dog everyone told him not to get and is only keeping it to show everyone that he is in fact responsible enough to raise a puppy

Several family members of his have told him he isn't ready for a puppy and he would he best to return the dog, but that has only served to anger him and put him in a ""I'm going to show all of you"" mind set. 

I have called him out several times over the unsanitary environment of the house (pee/poop stains) and the kennel situation but he has a very deflective personality and my complaints are just met with ""yeah maybe"" or ""hmm I dont know, I'm sure it's fine"". I can tell he's annoyed with my nagging and is roping me in with his family and holds the same ""I'll show you I'm capable of raising a dog"" mentality towards me. 

The kicker is I'm moving out in 3 weeks. I honestly have been pretty done with our friendship for a while (rant for another time) but hate the idea of leaving the puppy in this environment before I leave. The only logical next step I can think of is to force him to sit down with me and go over what needs to change but he handles confrontation so poorly I just know he would just say what I want to hear to end the conversation and then never act on it. 


To anyone that has made it this far my apologies for the lengthy rant and any advice for this situation would he appreciated!",15Mar2020,1

688,"My bestfriend and I have a brotherly bond that has stayed strong since the last three years. We've worked and traveled together and it seen a lot through. A year back, I met this girl at work, who I liked and we started spending a lot of time together, where my best friend, let's call him mark, did not get time. We used to hang out but it was less frequent than before. He didn't say anything and we moved on, this lasted for a month before a new girl entered his life as a friend and he started having feelings for her. Now at this point, I moved to a new job and I started meeting mark less frequently, but this was from both sides, since both of us got busy. He started hanging out with the new girl, and I carried on with my life, we used to meet once every two weeks. The new girl started creating trouble for mark and everything turned sour there, plus he started having issues with his family, after which he committed self-harm Now I got to know about this from another friend, because mark never told me anything. Now I can't talk to mark about this because he promised our mutual friend that he won't tell me about this. Two weeks before this happened, I met mark and he told me everything was fine, and when I probed about his family issues, he changed the topic. Now the problem is that mark is going behind my back and telling my fiance that i'm the sort of person who starts ignoring people once I get used to them, and she should watch out - this is ridiculous because I'll never do that to her, which she knows. I've messaged him to meet, but he left me on read for two days while he was replying to other people. I'm honestly very confused, I feel like he's blaming me for ignoring him  at the start because of which he had to latch on to other people. Deep down inside, now I'm started to feel that it is my fault. I don't know how to fix this, need some advice.",15Mar2020,1

So my mom knows I've been trying to save up money, but she also has control issues. It used to be me going out, but we settled up and agreed to some terms as far as my freedom- but for a price. I work a minimum wage job- 8/hr, so I'm literally scraping at pennies to save what I can. The relationship between my mom and I is very unhealthy so I have plans of moving out with my SO in May. She isn't aware of these plans but knows I'm saving up money for a trip with my SO next week. Again, scraping at pennies to do so, just barley squeezing by. 
We had a previous agreement that anything she had to pay for, I wouldn't need to until I was 21. We settled this at 18, I'm 20 now. She's now wanting me to pay for everything, out of the blue, the same as she pays with her 23/hr job. I can't save money, but her justification is that I have a job and do college so I should be able to.

693,"This girl and I started school about a year ago. We are in a very intense, fast-paced program that demands a lot of work and attention. It's very intense and anyone can succeed if they really try. There is this one girl who is starting to really piss me off. She is essentially not trying. I used to have no problem helping her out.. sending her notes, giving her tips for studying, I even went as far as to helping her out with online open-book quizzes. It got to the point where she would hit me up every. single. time. asking for answers. Not even trying. She also tends to ask a lot of stupid questions. She doesn't bother to listen in class or read assignments.. she just wants to be spoon fed everything. One time there was an online open book quiz, with UNLIMITED ATTEMPTS, meaning you can go back and take the quiz as many times as you need to get 100%. She did not even try and just asked me for answers. She also messages me on social media constantly, like around 2 AM asking for homework assignment questions that are due the next day.. I'd already be sleeping. I eventually just started ignoring her messages. I really think if it weren't for me or other classmates helping her out, she would have failed out by now. She barely passed last semester and I truly think she failed one of the finals but our teacher passed her on anyway or somehow ""made it work"". Other people have said she is constantly partying and traveling and here I am picking up the pieces for her. 

Today she had the nerve to message me going ""Hey I'm using Jessica's study guide and Mark's flash cards, is there anything else you'd like to add?""  


EXCUSE ME? I said ""what do you mean? I'm using those too""

My problem is that I am super passive aggressive. I HAAATE confrontation. Even if it means sticking up for myself, I don't know how to tell this girl to fuck off without sounding rude.

I asked her to stop raising her voice but she carried on speaking to me harshly and didn’t let me get a say in anything until she eventually punched me In the face.

701,"I am considering relocating, but I haven't found a place that feels like a good fit. I currently live in Austin and love it here, but it is changing so much that it no longer feels like somewhere I belong. Austin is now all tech-bros and trust funds. I am neither. Austin is losing its appeal. All of the places I once frequented are now full of bachelorette parties and guys with buzz cuts. Nobody cares about the music scene anymore. If I go to a show, I can barely hear the music over people talking about Instagram or whatever. It is definitely no longer weird. Austin no longer caters to artists, only those with money. I know it was bound to happen. I can't decide if Austin is no longer cool, or am I no longer. So here I am doing the very uncool thing of complaining about it on the internet. Austin just doesn't have the same open-minded, creative community that originally motivated me to move here. I want to live somewhere that is affordable, liberal, and interesting. Does this even exist anymore? My husband and I are both creatives. He is a video editor, and I am a copywriter. So we need to be somewhere that there is at least a small market for that sort of work. We like to go out a lot. We like coffee shops, galleries, and dive bars. I am very into food, so I would like to live somewhere that has a fair amount of quality grocery stores and a restaurant scene. That's very important to us. We also have a kid, so a city with kid-friendly beer gardens and outdoor activities would also be preferable. Austin has all of these thing, but the cost of living is really pushing us out. We would like to own a home and live comfortably. Is there a place like this that you can own a home for less than $250,000? I prefer somewhere as liberal as possible, but it's not a must. I just don't want to feel like I am not able to find like-minded people. I do also like warmer weather. Colder weather is okay, but I really don't want to be shoveling snow. Because I have a family, I would like to live somewhere with lower crime rates, but I also know that living in a city almost guarantees some crime. That is another thing. I would prefer a city with at least 100,000 people. And most importantly I don't want to live in a city that feels like the suburbs. I am fine with a more rural old town like city or a real downtown city feel, but I don't want to live in the middle of chain restaurants and stores.

702,"I don't know if the frequent thoughts I have are symptoms of some internal, deep-seated issues.i don't know if this is normal or acceptable.

I have very sexual thoughts, as a bisexual female. For me, that means a lot of people are on the table. I will imagine myself having sex with so many of my friends, or acquaintances/strangers I meet or see, just to see what it'll look like or if I'll like it. When planning to do anything I will inadvertently conjure up a romantised fantasy in my mind where I meet hot people and fuck them. I think of seducing professors in classes. Bosses and co-workers in jobs. I think of seducing people from their partners, or both parties in a couple. I think of picking people right off the street, anywhere really. I've never had the balls to do so (for ethical reasons or otherwise), but I think about it all the time. I get disappointed when my fantasy never happens, because I don't act on them, and no one who can fulfill them comes on to me anyway.

However, I feel a lot of shame about it. I feel predatory and insanely creepy. I don't want to think of my attractive friends in a sexual way. I don't want to be constantly chaotically horny in the background of my mind. In fact, I don't even need to be horny to feel the desire to do something wild and sexual.

Part of why I abstain from alcohol is due to this. I don't want anyone to know I'm a cringey pervert, or risk being one. 

A lot of me also doesn't feel attractive enough to even have such urges. I know it doesn't make sense, but I feel like if less people will reciprocate due to my level of attractiveness, then I shouldn't even have such thinking at all.

So I ask “hey is everything all okay” she says “yes sorry I have been really busy I didn’t mean to read your message” that sparks another hour long conversation. By this point I am really happy, and really want to become good friends with this girl. Fast forward maybe like a week (we maybe send 2 to 3 texts a night) I build up the courage and ask if she wants to hang out with me. To my surprise she says yes. I am stoked, I start planning it asking her questions like what do you want to do? I get know response. I saw she was online but no response. I’m thinking why? What did I do wrong? I leave my message there waiting for a response for maybe a week. I give up waiting and write “so what do you think what do you want to do” I get a another response “sorry I’ve been busy with school” I reply “not a worry” we talk for maybe a hour and random stuff she goes to bed it was like 10 pm I go to bed aswell. I wake up the next day it’s a weekend, I go “hey jess!” I response... I wait a little and check my phone a few hours later. It says she was last online like 5 mins ago. At this point I was feeling a little bit down cos like I said before I really want to be this girls friend. I wait over the weekend. Still. Nothing. One week goes past and I say “hey what’s up” we then talk for about 1 hour then I get nothing from her the rest of the week. It’s now the time I’m writing this. I’m really confused, when she is not “busy” we have a great, fun and enjoyable conversation for like one hour. But this happens not very often, even though I can see that she is not busy. I send her a few messages today trying to get her attention when I saw she was online on Instagram. Once again. Nothing. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do... Do I try to get me closer to my goal (being good friends with her) or give up. I’m getting mixed messages if she is interested in being my friend or not. When we chat (over text) I’m am super happy, and the texting conversation flows so well. I’ve talked to other girls on the same app and they are nothing like her. What do I do?",15Mar2020,1

713,"TL/DR 23F wanting to move with 28M husband to UK from USA. What are some things you would have liked to know before moving over? Was it difficult to get a job? Do you find it easier to travel? Do you have a better work life balance? What are some of the nicer and quieter parts of England? How is the job market for someone that has a bachelors in psych, masters in I/O psych and certificate in Business Admin? Is it very difficult to find an affordable home? Any tips? What was your experience? Where do you work? Do you find that you work to live or live to work? I want to know as much as I can about it! 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all I (23F) am seriously considering moving abroad with my husband (28M) to the UK from USA. He is a UK citizen and it would be fairly easy for us to move there. Everything about moving to England seems amazing. I love it as a country, I love the history, the scenery, the weather, the people, and how close it is to the rest of Europe. All of my husbands family lives there as well. I, on the other hand, have no friends, and only have my mom, dad and one sibling. The relationship between the 4 of us ok, but it is very volatile and often times toxic to be honest. In short, all that keeps me here is my family. I've broached the subject to them and they are very supportive and excited to have a place to stay abroad so I'm glad they're seeing the positives. I still feel guilty but I think I could cope. I have lots of questions which I've posted in the summary. The biggest thing weighing on me is the housing market / prices. I live in a town where you can buy a 4 bedroom, single family home with land and a pool for 145k so the prices of the UK are a little daunting for me. I need a home with a yard as I would be taking two 45 pound dogs with me but all the homes are duplex style. I just get so friggin scared about doing this, but I truly feel like it would be such a good thing for us and I don't want fear, or guilt to keep me from living my life. Any tips? experiences? Advice?",15Mar2020,1
714,"20 y.o. I am in a relationship now and we have almost been together for a year. I have had a few relationships in the past all of them fairly long and of course i have been hopefull in all of them. I just feel like this time is different and i feel like this might be the one. I am really confused and kinda scared about the feeling because i feel like everyone keeps saying it and then breaking up after a few years if not less and of course our relationship is fairly new too. I just feel like every relationship in these times will end at some point and its making me scared and sad about my feelings.

Any advice on how to proceed? Ofc. its not like im going to propose or anything in the next year i just dont know if my feeling is blind love or i might be onto something.",15Mar2020,1
715,"I have this really annoying thing that my brain does. I'll give a few examples of it, so hopefully someone can tell me why I do this.

First example: learning to draw. I really want to learn to draw, but small things get in the way of actually learning. I was following through a tutorial, and they started drawing multiple lines/curves over the same spot to get a more accurate line, but because they didn't mention it in the tutorial, I get this really negative feeling that's hard to describe, and it sort of kills my motivation.

If I'm learning from a specific resource, I feel like I'm bound to it, and it causes me a really troubling feeling when I have to stray away from that single resource to do more research on something that it didn't explain greatly.

Second example: If I mis-interpret something in a videogame, or the tutorial doesn't explain something, it also causes that negative feeling, sometimes it feels like the game is ruined. Example: Zelda: breath of the wild. I got the impression that the game intends you to complete each quest before moving onto the next, but the fact that I had to search google for that question almost ruined the game, it really kills the motivation I have to play it. This basically happens with any game where something like this happens. Also small example: tiny, insignificant spoilers to the game can also cause that negative feeling, for example, finding out that a level in a game is scary. Something as small and non-descriptive as that can kill all my motivation to play the game.

Third example: when I lost the stock usb cable for my ps4 controller. Not having the complete cables with the console caused that negative feeling.

Does anyone know if there's a name for this, and if I can overcome this? It really gets in the way of my hobbies and learning new things. I'm completely aware that it's a toxic outlook, but I can't help it.",15Mar2020,1

718,"This is going to be a relatively short post (me from the future, I don't think it ended up being short, writing all of this was actually kind of therapeutic) because I'm honestly genuinely afraid for no particular reason but all my ""daddy issues"" have  reached a tipping point and I want to know what to do. Basically my dad gets angry a lot and goes on yelling tirades and gets fairly physical. It's not intentional as it's unplanned and there's not like a belt or anything but he scratches, pulls, pushes, shoves, hits, etc. The physical aspect is getting less common, especially the hitting as I grow older but he stills yells whether I am being good or not at the littlest things, like if we were discussing the coronavirus and I accidentally interrupt him to say something like, ""Yeah, and did you know that it dies off on surfaces in three days?"" (I dunno). I'm not yet of driving age so I don't have a lot of independence. But his anger problems have been getting worse and worse for me. I think the best option is to trick him into going to therapy. The trick because he's kind of traditional and thinks psychiatrists are for people who can't function *at all* or are schizophrenic or something, which isn't true. Otherwise I honestly can't deal with it on my own. The brunt of his anger goes out towards me and my mother. Sometimes admittedly some of my actions may provoke him, but my mother typically is trying to keep the peace though she usually always sides with him despite the lack of respect he shows her. I don't know if I can have her cooperation on this. My younger sister is still in elementary school and she sees all he does o me but she is very good at staying out of it and is fairly neutral in everything, though she will always tend to side with my mom. I really just want someone to give me advice or tell me what to do or whatever. I currently have a band-aid on my hand because I went up (we were all gathered down to eat lunch but it hadn't been served yet so I just wanted a paper to record whatever my dad was doing) and got a paper, in the mean time both my parents started yelling for me to come down and I responded with the fact I was just getting something (right when I got to the top of the stairs) then I got the paper and pencil and ran down. Apparently I didn't respond fast enough or my dad was angry I was recording things about him but he grabbed the paper from my hands, creating a deep scratch in the process, somehow scratched my stomach, threw the mechanical pencil so hard it literally bounced all the way back and then started swearing at me (in front of my nine-year-old little sister) about how I was an crazy, idiot, fucking bitch, dog (some one these insults sound worse in the native language though he said ""fucking bitch"" in English). Currently he is in their bedroom degrading my mother and calling her a liar. I'm sorry to say, after all these times he's insulted me, it still hurts. I started crying and my current plan is to have my sister communicate with them for me (both mother and father, otherwise my father will turn against my mother) and for me not to say a word (I'll just have her say essential things, not argumentative ones so she's protected, like ""I''m in the bathroom I'll come down"" or ""I'm not coming to \[insert family activity here.\]"" \[we had planned to go hiking but I’m not going to join them\]) Please someone tell me what to do. Oh also, taking him to the therapist will be hard because we're currently not going to any restaurants and he basically stays all day because of coronavirus his company is letting him work from home. And I am not a perfect child, I can be a bit quarrelsome and my grades have dipped as of late, though I'm trying. I'm also a bit of a teenager in the way that I could do with less contact with my family but maybe that has got to do with what a messed up piece of shit my dad is. I have a lot of flaws beyond that, so I'm not entirely blame free but my dad is still a piece of shit who I only remember yelling at me since I was young. Also he just snaps sometimes, just can't control his anger, yelling, etc. which is the whole anger issues thing, just like he did now and afterwards never shows any remorse or tries to apologize for his mistakes and instead blames everything on me or mom.",15Mar2020,1

Before when I didn't have a life cl on my phone I deleted my important text messages and contacts and backed them up as an email then took a shower knowing my roommate wanted to look through my phone, I was listening to music, he took my phone and then later as I was trying to get dressed he started to harass me saying I have no friends and my text messages were boring and he didn't know why I was on my phone at 1:00 am but that he knows I wasn't texting . My roommate wore my shirt that I love and purposely put ketchup all over it. He did this as i was sleeping, he then says that my shirt is ruined and I should just give it to him. Well I washed it out and managed to get the dumbass stain out. My family is from Ukraine Russia and Israel, in Atlanta they have a large Russian speaking population. Anyway I met a friend for lunch at a restaurant. We had a nice time, we have a similar background and I was eating with her because she had a little bit of a culture shock and I was being friendly. My roommate who is basically white trash shows up as he was apparently following me. He walks past the hostess in a very nice restaurant and proceeds to sit down at our table and try to order food. He's trying to talk to her, but my date pretended to not speak English very well. When the waitress came by I told her I didn't want this man at our table and to call the cops because he was harassing me. At this point my roommate and I have had several arguments and he had moved out so at least I didn't have to worry about him messing with my stuff. So after the date I go back to campus and my former roommate has his brother and several of his brothers friends tell me to leave him alone. I'm livid at this point and ask his brother did he tell you what he did to me? These dicks then say they don't care. My former roommate comes to my room later and I finally threaten him to get him to leave me alone. Now this happens like a month after all of this shit happened. My roommates dad shows up and talks to me about how he raised his son the right way and no one knew how he was acting and that his actions in no way reflected his Christian beliefs. Between all of these events I had my now girlfriend come to campus because at one point I took her to a campus event and I paid for her concert ticket then took her to dinner. My girlfriend wears a Star of David and my former roommate called her a beautiful Jew who needed to be fucked by a good Christian man. Now at this point my former roommate and I got into a fight. I have to go before the god damn counsel now. I've filed several complaints, my rabbi is going to the meeting. My girlfriend has written a statement for the counsel about how bad he acted.

726,"Hi there,

I live in London and it’s gone a bit mad recently. They recently announced the elderly could be locked down for 3 months. My grandad is 82, in great shape for his age (except for recently being diagnosed with prostrate cancer) and lives alone. He ran half marathons into his late 70s and still plays badminton twice a week.

I want to support him as best as I can during this CV outbreak. I don’t drive, which makes it trickier. He knows how to online order groceries and my dad has offered to drop off stuff too, but he lives a 2 hour drive from us so that makes it a little trickier as more severe lockdown is introduced.

He is an awful cook as my grandmother always cooked before she got sick. I want to make him some meals he can easily freeze and eat, my dad can drop them off. He’s very traditionally ‘british’ with his food and quite carnivorous. What are some good ideas for meals I could make him?

Secondly, I would like to try and get him some sort of device he can video chat from. I am calling him every other day currently but I feel like this might cheer him up a bit more and he seemed up for it when I asked him. He’s an intelligent guy but hasn’t used a smartphone or tablet really before. Any advice for simple, elderly-friendly devices he can use during this? And any particular apps? He doesn’t have a mobile so not sure how Whatsapp would work.

736,"Last year when I was in my sophmore year of highschool, I had a relatively good friend group, one of them was a friend of mine that I've known since 3rd grade (I'll refer to them as R). Over the year, our group started to grow as we befriended more people, I thought we got along fine for the most part. It wasn't until February that things started to feel off. My friends would sometimes point out my shoes I wore and how funny looking they were and I would hit them on the arm. I started developing a bad habit of hitting them everytime I saw them. At one point in the group chat we had one of our friends(I'll refer to them as G) asked if anyone wanted to join a group chat to talk shit about someone that has been bothering them and R. I was curious and said I wanted in but for some reason, they never added me in. A week later, I was placed into a chat that some friends made and with G and R in it. They had said they had some problems with me and G&amp;R went on to list out little things they didn't like about me or that I did (the hitting, talking about school lunch, how I always try to make everyone like me, etc.). I realized who that group chat was about. I apologized for making them uncomfortable and hurt by what I did and promised I wouldn't do it again and let them know if they did have a problem to just tell me directly since I wouldn't want secrets between us and wanted them to be happy with each other but it didn't end there. I felt over time, I was being outcasted and left out, I messaged R if I had done anything wrong, and they responded with another list of things that they didn't like about me and said if theyre wrong to explain to them why I acted or did certain said things. I couldn't understand why they couldn't tell me directly if I had expressed openly that if there was something I was doing that bothered them then they could tell me, was there something wrong with me? On social media, I would always see G posting when they all hung out together as a group, without inviting me. I felt alone at that point, I didn't know if I had friends at all. June came by, I received a text from R who expressed they felt bad that I was being ignored and that they only stuck around G and wanted to clear things up with me and asked if we could meet up sometime. I accepted the invite since I wanted to try in a last effort to keep the friendship me and R had. G had texted me the day before I met up with R that they didn't want to be friends with me anymore because too much stuff happened between us, I agreed with them and we both cut off things. I met up with R the next day and R explained that G was trying to make me jealous and would constantly post on social media when they hung out so I could feel excluded. I wasn't as shocked as I thought it would be, deep down I probably knew they had the intention to hurt me with the repeated posts they made. I was glad I could meet up with R, considering we were both going to Japan that month as a school trip, I wanted for things to be good between us. We went on the trip and I thought we both had a good time, yet R never texted me when we got home. A month later, I recieved a text from R, they expressed that they were mad at me for saying that I didn't care about cultural appropriation and tried to educate me on the matter. I was honestly mad at that point, I thought R would've been able to express if something was wrong to me directly, but to have them not talk to me for an entire month and telling me now about a certain comment I made during the trip, I wasn't going to stand by it. I texted them that there must've been a miscommunication between us and trying to clear up what I actually said and apologized and expressed that if they didn't want to forgive me I understand why. R replied asking why I was apologizing as if I committed a crime and that they'd forgive me but would never forget what I had said. I couldn't take it at that point, I felt hurt by their words and actions. I decided at that point that the friendship we had no longer existed, I didn't want to be hurt any longer so I decided to cut ties with R and everyone else from that friend group. During the time we were friends, I had questioned myself a lot as a person and wondered if I was a good person or friend to begin with. Even now, I sometimes wonder if I was wrong for everything.

b) Unlike my previous crazy hours job, I would only have to work \~45 hours a week so we could both work, both take care of our eventual children, and actually have time together

744,"She recently just got out of a 23 year relationship. In the 90's, she was hit by a car whilst pregnant with me, her third child. She is in cancer recovery, where they took out all of her sexual reproduction organs. Her father was abusive, physically and sexually, she's not very smart, and lies a lot to make herself seem cooler than she actually is. I never tell her this.

Now, I know all this and I try to cook all her meals, spend time with her, as all of my older siblings have moved out. I help her with online college and she looks like she is trying to better herself.

However. I think she is jealous of me. 

My entire family has told me several times that I am the smartest person they've met and always come to me for advice, even though Im the youngest. 

Everytime I try to be nice to her or help her and tell jokes and make her feel better, she always accuses me of talking shit behind her back, making her feel stupid, lying, and overall projecting her feelings onto me. I have an online writing job, and she constantly asks when I'm getting a real job even though I have one. I don't do anything to hurt her, only support. 

I know she has gone through all these things and I take that into mind when helping her, but it's really taking a toll on my mental health. My sister thinks shes delusional and my brother is just like my mom.

What do I do? Do I just keep helping her,hoping she'll change? I'm 20. Our house is falling apart. She doesn't have a job and my grandma foots the bill for everything.

762,"TL;DR included. 

What I'll write happened in university 2014/2015.
I'm a guy, was 20 at them time, rather shy but I was alright when I'm one on one or in a small group.
Shy or not, I was always rather relaxed when talking.

In that university we had different classes ranging from about 25 to 100 students unlike other unis.
We were studying psychology which meant that we had no more than 5 guys in our classes which were idiots anyway.

So here we go:
A short intro to two girls there which had the same outcome. 

(1) Sometime within the first days one of the girls talked to me since we were sitting side by side and I didn't talk to anyone yet if I'm not mistaking. 

After that, we were uni friends so we didn't do anything outside of uni except asking for homework or so. 

(2) I've met her at the door because a bus didn't drive (we were on time) so we were late and the professor was strict and wouldn't let us in the first course.
That girl asked me to go to the campus with her.

We went outside, sat down and talked a little.
Nothing special.
The only thing I remember though is that she has asked me for my birthday and immediately knew my zodiac.

It went the same as the first girl.
We've greeted each other in the mornings, talked in uni a bit and talked about things like assignments on WhatsApp.
That was it.

End:
At one point (seperate from each other), both of them stopped even greeting me.
When I've looked at them, they wouldn't even turn to me.

My guess was that the first has talked to me because it was very early and everything.
The second MAYBE liked me and wanted more?
I thought that she was pretty but didn't want more than friendship so I may have given off signs of that?

These things have been on my mind ever since and I'm a guy, I naturally suck at interpreting the behavior of girls so I came to ask.

It isn't that big of a deal since it were just ""university friends"" but holy, this just won't stop coming to my mind from time to time.

Is there something I've missed or don't get??? 
I want to get this off my mind now. 

TL;DR:
Two girls - seperately from each other - started talking to me.

We've greeted each other in the mornings, talked a little over the day and talked about assignments and courses on whatsapp outside of uni.
No meetups or even invitations. 
Nothing special.

Both - again seperately - started acting like nothing happened and didn't even greet me anymore in the mornings.
That's how we stopped talking and I just don't know why someone would start talking to me and put of nowhere stop again after weeks or months.",15Mar2020,1

My job as a banker is considered essential so even under a potential lock down, I do not foresee the banks closing their doors due to COVID-19. And I completely understand that. If the banks were gone, people would absolutely panic. The other day on a conference call discussing COVID-19, the man leading it compared us to Apple, stating that their retail stores were still open. Well they aren't now. 

I don't know if it is safe for me to continue going in to work. I also don't know if I am overreacting. I have been diligent about hand washing/not touching my face/etc, but I cannot keep a safe distance from customers who need to show me their IDs and Debit Cards, and I cannot avoid crowds. I would guesstimate our grocery store saw upwards of 10k+ people on Thursday in the midst of all of the hysteria. I am also handling upwards of 20-30k in cash per day. These factors puts me at a very high risk, and I have two very small children at home.

When I asked her why she was in such a bad mood at the moment, my SO (21F) opened up about an incident that happened when she was 13 and the memories that are still haunting her.

She was more like the naive outsider I used to be, too, and didn't think much about it when she followed one guy she really liked into his home to drink something. She said she just wanted to hang around with what she thought was a nice guy, then a friend of him came around and they all drank hard stuff in the guys basement room (both 15-16). She wanted to seem cool and went along with it. What she didn't know was that they were just making her drunk to have sex with her. She doesn't remember very much after the drinking part, but she remembers enough to be sure that they all made out and then they both fucked her in the bathroom one after another. Being drunk as she was, she didn't defend herself, went along with it and after they were done, she went home and never told anyone except me. Additionally, she was a virgin before that incident.

I handled the situation pretty good, tried to comfort her saying that it wasn't her fault and that no one should experience something like that. She said that she already made peace with her past and that it's so long ago that it doesn't bother her that much anymore. Just some memories popping up now and then. And that I don't have to worry about it anymore.

But on the inside, I'm dying. Even days after she told me and being alone at home again I have so much hatred in my stomach I want to hunt these guys down and do very bad things to them. Or to smash my head/punch into a wall until the pain covers my feelings. 

On the one hand, I'm so thankful that she gives me so much trust that she confided in me and I appreciate that she shares her thoughts and life with me. But on the other hand... my mind works in a very visual way and I just can't get over the picture of two guys having sex with my cute little girlfriend in some guys bathroom. It makes me want to puke. It disgusts me. We had some very quiet days after the talk, me trying to not outlive my self-destructive feelings  and her trying to comfort me. I hate myself so much because I can't handle it on the inside. But what can I do? Now everytime we kiss, I ask myself what she might have done to those guys and everytime I close my eyes I see two guys fucking my girlfriend. Why am I like this? Like my subconcious would tell me it was her free will, even though I know it wasn't. I just want to delete that memory and be happy with her again. I really have suicidal thoughts the whole evening because I'm afraid that I will never see her the same again. I love her so incredibly much and I just want these feelings to go away.

(My parents do not know this but if they did, they’d force me to talk to someone) I’ve always been raised under “waiting for marriage.” Recently, my younger sister caught us in the act... kind of. My room was locked but she recorded us and showed my mom. My mom asked for me to be honest and that she’d be understanding, so I told her the truth.

She proceeded to call me dirty and disgusting. That I’m a disappointment and a liar. She said I was selfish to have sex and that I didn’t care about her and my dad. She went on about how I should’ve waited for god’s blessing. She talked about how I could get pregnant and I told her I was not only using condoms, but that I’m taking prescribed birth control pills. She got smirky and said that that explains why I’m fat. (I’m 5’2, 130lbs) She said that since I’m acting like an adult, then she’ll give me adult consequences. I’m no longer allowed to drive. No more dates with my boyfriend. No longer paying for college for me or any of my things. And that once I’m 18 (in 2 months), she wants me out of the house. I apologized and said that I understood.

I came to her room the next day and apologized again. I told her that I accept all the consequences and that I wouldn’t have sex again, atleast while I live under this house. I told her I didn’t want to lose my relationship with her and that I understand if it takes time for her to forgive me. She got mad and said that I’m so selfish. That she was so proud of me and that I turned out to be a complete disappointment.

This is not a puppy crying from being left alone, as I wanted to believe when they first moved in. It’s unmistakably abuse.  I can hear the thuds of the beating and the resulting yelps, which go on intensely for several minutes at a time and then stop.

I’m not sure that calling animal control would do anything - animal control officers need a warrant to enter, and even if they got one, unless they happened to literally show up during a beating I don’t know if there would be anything they could do. The dogs may well be otherwise cared for. I’ve never seen this behavior, only heard it. 

Additionally, calling 911 in the moment doesn’t seem like a good option as these neighbors are black, and while I do want them to stop beating their dogs up, I don’t want to put their lives in danger by calling the police.

My entire class has failed to complete all the requirements before the closure of all schools in my state. It’s not looking promising that the schools will reopen with enough time to complete the degree requirements before the semester ends. When this semester ends I will be transitioning into my final year at university and just got accepted into a big senior year scholarship program for student teaching. Am I going to be held back for not completing the requirements this semester? If I get held back in this one class, I will be behind and will graduate late. Not to mention all my scholarships are based on 4 years l, so I will lose those if I have to graduate late. Keep in mind my whole class will be held back not just me and I’m sure other students at other universities in the state and going through the same thing right now. Will the state just waive the requirements for the semester or will they hold all the students back?",15Mar2020,1

As you can imagine, this industry is taking a massive hit and I've been offered and taken a voluntary one month leave that may be extended at some point. During this time I will continue to receive health insurance, but no pay. I live in Minnesota so I'm not sure if I'll qualify for unemployment, but I'll look further into that on Monday.

During my month or so off, I'd like to invest in myself and take online classes or skillshare so as not to waste my availability. I'm computer savvy and ideally, I'd work on a potential remote skill that I can continue as either a hobby or side hustle when I get back into work whenever they take me back. I've wanted to do this for a while but haven't had enough time free to really invest until now.

I'm 18 years old. This is supposed to be a wonderful time of my life. But every single time something okay comes along and I'm not going through it, I get fucked over.

I got a new job, but it's now closed for who knows how long because of the glorified flu. My friend circle keeps shrinking because I'm not dealing with anyone's shit anymore, I have 4 people I know I can trust and even then I have a hard time not waiting for them to turn around and stab me in some way.

My girlfriend's severely depressed and I'm scared she's going to kill herself and I can't get her to get help, my two best friend's relationship seems like it's going to break at any second and I'm afraid how it's going to affect my friendships with them and the only other stable friend I have lives two hours away. My car doesn't work and because of my job closing i can't pay for the repairs and it's likely hours will be limited once we open again, and I'm running low on money in general and probably won't be able to pay my car insurance and phone bill.

Me F24
Brother M30
Sister F25
Parents F/M60
Therapist F65

**TL;DR I was asked to watch the house of my older brother, and I wasn't as equipt to handle their convoluted security system as I thought resulting in a couple instances where I left a door unlocked. My brother called me afterwards and lectured me about how lazy and unprofessional I was. While my parents are siding with him, my sister and therapist both claimed that he was overreacting. I don't know who is right.**

He and I have a fragile relationship to say the least. He was really verbally and physically abusive growing up and it's didn't stop until he moved out. I would describe him as very neurotic and there are many times where I still feel unsafe to be around him.

After many years of therapy with my current therapist, I've been able salvage a relationship with him. This is the same therapist who helped me get through much of the trauma inflicted by my mother.

About a month ago my brother asked me to watch his house and cat for a few weeks while he was out of state with his girlfriend. Everything was going well but there were a couple instances where the door jammed without me realizing and it showed on his app that it was unlocked.

There was one time where the door jammed so bad that it wasn't opening. I ended up leaving it because I would have been late for work by an hour had I missed that morning bus.

He called me after he got back saying he was really pissed off about my performance and how I should have taken this more seriously. I made sure to apologize but he kept hammering me with some really hurtful statements. He said I ruined his trip because of how much I made him worry. He made assumptions about how I was just high the whole time (while I do smoke, I was completely sober for this task) and he blaimed me for a door he left open that he never mentioned even existed. He also said I was lucky that I was his sister or I wouldn't have even been paid (100 to pay for the bus tickets needed to get there.) He ended it with a request for me to pull his girlfriend aside and apologize to her in person. I agreed.

That was a really painful phone call given some of the things he said about my character, so I mentioned it to my sister who was pissed. She said, ""I've watched many houses and never once did they react so poorly over such minor hiccups. Remind me to never watch his house.""

I told my therapist about it and she sided with my sister. ""Everyone makes mistakes."" She wanted me to write a letter to him explaining how what he said was uncalled for. She also mentioned how it's a bit overkill to have me apologize to his girlfriend.

My mom heard about it too but she's sided with my brother. ""You should have been more careful. What you did was wrong, plain and simple. I would have chosen being late over doing what you did."" 

I know I should have done better, and I'm still going to apologize to his girlfriend, but there's a stark contrast between the two sides. One saying I was a total f-up and the other saying I did nothing wrong.

However I’ve always felt this weird sadness that never leaves me. Like, I’ve considered suicide but only refrain Bec:

2. I’m worried about the karmic consequences (I’m Hindu and in my sect of Hinduism, we believe that if you take the life you have for granted/give it up willingly, you end up on earth in your next life with a shitty life).

My question here is whether I should ask my parents if I can see a therapist. The problem is that where I come from, therapy is sorta stigmatised (I live in India). Although my parents are woke af and really really forward thinking in terms of people going to therapy, I don’t know how they would (privately, by which I mean reactions between the two of them) react to my asking for therapy.

My ex was the perpetrator in this situation, we broke up in the beginning of January this year, and me and my best friend were on the topic of sex and I said that most of the time I had sex (yes, it was underage) I didnt want it. This then made my friend realise that I was raped, my ex didnt physically force me into it, but pressured me and used nudes I sent him (out of pressure), he used them as blackmail that if he didnt get what he wanted he would show them to people. We had those types of conversations over snapchat, where all the messages deleted automatically as we didnt save them. When I told my close friends what happened, they all said I was raped, and for a good while I couldnt accept that I was- everytime I saw my ex I would have a panic attack, or just break down crying. Only now I'm beginning to accept what he did and my friends are suggesting legal action. The thing is I think these types of cases get ignored most of the time and I'm really scared that they wont believe me, like some of the other people I told. My close friends were able to get my ex to say what he did to me in person, and they say if it was the police he would instantly give in. Not to mention that I have none of the pictures my ex sent, or the sexual texts he sent aswell, all i have are discord conversations that only show some manipulative behaviour.

I’m not here for sympathy, or coddling, just advice. This post will likely be downvoted into oblivion.

This post is about CORVID-19. I’ve been putting on a brave face about this - saying we can do this, we can get past this and not be ruled by fear.


My dilemma;
If I contract CORVID-19, I will likely die. No question. I have a long history of respiratory infections and been immune compromised since 2016 due to a dual infection of pneumonia and MRSA, both in my lungs. It left permanent damage.

To add details: I have a history with issues of suicidal idealization, but with no action. I’ve been stable for about a year. This isn’t any depression, this is desperation. If you’ve read this far, you know why.

My options are:

Take precautions, isolate as much as I can, be careful and hope I don’t get it. 

If I contract it, end my life in its early stages, while I’m able. It’s looking like I won’t be able to find treatment even though I’m in a big city. I’ll be told to go home and self isolate. Death sentence right there.

If I’m admitted, I’ll likely be on a ventilator. I watched my Mom die that way. It’s really nasty. I’ll pass.

End my life now, in the next couple of weeks. Gather what I need when I find a technique that will work.

This really is Scylla and Charibdes.

I'm 23(F) and I have a Goddaughter who is 8 years old by now.
I loved her as my own when she was little but I was pushed away by her mother (who happens to be my own Godmother and aunt).
Her mom pushed me away because during my parents divorce my mom wanted me to be her bff and when I wanted to fix my relationship with my dad she told everyone I betrayed her and kicked me out of her house (i was 17). My aunt sided with my mom and since then I haven't seen nor contacted my goddaughter.
I was distraught because I lost my favourite aunt and I missed many years of my Goddaughter's growth. I hear she's a very intelligent and sweet girl. 
My father recently told me she now has a facebook account, and although I don't have one, I was thinking of reaching out.

Long story short he is 47, lives at home and has never paid rent or lifted a finger to help her. She cooks for him and feeds him because he has never worked. Almost two years ago he got state ins to label him disabled due to migraines. Thing is he seems to be fine when there is something he wants to do but suddenly a migraine develops when asked to help or get a job. So, I recently went home to reconnect with my Mom and low and behold my Mom can hardly walk. However she cleans the house struggling and still cooks for my bro. I asked my brother to help her clean and he just deflected and ran downstairs to his room to play video games. My Mom has never had the courage to kick him out. I moved away upon graduating high school. I have worked hard and am grateful for a good job which I can live a nice lifestyle. I’m so worried when my mother dies that my brother will look to me to help him out. I just can’t believe he won’t lift a finger around the house to help her out. So strange and he acts so entitled.

One of my very close friends got quite angry with me recently because me and one of our mutual friends went to far with a joke involving them. We apologised several times to her and she has always been a nice person so we thought that It would be over like that and we went on with our day. She later got mad again for some reason and started acting exactly like I would have in a situation like that. She threatened to expose some secret about me and destroy me. I dont feel threatened by her since I dont have much of a reputation to destroy but I'm scared that she has picked up the behavioral patterns. 
She has always been a very nice person and the total opposite of me. I would try to beat up someone and she would pull me out off the room for example.

800,"I recently realised that I was really in love with my best friend. He is the most important person in my life - we talk every day, we see each other all the time and I just can’t imagine him not being there. We’ve been friends for 3 years or so, but only got really close in the past year. I helped him get through a break up with a girl who just bought out the worst in him. Immaturity, drama, constant bitching about other people, just stuff that I wouldn’t want to be around. So after she was out of the way me and him developed our relationship and it turns out we just clicked. 

I knew I had developed a great deal of affection for him and I believe he did for me to... I hadn’t known what my feelings were towards him until we were sat with friends and somebody bought up his ex and how they might be meeting up in the week for a “chat” which apparently he had said he would just take her back to his and use her for sex - I got really uncomfortable and started having a major anxiety attack and had to leave. He followed me out because he could see I was distressed - and told me he knew I was in love with him. I hadn’t realised this at all, but it hit me that I was and he knew before even I did? 
After a really long, emotional and ego boosting conversation on his part, he essentially told me he didn’t see me the way I do him, but he cares about me and if things were different he would be with me and we would already be married. We promised things wouldn’t change. Because he couldn’t imagine his life without me, and I couldn’t imagine mine without him. 

2 months or so later I’m still finding myself struggling with the things he talks about... knowing I feel the way I do, he persists on talking about his sex life, what he’s done with his ex, he even showed me a box of condoms out of his drawer and said “I can go for hours with these”. I have no response to whatever he says about stuff like that.... I just go quiet and find it hard to get back into the flow of a fun, chilled, happy atmosphere. So I usually leave wherever we are and we don’t talk for a day or two. But then he texts or I text him and it’s back to normal. 

What I would want to figure out in my warped, love sick lil head, is why would he persist on talking about that stuff when he knows I am trying my hardest to get over my love for him, knowing we would never be together. And is he doing it to get a kick out of knowing it’s hurting me? 

I don’t know what the end game is here... I just don’t want to lose him because without the whole “in love” shit - I really enjoy him and being around him. He brings out the best and worst in me. But do I need to lose him in order to put myself first? I could just really do with a point in the right direction... I just don’t want to end up bitter and angry towards him because it’s not fair on him... or me I guess.

And the whole thing between us has gotten awkward. And I dont wanna go home. Because I know he will abuse me either emotionally or physically now. 

He was drunk or was in the progress of sobering up after drinking. So, he kicked me out, i went to my aunts, called me, hung up and texted me these shitty things. Me, who was already messed up and crying quietly to myself- hurting already, heart aching, I just confessed to him that I was suicidal and blamed him for it because, its obviously his fault. He was suppose to teach me these things, communications, love and about life throughout my whole fucking childhood. But no. I only witnessed him feeling sorry for himself, violence and how hatful he can be. So yes, I'm now _this_ person. 

.

.

Now I confessed that I was suicidal. 

This is what he wrote back, also gonna put my thoughts on this:

▪︎""U blame me for everything, I tried to help u all ur life to push you to succeed"" 

Pushing me to succeed, what he actually meant was using that toxic method that narcs use....tough love. I dont know what the fuck tough love is but his isn't working on me at all. He only hurts me instead and I just fall into that hole again. I was born a meek, weak, highly sensitive person SO someone like me doesnt go well with tough love. There were times he was nice to me while trying to help me but my depression or whatever shut my mouth closed made me not want to talk about my problems at that time...because...I was only a fucking tween and a teenager suffering with depression which was strong at that time due to reminiscing about my past, my family problems and the violence that I've seen as a child. 

▪︎""U isolated yourself"" 

My isolation started in 2012, I was 12, which years later become a normal thing for me. He didnt try hard enough. My isolation worsened in 2014, then 2015 is where my suicidal ideations really began. Throught the years he gradually became and showed his true self. So my only coping mechanism against this man was by making the isolation more intense and distract myself with the internet a lot more. Which worked for me. I was normal sometimes and sometimes spoke with him. That lasted less than 'a while' though. 

▪︎""I didnt do that to you..""

I texted him: ""yelling at me and doing and saying what you did when u kicked me out of the house made it worse"". It, being my suicidal ideations. Yes, he did that to me. All these years he those to me. He never said sorry or talked about his horrible behavior, so how the fuck am I suppose to be all normal and be all smiley happy go lucky daughter after the bullshit? Till this day I NEVER forgot how horrible he treated me and said horrible things to me. Because a parent's words can stick with you like glue... and I'm suffering with that as of right now.

▪︎""We'll get some help if u dont want my help.. there are other people who are there for that""

I texted him: ""I've lost my will to live, how am I gonna succeed in life when I'm always suicidal"". Yeah.... that tells a lot about him right? Also why I dont want his help anymore is because, later on he will make it about himself and start being a fucking narc again. So I've learned on this app, narcs will never genuinely help you. So fuck asking him for advice. 

▪︎""I guess I'll report you to social services to get some help instead of blaming me for everything""  

Here I was, finally confessing something he always wanted to hear from me and he just fucking makes it about himself.

Right now, I'm at my other aunts house. I'm gonna sleep here for the night with my dog that he also kicked out.

I dont know what will happen tomorrow. I dont want to go home.

I'm a 20 years old female, I've been friendless since 2012, I'm an introvert, I suffer with social anxiety and speaking up either to people and for myself to the point I just nod, shake my head and mutter out quiet ""oh, mm, oks"". Its really bad. I have confidence issues. I'm cynical. I have no job and still attend to school, adult education this year. My life hasn't really started. And I'm suicidal.

I don’t know what to do.

I am the only income in the household. I recently ended a 2 year job to go to work at a higher class restaurant. I ended training today. I live in Georgia in the United States. Ohio just announced my worst fear: All bars and dinning places will be shut down from tonight until March 30th. I am panicking that either the United States or my State will follow this same restriction. If the USA or my State does this, I literally will have ZERO INCOME. I have saved up $2000 dollars but that is it. Also, I was supposed to finish up registering for classes on the 23rd of this month however all colleges in GA have been shut down. What am I going to do, what CAN I do??? I am so fearful that I will end up spending all of my emergency fund for my family and still end up out of money and out of time.

811,"So my BF is almost 29 and I’m almost 28 and we have been together for 4.5 years and have lived together for 2 years. I knew as soon as we moved in together that I wanted to marry him. Recently I started looking at rings and showed him the ones I want for when he decides to propose. He asked why I keep bringing up rings and I said we are close to that point in our lives. He said he knows he wants to be with me forever but doesn’t know for certain just yet if he wants to get married. He said it could take him several months to get there or even a couple years. I was completely hurt by this because I know exactly what I want from our relationship and he just knows that he can’t imagine life without me. He said he wants to make sure he’s the happiest he can be before committing forever and I took that as he’s waiting for something better to come along but he said that’s not what he meant. 

Am I overreacting by this?? I just don’t understand why he doesn’t feel the same way I do. I thought after 4.5 years together he would be thinking about marrying me by now.

812,"

I'm sorry this is going to be a bit too long, I trued to make it as short as i can but I really need to give the full story to understand why I am so confused and hurt right now.

I am in my senior year of high school and I've had a crush on this guy since junior year but just from afar because we didn't have any class together. But this year, we have classes together everyday so obviously we started getting very close and everyone started noticing. We started sitting together during classes, always laughing, always playing with each other, he would come to my locker and just start conversation at least once a day, text me everyday... etc. People at our school are very childish and gossipy and especially this guy who we ll name zack and who asked me three times and who self proclaims himself as my bestfriend and Not too sound full of myself or anything but just for background : almost half of the guys in our class, including most of his close friends, have asked me out and i rejected all of them (because i liked him) and i know a lot of them still like me (because they told me)). Anyway, everyone started to tell us we should get together because we obviously like each other, but zack started straight up bullying him and getting the other popular guys to do it too because of this (ex: they would scream that he has a boner when im up to the board, or when we are doing an assignment together...) in short, they made each class he has with me a living hell. But he is a very nice, kind, and smart guy and not the type to pick fights or get angry (which i love abt him) so i was the one who fought with zack and the boys each time until i get kicked out of class  to defend him. This lasted a few months until one day he asked me out to the movies, you cannot imagine how much i was excited thinking it was a date until when i got there i found out he invited two other guys. One of them later told me that he sensed like he was third wheeling and interrupting a date. I confessed to him that i liked him and that i tought it was a date too. So one day he asked us to go get food from the mall with him afterschool just the three of us, and he left us in the middle of the meal (on purpose). We stayed together the whole day, played in the amusement park... we were like kids and we had so much fun, it was honestly one of the best days of my life and i think i just loved him so much more since that day (he also held my backpack the whole time). When i left, that guy called him and told him the real reason he left and that i liked him and he should do something about it soon ( btw this whole time zack kept calling him to see what we were doing but i hung up each time because i hated him and we weren't speaking for weeks now). The next Saturday there was a birthday party and that same friend told me that i MUST come because my crush was planning to ask me out that night. It was very hard for me to come because of other issues, but sacrificed so much to come even thought he had been ghosting me since Wednesday. He ignored me again for the first half of the party (i made peace with zack there) so i got angry and told the friend that im going to leave soon because he isnt going to do shit, that friend then told me that he is super stressed and nervous and ""was gonna crap his pants when he saw you so be easy with him please"" then i saw all his guy friends around him telling him stupid things like ""kiss her"" ""fuck her"" before he came up to me and asked me if we can go talk outside. He then basically confessed his feelings to me without looking me in the eyes because he was nervous i said i felt the same to relax him a bit then he asked me on a date for the next weekend i said yes ( while zack was bothering us from the window the whole time) when we went back inside i tried to stay next to him the whole because i knew he would go back to avoiding me because he was nervous. He then texted the whole weekend about it and everything was fine until suddenly monday at school he ignored me the whole day. This lasted the whole week where i was asking him everyday "" are you okay?, did i do something wrong?, what is going on?"" He would each time answer something cold like im fine and walk away. Then friday, the day before the ""date"" he texted me to ask about tomorrow so i said your finally done ignoring me and i tought it was cancelled because we hadnt had a conversation irl since you asked me out. That bastard told me "" its not because of u, its just because of other people, but i think we should still go tomorrow and see if its worth it"" i left him on read. We didnt speak for another week since, until I reached out, ME, AGAIN. So we went to have an hour long conversation where he said that he only asked me out that night because his friends said if he didnt hes a p*****, that he liked me but not THAT much, that he didnt really mean what he said so he regrets it and wanna take it back ( this whole time i was smiling but holding back my tears) he then proceeded to talk about his ex that he still loves for about 30 minutes. He ended the convo by saying you can wait for me as my feelings get stronger if you want and you can date whoever you want in the mean time but i really want us to stay friends because you make me laugh a lot. And surprise surprise, since that day we became basically strangers. Its been a month now and we talked exactly three times since, not more than a minute each time, on school related topics. I know he started going to clubs and drinking very often ( very unlike him he didnt use to that). I also knew after all this that zack started talking to him when we werent talking to each other and feeding him lies about me ( he is a very gullible influentiable and naive person so im sure he believed everything) I hate him for playing me and doing what he did but i believe he does have at least a little bit of feelings for me and i still think about him everyday and cry because it fucking hurts how much i love him and how we went from spending every minute of the day together and opening up about deep things to each other to passing each other in the hallway and not even saying hi or looking at each other or the whole day sitting next to each other in class but not exchanging one word. I feel like it's ripping me apart.

Again i know this is waaay too long and i am so so so sorry. And if you read the whole thing then thank you it means a lot and do you think i should talk to him one last time or do something or forget him (if so how i tried but cant)?",15Mar2020,1

818,"I live in a transitional housing program while I'm waiting for a group home due to complex mental illness which leads to suicidal impulses. I've been there for over a year. 

They don't have internet access or any stimulation, they don't have cable TV, and the TV is only allowed after 5:30pm, I'm currently attending school and I keep on asking how I'm going to attend my courses. They keep on telling me to go to the library (Which is a two mile walk, and the libraries may be closing) or go to Starbucks in order to get my schoolwork done which may be closing soon. Due to the lack of stimulation and the fact that I'm encouraged to go out, then I've already decided that I'm not going to self-isolate if I get sick, because I need to get outside for my mental health and well-being since I'm just so sick of it there and I'm not mentally capable of doing nothing but sleep for 14 days. I'm honest to my case managers and my therapist about the fact that I can't isolate without much stimulation mentally, but nobody is taking it seriously or doing anything. I just can't sleep for two weeks with no stimulation confined in a small space, it's not reasonable for anyone to do, especially since I'm going to need to go to Starbucks to attend school due to classes being moved online and I'm not receiving any accommodations to help me with school.

They've started to take everyone's temperature at medication time, the official policy if someone does get sick is to discharge them... On to the street. Not to mention that this is unethical, and probably illegal and will spread Coronavirus from a contained location into the general public at large.

I'm probably going to have to drop out of my classes that I have an A in, if they do end up closing, which pisses me off because I may not be able to get them refunded.

Are there any tips or advice for living and isolating for people in group homes, when the place that you live sort of encourages you to go out during a pandemic and will kick you out on the street if you do get sick?",15Mar2020,1

824,"A little background: I'm a 22 year old guy diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder who recently started therapy and am going to start group. I work as a retail cashier and nearly every other coworker is around my age. I feel like I have a pretty good, albeit superficial, relationship with everyone. I'm a mostly quiet but sometimes bubbly and energetic guy. Myself and my manager, who is only 23, are pretty close especially as we discuss our anxiety with each other. A few months ago I started crushing hard on a new coworker and asked her out only to find out she's already in a relationship. On the outside I say it's cool and we remain friends, but on the inside I'm devastated. I romanticized her, put her on a pedal. She was ""the one"", and if we started dating all my problems and low self esteem would go away. Because I mean if this amazing person told me they loved me then surely I'd never feel bad again. So in a fit of all these feelings I jokingly told my manager I wanted to kill this girl's boyfriend. I was obviously joking and my manager laughed along. I even told my manager I wasn't actually thinking that and that I was just hurt.

So I have an intense fear of social rejection, I'm paranoid that everyone around me is talking behind my back, making fun of me, and purposely not inviting me out. This stems from experiences and believes from my abuser in middle and high school. Then an incident in college where I confided in a friend about my suicidality lead them to shaming me and telling the rest of our class, leading to them ostracizing me. So me being open with my feelings has bit me in the ass a great number of times.

So today I ended up working with the coworker I had a crush on, and she asks me if I've been talking behind her back. That she's heard from a lot of people that I'm obsessed with her and want to kill her boyfriend. I am able to explain that I only told our manager as a joke and that I shouldn't have said that, and she seemed to be okay with that. But now I know the truth. That my manager who I confided in, told my secrets to everyone else and they are actually making fun of me behind my back. I have caused my worst fears to come true.

So now I have a decision, should I quit my job, which I've always hated and wanted to quit anyway, or realize that I'm overreacting about the situation. I don't work tomorrow so I'm thinking of calling in and quitting by the phone without giving any reason why. I just want to make this one phone call and never think about that place ever again. I'm currently living with my family so I only have car payments and a few bills every month. But to be honest I just want to quit my job, and release my album, that's it. I don't want another job, another chance at embarrassment, another chance at failure, another chance at ruining everything. I'm just so damn tired and I don't care about my life anymore.

834,"Just a lil bit of context : Am 18 going on 19, and a lot of incidents in the past have led to a little spite towards my parents, although I harbor no ill intentions towards them

My parents, especially my mum, always gives me reminders on things that are basic needs of a human. for example like brushing your teeth, going to shower, basically things that I'm fully capable of doing, and do on a daily basis already. Her words are usually phrased like 'you should do xxxx, because if you dont then xxxx will happen', and it gets really annoying because her facts may not be entirely correct and are read off media sites which may not always be reputable. Once I tell her I have done said action, she will go 'Good, at least you have done xxxx.' 

In addition, if it's not a reminder to do something, it's a question from her asking if I've already done so or not. I feel it's ok if it's just once in a while, but these reminders come every day and it really ticks me off. I feel like i'm being treated like a small child who knows how to do nothing in the world, but that's just my inner thoughts.

I have tried confronting her about this and telling her not to give me reminders as such. Many times she will agree to stop reminding me but continues doing so the following day onwards. My dad will then chime in, adding that it is just 'for my own good' that my mom keeps on constantly reminding me on things like this, in addition to asking a load of questions everyday. 

I feel very frustrated with this situation because I feel obliged to let my parents be this way. Although I know they mean well for me, but I don't like being scrutinised by family to the point where even constant reminders of the simplest things. Often times I find myself overthinking in my head arguing with them instead, but to no avail. In an argument, my parents never do back down and refute any statement I will make. They will make their case on why their decision to do something is right, and then say it was for the best for me. Sometimes they may be right, but the argument will always end this way.

I ask because I was a member of a band/production for 4 years, they have a large turnover of performers, around 150 over the years, there are some who came to the band and added musical value, they now receive royalties and recognition for that, but there have been people who were part of the band who added a lot of personality to the show with their character, which has in turn made the show what it is today, entertaining, funny, etc. But they don’t get any credit for that after the band is finished with them. It’s like the band brings in characters, sucks them dry or their character, and then ditches them and integrates their character in to the show. Like stealing their character almost. 

I hope someone understands what I’m saying. And if anyone has any ideas how you can protect your character please let me know.",15Mar2020,1
841,"I posted this yesterday. If didn’t get many hits so I’m giving it another try...

We were married for 19 years and have three children together. My ex has taught at the same private high school throughout her entire career. Her first year of teaching was actually the same year we got married. 

Our relationship started falling apart around the spring of 2014. I work in construction management and was hired on to work the biggest and most stressful project of my life around this time. My ex would get frustrated with all the late nights I was working and we began arguing on a daily basis. The stress from both of our ends eventually led to a dead relationship. It got to the point where we had no feelings left for each other and would just ‘tolerate’ one another. I had always figured she would come back around eventually.

I made perhaps the biggest mistake of my life in November of 2014. After a night out of drinking, I slept with one of my female coworkers and that was the start of an affair that went on for a few weeks. I eventually stopped seeing her, after realizing what I did was terribly wrong. I signed myself up for marriage counseling and begged my wife to join me. She eventually agreed and during one of our sessions, I confessed to the affair. My ex was livid and any improvements we had made over the past few sessions were completely erased. I repeatedly begged for her forgiveness but she told me she was going to need some time to process things. 

During this time, my wife had started talking to another man. He was a senior and one of her students. I didn’t find out about this until she filed for divorce in April of 2015. Two months later, he graduated high school and they officially began dating. I was sickened by this news and the first thing I did was report it to the school. They told me that there was no proof that my ex did anything illegal and that it appeared the romantic part of the relationship had indeed started after he had turned 18. My ex later found out that I talked to the school and she vowed to take me for everything in the divorce.

Long story short, she did just that. I was so hurt and angry that I turned to some bad things during this time. Her new toy boy came from a very wealthy family so she had obtained a top tier lawyer that I couldn’t realistically compete with. I also knew the kids were going to favor their mother regardless of what I said. Putting all of that into mind, I essentially gave up and settled for the bare minimum. I had ended up losing my job over all of the stress and was going broke. 

I essentially took a plea and she got sole custody of the kids in exchange for a written agreement stating that I wouldn’t have to pay her anything. The last thing I wanted to do was give her full rights to the kids but my lawyer strongly advised me to take the deal that was offered and said that I could still maintain a relationship with my kids in the long run without the financial burden. I was in a deteriorating mental state at the time and I don’t think I could have worked at all. The little money I had saved would have went straight to my ex and I likely would have found myself homeless, although looking back I think I may have just ended things entirely before it got that bad.  

Since that time, my ex and her new man have gotten married, had 3 daughters together with a fourth on the way, and are now pushing for him to adopt my biological three children. I clearly intend to fight this in court but the fact that she has sole custody, a highly renowned attorney, and a husband who has spent that past four and a half years around the kids while I have not even been allowed to speak to them under her commands. I’m afraid all the cards are in her hand and that’s what makes it so terrifying. There’s nothing I can really do besides hope the judge has a heart and sees through all of the BS. The first hearing is scheduled for next week.

Just like any other human, I’m not perfect. I’ve made some colossus mistakes over the past few years and I live with deep regret every single day. I will never excuse my actions that played a role in the breaking of my family. However, I don’t believe the mistakes I’ve made should result in the situation I found myself in now. I wish we had a better family court system that wasn’t so pro mother and I wish we had a system that didn’t allow the wealthy to have an instant advantage in situations like mine.

As I said, I’ve retained the best lawyer that I can afford and I’m listening to everything he has said from a legal standpoint. However, I’m needing some support/advice on how to control my emotions in court. My attorney has suggested that the worst case scenario for me would be the judge asking the kids to take the stand. I don’t think I could control my emotions if that were to happen for obvious reasons. I also fear the moment I come face to face with my ex, the woman who has put me through a living hell the past five years. I fear that I won’t be able to keep my mouth shut when I face new husband. I don’t know whether to stay quiet or vocally put up a fight for my children. The last thing I want to do is upset the judge who already thinks low of me. 

All I want is to retain my parental rights while being able to speak to my children without being labeled as ‘mentally unstable’. I want them to understand why I haven’t been in their lives for the past few years and prove to them that I love them and would never want to lose the role of father to them. I fear that they have already been brainwashed into hating me and already see stepdad as their real dad.",15Mar2020,1
842,"I had a falling out with a friend a few weeks ago that made me realize I'm not a very good person. I don't consider other people's feelings before speaking or acting. Sometimes I try to manipulate others to get what I want. I blow up and start arguments over pointless things when I'm feeling sad or depressed. 

I made an appointment with a therapist but they canceled because they are no longer accepting new patients due to the coronavirus. All of the other therapists in my town seem to focus on drug addiction or seem to use relegion as part of their practice. I do need help though so I'm going to give them a try regardless, just frustrated with the situation.

845,"I have a new job as a direct support professional I’ve been at for 2 weeks. I live with my mom who is going through chemo for breast cancer, has a compromised immune system and is supposed to be isolated. 

As the virus crisis quickly escalated, I assumed that they were going to do something like suspend some services. The ENTIRE job consists of large gatherings and public places. Every morning we are in a room with all staff and then all staff and clients as well. 

It’s been very disorganized, they seem to have no plans in place whatsoever for managing the crisis and I’m getting nervous as I’ve received no communication from them about what’s happening tomorrow. I really don’t want to lose the job but my mom could actually be at risk and I don’t have time to find an apartment now. I literally don’t want to leave the house and come back even once, especially to such a breeding ground. 

Should I call them and tell them I have a high risk patient in the house to whom I can’t risk giving the virus? Is this too late notice for tomorrow morning? Will we actually be fine if I clean thoroughly as soon as I get home and stay isolated in my room?? 



TL;DR I have a breeding ground of a job which includes taking people with disabilities into community settings after a large morning meeting of staff and clients. The company seems completely disorganized not telling us what the coronavirus plan is IF ANY. I can’t risk bringing the virus back home to my cancer patient mom but as far as I know I’m supposed to report to work tomorrow.

847,"Hello people of Reddit. I need some advice when it comes to my ""friend."" My ""friend"" is a pretty funny down to earth person. She has some good traits, but also a lot of bad ones... I've known her for a long time, and she's always stealing things. She used to steal people's photos on social media (make fake profiles) to pretend that it was her. The funny thing about it is she's actually stolen many photos but a majority of them are guys... I feel like she's implying that she might have some gender issues, but whose to say? She goes by boy names and dresses like one 24/7. She also has no hobbies except being on social media. She watches ""transgender"" or ""lgbt"" videos all the time. Every time we would hang out that's all she did. I don't mind the lgbt community, I wouldn't even mind if she was trans or gay, but that's all there is to her. She does weird shit like claiming she's an ""artist"" and ""photographer"" but she steals that stuff too. I've google searched her ""photos"" and ""artwork"" and she's stolen every single one of them. I'm getting fed up with her because she just sounds so fake. Could she be mentally ill??? I pity her. We're both in our 20's and she'd rather steal people's hard work than get into a legit hobby like art or photography and create her own things. I don't understand how somebody can't have a hobby? It's like she doesn't know how to have fun or even want to have fun? She doesn't even drive either, yet acts like she does by taking photos in the car making it look like she drives (or she steals other peoples photos) It's freaking weird. She doesn't work, dresses grungy, has no hobbies, doesn't date, doesn't drive, I'm her only friend. Yet, when I've been around her and her family I've heard her say she has a lot of friends, and hangs out with them a lot. Pretending to have a normal life. I feel bad for beating her down, but it's hard to be friends with someone like this. I find it so bizarre. Should I break off our friendship?",15Mar2020,1
848,"I have debilitating anxiety that runs everyone off eventually, which increases my anxiety. I’m barely functional right now. 

I’ve started talking to someone who tolerates my anxiety really well and isn’t effected by it. They’ve basically promised me the world. They say they won’t leave unless I want to leave them, they want to financially care for me (my anxiety makes decent employment hard) and support my dreams, and they always try their best to comfort me when I have a panic attack. They live across the country, want to meet, and are willing to pay for everything to get me there. 

I almost left this afternoon, but the person I asked to watch my place started sending me these articles about human trafficking and said that no one will love me the way I am — which I’m pretty sure is true — so it must be some sort of sick person trying to victimize me. I chickened out and didn’t go. 

I feel so stupid, I don’t know if this is justified. I know that trafficking and stuff like that are more common than people like to think, but I don’t have the option of turning down my one chance at being happy just because it could potentially end up badly.

After graduating and my lease being up I knew I wanted a change of scenery &amp; we were both tired of having to commute (He drives, I do not). So I decided to move to his city &amp; start new here. 

He has a huge group of close friends some of which he has known since kindergarten who are all amazing and welcoming. His parents, cousins, aunts/uncles, etc all live here as well. There’s no shortage of things to do as it is a bustling city, I have secured a job I like &amp; live in a beautiful apartment with a close friend of his that he has known for years. I am a social person in the right situation, but I have found myself struggling to form real connections or find anyone I could see myself getting close to. Anything I do is with him and his friends/family. He has expressed his want for me to be more independent, but I’ve only been living here for 3 months, much of which was spent moving into my place, securing a job, and getting settled. I do not know how to put myself out there or what avenues to find friends. I don’t drive, so I can’t visit anyone from my college easily. I’m working 6/7 days &amp; on my days off I want to just be home or we already have plans with his friends.

So I am a 16 year old girl, and I have this ‘friend’ who’s 18. I say it like that because we are very good friends but I like him a tiny bit more. 

A little backstory: 
We’ve been good friends for about 3/4 months and I really struggle with making new friends and currently don’t have many other friends so he is one of my closest friends. Unlike me, he (let’s call him A) is quite popular in his year, he’s kind of nerdy but a really nice guy so he has a lot of friends. A lot of people say he’s a pedo because of the age difference as I’m in year 11 and he’s in year 13. We only speak through texts because i think it would be weird to hang out at school but we try see each other around if possible. 

Anyway I have this friend who is also in my year. 2 months ago she asked for A’s snapchat. I didn’t give it to her because I thought it was strange as to why she wanted it. The other week she spoke to A about me and said that “I was sad because me and A lost our snapchat streak” (for the record I joked about losing it with some other friends and she was eavesdropping). She then proceeded to tell me he said it was really weird I care about that. This isn’t the main point but I just wanted to clarify that it is weird she would go out of her way to tell him how weird I am right? Or am I being overdramatic. Anyway she eventually got his snapchat through other means, still not sure why she wants it so much but I was just wondering if anyone could tell me how to not be really jealous? A told me she added him and he said he was just going to be really blunt but I’m a bit worried she’s just going to talk about me to him and make him dislike me (you can really tell I’m an insecure teen this is pathetic I’m sorry) So yeah how do I stop overthinking about this situation. Also I am not stupid and I know this little crush won’t go anywhere but I really do appreciate him as a friend so I don’t want to lose him there either.

That is literally my dream but we are both 22 but I’ve never had a girlfriend (lol), a serious job, and I’m living in a shitty college apartment until I can get my degree.  He seems to have it all together and I’m utterly lost in comparison.

I have a general idea of what I want to do and how to do it but life is so unpredictable I’m scared that these goals will be screwed up and I don’t know how to feel more comfortable with this uncertainty. (iE corona virus screwing my class schedule)

How can I know if I’m doing the right things coming out of college.  Am I already behind starting my life?  Should I already know these things?",15Mar2020,1

My contract with my new employer will start April 1st and my last workday at my current job is March 26th. However, my new contract has a '1 month' clause which means the employer or I can decide to not go forward with the contract during one month. The new position is in IT consulting so I'm not too worried just yet but what if the economy goes to hell the coming weeks?

873,My family and I were invited to a wedding and we had RSVP’d last year near November. The wedding is being held in a city where there are confirmed COVID-19 cases. The wedding is on the 2nd of April and my family and I worried because all of us are immunocompromised. If we go we’d have to get hotels too and we’d be exposed to lots of people. So my question is if it would be rude to not go since we already said we were and it seems like they’re still holding the wedding.,15Mar2020,1
874,"This one friend that I have has been moving really weird and fake a lot recently. I’ve always let it slide but I can’t anymore. I need to call him out on it. The reason I think he’s been acting fake is because first whenever me and him chill it’s only to smoke. 

I would go all the way to him and we would smoke a few joints and he would wanna leave. He’s never once been like oh come to my house and chill or asked to chill anywhere. It’s always smoke by the building and leave. I’m tried of that. Am I over reacting or is that a fake friend? 


Another thing I noticed is today I messaged him asking what he was doing and he replied back saying he had no plans so I asked him if he wanted to smoke later and he said something along the lines of I’m down and then I asked him if he can get the rolling paper this time since I can’t get it till next Friday or if not we would have to smoke another time and his responses to that was “oh ok fam” 

Like really he can’t buy the rolling paper this one time that costs $2.50 when I’ve always been the one to buy the weed and paper the whole 2 years I’ve known him. Like this just shows to me that he’s a fake friend or is using me. What do you think? 

How can I call him out on this? Also should I say In text or in person? I’m more comfertable saying it in text tbh. It just kinda hurts because I’ve known him for 2 years and I considered him my best friend so to find out that ur best friend of 2 years was using u the whole time and been a fake friend hurts a lot I at least want answers",15Mar2020,1
875,"I work at a live television studio. I have a co-worker who has been here for a little over a month and we've already had some issues with him (repeated tardiness, poor attitude, missing a few pre-recorded segments). Our direct supervisors finally did something about it and the dept head had a talk with him. This worker has gotten much better about being on time and he hasn't been disrespectful for a while.

But now he came in hungover and kept having to run out of the studio to throw up. Direct supervisor and some other co-workers laughed it off, but I'm concerned. I have to work more closely with this guy than they do. I'm having surgery soon and this guy will have to be alone in the studio, managing on-camera talent among other things. Is it wrong to go to the dept head with my concerns, since he already knows we've had issues with this worker in the past? I just feel I'll be uncool to the other workers if they found out I told, especially since my direct supervisor shrugged it off. I know I shouldn't care if others like me, but I also feel like we're having too many distinct incidents with this guy, and I'm afraid that more are just going arise. I also cannot approach this guy individually because when I tried to in the beginning of his employment, he went off on me and left.

The thing you need to understand about my industry is that everything has to work in close coordination to make our shows happen. So when someone keeps running past me to puke, or our headset channel is bogged down with ""Is X okay? Is X in the bathroom again? How much did you have to drink, X? Sure you don't want to go home, X?"" it affects my work as well.

880,"Hi! I’m 17 and I’m soon done with my first year of the swedish equivalent to High school. In sweden you get to choose whether you want to study Economics, Tech , Nature sciences, arts and social sciences. There’s many more but those are the main ones. I chose tech. 
I've always been a bit on the creative side, math and physics has never been my strong sides. I just guessed that I just needed more practice.

 But school is becoming really hard and I’ve lost all motivation. I feel kind of lazy and stupid bc of that. It was between tech and Arts bc I felt that those were the most creative lines of study. I did not want to choose  arts since it has the reputation of “lazy students with no future” (no offence to anyone studying arts!! My cousin is studying arts and she is doing so well !!) but now I’m starting to really second guess my choice. 

If I were to begin studying arts now I would have to start my 1st year again.  But I guess it’s worth it if it’s what I want?? But I know I’ll feel a lot of regret. I feel like I’d downgrade bc I know tech opens many more doors. But if u add some courses you can still become an architect or psychiatrist whilst studying arts. 

But idk if it’s just a lack of motivation or me genuinely disliking tech that makes me wanna switch. What should I do?",15Mar2020,1

Here it goes, I purchased a very skittish parrot about a month and a half ago and have loved him so far, since birds are SUPER scared of everything him letting me pet him/hold him is incredible.

Basically, he is a little scared when my hands go in his cage. And I was very upset from something else that morning so when he didn’t responded to my training the way I liked and got a little scared I just picked him up without thinking. Bird owners would know that this is the stupidest thing I could have done. But, I did it, and now he is super Bitey  and scared of me. I have spend every second possible with him since it happened, even putting off events just because I was so terrified of our current situation. I said all that to say this, I don’t need advice on the bird, I got myself into this mess, I can get myself out. I’m asking about how to stay calm, not cry, and stay happy.

883,"Context: I'm a 19 year old guy with zero experience in relationships, she is also the same age as me and we're in the same class, however I only have one or two classes a day being math unlike her who has the whole set. She's a rather shy and studious girl at least from the classes we've had together, being somewhat introverted and not really being part of the class I've only talked with her once or twice for either homework or something else math related. 

Being the fool that I am I asked her out once via text in December as soon as Christmas Vacation hit, I told her I was interested in her and would like to know her better and if she would like to go lunch and watch a movie or anything really. She rejected me politely, it looked as if her mom had actually been the one rejecting me by the way she answered (lol) although I can't confirm anything really. 

Well, no biggie, I got bummed out at first but I was over her rather quickly, or so I thought. Come march and I'm committed to ask her out again and in person this time, the feelings have resurfaced rather strongly again I'm not sure why.

I’m 16 &amp; she’s 12. Shes incredibly intelligent for her age and I know she would understand. My parents know about it and understand. My neurological disorder causes severe OCD, depression, anxiety, and makes me physically sick at times. I know I have good reason to use it and times are changing. it bothers me so much that my parents could get in trouble for that. And I don’t know how she will take it, with it needing to be kept a secret and all. We’re going to explain things to her and she’ll get the understanding that it’s for medicinal use and not uncommon at all, but I’m just worried. 

The reason why I’m thinking it’d be best to just tell her is because my parents are splitting, and with my mom being a single mother out on her own and needing to deal with my medical needs, traveling and living together would be so much easier if it wasn’t a big secret that needs to be kept.

Right but I’m not feeling like the best of people as I didn’t thing I’d have this problem in my life

A friend and I were having a conversation and the sex topic came up and I stated that my girlfriend and I have sex, no other details given.

My girlfriend is now angry saying that I exposed her but she has a friend who knows a lot of our sexual activity, and this friend I have told is the first person to know anything about us.

886,"Backstory: As the title states, I'm 18 with mild schizoaffective disorder. I was prescribed Haloperidol (a first generation antipsychotic.)

Over the many months I took it my condition only worsened, in addition to the disorder itself getting worse, it also caused me to permanently feel ""foggy"" (as in I couldn't think straight, or think in a very complex way). This caused my grades and social life to suffer.

So one day, I decided to secretly stop taking it. One week in, the confusion, and the ""fog"" I felt started to subside. One month in, my delusions and tactile hallucination stopped. I became less depressed and anxious and my grades went from failing almost every class to an B/C average. 

Today, I am very happy, healthy and I experience symptoms very rarely and when I do they are extremely mild.

I know what I did was risky, dangerous even. But it was my only option.

Now that I'm 18 and can legally refuse treatment, I want to inform my doctor of my decision and get him to stop writing prescriptions for me (on that particular med, I still take all my other ones as they help a lot.) So my family doesn't have to keep paying for a med I don't take.  (I live in the U.S. btw)

I'm afraid however that my family or my doctor will respond harshly to my decision and I'm worried I may be forced to continue treatment, even though I am mentally competent and definitely not dangerous to myself or others.

 (honestly this fear is probably unfounded, considering they always say they've noticed that I've gotten much better, but it's still a possibility.) 

How should I tell them?",15Mar2020,1
887,"It's my birthday. I'm feeling really down. I'm not doing anything at all. I got out of a 7- year relationship recently, someone I spent every second with and had planned to marry. I loved him and we were best friends. He would become abusive, it wasn't a lot but it was enough for me to know it would continue. It was really hard to leave and we both cried a lot but now he is dating a new girl. Apparently I'm very sensitive and an idiot because this hurts me to see in spite of everything. My friends in my area moved away long ago. So I'm all alone. 

I had to pay off a massive medical bill, and now have no money for rent that's due tomorrow. On top of it, I've been putting off dental work for 8 months because they quoted me $1950 even with insurance and I keep thinking there will be a time when I have that kind of extra money. I used to have a great salary. I lost my job and now everything is piling up. I want to start a business and I know I'd be successful but I cannot get a loan because I'm still building my credit.

There's so much stress. I'm going to lose the place I've rented and made into a home the past 6 years. 

Now my work just sent us an email that we won't be going in for at least two weeks because of the coronavirus. I know they have the funds to pay us, but they are saying this is our ""unpaid vacation"" where we can recooperate. 

I am so happy for workers that are having their wages covered during this time, but I wish more businesses would do this. On the other hand, I get that it makes sense that if they aren't earning money, they can't pay it. 

I honestly have no where to go and don't know what to do. If I could get a loan of some kind, I would pay it back x 10 in the future. I have an amazing business plan and if I could breathe for a second I could make it great. Unfortunately, I cannot have a family member sign for me. My father is abusive and if I mention anything to do with money he would tell me I am a loser or ruining his life, etc. My mother has never had a paid job and is constantly abused my him as he is the money earner. My dream has always been to get her away from him and have us both leave him altogether. But it's looking like I might have to go back and stay with them.

So a friend of ours called my wife and told her that a person with known Coronavirus was at Safeway (grocery store) talking and coughing without any cares.  This friend was told by a friend of the carrier that she was diagnosed positive.  

I know my wife and this other person wouldn’t do anything but I felt I needed to tell people because my community has large elderly population.   Five large senior housing complexes and two convalescent homes.   So I posted on Nextdoor.  I was vague and mentioned it’s a rumor (even though I know more then I led on). I gave some clues to the persons identity and I wrote that this is for if anyone knows this person hopefully they can tell them to please continue their in home quarantine.  

The post immediately was filled with people pissed I posted it because it was written as friend of friend.  I understood, so I told them how to report it and within an hour it was taken down.  I didn’t delete it myself cause I still felt I was doing right thing.   

So this morning we get a call from the friend.  The person that told her was pissed so she was calling the people she told.  Which unfortunately for me are very small groups.  The first parent who knows the person with covid only told two people and my (guess not friend anymore) only told two people.  

Anyway my wife is pissed and I am an idiot cause I feel I did what I should.  

I never identified the person.  Very vague clues. Like school her kids attend and she is seen talking to someone in SUV at pickup.   Just enough so someone can get to her.  

Apparently it  got to her.

895,"So last week, I (15F) got bored and went on Omegle to chat. You can add subjects you want to talk about , and you match with others who want to talk about those topics. I listed depression and suicide. Bc I'm depressed and suicidal and I wanted to help others out. I met this guy and we had a lot in common. Both closeted bisexual atheists in a conservative household. He was kicked out months ago and he's super depressed. Also, he said those things first, he didn't say those things after I told him.
So It all started when I ended one of my sentences with the word bro. He then said that I brozoned him. I thought he was joking but he really thought we were having a relationship. We continued talking on discord and he sent me two things. 

-The first one was that we have so much in common
-The second one was so we're more than friends now huh? 
So I replied to the first one with yup and to the second one with your moving fast huh? But he probably thought I said yup about the relationship thing. We just continued talking and at some point I discussed moving to another country to live with your partner and I probably have him the impression that I wanted to move in with him later. I know that was so stupid of me but I didn't know he was that serious about it. He's 18.
So he asked me to send pics of my face, but I felt uncomfortable. After pressuring me I send him a pic of my face, he told me that he can show me proof that he finds me cute which he later confirmed to mean boner. I felt uncomfortable but we kept talking . 
We barely talked the next few days. I just asked him how he was and stuff. But he kept bringing up the relationship thing, and I kept saying that idk and we moved way too fast. The reason why I didn't just reject him (in a kind way of course) was bc he's depressed and he has no one else in his life. So I didn't want to make him feel worse. 
So today he was pressuring me about the relationship shit and after I told him I will talk to him tomorrow he told me he won't be here. I got super scared cause I'm already suicidal and if someone does it bc of me I will never forgive myself. He kept saying that he wants something but couldn't tell cause I will feel more guilt after he commits suicide. So I knew he meant nudes, but I acted dumb and I let him tell me. Obviously idk what to do.
Since I'm not a very naive girl he thinks I am, I know that he could just be manipulating me and using me bc he knows that I will feel bad for him .
But part of me still believes it bc the things he told me were believable. 
I told him my mom was coming and I had to delete everything off my phone, and I'll talk to him tomorrow. 
He said: 'goodbye, I won't be here anymore.' 

I'm scared but at the same time this seems like a scam. He knows I come from an abusive family and probably thought I was an easy target. 
I wanted to cut off all contact, but he's actually lonely and in need of help.

I busied myself with other things and looked forward to the “next big thing”: baby, house, etc.  Life became boring and monotonous, and while my husband treats me extremely well, he can also be controlling and needy.  This has intensified in recent months, and I am just now recognizing it for what it is.  

A few months ago, I began having an affair, and it was very short lived.  But I would never have thought I would have been one to do that; to me, that shows the depths of my unhappiness, that I was willing to risk my marriage for something else.  And I miss the connection I had with the other person every day.  We have been to marriage counseling many times since the affair ended, and while my husband sees that as the main issue, he doesn’t understand that our marriage wasn’t great before then.  It just finally bubbled to the surface.  

I no longer feel in love with my husband.  He is a good man and good dad, but I don’t have any feelings of love or attraction for him.  Little things he does annoy me and cause me to dislike him even more; it is turning to active hate and apathy.  He says that we can save the marriage if I choose to; I just have to act loving and the feelings will follow.  But how can I do that when I have no desire to at all? And at some points he disgusts me?  

A few things make this even more complicated.  My family thinks this is completely out of character and assume I’m having some manic episode.  I have always felt like I have to do things to make others happy or do what’s expected of me.  That’s why now that I’m letting my true feelings be known, they don’t see this as “the real me”.  They are also religious and reject divorce for almost every reason.  They think I need to stick it out for our kids.  My husband also continues to go over to talk to my parents without my consent, essentially manipulating things with his emotional rhetoric because he is afraid of losing me.  

I wish I had dated more before I got married.  I feel like I missed out on some of the fun, and I also feel like I didn’t really know who I was when I married.  I was doing things because it was expected or I thought it what was supposed to happen.  And now I regret it.  

I’m afraid of hurting my kids and “messing them up” in some way.  My family makes me feel guilty for even feeling unhappy in my marriage, like I should realize I have someone in front of me who loves me and works hard for us, is a good dad.  All of those things are true but I don’t want him.  And I feel guilty for it.  

I’m afraid of getting divorced and regretting it.  Maybe I would realize down the line that I should have tried harder or been happier with what I had.  But how?  I’m mentally pushing myself in that direction every day and it’s like there is a block.  I can’t get past it.  

So my ultimate question is this: should I remain in a steady marriage where I know I will be taken care of even though I’m not happy, or should I end things and begin a new life?  This is a constant weight on my mind.  Please help, Reddit.",15Mar2020,1

It started as a burning in throat and nasal passage and I've begun coughing quite a bit. I have an appointment that's pretty important tomorrow at Texas Oncology (I live in Oklahoma) and have been going back and forth with myself on whether or not I should go considering there will be cancer patients there and I'd feel like shit if I ended up finding out I had corona or just even the flu and spreading it to anyone in there. The downside is I'm also in the midst of receiving disability for neuropathy from a 3rd party company I paid for through my job so they keep track of every appointment of mine and are still in the midst of making a decision about paying me disability (which is an entire bullshit thing in itself). So if I don't go, they could think I didn't really need to even though I do (for iron infusions). I hate the fact that I'm even put in this position because I couldn't have just gone and gotten tested last week when I first got sick to see if this was corona. Anyway, knowing the basics, what would you guys do in my position? Go or reschedule for a week or two (which could even be worse since they might shut down due to this crap)?

As of writing this, I just got done with my friends birthday party. Long story short, my mom told me before I went out that she’ll lock the door and won’t let me in. I went and about an hour or so into my friend’s party, my mom called me and told me that she’s locking the place down and won’t let me in. On the phone, she literally told me that I’m locked out of the house for the next two weeks since I apparently might have the coronavirus or some shit and after that, I can come home.

I get there and just can’t wait to either go sleep or have a drink.  

I read a few articles online.  Some say it’s an addiction, some say you need to put more effort into finding life interesting.  Maybe it is where I live?

907,"A few weeks ago, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of 2 years for unrelated reasons. I have not felt “right” since and I am so scared. 

I feel like nobody really knows me and it’s giving me really bad anxiety. I feel almost like I don’t even know myself. Life feels weird and monotonous. Like every day and everyone is just going through the motions. And it’s scaring me and I can’t figure it out. I don’t know how to explain it properly to the extent of what I am actually feeling. I would almost describe it as a sort of existential crisis. Everything I do or say feels weird and mundane and pointless, almost like it’s programmed or something. And I feel the same as I observe others. Like we are all just doing/saying things because those are the things we do. Like that is just what is “expected” or something. Nothing feels real. I can’t find meaning in anything. I have my friends and coworkers and family but I feel like with each group and each individual person, everyone sees a different version of me and nobody REALLY knows the full, real me, or everything that’s going on in my life. It’s freaking me out. I feel so out of place and I’m so uncomfortable all the time. I miss having one person who knows every single thing about me and who truly cares and asks about my life and loves me for who I truly fully really am. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this. I feel so alone even though I know I have others around me. I just want to feel normal again.

Please tell me if you have ever felt this way. I am open to any advice or insight on how I can stop feeling like this. Thanks",15Mar2020,1
908,"tl;dr: My therapist and I agree that I need birth control. My dad doesn’t agree. How can I change his mind?

I (17F) go to a therapist and last time I went, this past week, I had to bring my dad along with me so the therapist could talk to him about me. The therapist, my dad, and I were all talking and my therapist mentioned birth control. She said that since I have a serious boyfriend and am a young adult I should be placed on birth control. She proceeded, for at least 10 minutes, to go over the benefits of it and insist that he put me on it. She said even if I wasn’t having sex that it was a good idea to put me on it in case I made that decision to have sex in the near future. I agreed wholeheartedly with everything that she was saying and later that day, had worked up the courage to ask him about it. I thought that he would be supportive since a fellow adult had recommended it. Instead, when I asked, he said “Is he pressuring you that much?” He then talked about how my therapist says things are good ideas, but that doesn’t mean we should listen to her. 

It really bothers me that he treated the subject as such because he always says he will be there for me and I should open up more. When he treats these things like this, it hurts me.",15Mar2020,1

I told him I didn’t realize I had that much strength and didn’t take that in for account, and then I apologized for what I did.

He disregarded it and screamed at me saying, “You aren’t that strong to do that, you’re just extremely stupid”. I kept trying to apologize him, but he left shortly into his other room and locked the door.

A guy I know, who is in his 20s, admitted to me that he is in love with a girl we both know. The problem is, is that she is in high school. She is the legal age of consent in our state, but not 18. They have an 8 year age gap. 

At first they started just hanging out, and then he showed me texts where they flirted, and then told me it has began to get sexual (not full force though). He claims that she is so mature for her age and he wants her for more than sex. I think she is mature for her age, but still very immature in many ways. 

Her mom has no problem with her hanging out with him. She has met him many times and I have even heard her say things like “I wish you were younger because you would be perfect for her”. 

For some reason, he has not told anyone else except for me and has advised me to keep it on the down low. I don’t know why he trusted me enough to tell only me. Other people we know have been catching on and think it’s weird that they hang out. They just don’t know the full extent of it. 

Should I just leave this situation alone since she is the legal age? Or should I tell someone? I’m not sure what to do. I’m stuck in a hard place and I don’t feel like this is right.",15Mar2020,1

918,"So I have two jobs and one is in a poor income area. So it’s a very diverse group of individuals. There’s this one lady with autism I believe or some sort of mental illness and she’s very nice and childlike. 

She’s come in before to buy gift cards to eBay and Amazon and visa gift cards, etc. So today she needed help to buy a gift card to apple but she was mentioning how she wanted to know if we would pay her cash today(under the table in exchange for cleaning) bc she didn’t save enough. I told her we couldn’t really do that and hyped up on caffeine I started asking for more detail which I never really do. 

She basically spends the next 2 hours telling me about her gf and how she needs to send her this money through Apple bc her gf is in the hospital and she can only talk to her once she sends the money. And she shows me the messages and basically I found out that this sweet old woman is being scammed by some girl and guy in California!

She’s bought this woman iPhones, sent her presents, and gift cards and even gives money for her to get dinner delivered to her.

And let’s say that she had about 100 text messages total, the scammer girl sent maybe 12 messages total. The woman is obsessed with this scammer girl and she sends her just rows of hearts and kissy face emotions. 

And I tried to talk to her and try to make her see that maybe this scammer girl who she’s only talked with her online isn’t who she says she is. But she would smile, shake her head , and say how much she loves the girl and how it’s so real and she doesn’t know what she would do without her. And in the messages she’s pretty graphic in explaining that she will do anything for her “wife.”

And then it gets more fucked bc she then tells me things about her past where she found her mother dead in her room at the age of 20 and she got married but then her wife died a few years after that. And my soul was just vomiting bc I want to help her soooo much but I’m scared what will happen if this woman actually “loses” this scammer girl. 

She even told me that one night when she didn’t send the scammer girl food she threatened not to talk to her and she said she cried for two days and she didn’t know what she would’ve done if the girl didn’t reach out again. Like I’m genuinely concerned and want to help and I don’t know how.

Like I was able to stop her from buying another gift card today but I’m not always here and she doesn’t have anyone who really watches over her. And I asked if she told the care takers in her life about this girl but she’s scared they’ll judge her on being gay. So I think I’m the only non-involved person who knows what’s happening and idk how to help!!! 

And what’s crazier is how she met the scammers! She was playing with her phone and dialed a bunch of random numbers and called but hung up and the number called back. And from what she said about the conversation  I think the scammer woman thought that she was talking to a kid who accidentally dialed her number ,but then she told her she was like 50 something and her little scammer brain started churning.

I need to know what to do!! I wanted to reach out immediately to the ppl she was texting but this woman genuinely believes that this scammer woman is her wife and that they are in a serious relationship. I asked her if she ever asked why they didn’t meet in public (they’ve been texting for a year from what she says , but the messages are up to 3 months ago) and why she has to send her money just to text her but I don’t think she understands.  I didn’t want to flat out say, “this is a scam,” bc I don’t know how she would react. Also , I don’t want her to think or know that I’m the one who made her “wife” go away bc I feel she would blame me. Please help me, Reddit!",15Mar2020,1

At the early stages of our relationship my boyfriend had an issue with my past. I’ve slept with two people before him ( both mistakes and bad experiences I don’t want to go into  ). He soon said he ‘ got over it ‘ and hasn’t brought it up since. We are now engaged, a year and a half later, but I can’t help feeling guilty. I wonder if he is truly over it and I hate the thought that it may be bothering him deep inside. He has been with other women before too. 

That doesn’t bother me, but I know for men it’s a little different. Should I bring this up? I feel bad about it literally daily and wish I waited, I may as well have as I was almost 25. There’s a lot of things that bother me about it. 

The fact my first was no good and the fact I was drunk during my first time. That was not meant to be the case I always thought my first time would be super special. And the fact I was drunk kills me. The fact that I just cannot believe I let my morals slip as I wanted to wait till marriage.

I'm not antisocial.

I feel like I'd find a better solution myself by self regulating like an adult and fitting in all my hobbies in the day the way I think works best, having a little freedom rather than being told what to do like a child.
I understand they want what's best for me but I often feel like I dont have the freedom to schedule my day how it would work for me. I understand in the real world that's not how it works all the time, but being forced into no choice but ""use this time we give you"" with hobbies sucks.
They let me self regulate for a few weeks and it worked fine, I managed to balance everything. Now were back to square one, I have to wait till the evenings to play. What if I want to play a bit in the afternoon and come off for a few hours then play a bit into evening? I feel obligated to use the time they give me so it feels more mandatory than if it were just thrown out there. Same as every other hobby, If they told me I could only play my guitar in the evenings I'd feel the same way. Also since covid 19 schools are shut and none of my friends are going to be meeting upbecause they dont want to risk it.

3 weeks later she hits me up out of no where. Voice sounded funny on the phone. I was busy (thank god ) 

Did a little back ground check on the social medias using the number.
Media’s. Something seemed off, pictures super edited, no past history... 

Searched her number on google and picture popped up and it was confirmed. 

I just blocked the number so fast.

Now I just feel violated and embarrassed. That no one tapped me on the shoulder or anybody said anything..  maybe no one noticed .. but it just bugging me.

Just feel like my manhood was played with.  And it’s bothering me to move on from the situation.

I don’t know how to handle this. I’m sad for the loss of dee, I’ve lost someone whom I grew up with but I’m more sad for the loss jay is experiencing and I’m unsure how to handle this situation. Any advice, I’ll be grateful. Am I doing this right?",15Mar2020,1
932,"I have developed a crush on s who I commute with and we have been greeting eachother and having small talk after we get off the bus. This week I was ready to ask her out. but My job has been shut down for two weeks thanks to the coronavirus and there are exactly two weeks left on my contract. Ive only seen her once this week and that was before I knew what was happening.

I know her name from talking to her so I was able to find her on instagram. I dont know if I should just send her a DM. we have talked in person but not much but She does show signs of being interested. The only alternative. I may have is to possibly commute on my work for home days to see if I can catch her and ask her out. 

I honestly dont know what to. she makes me feel away that I have not felt in years. and I have not been able to sleep for the last three days.

TL;DR I caught feelings for a woman I commute with. My job got closed down for the remainder of my contract so it would be hard to see her. I found her on social media because I know her name. should i try to message her or try to catch her on the route after my contract job ends.",15Mar2020,1

So my Grandfather has cancer and doesn't have much time left... I feel sad and feel bad for him. But I can't stop thinking about the cameras he has. I feel really conflicted, like i'm sad but also wondering if he might give me one, and I feel really bad. 

I'm not sure if this is normal, to be sad but also excited to see if you get a $1000 camera, and it fuels it further with the fact I was actually planning to film a short film soon... He even knows about my interests in film making and photography.

Just wanna know if this is something to feel bad about, or if its normal. I might just be a bad person.

NOTE: this is entirely just how I feel, and I feel really bad.",15Mar2020,1
