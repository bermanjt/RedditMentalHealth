0,"So, recently i have kind of become more aware of exactly what the smart phone is, not just what it does for me specifically. I knew that tech was keeping more and more tabs on us but i will admit, I actually love having access to my smart phone. I am using social media which is reddit but i dont see it like facebook or the others. I work with it by calendar dates, keep notes and have reference books etc. 

Its more like a giant forum for me and theres lots i can learn, i enjoy talking to others on here. Its what i really liked fb for anyway... Commenting on my sports teams pages after games and other things too. No likes, photos up and not trying to show how great my life is to others, or seeing other people doing it lol... 

Theres upvotes but people here have been more friendly in a massive way to me. People on fb especially will attempt to ridicule, argue and generally act a fool alot. I think you guys are nicer and more intelligent. So can u hook me up with...

Any ways you know or do yourself that makes using a smart phone as private as possible. Im not really nuts on keeping what i do secret, its just i bought the phone for alot of money. I will use it exactly how i want and nobody asked me if id like to be kept track of, i paid you cash for the phone, cash cow is all outta milk lol. 

I saw a darknet doc which went into how ""sexploitation"" (getting comprimising data from people) and using it to horribly extort people. The doc actually showed some of the sites and the scale and how its being was very scary. Its one of the biggest black market earners now and pushes neck and neck with drug markets. I am not likely to be a victim even though anybody can... Its more young people who are targeted, comprimised and forced to do horrible things by people, which is recorded and so on. There are communitys of people who exclusively love doing it and they gloat and show off who they have got trapped and what they are making them do. Im sorry but i didn't realise how deep privacy actually is. I got concerned for the lil ones in my family and i guess i was quite naive what sick people really means. 

I dont want anybody being able to get data from me, record through a mic and cam without my permission, or keep track of my preferences so trends can be given for ads / marketing and sales. I am not really clued up on tech, as in im not a tech/silicon valley kind of person. Im able to use computers competently but not enough about how it works fully.

Is it even possible to totally stop a smart device from collecting mic and cam data totally and completely at all? Im not big on children having phones when they are young at all, but if it isnt possible then parents must decide if they wish to allow their child to use something they arent able to make totally secure. Its more a case of apps and little ones too. Buying a child a tablet isnt bad at all, there are tons of games and ways you can play together and watch them learn. Id say that if you give them a tablet and they are able to use it when they want its not good for them at all (in my opinion). Those children are very likely to just use the tablet most of the time. I think its sad that some kids are given a tablet ""coz it keeps them quiet"" as the ones ive seen and known really don't go out and socialise as much, and arent as socially developed in general. Still lots of parents arent aware of it being bad like single parents juggling everything they do may well be tempted to use a tablet for peace to do whats needed on a hectic day. 

Its apps that are the problem. Kids dont have a clue about app permissions even though they get really good at using it quite often. Theres apps like talking cat tom or something that had individuals talking to lil ones on a camera. Mum and dad doesnt have a clue, extreme as that is, id still not allow them to be data mined either as a matter of hell no, children arent cash cows. Anyways if u don't see what theyre up to you can have things that arent good slip past. Controlled access &amp; and involving yourself is great, tech will be their world more than us, nostalgia aside we are moving more into tech each day. 

Can i make every app have as limited access as i can (ideally as low as mic and cam access) or is it all based on every apps personal conditions it wants or it wont install? I think the 2nd option but what do you guys know? Just means if the app wants too much access just simply not using it. 

Of all ""social"" stuff if need be id happily remove all others. I only have a fb with 100 family and friends on and none of the others but i can still access fb on public or work computers to keep in contact with family and friends. Id definitely keep Reddit, i dont know if mining happens here or what scale but i accept some access will have to be given. Reddit is worth a little. 

Also is there any good programs, apps or adaptions that i can use to help me? This is where im least clued up, my finger isnt on the pulse regarding new apps/software and the like. Im using a oneplus 8t pro atm so its android id like any ideas on if possible! 

Hopefully ill hear from you guys shortly!",08Nov2020,1
1,"Hi, 

So I dated a guy (22) for almost 2 years at university where we pretty much lived together. We had as you would say a very toxic relationship. It was either very good or very very bad.... he has grabbed me and not let me go, grabbed my hair, pushed me backwards by my chest and my neck. He also cheated on me.... but the worst part he made my mental health feel like it wasn’t real and that I was making it up, I wasn’t allowed to talk to my friends about anything to do with him or we would break up. I spent hours crying and begging him to stay. He would say hurtful things and talk about cheating, and if I got upset it was my fault for taking it to heart. 

We started having sex issues, I hated my body and he made me feel 2nd best to what he wanted in a woman (skinny with big boobs) which he had told me a few times. I had no interest in sex with him- and yet he wanted 3-4 times a week. He would threaten to leave if we didn’t start sleeping together more and had left and come back due to me begging him to stay and that we would work on it. He would be nice to me for 2 days, then would go cold and say he’s been nice to me he now deserves sex. 

After being on a break for about a month, I finally gained the courage once moving home to end that relationship and now I’m left with no self-confidence in myself. I feel worthless and ugly. Sex feels like a job or a chore and not fun. I’ve been so depressed and had so many panic attacks and I come onto Reddit to find he had cheated on me when I had moved back home before we spilt. He has also removed me from all social media apart from Reddit. 

Any advice on how to start loving sex, myself and gaining to courage to feel like all men aren’t going to do this too me? Also how I can or how I should start moving on, because mentally I’m exhausted from everything.",08Nov2020,1
2,"This is gonna be both a long read and kinda pathetic so get your drink of choice.


Basically, I grew up as the weird kid. I provide a more detailed explanation in other posts that I don't expect you to read. Summarized version: diagnosed with ocd, made me socially awkward, internalized mentality of second tier till today. I am now 19 years old. As a result of past insecurities caused by this fucking mental disorder I have never dated, done drugs, or had my first kiss, classic teenage stuff (i.e. what damn near every teenager has done). I have decided to make a change and find a relationship before I turn 20 so I don't feel like I've failed as a teenager. So, I asked out two friends recently and got rejected twice (second girl initially gave me a yes but cancelled). So, I have no dates, a three month break from college coming up and then like 4 more months until my birthday where I turn 20. I have like 2 weeks to find someone to ask out if I intend to date before turning 20. Cause of covid most of my friends are in my dorm, and as I have learned asking out people you live with isn't the best idea. I feel like I'm running out of time and options. What the hell do I do? I can't join a dating app because when I tried that my parents shouted at me over the phone for about 3 hours. Now of course, rebelling against parents is a big part of not failing as a teenager but I need to figure out how to keep a dating all secret. They found out last time by checking my bank account records, is there a free dating app? What do I do?",08Nov2020,1
3,"So lately I really want to get into a relationship because I have never had one in my life. I think it would be so much fun, but the thing is that sometimes I worry that its going to take a lot of time for me to get into one. Ive had issues with my body image my entire life so I can get really insecure about it. I know exactly what kind of relationship I want but I have no idea when it will happen which sucks because I have this whole idea in my head",08Nov2020,1
4,"When I was in preschool (so like, 2010 to 2012 tineframe), my favorite show was My Little Pony. I loved it. I'd watch each new episode and always binge it. But, a few months before entering kindergarten, I decided to stop watching the show and act more boyish so I wouldn't be bullied.

In kindergarten and elementary school, I desperately envied girls. I wanted to wear girls clothes, have long hair, have sleepovers, wear makeup, etc. And I still do. When I initially entered middle school in the fall of 2018, I began wishing I had a larger butt and a vagina. It sounds conceited and aloof, but occasionally I find myself wanting to have a period. It's so weird.

I can't be open about my feelings. I'm in an incredibly Conservative area and could be murdered if I became more open about my identity. But at times, I wonder if I'm really trans.

Generally, I can't even go a day without feeling dysphoria. I avoid clothes shopping so fastidiously that I only go when my clothes actually start compressing my body. This is because when I'm at clothing shops, I want to look on the girl's isle and buy girl's clothes. But I have to stick to the boy's isle, which is basically all the same clothes with the only difference being are they burgundy, navy blue, black, light grey, or white.

The other day I needed new shoes, and I couldn't stand being in Kohl's watching cute girls (people I already envy) buying clothes I want but can't have. So, I screamed at a girl calling her Nazi trash, and shouted that the clothing industry was run by pedophiles to get myself kicked out. My dad was fuming, but I was so happy to be out of there.

However, there are days where I feel no dysphoria, and sometimes even long periods. It confuses me, and makes me wonder if I'm really trans. Then, I start considering the possibility, and I run back to the thought of being trans so I could end up being a girl. Because I really wanna be a girl.

Earlier this year, I made a vow to grow a beard and become borderline toxic in my masculinity so no one suspects my desires. Ever since, I've grown attached to this persona, even though I desperately want to be a girl. I don't want to give up my penis, but I don't want to live without a vagina.

Any advice/analysis?",08Nov2020,1
5,"Hi, I haven't used reddit before so I don't know if this is what I'm supposed to do. I've never been a very confident person until I met my friend. I'll refer to her as ""E"". She was really independent and she made me feel like I had someone to rely on?? I always did what she wanted and I tried to fit in with everyone by acting like her. I genuinely believed she was my friend but now I know she was just manipulating me so that I'd do whatever she wanted. She has always been rude to everyone but I sort of idolised her so I never saw it.

A while ago, she told me that she met up with a 17 year old guy when she was 13. He picked her up in a car and drove her around then she told me that he got on top of her and she tried to push him off and he didn't so he just carried on. She thinks that he was ""in love"" with her when all her wanted was sex.There was also a 21 year old man who bought her a hotel room when she just turned 14. She said that there were two men in the hotel room but she didn't tell me anything else about it. One of the men used to text her only on weekends to pick her up and drive her around.

When I found out about this, I told my mom that she had been raped, about the older men and the hotel room because I didn't want her to be in danger or be taken advantage of anymore. My mom ended up telling the police and her parents. This ended up causing a whole argument and ""E""'s parents punished her by shouting at her, rather than helping her :(

Ever since then, she has been bullying me. She calls me horrible names all the time, she says that she wishes my family died, she spreads rumours, she kicks me and she knotted my hair then tried to cut it off (I've found short pieces in my hair where I suspect she actually did it). She sends ugly photos of me to guys and then gets them to insult my appearance.

I pretend like everything is okay but it hurts me inside. Instead of focusing on my work, I focus on trying not to cry because of how horrible she makes me feel. All I wanted to do was help her. I've apologised to her so many times and tried to make things better but she just won't stop. She's destroying my mental health and my self esteem and I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried to tell my family but they think I'm being a typical teenager. I don't have the confidence to move schools or make new friends or even go outside by myself because I've relied on her with so much to boost my dependence (which I know is my fault) and now I'm failing all my classes. I cry all the time and I don't know what to do. I'm desperate to be online schooled but I'd end up isolated completely. It's all giving me too much anxiety and I don't know what to do :( Someone please help. I don't know what to do about anything",08Nov2020,1
6,I‘m now in the second year of MedSchool and the learning part takes a lot of time. Also are the work hours crazy on a hospital shift. So I wonder if I miss out on life when I‘m spending my 20s most time either studying or working at the hospital?

7,"I'm a 15 year old male with a strict mother and stepfather, and a dad I occasionally visit every other weekend. At my mom's house, I'm not allowed several things. Not allowed to date, not allowed to talk to people online, not allowed to use electronics during the week, one hour of screen time on Saturday and Sunday, etc. My dad is a lot more laid back, and I spend time doing things there that I'm normally not allowed to do.

I have a girlfriend. We've been dating over Discord for a year now. I really love this girl, and I want to marry her in the future. But recently, my brother told my mom and stepdad about her. They don't seem angry, but I'm worried about a few things:

1) What if they try to make us break up?

2) What if they disapprove of her?

3) What if they want me to log onto Discord and look through my messages? ( We talk about some sensitive topics)

If anyone knows what I should do, please help me out. I'm irrationally scared of what might happen.",08Nov2020,1

I gained a fiance this year and he moved in about 6 weeks ago. I am and always have been very insecure about my looks, and that he was regularly watching porn and had(s) a favorite specific type has NOT helped. I feel gross compared to their skinny perfection and even though I know I ""do it"" for him I can't help thinking about how much ""better"" I'd be if I fit the ideal.

9,"So I used to work at this internship. Long story short, everyone thought I was a terrible person for no reason. They targeted me and made me sound like a backstabbing, mean liar. I don't know why. I think it was because I liked this girl that someone else liked and they found out and made me out to be a bad person. Too much drama for a literal internship in tech.

Fast forward. I make another friend. Him and his gf have been together for a while. He reveals to me that he cheated on on his girlfriend with several people, some of these people that I know from work. I kept it a secret because I truly did not know if any of it was true and I didn't want to be involved. I just wanted to focus on my career. I was scared to intervene because I thought people would wrongly accuse me of lying or something, because they already hated me. To this day, I haven't told anyone. That couple ended up breaking up. I am not friends with that guy anymore. I can't believe he would do that to his girlfriend. It's terrible. What makes me more concerned though is that one day, we went our for drinks after work. This dude invites a girl who is already in a relationship that we work with. I think this girl is still with her boyfriend, but I am not sure if the boyfriend knows. I feel so terrible that this other guy might be dating a cheater. 

My friend told me all this stuff. I usually never responded and remained netural even if I judged in my head. I really didn't want to be involved because they definitely would have thought I started all this so I kept silent. But now I feel like shit for keeping this secrets :(  please help",08Nov2020,1
10,"It’s not that I don’t care what people are telling me, I very much do. The issue is that I relate things to myself, as most people do to process things, but then I share that relation. It seems to become more about me and less about them, which I don’t want. For example, if someone tells me about a dumb thing that happened at work, I might follow up with a “Oh! something like that happened to me!” While this is fine in friendly conversations, it is a bigger issue when listening to people talk about things that bother them. 

The good thing is that I am conscious of this, but even with that awareness I still find myself slipping into it. One thing i have tried is asking questions about what the person is talking about, but my questions always seem superficial. Does anyone have any tips for being a more attentive listener, or more comforting friend? Do you have any advice on asking the right questions?",08Nov2020,1

13,"I’ve been struggling with a sense of feeling hopeless and like I’ll never be able to do a good job providing for my son. After my alcoholic dad died when I was 10 my mom suffered severe mental illness and we had to live with my grandparents. I got pregnant at 19 and 4 years later went on to graduate with my bachelor’s of science in nursing with straight As...I purchased a home just over a year ago...and I thought that doing these things would mean a good life for my son. 

But my child’s father is a drug addict and hasn’t seen my son in years. I make too much to qualify for assistance even though I don’t make that much. My family has looked down on me since I had my son. And now with COVID and being a nurse I’ve been struggling to stay afloat. 

I recently looked at all the negative stigma online towards single moms and honestly my spirit is a bit crushed. I feel like no one will ever want me and I’ll never be able to do a good job for my son. I just need some advice or encouragement as to how I can keep going",08Nov2020,1
14,"I need some advice. This coming spring my partner, myself, my mother and grandfather will be moving from Toronto buying a house. My mother, grandfather and I want to move to Kitchener, but my partner wants to move to Oshawa. **He wants to move to Oshawa because**  

1. he has a friend in Oshawa with who he can do automotive side jobs 

2. he likes the city

3. wants to eventually go into Durham police

**I want to go to Kitchener** because there are a few universities that offer master and PhD programs that I would like to do once I complete my undergrad. I don't like Oshawa because after GMC closed down many people lost jobs and poverty went up. When I was in the downtown there were many abandoned buildings and shops with boarded up windows. It also felt very industrial. My mom and grandfather like Kitchener because it's a German town with a lot of German people / culture (we're German / French). I also like how there are a few french schools / daycares as I want my child to learn french (french is my first language and my moms).  

My partner has a good job with good benefits in Toronto as a cable technician. His plan was to stay at that job until the end of 2021 then start applying to the police. I worry that if we move to Oshawa and he does not enter the police I will resent him. I honestly hate Oshawa and can't see myself living or dying there. Unfortunately  because my partner is contributing money towards the downpayment for the mortgage he has to also agree 100% with where we move to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always wanted to do my PhD and worked hard towards this goal. Currently my marks are good enough for grad school (even law school lol) so this goal is achievable. If I move to Oshawa the only other uni that offers the grad program I want is in Toronto. So for the next 6ish years I would have to drive 2 hours per day to school, compared to 20 minutes per day in Kitchener. Also, he can do police in Kitchener-Waterloo region but he says he doesn't like their police.

So my mom has recently been sort of flirtatious with my friend (Matthew) I’m not sure if I’m just looking too deep into it. So basically my friend has always made jokes about fucking my mom (typical teasing shit. He only says it because we both know how weak that insult is)and one time we were in the living room in the couch.  Just chilling and he said a joke about fucking my mom again. Well, she cleared her throat having just came home from work, (unknown to us) well the two of us turned around. She was there. Hands on hips. She looked mad. It was so fucking tense that moment. It was like time froze or some shit. Well, after a few seconds she cracked a smile and laughed. My friend was relived she found it funny and not mad or offended. I was stunned. I thought “shouldnt you be at the very least, uncomfortable????” 

So then after that, whenever the two are together or in the same room, they’re kinda flirty. Me and my friend are both 18 BTW. Idk something about my mom’s tone sounds similar to how she talks to my dad whenever they get romantic. My friend kinda just brushes it off. I think once she even fucking slapped his ass (like how coaches do it) but the two treat it as a joke and my friend always fucking denies it.

29,"A little background: I (23F) am getting divorced. I have an almost three year old son and I’m planning on moving. My soon to be ex has already moved three hours away for a job opportunity. I stayed behind in the apartment we shared and he’s still paying the bills (yes, you read that correctly). He’s only paying the bills until I can get my own place. And I have two options: 

Option one: Let me preface this by saying this is not a permanent solution for me and this post is not asking for advice on better paying jobs. With the hours that I work (at a daycare center), I can’t afford much. I was approved for government housing and I’m currently getting the paper work done in order to move into government housing soon. So basically my rent would be based on my income and I’m still living in the same area. 

Option two: move to another state to live with my dad. My dad already has a full house: my grandma, little sister, his girlfriend, and her two kids. My adult brother lives there as well but is apparently moving out? So my son and I would be sharing a room. I wouldn’t be living with my dad long term and the goal is to get on my feet as soon as possible. He said Daycare’s where he lives pay 14-16 an hour which is a considerable raise from the 8.70 I make now. He said that if I moved in with him, I could either go back to school and work part time to contribute to groceries or pay 500 dollars a month to him in rent. I want to be a preschool teacher someday but I’m not in a good place to go back to school. I think it would be unwise to juggle school, work, raising a toddler, AND trying to save up for my own place. But 500 dollars for one room that I have to share? That seems like way too much and I might as well get my own place at that point. 

So how do I negotiate his price while still being respectful? I think that $250 a month is a fair price for one room if I’m paying all my other bills (phone, car insurance, groceries for myself/son, ect). And I also feel that at $14 hours an hour, I’d be able to pay all that and quickly save up for my own place. 

I like the idea of moving out of my home town and being closer to that side of my family, but I think he’s asking an unfair price. If I stay here, I’ll likely be on government assistance for far longer than I would like to be, but at least I’ll have my own space.",08Nov2020,1
30,"I’m 24 and I’ve been trying to become a lawyer. 

Most of my friends have pretty good jobs and are doing well from what I can see. One of my very good friends is also a lawyer, 24 and is on 6 figures already. 

For me, I’m always happy to hear when my friends are doing great. I’m happy when they get a promotion or get a new car, nice watch etc as I like to see my boys doing well. 

Presently I’m not a qualified lawyer and I don’t work in a big firm so my salary isn’t high and my friends know how hard I’ve been working for the past three years. Last week I got my first client and this is pretty big for me as i had failed to get one for so long and I never thought I could do it. 

I told three of my closest friends and only one asked for the story. The other one didn’t say anything and another said congratulations and he wanted to know the backstory. I told him to call when he’s free but he never did. This upset me because if it were the other way around I’d be on the phone immediately. For example my friend had struggled to get a job for some time but as soon as he got one he told me on the day and I got him some champagne to celebrate. 

It got me thinking that maybe I shouldn’t openly tell people when things go well.  Maybe I expect too much from people.",08Nov2020,1
31,"Im a 24 year old that’s been a nurse for a little over a year. Right now, I’m not going to school or furthering my education. I intend on specializing in one nursing field or getting certified in diabetic care at some point. Instead, I am “living life” by traveling, going out with friends, shopping, etc. Other things I enjoy doing is working out, and hanging out with family. I live with my parents but have started to search for my own townhome to move out in a couple months. 

It’s been pointed out to me by my boyfriend that I need to get a hobby because I have no ambition. He says I spend too much time being unproductive. I kind of agree with that statement because I’m not doing anything to benefit myself right now. I do feel lazy/stuck in life. 

Is it wrong for me to hang out like I am? Should I be improving myself by reading, working towards a new healthcare certificate, investing in stocks, etc.

I have been one of those goody two shoes kids for most of my life.  I don't know why, it always feels like there's some voice in the back of my head that I'm always fighting saying, You should buy a motorcycle. You should drink to your heart's content. You should smoke. Be reckless. Be stupid. And I haven't even been on a motorcycle, or had a smoke, and I drink only like a drink or two a most per year. But yet somehow I always dream of doing all these stupid things. 

I'm quite honestly tired of fighting it. Is there something that I can do, that's not excessively stupid and unsafe that'll give me a thrill?

35," 

Around 2-3 years ago i (16M) had a massive crush on a girl (15F) that I've known for years. we went to the same nursery and we both directly live near to each over (2-minute distance :/ ) but anyways, i used to spend a lot of time with her doing loads of things, i used to eat with her family all the time, I used to babysit her younger sister, basically anything a guy could do if he was able to live close to his crush.

after i really started getting into puberty i became immature and i started to make this girl hate me. she was starting to like me more but then i just sort of ruined everything we had... she blocked me on everything, we stopped seeing each over, and just never spoke again...

now a few years later i currently have a girlfriend and I'm in the happiest relationship i could be in and i couldn't risk anything in the relationship i have now. But i just can't stop thinking about this girl, we dont see each over that much these days ( we're not meeting up or anything since we live in the same area i might just find her at the shop that I'm at or at the park I'm at etc... ) and we'd say hi and id starts getting butterflies, and we'd walk off and carry on with my day.

i really don't know what to do. sorry if i didn't explain my situation in much detail but i really do want to forget about her and carry on with my life and the relationship i have now. i really can't get her out of my mind and every time i look out my window to look outside i have to look at her window to see if she's there. i really want her out of my mind, i know its hard to get rid of a crush but this girl literally lives near me and i see her almost every day!!! i just need her out of my head.",08Nov2020,1
36,"I had a chaotic childhood. My life has been mostly one trauma after the next. I've looked at the diagnostic criteria online for BPD and they describe my life - present and past - to a degree of accuracy. My dad has it, and my understanding is that genetics can have an impact on BPD's incidence rate. Back in 2014, I had one of my worst mental health episodes, when I ended up walking in a daze until I was six miles away, walking head-first down a motorway and about to throw myself into traffic.

I spoke to my community crisis team the day afterward, and they told me that my poor mental health was just a part of me growing up and finding my place in the world.

Six years later, at age 25, I still don't know my place in the world. I'm impulsive, I go from one emotional extreme to the next multiple times a day, I exist in a chronic state of boredom, I have intrusive thoughts of suicidal ideation (though I have no intention of hurting myself) and I completely cease to function at even the slightest thought that my loved ones could be abandoning me. Nothing about the way my mind operates feels normal to me. I'm desperate for help, but I'm scared of asking for it in case they just sweep me under the rug like they did last time.

We have been together for 2 months, and we met during covid.I have been recently pretty stressed with work, school, etc.  I may have been a bit distant the past week because of this. I’ve been pretty exhausted because of this. Normally I call him before and after work. On Friday I got off of work at 6. I just relaxed, ate, said hi to a friend for 2 min, took care of my pets, spent time with my mom, etc. He later called me a little before 11. He started talking about how I had been distant because of stress, and what I haven’t been doing in our relationship. He also was mad about me doing stuff and not talking to him. He questioned me about everything I did since I came home from work. He even asked about gaps in me texting him, so he could get clarity of what I was doing. He also didn’t like my reaction when he called me before work that day. He surprised me because he normally sleeps until later, and I was in the middle of doing stuff. After about 2 hours of this, he finally stopped talking. 

I asked if he didn’t mind if I called my friend to wish them a happy birthday( they are nocturnal). There birthday at that point ended 1 hour ago. I meant to call him before all of this started. I talked to my friend for 26 min, and then we continued this for 1.5 more hours, and I was honestly struggling to stay awake through this.  

The next day he texted me at 5:30am because he wanted to talk about something and couldn’t sleep. I saw his text at 10:30am, and asked if he still needed to talk about something. He later said yes 30 min later. I called him, and then he got mad at me for leaving him for “30 minutes”, so I could say happy birthday to my friend. I have known this guy friend for years. I will admit that I talked to him longer because I didn’t want to deal with this conversation, but it was my friend’s birthday.  He said how he was pouring his heart on the table, and I left him to talk to another guy for 30 min. I literally asked him if this was okay for me to do. He asked me if I understood why he was mad, and I said it was because I talked with a guy friend for 26 min instead of 5 min. He then told me how what he wanted was for me to not have left the call at all. I really don’t know what to do.",08Nov2020,1

We always had contact with our dad but around 2 years ago he broke up with his gf (who he cheated on our mum with) and got with his new girlfriend. He married her and got her pregnant within a year. He saw us less and he just seems like he’s being controlled by her and it’s a really toxic relationship from my point of view. (Like they both track each other, she always insults him for everything, he’s always trying to do something to please her) and I kinda feel bad for him but he’s just kinda turned into an asshole.

Yesterday I drove my mom up to see her because my mom had not gotten any sleep the night before and although I had only gotten a couple hours, I was more fit to drive than her. Lack of sleep came from the unexpected loss of my 4 month old nephew. 

My sister and I haven’t spoken for so long for a lot of reasons but I don’t care about any of them right now. I just want to take her pain away. The baby that passed has a twin brother, they were 6 weeks premature and at first it was believed that the baby choked on his spit up/vomit and died from that. The autopsy showed no fluid in his lungs so it was more likely SIDS. I know my sister is blaming herself but I believe in my heart that there was nothing she could have done. 

I just don’t know what to do for her. I asked that she seek counseling when the dust settles because our entire family suffers or has suffered from depression and because she’s still a mom to 4 other kids and they need her.

42,"So I've known this person for four years and we're very close. As she says, we're basically family at this point. She is a chronic oversharer so I know way too much about her and tend to get dragged into every little bit of drama in her life regardless of how I feel or what's going on in my life. It's a very one-sided relationship and I often feel as if I have to be emotionally responsible for her despite her being almost four years older than me. (She's 27, almost 28, and I'm 24.) The only thing she does is complain about everything and she's famous for doing anything in her power to get all the sympathy in the room (even if it means completely ignoring the feelings of the person actually injured, upset, etc.) and I'm tired of being her friend because frankly it's exhausting and I'm not happy in the friendship. Sure we've had some good times, but she's a total emotional vampire. Often I feel drained after trying to talk with her and there have been times we've talked and I've started talking about myself and what's going on in my life and halfway through my sentence she's going on about something else totally unrelated and it's frustrating. 

Here's the problem, through. She's my roommate. It's not like I can just ghost her because she literally lives with me. I've tried avoiding her, but sometimes it's just not possible. I've tried to make it as clear as possible that I'm not happy in our friendship and I don't want it to continue but she just can't get it. I've even gone so far (and yes, it is really mean to do so) as to straight up tell her everything she does that makes being her friend so frustrating, and after two years, nothing's changed. She's exhausting and a severe negative influence and I've just had enough, but I can't get rid of her. I'm moving in seven months but I'm not sure I'll make it that long before I snap and say something else that's potentially damaging.

43,"Hello. I'm 24M and I've been working as an engineer in a small private company for almost 2 years. I graduated in mid-2018 and have been working here since Jan 2019. Since graduated, I've always wanted to become a Uni. Lecturer/Professor, especially after I did a research project with my Professor (mid till late 2018). My goal to work here is not for making money, but to gain that practitioner experience and/or POV before becoming a Uni. Lecturer, and also gaining a recommendation letter (which I predict my company will give after everything I've done here).

My initial plan was to resign in December 2019 and start my master's education in mid-2020. But I received an opportunity to learn more as a practitioner and here I am now, still working in the same company. And also with this pandemic situation, I'm really not sure what to do.

Why do I want to resign? Because (1) with this current workload I cannot actively search and apply for scholarship; (2) I have to prepare and pass English Test (i.e. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.) to become an international student; (3) searching for a research topic is not really easy for me.

I have an instagram account that doesn't really have much followers, like only 200, and today I decided to post on it. You know how people tag their friends on their posts, well, today I came to the realization that I literally only have two people to tag compared to the 7+ people everyone else I follow have tagged.

49,"About a year ago my friend watched the walking dead for the first time, and since then she had been in love with Carl Grimes, a character in the show. At first it was a cute thing, she seemed genuinely happy with her new celebrity crush, and I was happy that she was doing well. Her behaviors were similar to friends that I have who watch anime, a simple crush where they are absolutely okay with only liking the character and no one else. 

But as her crush progressed it got worse. I think I first became worried when she called me one day crying. Turns out she got to the portion of the 8th season where her crush dies. She told me “I have been crying on and off for 4 hours. I’m having anxiety attacks over him.” She has made a shrine for him, she has full on anxiety attacks if she misses one of the actor’s livestreams, and she has memorized all of his lines in the show. When we would call she would always be watching a movie with the same actor who played Carl, and she only seemed interested in those movies. She changed all of her usernames on her socials to something related to the character.

Then I noticed Carl Grimes started to become a way of escapism. She told me that she is going to get married to him and have children, and is manifesting their marriage every day. She also continues to attempt to shift universes even though she is waisting so much energy and power, to the extent where she will sleep throughout the entire day (she is almost nocturnal.) She can’t watch her character die, or even be around his later “girlfriend” or she will have true anxiety. Like it’s not fake, it’s actual long term panic attacks. I’ve tried helping her, I even had to call the hotline because she was so attracted to this guy, but every single time she will have an anxiety attack I can not distract her from him. 

Last night she sent me an edit of Carl Grimes. “Isn’t he so attractive?” she asked. And I wasn’t sure how to respond, I just left a simple answer, “To me, no.” She started full on crying, and later hung up the phone. She hasn’t contacted me since and I’m not sure what to do.

51,"Sorry for grammar and stuff in advance. Some background: my parents got divorced 15 years ago, because of the stuff that went down during it, my dad didn’t date that entire time except for one or two flings he didn’t tell us about until later with some women that were notably younger than him but still generally respected (around 30 but nothing crazy). After years of isolation, he started trying to find someone, we were all pretty happy about it. He came home one day asking if we wanted to go out to eat with his new girlfriend because things were getting serious between them, I was excited to meet her but refused to after learning her age. Not only is she one year older than my sister, but they attend the same university.

Previous to this my dad and I had an amazing relationship, we were incredible close and he was someone I could go to with any problem. I can’t really pinpoint when, but their relationship began to cause a divide between us. Ive always felt that age gap relationships where one person is in their teens or early twenties is at best naive because the younger one doesn’t have the emotional maturity to hold themselves up against someone with much more experience, and at worst predatory where the older person knows they can manipulate someone of that age. In short I believe there is a power imbalance, and those types of relationships have always made me uncomfortable. Me and my siblings told him about this and made it clear he disagreed, repeating that we should be happy for him for finding someone after so long and that it wouldn’t last long (it did). Over time it made me more and more uncomfortable, something screamed in my mind that if the age for dating was any lower, he would dating an even younger girl. More and more I started to become unnerved in situations where we would touch (hugging, sitting near each other, basic things I used to have no problem with), even though I know he would never do anything to hurt us. 

We started to have numerous screaming matches about the subject and a couple other unrelated things after a while. We’ve never fought without being able to work through it before, but none of our arguments these days ever have an ending. The woman he’s dating could be a lovely person- I have no personal ill will towards her- but because of the nature of the relationship, I had no intention of getting to know her. Eventually we set boundaries, we agreed that we would never meet her and she couldn’t come to the house where my siblings lived with him. He’s done a good job of respecting them so far. 

Sometimes I feel shallow because I have thoughts about his relationship being embarrassing for me when I’m teased about it by my friends or they bring it up around strangers, even though I know it’s not a show of my personal character. Sometimes I think I’m being over dramatic and should just be happy for him. But alot of the time I’m happy with the boundaries I’ve set and frustrated with my dads behavior which I perceive as immoral. It’s very confusing. Everyone I talk to about this doesn’t really have any advice on what I can do further, setting boundaries only goes so far to relieve tension. I want to know whether or not there’s more I can do to save the connection I had with my father, and what personal moral steps I can take in this situation to improve my family’s wellbeing, even if it means admitting I was wrong.

54,"Honestly, my mum is one of the nicest people you would ever meet and a lot of people have said so themselves. She's too kind, too caring and well, thats the problem. She's the complete definition of a metaphorical doormat. 

She's a Libra which I guess means she will just flat out refuse to to make any decisions that would compromise even the slightest of disagreements. Worst  example of this is her marriage, unhappily married for 20+ years. My dads side despise her (religious reasons) and I feel like they helped write up the divorce papers that my mum blindly agreed to sign without reading. Pretty sure the papers stated she moved out which isn't the case at all. They're still living in the same house.

She's been working a physically demanding min wage job for 20+ years now. She will receive calls from colleagues and supervisors asking for help and will  help them over the phone for HOURS even on weekends when she's not working.

Unless she gets fired or miraculously receives a job offer (she wont, too big of an asset and no confidence to job hunt) then its destined in her eyes that its a sign from the universe. Her skills and confidence has just regressed more and more because of her self restrictions to do anything for herself and puts everyones happiness before her own. Has it always been an issue? Did she just intertwine whats left of her ego to these beliefs just to make sense of it all?

Didnt study and failed your exams? Universe. Job application rejected? you guessed it.

You know when you reach that point in your teens when you realise your parents aren't as invincible as you thought? I had that too, but I'm in my early 20's now and I'm in complete disbelief how anyone has survived this far. I've told her I'm gonna have to look after her at some point financially in the future but she refuses to let herself be a burden to me, but I have to because shes sacrificed so much for me and also because she's in her 50's with zero pension contribution.",08Nov2020,1
55,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for over 10 years. We meant in high school and he was older. I feel for him hard and mainly with his personality. I’ve always been happy in my relationship merely only innocently fantasized about other people or scenarios and even then I would feel slightly guilty. It was like Marshal from How I Met Your Mother.. I really did have to like kill him off to actually fantasize about being with other guys. We were happy and even recognized by other as being in the ideal relationship. 

BACKGROUND: We comes from your typical white privileged suburb families. Despite that we still, I hate to say it in this way, but are a little white trash.. little. We both had the same history in school, skipping class and getting into some, typical teenage, run ins with the law. My family is disfunctional and his has a little as well. We met at work, he assist-managed a fast food restaurant. 
We’re lazy we smoke weed I drink we’re not as responsible as we should be. I eventually went back to school after four years of f*cking around and  got my degree. He took some classes but never got far on the school front. Back in high school I did tell him he needed to go back to school if we were to continue with a serious relationship. He settled, maybe unintentionally, into a trade practice with limited opportunities of making money or moving up. I always figured I would be the bread winning and told myself I liked it like that but maybe I just told myself that as a means to be okay with his, I hate saying this, lack of ambition. I love him and was in love with him. Money was never a huge driver for me but I did always think it would work out... reverting back to my upbringing. 

Back to the story:
*Three years ago...*
He started ‘lightly’ using drugs to ease an injury from work. I did not know any of this until more recently. 
I was in my mid 20s and he now was in his early 30s. We both didn’t/don’t take care of ourselves in the best way. We smoke cigs, at this point (3 years ago) he recently quit with my help and vaping. I failed and kept smoking. We, then and now, smoke weed regularly like all day er’y day. I can’t and do not smoke before work but he does. I don’t like smoking before family events but he will. It’s fine because he seems to still be able to do his job but he can naturally be careless or clumsy so weed only makes it worse. His Injury(s) are truly from being careless but also very out of shape. We’re the type to sit on the couch and get high and eat like sh*it. We’re lazy and irresponsible. 

*Two years ago...*
I graduated from college and got my first job. We both have always been responsible in the sense of working and keeping jobs and doing them well for that fact. Even as over achieving I am in my work I was and am still irresponsible in managing my life. Our relationship was still fine but we were fighting more and more slowly. When I need his help he seems to never come through but I also take my anger out on him - most people take their emotions out on those closest. He would always eventually give in cause he knows I suffer from controlling tendencies from my mother and family life. He understood that about me which helped our relationship be successful but slowly that understanding started to shift. I realize I should do more and mature and not require him to accept my flaws with no hope for change if I expect him to work on his flaws. 
I still was unaware of the drug use. 
I did very well in my first 6mo-year in my new job. I worked hard but noticed our relationship was differing. Money was an issue. I am a saver and like to keep track of the money and he loves to spend it. He’s irresponsible when it comes to paying bills and spending money. I can be too but not nearly as much. I started to realize my life wasn’t ever going to add up to what I always expected it to be. I started having feelings telling me I needed to settle with the life that was on track for me. We still haven’t gotten an engaged or married. We were going to wait until I graduated and then it just seemed like it didn’t matter. Like the relationship was already decided to stick, a guarantee. 

*I met someone...*
A little over 6 months into my new job I met someone who recently started working with me. I was not attracted to him at first but he had a great personality. After two months of working with him I began to feel weird. Couldn’t understand why I kept thinking about him didn’t understand why I felt jealous when he went on work calls with a female co worker. He was cute but I really didn’t think he was that attractive so I didn’t understand why I was feeling this way. 
He’s married and had a one year old. His wife and him have also been together for over 10 years and his upbringing was in a small town had little divorce and everyone married their high school sweetheart. 
I found myself always drawn to him wanting to talk to him and I could feel he wanted to talk to me. At work when it was slow we would talk for hours just laughing and getting to know each other. After several months we had a work conference and both had been drinking. We flirted a lot and started texting a lot but nothing happened. After we got back it was like the attraction between us was no longer ignorable. After two weeks we went out for a couple drinks after work and it was honestly the best time. He surprised me with how touchy he was and the flirting was hardcore. We laughed and had so much. It was intense and electric and I felt a way I had never felt before. I could feel it from him too. Unknowingly I think that was the night we both fell in love. The next day at work we went to lunch and he again surprised me with his boldness and asked me pretty much if I had feelings for him cause he had feelings for me. We started messaging on Snapchat (separate accounts) and we talked non stop. We started getting lunch together every day trying different place and grabbing quick drinks after work. We had our first kiss two weeks after our ‘first date’. It was weird. I hadn’t kissed someone else for over 10 years. I wouldn’t say it was like a magical and great first kiss but I still wanted him. We would make up but never anything more. We did sext each other a lot but we still hadn’t done anything. 
After a month we had an opportunity to hang out at his house and I knew stuff would happen but I did tell him I wasnt ready to go al the way. Well we did. It was honestly the greatest first sex anyone could ever describe. He is generous in bed and again surprised me with his aggressiveness. We both did positions that night we had never done and did everything (1st/2nd and obviously 3rd base). 
The next day he was going out of town and I had to work but we talked on the phone for four hours.
I’m going to speed this along.. 
we feel in love. The sex was grata and exciting at work and in parking garages but we both felt it. We were falling hard for each other. I’ve never met anyone I’ve connected with like that and I know it’s the same for him. 
I’m an idiot. I would always tell people not to date people with kids cause it’s extra baggage always messy.. and here I am having an affair and falling in love with a married man with a one year old. His wife did ask him what was going on with him and he was honest to a point with her.. he told her her feelings had changed. Thy ended up going to counseling and him and I lightened up on sex and saying I love you but we still hung out and kissed and did other stuff. We did have some sad moments where we tried to stop talking and things got harder. Worth mentioning, on New Years he surprised me in his office with little hats and had the Tokyo clock on and did a countdown NYE kiss with me since we wouldn’t be able to be better. Meanwhile both of our work was super distracted and started to suffer and, more to the story but in the end, he got fired just after the new year.  
I was terrified us not seeing each other would end it forever but we still talked and snuck off for an hour at least once a week to see each fb other (she was a stay at home mom so always home while he was looking for a a job) 
She confronted him again about his feelings but this time he told her it was going to be okay and tried to end it with me the next day. It was said we both cried. He kept saying he doesn’t have a reason to leave he didn’t have an excuse. We both knew that if anyone found out about us we definitely couldn’t be together because his family and friends would hate me. He also said the main reason was his son he couldn’t be away from his son even part time. And his family would probably hate him for ever breaking up his family. The day we meant to say good bye forever he told me his heart physically hurt. I woke up with anxiety the next day and reached out to him. We just never could say good bye to each other. We decided to take a month apart and meet again to see how our feelings for one another we’re doing. We failed off and on during that month. We never saw each other but the longest we went without talking was 4 maybe 5 days. 
After that ‘month’ period we meet for lunch and just kept talking. 

*Then COVID hit...*
Meanwhile all this going on my relationship began to plummet and I found out about my boyfriends drug use and how bad it had gotten. First red flag was how low my bank account was getting. He just started to change. He didn’t care about work and because of his pain he milked it and used it as a crutch. He only ever talked about drugs weed mainly but it was like all he cared about. 
I think he too was starting to feel stuck and less hopeful about the future and his potential. During the lockdown we fought a lot and he came clean in increments about his addiction. And my co worker found out how much he loved being at home with his son. I felt him slipping away and felt no hope for my relationship.
Shutdown lifted he finally got a job bad we still talked. Good morning ever day and good night every evening. We ALWAYS talked all day long messaging each other or talking on the phone. 
He tried to end it again. He told me ignoring family expectation and his son that he did want to be with me and was still in love with me even though we didn’t say I love you anymore. We hadn’t had sex in 9 months. We failed again to stay apart from each other. I wasn’t always the one to dial him too. 
I tried to take a break with my boyfriend several times just so we both could think but he always fought against it. 
After some stuff going down over the summer I realize now he’ll never leave his wife and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I will ever be in love with my boyfriend again but it’s too late to start over. I’m running out of time to start a family and fear the idea that I will never find someone I’m that compatible with like I have. I also can’t get over the other man. We still talk but the whole situation is literally LITERALLY driving me insane. I told my sister and mom about it but now I feel like I can’t even see them anymore because I’m too embarrassed or too broken and I’m sick if everyone in my family seeing me as broken. I know they can tell I don’t have that spark I used to I don’t have hope anymore. I’m seriously depressed but internalizing it all. I know he’s struggling too but I feel like he has a family and kid and house and has less of his ‘life’ to figure out like I do. He has a reason to keep it together and a reason to love while I’ve lost all hope or longing for the future. I know I have to end it. Guilt, sadness, Anxiety for the future is consuming me. My anger and jealously have completely taken over and all I want to do is blow up his life as much as mine has been but one I’m still somewhat of a good person and would feel bad causing anyone pain and two I’m pathetic and still think if anyone finds out about the affair that would ruin any future chances of us being together. 
I also want to work on my relationship but how can I when I did something bad and can’t even talk about it. I want to tell him but I don’t. Can I even work on our relationship without telling him. 
I just feel stuck. Depressed. I am NOT suicidal by any means because I know there’s too many people that would hurt and I would never do it but... the idea of dying.. I think about it every single day for the past 10 months.

58,"Hey guys, this is my first time on here and it’s gonna be a long one , so sit tight

I met a girl a couple of years ago (for the sake of privacy, we’ll call her B) and was instantly attracted to her and I could tell she felt the same . Even though we never saw each much other due a grade difference( I just graduated 😁) , over the past 4 years we got amazingly close. After the pandemic hit, the fact that we never saw each other never made whatever type of connection we had go away. Or at least that’s what I thought. About 2 weeks ago , I bought B her favorite flowers and asked to take her on a date and she said yes and seemed very excited. On my way out, I asked if it would be okay if I called later and she loved the idea. Later when I got home and decided to call, there was no answer. I’m fact the only word she has ever spoken to me since are the streaks she sends out for Snapchat. As I said earlier, that was about 2 weeks ago. Since then (and a little bit before) my friends have started to distance themselves away from me. I shake from the stress sometimes and they notice and spread rumors .  I don’t really  have a lot of motivation for life bc of some things in my past but my friends and B were always good for that. Now that I don’t have either, what do I do now ?

59,"Sorry if my English is bad, but it’s my fourth language. I don’t know where to begin but essentially, I am moving away from my city/province to a new one and my family thinks it’s a bad idea. I am a first generation Canadian, my family is of African descent. I am in my last year of my degree at the university. With school online, I started doing a co-op/internship for a company in a different province (Victoria, British Columbia). I have been doing my job remotely which has been good. Working full time and taking five classes though has been tough but I have been managing. So in August, I had the idea to move away for the internship as it’s until end of summer next year. The idea is that doing a hybrid work schedule could be better for me. I am also in my last year, five classes next semester and I am done in April. In Covid times, I think this is a great opportunity. The company is amazing, the people are amazing and I really like working there. I would like to graduate and have a job, I would not mind taking up a job with them when I graduate. So I am basically chasing a great opportunity. Even if I don’t get a job with them, having the experience during Covid will set me up nicely. 
My family thinks it’s a bad idea for me to move away. They think me moving away from family is a bad idea. I should stay because we need to be close to one another. My nieces need to have me around as they grow up etc. Even though I am leaving tomorrow, I have doubts if this is good for me or a good idea. I am not sure what to do. 

Any advice to I guess calm my nerves? The past few hours I have been anxious. Having a lot of thoughts about it. 

TLDR: I am moving away from my family. Moving to a different province. Family thinks it’s a bad idea, wanted me to not go. I am anxious. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",08Nov2020,1
60,"I don’t want to do this anymore. Ive lost all motivation and drive to live. It’s been so long since I’ve felt happy. Every day from the moment I wake up til I fall asleep I think about this.

But it’s getting to the point where I think I want to find out. 

I’ve thought about the people who have been around me and that are no longer here. Is it selfish for me to leave this place when others have left without a choice? 

The only thing that is keeping me from doing this is the impact it will have on my parents. On my brother. That most certainly is selfish. That while my pain might end, it will be thrown upon them. That’s not fair. They didn’t ask for that and I don’t want to hurt them. I don’t want them to ever feel the way that I feel. Like there’s no escape.

64,"So, I am 16 years old and I have a really difficult relationship with my dad sometimes. He is a nice father and I love him, he does everything he can so me and my sister can have a good life. But when we do something he doesn't like, even if it is a little thing, he start screaming and even breaking stuff somethimes. He never will accept he is wrong (even if literally everybody says that he is) and will blame us for not liking him and stuff like that.
I know and admit that me and my sister give him reasons to be stressed, but most of the time he is exaggerating. And to make it even worse, he have a heat disease and can't get stressed, but it looks like he is chasing for every little thing he could use to scream with us. It's something like, i let my window closed but i should have opened, than he start screaming and saying that he will break the window because it is his house and he do whatever he want to do and if i don't fight back he will be screaming for hours , but if i do he  will be even more stressed and will say that i don't love him and that he would prefer be dead. It's really sad and all of my family suffer with these kind of situations. We already talked a lot about this and promised to act better, but as soon as he can he will be screaming for everything again, and I will be stressed, he will be stressed, my mom will get stressed and everyone will be suffering again.

He didn’t touch her and he also stood there but everyone in his family was cheering this on and I sat there having to watch. I felt disrespected and hurt. I went to the deck and cried.

69,"I (20F) have been friends with this guy (26M) for about 8 months now. We met online and he’s become one of my best friends. We text every day, call, play video games. But one thing I dislike about him is that he’s emotionally unavailable. 

I’ve had a few conversations with him talking about how our friendship feels very one-sided and that he doesn’t care about me and each time he reassures me that that’s not the case. But his actions tell me otherwise. I’ve been going through a rough time in my personal life and will try to vent to him if i’m having a bad day but he usually just ignores me or replies with one word. The last couple times this happened I tried to talk to him about a bad day at work and he didn’t reply for over 5 hours. The most recent one was yesterday where I tried to vent to him about some stuff that was going on at home, he didn’t reply for 20 mins then said “sorry i was playing a game” and never checked in to see if everything was okay. 

I know he’s not my therapist and he has no obligation to be there for me but it would be nice after all the times he said I was his best friend and could talk to him about anything. I just feel like a burden now and don’t even want to bring it up because I don’t want him to feel like he’s always doing something wrong. But this is making me resent him. It just hurts because I feel like I’m always there for him and will call and text him all night if he’s having a bad day and I will never get that in return.

70,"I'm a 21 year old female and a mixture of studying the worst of men (I study child and family law so I've had to study a myriad of rape and incest cases) and I guess some bad experiences of creeps/being groped in public, have made me see them *all* as sex monsters. Growing up, I always heard they only want one thing and it's like these studies and all the times my butt was smacked/groped in public reaffirms this toxic idea. I feel like this must make me a hetero incel with a long term boyfiend or some terrible like that. My dad made an innocent joke about how funny it would be to show a new date wayyy too many pics of him doing mundane things on my phone,  so as to allude to our family being too close or me fancying him. He made said joke in front of my mom and laughed, he often makes jokes about how I could purposely ruin dates with absurd scenarios like some sitcom character). I twisted that to mean my sweet dad who raised me to value myself for my intelligence and not just my looks, my dad who calls men in their 30s onwards dating college girls gross, has secretly been an incestuous sex mad monster ALL ALONG because all men are and this joke was his way of letting me know he feels something immoral for me.

Ive started to get a decent amount of dog clients (roughly 2 weekends each month I'm booked).

75,"So some backstory, I live on a 1/4 mile gravel driveway that shares 4 houses. 1 house at the bottom and then 3 at the top of the hill. My house would be the second house coming from the road. The house at the end (fourth from the road) has always been a little trashy and produced a decent amount of drama. This part of town that we live in is a very nice part of town and neighbors like this are pretty rare. 

The problem is, the guy who lives there has a son that was just released from prison, he did a few years for armed robbery and some drug related offenses. 

Since his return from prison, the traffic up and down the driveway has picked up substantially, there are constantly shady looking vehicles going up and down the drive. Alot of times they will stop in the middle of the driveway for 20 minutes to an hour with the dome light on, and I have no idea what they are doing. The cars don't stay over there but a few minutes before they go back down. I also see him walking up and down the driveway at all hours of the day and night. And as of recently he has stopped by my house to ask to use my phone and ask for cigarettes that we don't have. 

My wife and I do not like this kind of activity on our driveway, we don't know who all these people are, we don't know what they are doing stopping in the driveway AND we have an 8 year old daughter who likes to play outside. 

I'm not really sure what to do, I would like to go to the cops but I dont really know what they could do. I dont feel like we would be taken seriously. Judging from what I'm seeing I dont think he is just simply dealing some weed. I think its heroin base on how fucked up these people look.

What are my options?

77,"TLDR; I have no friends to invite to my wedding but my bf has plenty. How do I not feel super insecure about this? I'd also appreciate advice on how to make and keep friendships in adulthood.

My bf and I plan to get married within a year or two. We're already discussing our potential budget, location, catering, etc. Today, while discussing who we'd invite (we're planning on keeping it rather small), he said he wanted to bring some childhood friends, at least three. He asked which friends I'd bring, to which I had no response. I've always been horrible at keeping friends for more than a few years--we always fall out, go our separate ways, or I end up ghosting them because I generally feel insecure and like I'm a bother to others. I also have a tendency to get into toxic friendships which inevitably fall apart. So, upon realizing that I have no friends to bring to my wedding, I'm just generally sad and frustrated with myself. It'll look pretty odd having just close family on my side of the aisle while my boyfriend will bring his share of family and then some.

Now, we do have a few mutual friends, but really they are just my boyfriend's friends that I see only when he's around. They're really great people but I've never seen them as simply ""my"" friends--they're ""our"" friends, and really mostly his. I want them at my wedding but I didn't realize my bf has several childhood friends he also wants to bring.

So, to sum up, I generally feel really inadequate and embarrassed that I have no friends to invite to my wedding. I doubt it'd be feasible to make new ones right now, especially with the pandemic and all. How can I make myself feel less horrible about this whole situation? Or is there a solution at all? Additionally, does anyone have any advice on making new friends, and on keeping them, especially as an adult? Thank you so much to anyone who responds.",08Nov2020,1
78,"Today my twins turned four. The past few months have been hell. We lost our home, our storage unit, and went through a parental abduction. I’m slowly rebuilding, we have a roof over our head now after being homeless but not much else. 


A few weeks ago I was able to get both girls a toddler bed and a blanket each after all four of us were sleeping on the floor. When they saw the beds my sassy twin made the comment “no take our beds we be good girls”. I took it as she thought we lost everything because they were “bad girls”. 


 Fast forward to today and we went to get balloons (all I could afford) and to the park. She started talking about all the toys she used to have and how we used to always have food in the fridge, “memba we always had food”. And then she got really quiet and said “oh but we bad girls now”. That broke my heart!


 The last few months have been a huge shock to all of us, it’s a night and day difference. I've never once told them they were “bad girls”. The only time they haven’t been with me is daycare and when their dad took them a few months ago resulting in an amber alert. We don’t have a tv so I have no idea where they picked it up from. 


I’m trying my best to make things work but I don't get monetary assistance or food stamps. How can I make this transition period easier so that they don't think they are bad? I'm cross posting this because I’m desperate for advice and hoping I can come up with a solution.",08Nov2020,1
79,"I (M25) have a sibling (M31) that stops at nothing to parent me and discipline me as if I was his own child.. and no, it's not in a ""loving and wanting to do better"" way. It's in a ""you made a mistake and I'm going to call you out on it"" kind of way. I am still living at home with my parents due to personal reasons (and maybe with a touch of covid) BUT it's not necessarily by choice and I am looking to move out. And because of COVID, my brother had to move home from NYC since it shut down where he worked and there was nothing there for him. 

As thrilled as I would be about him moving home, and even remembering a lot of the good times we've had, the bad times will ALWAYS find a way to slither into my mind and put a horrible taste in my mouth. For as long as I can remember, he ALWAYS has to call me out on mistakes I make (even the tiniest one) or if I forget to do a chore, he's the first person in my ear to boss me around and tell me to do it. At first, growing up, I just thought it was his job as the oldest brother to be a bit ""bossy"" and I actually did not mind it that much. But now that he's home again permanently, I can't deal with it. It's mentally draining. I've had discussions with him about this, and some of those discussions have turned into full blown arguments, and he still doesn't get it. He's made PLENTY of mistakes and has fucked up quite a few times, and I'm never the one to chime in, because why should I? I'm not his PARENT nor am I in any position to discipline and tell him what to do, just like he is in no position to tell me what to do. 

I don't know if any of you have siblings like this or really any family member.. But I desperately need some advice on dealing with him..",08Nov2020,1

Ive tried so hard but i just see her like one more time and all the feelings i think i lost just come back. Like i would take a bullet for this girl.

And she said yes, of course, she just needed a little financial support every once in a while to pay for them.

Then he kept dropping hints that he wants to take me on a date anyways one day he asked me to FaceTime, but lately I’ve been depressed and anxious due to COVID-19 and other issues. So I told him I’m not comfortable video chatting with someone I barely know. I did that because I knew after that he would ask me on a date, and tbh I don’t wanna go out with new ppl at this time and bring a virus in my home cause I live with my grandparents and they have health issues. And he was respectful about it. After a few weeks, he started posting pics on insta with his new gf. On insta he always likes my pics, if im liking all his pics then maybe that’s why but I barely like his posts, recently I liked his new pic then after a second or two he liked an old photo of mine from a year ago. He must’ve went to my profile to do that. Idk if he was doing it cause of likes for likes. A week ago he posted a pic with his gf and I liked it cause I wanna be nice, then he deleted that post and reposted again, it seems like he doesn’t want me to like it, maybe I’m overthinking it but I thought it was weird so I didn’t like it after he reposted it.

87,So I read so much. I think about world problems constantly and how I can help others for the betterment of our future really. I am constantly thinking about shit like advanced physics and human consciousness I don’t understand why. Why do I think so much about things that can’t be answered. I spend so much time reading isolated from everyone else. Reading philosophy or economics. I just feel weird at the end of the day. Kids my age are more focused on girls or parties why am I focused on all of this. I just feel so unbelievable left out and lost. I analyze absolutely everything and try to solve everything that I can that comes to mind. I’ve rejected 3 relationships from girls because I just don’t feel like it’s worth it if that makes sense. I play football and that’s it. Most of my other time is spent reading and writing. I am extremely weird and I am actually subconsciously ashamed of myself. I don’t understand why I am who I am or why I am this way. I just want to be normal. People view me like I am some freak. Reading all the time instead of partying. I honestly just feel like I want to change the world in some way and help others. I don’t know how I’ll do this but like that feeling is there. I just want to know if this is normal or I am just a weird social outcast.,08Nov2020,1

The family that I live with are kinda-supportive. They let me dress how I want and they try not to misgender me too much, but they're not actively supportive of any other moves towards transitioning that I want to make and they're not comfortable using my chosen name. I also feel discouraged from coming out to my other family because my parents want to make this not a big deal (read: they think I'll grow out of it). 

I have a few friends who I don't get to see very often who are completely supportive. I spend most of my time either at home, with extended family, or at uni - where I get misgendered pretty much constantly, aren't comfortable using any of the provided bathrooms, and although I use my chosen name people often can't pronounce it. Or they ask me what my name was before I changed it. And then. Compliment my birth name. 

I feel so uncomfortable in my skin and with the way I'm seen in the world. I don't know how to feel more accepted or to present in a more non binary or androgynous or queer way. I can't afford medical transition or legal transition.

Two nights ago I was hanging out with 2 of my friends and two boys I’ve never met, we ended up playing truth or dare and if you didn’t want to do or answer something you had to take off an article of clothing. Long story short one of my friends, both of the boys, and me were all cuddling while almost naked. One of the boys asked if he could suck on someone’s boob and I was horny so I agreed alongside w the other girl. He did, and a few minutes later one of the boys asked to eat me out and I agreed because once again, I was horny. I ended up being finger blasted and eaten out while everyone was in the room. I’ve never had any kind of sex and that night was the first time I ever even let a guy see my boobs, let alone two guys. The next day one of the guys stayed and we just drove around and came back to my friends house. I ended up giving him a hand job and a blow job. I’d never touched a penis before either.

92,"I started taking singulair like last year and I was irritable and pretty moody but I thought it was all circumstantial stuff and the coronavirus was in full swing stress was at a max. So, naturally I just thought the mood swings were just a result of being under a ton of stress and I was only getting about 5 hours of sleep a night and having bowel problems and other anxiety like stuff. Well, I went off the Singulair for like a month due to an insurance changeover and when I got back on them like the second day I just started going off like majorly going off on people. I was way more chill but not great before I started taking it again and then I started going off on my wife, I started going off on my mom, my wife's grandmother and even my friend. I tore him through the floor and I did it gladly! I told him like the worst things you can tell a person. That night I noticed my sleep was way off again it never did get back to normal even in the month I was off the meds but the stress and strangeness calmed down.

97,"Started dating a not close friend a month ago. They broke up with me after we had our first disagreement (I had gone away to do an emergency animal rescue and they didn’t feel comfortable with the amount of contact they got while I was gone (which was zero) and I didn’t like that they wanted me to be accountable for every moment of my life). We had gone on 3 dates in the month we had been dating, so thought we were taking things at a relaxed pace... did not see the text saying they are done with me coming. Regardless, once they had sent the message I checked to make sure they were okay and had the support they needed from friends. I didn’t get anything back so that made me acutely aware of the uneven power dynamic that was already establishing itself. 

We were friends beforehand, and I wouldn’t mind going back to being friends. We didn’t do anything to make it awkward to be friends. 

After messaging to break up, they have since messaged to request an in person meeting to go over the things they had trouble with. They said that was the only way there is a chance we stay friends.
I am a little of the opinion that if they found breaking up with someone over text appropriate, there aren’t many topics that are more heavy than that requiring in person communication...and I am feeling rather sour about it. I am unemployed, and working as an unpaid volunteer for an animal rescue while I look for work. I don’t have the money to get across town (they didn’t want to come to me) just to be berated by a person who feels hard done by but doesn’t care about my feelings.

The meeting is in 2 hours. Do I go? What would I say if I were to cancel? 
I care about them but don’t want to deal with their emotional blackmail when I have looming homelessness, bankruptcy, and 2 dying pets on top of my pre-existing health conditions. My EDS and crohns tend to flare up the more stress I am in too.

I grew up in a very left-wing family. Was an early Bernie supporter, anti-Bush, anti-Israel, anti-capitalism, but I eventually felt I was anti-too many things. I started looking at a broader set of sources to get a more balanced view, and as I’ve grown closer to ‘the centre’ over time, it’s grown harder and harder to communicate with my family.

Tonight was an extreme example of this. We were talking about Kamala Harris, focusing on how great it is that she’s the first black, Indian, woman to be elected VP, which I agree is awesome. I then said that the main reason she was chosen by Biden was tactical, to win the ethnic minority vote in an incredibly tight election against a man like Trump.

Immediately, it was 3-against-1. Nobody actually called me racist, but my comment was “problematic” and “disgusting”. My family were shocked at me - how could I think this? My girlfriend ended up crying and leaving the room. I was shocked at them - how could they not see this for what it is?

For the record, I don’t think I handled it well. I came back and apologised but it’s not really resolved. I’m asking for advice on how to handle these situations better. If anyone else feels like a bit of a black sheep in family politics, I’d like to hear your thoughts especially.

103,"Okay this is complicated but important, bear with me. I met a woman on tinder, we hit it off and talked for a week before deciding to meet up. We meet up for tea and have a lovely time and I end up spending the night and were giggling and laughing and just vibing. Next morning we wake up early and I walk her to class where she asks me for my number and gives me a kiss and we part. She texts me once about the election and then radio silence for two days. 

The second day I called the number to see if anything is wrong or what happened, and went to voicemail. 

So not getting a response after a tinder date I would just assume I got ghosted/it didn't work or something. But that does not jive at all with any other parts of our interaction. 

You don't make a point of asking for someone's number if you are going to ghost them, you don't give them your real number if you are going to ghost them. You unmatch them on tinder if you are going to ghost them (she hasn't)

 Which makes me think maybe something else happened? Maybe she lost her phone? Problem is I don't know what to do. If she did ghost me I don't want to be all stalkery trying to connect with her, but if she didn't I really don't want to lose what I felt like was a good connection. 

I don't know any of her friends, or any way to contact her besides tinder and phone. If she did lose her phone though, she wouldn't have access to tinder either, and since I believe tinder makes you verify by next to sign in on a new device im not sure she could do that on a friend's phone even if she wanted to.

I know where she lives and it's very close by but trying to contact her in person is absolutely a last resort because like I said, I can respect that choice if I know what it is.

104,"Hey everyone. I don't know how much can be gained or input given on this situation since you don't know me, the people involved or the environment, but I'm pretty low on options so thanks in advance for your input

I've been working at a company for nearly 2 years now. I always make an effort to say bye to people when I'm aware that they are leaving, or once I find out that they have left/transferred after the fact. Most of the time this just adds to an already positive relationship and lets people know that you hope things go well with them. A lot of people its a brief interaction, some people a longer conversation, others want to stay in contact in various ways. It seems benign enough, but one of these interactions went so badly that its actually ruining my life

A new location opened and the GM of that new location posted on our slack channel (work communication chat, hopefully some of you are familiar with it) that he was looking for a certain amount of permanent transfers over to there. Everyone who I knew from the post that said they would I messaged to say that I saw that they may be transferring, if thats the case then its been good working with them and hope things go well with them. I talked to everyone but one girl co-worker (mid 20s, and I am Male 28), which isnt a problem, but what happened from there is she ended up coming back to this workplace to finish the week before transferring (everyone else transferred immediately). I kind of figured that she may just be staying and didnt think much of it. Since we're socially distanced I couldnt just ask her if she was staying after all. Anyway, next week comes by and it becomes kind of clear that she actually did transfer, and basically blew me off

This is when things go far down hill. I was upset that she clearly ignored me, and messaged her to see what that was about. That ended in her cursing me out and calling me creepy. Nobodies ever said anything like that to me before, the only thing Ive ever gotten since middle school was nice, friendly, harmless, etc. Its pretty much ruined my mind. Ive developed physical anxiety issues, Ive hardly smiled or laughed in months, my motivation for work and life has plummeted. Ive talked to friends about this, I was also able to relay to them my conversations with other co-workers (which are all positive besides this one). They have reassured me that I am not creepy and that nothing I said to her is creepy

Now I'm in a workplace of hundreds of people where a girl co-worker has called me a creep. Theres only two people Im aware of that are closer to her here. Ive tried to talk to both of them about this to no avail. They want to maintain a relationship with me and still talk like normal but basically have pretended like I never asked them to talk and clearly dont intend to talk about this with me. I feel like the best person that I can talk to at this point is another co-worker (35F) but there's no easy way to do so bc we now also work at different locations as well",08Nov2020,1

I haven't experienced really severe depression since adolescence, but I absolutely remember what it's like to feel helpless, unlovable, etc. He has two kids who we used to have every other weekend, but a few months ago, their mom seemed to decided that she just doesn't like us anymore, and we've been ghosted. Not getting to see his kids is a whole factor we can't do anything about. I won't lie; I've stalked his baby mama on social media a bit. She complains about how he wouldn't go to work and smoked too much weed.

Regarding work, his side of the story is that he didn't work for the majority of the time they were together, because he was a stay-at-home dad, which saved as much money in daycare as he would have made from minimum wage, and I totally believe it. He had a job when we started dating, but was laid off the first time everything closed down due to COVID.

Until a couple months ago, we were renting out the basement of a dude we met on Craigslist, and he was paying his part of the rent via unemployment with no problem. Since we moved into an apartment together, he isn't paying his full part of rent. He says he's been applying to every job possible, and I hate to say that he isn't trying hard enough, but I've been suggesting that he print out resumes and meet the managers of the jobs he's applied for. Why not? He has no motivation to do anything but fill out applications, but staying home while I work two jobs makes him feel guilty, so it's a vicious cycle.

He does smoke a lot of weed. I smoke, albeit not as much, and I know how occasional partaking can be a big help. I do feel like his smoking is excessive, but he definitely smokes just as regularly as when I first met him. He's even cut back lately, since rent's become scary.

Communication is bad on both our parts. I don't know how to put my feelings into words, so I don't until I'm angry, when it all comes out shitty. I've tried writing my thoughts out for him, which for me is the best way to get my thoughts organized and say things in the most diplomatic way. He ignored it until I mentioned it, and said it's shitty that I can't ""just say it to his face,"" and that really hurt. He tells me things like ""I'm just sad, there's nothing to do about it"" and what am I supposed to do with that? Maybe the quarantine's made us sick of each other and that's fine, but I don't know how to help him or us.",08Nov2020,1

  I talked about almost everything with my “best friend” and asked for her advice because I felt like she could help me understand things in another person's point of view and perspective. She knew me inside and out. She knew my past childhood traumas and what caused me anxiety. She knew just how to get under my skin. 

  
  I was in a great relationship and tremendously happy with my girlfriend. She moved in with her two children and we couldn't be happier. She had lost her job prior to the pandemic, but was receiving unemployment benefits and food benefits to help the family. She helped my son with his at home school also. She was going to start looking for a job after the unemployment benefits ran out, but this was in the very best interest for our family at the time with everything going on. This is something that we both agreed upon. 

  
   My “friend” was always so negative about my partner. I would ask for advice on what I could do to calm my girlfriend and understand her perspective when she was feeling angry and upset and how to be a better partner. When I talked about the times that my partner was feeling angry, she would call her abusive, manipulative, and a narcissist and to stay away from her. She also said that she was using me because I spent so much money on her on the kids with clothes, computers for both of her kids, a battery for her computer because hers died, sometimes food for the family and many other things. I was the only one working, but she brought in unemployment benefits. 

  
   My “friend” was extremely pushy and adamant that my girlfriend was all of these negative things, no matter how much I tried to argue that she was not. This “friend” would not budge from her negativity about my partner. A good  friend would not have been like this and would have said okay, I disagree but I am here for you, right? I firmly believe that she had an agenda.. 

  
  I ended up believing her, thinking that my “friend” had my best interest at heart. So, from that day forward, I thought that my partner was abusive, manipulating me, using me, a narcissist and the abuse was one day going to get worse... and I was in danger. 

  
  Believing my friend shaped how I behaved and reacted in the relationship. I told my partner that she was being abusive and manipulative. That was the lens that I was seeing through. A lot of the times,  I didn't react in kind and lovingly ways that I typically would,  because of all the garbage in my head. I feel tremendously guilty. This made her suicidal and she checked herself into a mental health facility. She didn't want to be abusive, she didn't want to be a “monster” or a bad person... She then, was doing daily group therapy Monday-Friday every day. She is so strong and amazing. She is a GOOD person in so many ways. 

  
  She was not perfect, had her flaws and quirks and she made mistakes, so I am not looking through rose colored glasses here. I am being realistic. I too was not perfect, full of flaws and quirks and had made mistakes. 

  
  The “friend” was putting soooo much pressure on me to end things and get out while I could.... before I got really hurt or killed.  “Think about your kids, think about the dog, she could some day kill you or the kids” It put me into this self defensive super anxiety, terrified mode and I ended things with my partner in a super dramatic and unreasonable way.   I ended things via text. I said absolutely horrible things to my partner that absolutely was not true. I told her that she was not welcome in the home anymore. So, I left her and her two kids almost homeless. She didn't have any money because she was waiting on her unemployment checks to come through. This absolutely had to have been traumatizing for her and the kids from her point of view. 

  
  I would have never done this to someone that I love. I legit was convinced that I was in danger and this was my ONLY option. I legit thought that I was doing the right thing. I legit believed at that time that my partner was all of these horrible things. But, omg she was not at all! I believe that anything can be worked out if both parties are willing to do what is needed to work things out.   
  I never once felt like she would hit me, hurt me, or do something to intentionally hurt me. When she held me, I felt at home, like every problem that I ever had just melted away. She was loving and supportive and would do things to help me feel less stressed. I was so stressed because of the conflict in my mind and my gut with everything my “friend” kept saying. 

  
  The “friend” had me convinced that my partner was abusing her dog and I needed to save the dog because it was the right thing to do and not to give back the dog to her. She said that if there was any problems, to call the cops. (My partner would smack her dog on the nose when he misbehaved, tried to bite someone or growled  and she would do this “bite” thing with her hand on his neck when he misbehaved.) Everyone that I spoke to after everything happened, except for this fake friend was like omg that's a normal dog ownership stuff. There is a line between abuse and discipline and she didn't cross it at all. 

  
  The “friend” was there when my girlfriend came to pick up some of her belongings the first time. She brought her gun too for some reason and made a point to tell me that.. She was super pushy, bossy and demanding on what I absolutely HAD to do. She gave me the number to the non-emergency 911 and then, right away transferred a call from her phone to me to them, instead of letting me make my own choice. I did not want to call the police at all. It wasn't even necessary. I didn't even want to end my relationship. I wanted to marry my girlfriend. 

  
  After talking with my actual best friend, other friends, and my therapist... I realized that this “friend” was sabotaging my relationship because she had an agenda. My actual best friend (whome is also “best friends” with the fake friend)  said that the “friend” has been super  jealous because I hadn't been spending time with them and that the fake friend is in love with me.The fake friend was really upset that my partner and I did not go to our friend's wedding due to Corona, but this was a decision that her and I agreed on for our family. 

  
  The “friend” and I had a one time thing a few months before I got together with my partner. She knew that it was a one time thing though. She was also supposed to move clear across the USA, had a job lined up making over 100k, and a place to live... but all of a sudden she didn't have “$5,000 to move there” My girlfriend and best friend threw me a birthday party and the “friend” was there. But, the “friend” was so off and weird the entire time. She didn't bring me a birthday gift or bring any food for the party, just ate what we brought. I was snuggling up with my girlfriend, happy and laughing and she ended up leaving early. She hugged my partner, but it felt so off. When she hugged her, she looked at me like she was making sure that I saw. 

  
  My oldest son was there when my partner came to pick up her belongings and I talked with him about it from his perspective and he felt like this “friend” was way too pushy and demanding  also. He too agrees that this “friend” sabotaged my relationship. 

  
  My therapist said that a narcissist will not admit if they are wrong. They would not seek out any help and would not say that the problem was with them. She was a GOOD person. An amazing woman for me. Feeling angry about something is okay, healthy and normal to talk about and it's not abusing someone if you are talking about things that make you angry. Calling someone out about things is completely different than being emotionally abusive. She said that I was being arrogant. I was though. She said that I was acting cold and I was. But, it was because I had all of this stuff in my head that she was a lot of things that she was not and this made me defensive. 

  
  So, I have cut this fake vindictive “friend” out of my life. Honestly, every interaction was always about her. She was constantly asking for money and I stopped because she never paid me back. She has borrowed over $600 from my best friend and still hasn't paid her back. She has had me bring her food, groceries, etc and never paid me back or did anything for me. She has never once given me any kind of birthday or Christmas gift, not even dollar store socks. I have given her many gifts over the years. She would ignore my messages when I was so happy and talking about my partner. But, the minute that she found an opportunity to destroy my future with her, she was talking with me more, but it was mostly her trying to convince me about how horrible my partner was for stuff that was absolutely normal and healthy. 

  
  I want my girlfriend back. She doesn't know about the “fake friend” stuff because we are currently in no contact. I have been reflecting more and more and started reflecting on the why did I think that she was this way, when she wasn't at all... I talked with my therapist about it and now, it makes total sense. 

  
  I am seeing a therapist and working on bettering myself and growth. My therapist said that her and I need at least 30 days to heal from this breakup. My last session was about boundaries. If I had set a boundary with my “friend” to stop speaking ill and pressuring me into believing all of these negative things, then things would have been different. I argued with this “friend” until I gave in. I didn't grow up in a family that had many boundaries. I am also doing EDMR therapy and calm therapy to rewire my brain due to past childhood traumas. 

  
  I still feel as if I should take responsibility that the breakup happened the way that it did. Even though, I was under intense anxiety and pressures from this fake friend. But, if I did not have this “friend” getting under my skin and pressuring me the way that she did, I would still be with the love of my life. 

  
 My ex partner still has me blocked and is on the dating apps now. We spoke last Sunday when she picked up the remainder of her belongings. She said that she wanted to work things out. She was in this. She loves me, is in love with me, sees a future with me, wants to be with me, but not right now. She needs time to heal from the trauma of the breakup. The last thing that she said to me, was to get help so I don't hurt any more relationships. 

  
 My partner does not know about the vindictive fake friend stuff. It has taken a ton of reflecting and talking with my therapist and others to realize what happened. I still feel confused though. 

  
 I fear that everything that has happened.. I have lost her forever. I cannot take back the things that were said or done.    
 Is there anything that I can do ?",08Nov2020,1
109,We are remote learning right now and I want to start DMing her but we haven't really talked except in school doing classes (before remote). I would like to keep talking to her but I don't want to come off as creepy or weird. Any suggestions? Just looking for something to get the ball rolling,08Nov2020,1
110,"First I just want to start by saying I’m 16. To start off, I was talking to this girl for about 3 months and we FaceTimed every night. It was clear we were into each other. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to lead you on for 2 months. Regardless if it’s for a week or 2 months you should never lead someone on. It’s cruel and it just shows you don’t have the decency of a human being. 

Anyway, yesterday my friend just texted me asking if he could have a shot with her. Of course I said yes but gave him some things to look out for. After all, she did just ghost me instead of just saying she was done. Just tonight I got a text from her friends saying “she never liked your broke ass” and some other things. I simply just responded saying that what she did was immature and I hope she treats my friend better. 

At this point I’m mildly frustrated because I’ve known him for a long time and I told him it was ok to shoot his shit with her. They are now dating and he didn’t even try to stand up for me or anything. I sent him a message and he just left me on read. I don’t know if I should block him and move on or see what happens next. What do you guys think?",08Nov2020,1

112,"- Graduated with my BSN in Spring 2020

- Started my first nursing job in July

- Let go from this job in October after my orientation period (3 months total experience in med-surg)

If I ended up going abroad for a year in another country to teach English would I be able to get a nursing job when I come back?

I was planning to travel after I graduated college, but it wasn’t possible with COVID. I just feel like I need something to look forward to. My first job really messed with my mental health. And yes there are jobs for teaching abroad that start in January/February, despite COVID, that I’m qualified for. I’m just worried that after I come back I won’t be able to find a nursing job since I’ll only have 3 months experience and a year break in my resume.",08Nov2020,1

115,"F(28) -had to move in with my parents during the pandemic. As you can imagine it’s not going well.

I have several concerns. 

Political stance is something I knew to be an issue. But it has proven to be violent and unapproachable. Can someone give me some tips on how to deal? If it’s any help, I voted for Biden

My mom seems to totally pop her top off when I talk about things with her. This could be simply me saying she didn’t follow a recipe accurately and therefore screwing up, or the fact that she has been collecting unemployment and literally doesn’t want to do her job because she’d have to wear a mask. She has been unemployed for almost 8 months. Either way, she has no desire to help anyone or do anything productive with her time. I can’t talk to her about anything without her eventually throwing her fist.

What can I do to understand my people better and make life better for us? We gonna be stuck for a while",08Nov2020,1
116,"My best friend of 6 years is in a tricky situation. About 9 years ago her half aunt met a guy and got married, he has 2 children from his previous marriage. For many years she had no relationship to them and they weren’t really considered family. However about 3 years ago she developed feelings for on of the sons and with some of the family’s blessings they dated. The family had no problem because they were not blood related and her aunt was her half aunt and wasn’t necessarily a close family member until 4 years ago . They broke up recently and now she’s carrying around so much guilt. She’s afraid of what people will think of her, she knows there’s no blood relation but she felt like she did something wrong. Even though she ended the relationship because she thought it wasn’t right she’s still beating her self up. I told her if she wasn’t blood related to him then it’s fine and he’s history now to not worry but she still is. And advice on what to tell her ??",08Nov2020,1
118,"My best friend has been planning on a short trip to another city for over a year now. When she first told me about this I told her that I wanted to go and she agreed. Now we are close to the date and never spoke about it again, until today. She said that her friends were organizing on how they were going to go, completely forgetting I told her I was also interested. So I reminded her ""hey, don't forget about me, I want to go too"" and she replied something like ""ahh yeah sure"". 
She's not the kind of person that forgets that kind of stuff, so after that situation, I realized that maybe they've planned on everything thinking that I wouldn't go and she told me just because she was excited.
I'm not the jealous kind of friend at all so I wouldn't mind if they don't invite me but I guess it would be weird if I ask her if she really wants me to go. She wouldn't say no just not to hurt my feelings, and if I go I'd hate to make them feel uncomfortable. And if they decide to travel without telling me it would extremely awkward. I feel like I shouldn't have insisted but I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid.

119,"I (18f) was posting on r/AITA and was informed my relationship with my boyfriend (18f) could be a codependent relationship and that It is super unhealthy. I just want to post something focusing on this because I really don't know.

Me. I am Autistic and have some troubles with recognising emotions but that's never been a problem because my s/o explains what he's feeling to me specifically. I also have undiagnosed anxiety and require constant reassurance that he doesn't hate me or something isn't going to go wrong or that I will do something wrong, which he always gives and numerous times have been told that he's happy to give this reassurance. He's always been by my side for the over a year we've been dating despite my  regular panics and struggled with life skills (organisation and planning mainly). Also I would like to point out I will be trying to get a diagnosis/some help for my anxiety once lockdown is more over and I can go to a doctors.

He has chronic depression and semi relies on me to reassure him he's not worthless and that he is amazing and unique and that he has a place in this world. I give him constant comfort whenever I see him (unless I feel bad/sad, then we comfort each other). He also has some problems with emotions so I too explain what I am feeling in detail father than with an emotion. I help him sometimes with schedules and just overall love as his childhood has been quite full of neglect.

I've been told this relationship is unhealthy as we rely on each other, but other than outside problems with our school lives or social lives, me and him have never had any real problems with each other. We don't fight, we talk things out and support each other in whatever we want to do.

 Is this relationship unhealthy?",08Nov2020,1
120,"I am 16F. I was heading back to my mom's car, she got mad at me for being ""late"". She arrived way earlier than expected and she got angry that I didn't answer her call immediately. I had my phone stowed away to show that I was paying attention to my friend. In the car, she said "" he's not your friend is he? If you want to see him again, I need to know his parents, more about him including his ethnicity and his mental health related things"". I was just hanging with a platonic friend at a park, nothing happened. All I did was hug him goodbye. She said "" I don't care what you do with your boyfriend "" and then shortly after she kept interrogating me about the clothing I wore around him. I don't normally dress up, all I wore was a fairly modest tank top, a baggy gray cardigan and black pants. She complains about me showing an inch of skin even though she shows skin. I think she's a hypocrite because she wears fairly formal clothes around the guy she is screwing with. I just wanted to look a little nicer today because I was sick of the baggy clothes she forces me to wear. She would always complain about how disgusting my clothing looked and told me to look nicer. When I did, she accused me of having sex with every friend I hang with. I like to look nice for my friends usually, not because I'm attracted to them but because it makes me feel good and I want to look presentable. It's so confusing.. she wants me to wear nicer stuff to be more ""ladylike"" but then has said I was becoming one when I was testing out makeup, would always judge the shade of lipstick I wore rarely and would try to cover my body as much as possible and then say it's unattractive that I wear baggy things even though it's all I have and because she says she doesn't want me to look slutty. I mean, if I were dressing nice for my friend because I liked him (I don't), that's my business, I am a single teen girl and she's a grown woman who has a husband and kids. I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm not cheating unlike her. And I didn't do dirty stuff either. I just wanted to feel pretty because my mom used to make fat comments all the time and would say I suck at dressing myself. She hates it when I look dressed up, which is very rarely",08Nov2020,1

Yesterday, I removed it by going through it with a razor blade, cross-hatching against all of the ink. It did bleed quite a lot, but I'm well versed in caring for wounds and I do think it will heal up well.

Is this alright? The wounds are not very deep, above the dermis layer of my skin and are bleeding superficially; I don't think they'll scar.

123,"Okay, firstly, I’d like to apologise about the thread title, I don’t actually stick stickers on apples but I feel at the moment that’s a valid career move.

I am unemployed, I have been now for over a year. I lost my last position for complaining about a returning manager who came back from maternity leave, long story short I didn’t realise the influence she had in the company and I had my first taste of a sociopath absolutely walking the floor with me. I even moved cities, 8 hours for that job. 

Okay so I’m not bitter anymore, I got that job immediately after graduation and it wasn’t great anyway - but it did break my heart somewhat.

That being said, I am really struggling to find work, I seem to face the your overqualified or you don’t have enough experience, this may be true and it may be a nicer way of saying we have better candidates applying.

So over the last year I’ve been fighting for work, I don’t really understand where I’m going wrong or perhaps even where I can improve. I’ve asked for feedback from multiple interviews to be told that I was a second choice and the only reason I didn’t get the position was because another candidate on has x amount more years experience in a similar role.

This keeps happening and I honestly feel like the world is saying no thanks to me, I’m trying to stay positive. Anyone who has been unemployed for a long period of time will know my pain but honestly I want to see it as a valuable lesson over the torture it may have felt like at times.

I’m clueless now, I just really want an opportunity but it feels like I’m slipping through the cracks every time. I don’t often cry but I can feel my need to share on reddit just to keep myself from falling apart.

My partner has been supporting me and I do my best with the welfare I get but as you can imagine it’s the very bare minimum. I give it all to her to go towards bills but I know she holds a strong face and I know that we’re struggling.

Her father hates me because he believes I’m lazy and this is heartbreaking. I now longer visit her family home with her for her dad will berate and belittle me the whole time - suggesting it’s easy to find work. I believe he thinks I don’t want to provide for his daughter but that’s all I want.

I’d like to create a family, but I would never bring a baby into the world if I cannot at least provide a good life for it; I’m not suggesting I need to be a billionaire but I’m not gonna make any rash decisions while we are financially unstable...

So to the point, I want to stay happy, I want to stay positive and not turn bitter but this is how it’s gone so far... or this is what I’ve tried anyway.

Over 1000 applications sent off - from minimum wage to around £24k a year. I have 2 degrees, good grades, I joined the army at 17 and received basic training, I’ve worked on films and television, I’ve had a varied set of experiences but nothing that is a lasting career. For ease of math, out of those 1k applications, I’d say I’ve written around 150 personal statements, tailored cv’s, covering letters.. I’ve provided free work, examples of previous work and even offered to work for free just to get in the door.

I’ve completed so many job training programmes only to be told after weeks that they are no longer employing at that time as the role has been filled, or perhaps my application has been lost or they have no record of the hours of questions I’ve answered and to please do it again, multiple times.

I’ve built connections, I actually met a councillor for my city who directed me to one of his departments. At first he was very flirty, it became obvious quickly he was gay but I love the gays, so saw this as just another friend. He passed on my information and secured me an interview, he helped provide all the information for the interview and advised me on what to say, he also allowed me to use him as a reference (he was the boss of the department). During this process I started to see that he became quite forward, he would say things that would make me feel really uncomfortable, at times even rapey but I kept at it because he ensured me he would secure me this role, it had amazing benefits. Long and short of it, I didn’t get the job. I feel like because of the way I look he tried to take advantage of me, if perhaps I had less confidence he may have tried to take full advantage of me using the promise of a job knowing how desperate I am to find a career.
I’ve moved past this and learned that I won’t be dealing with that again, and perhaps not to trust everyone I meet.

I thought like perhaps maybe doing something for my community may help, so my partner and I baked hundreds of cakes, biscuits, treats (were both very good chefs *modest) - we delivered them in lovely packaging to local families who were struggling, we wanted to give them a treat when they were struggling because despite having very little my partner and I have what might be considered the pedestrian relationship, with eachother that’s all we needed. We ended up helping hundreds of families, never accepting money for our goods, only smiles. 

I’ve done the miles, I’ve walked into companies and handed in a CV, I’ve worked on my interpersonal and personal communication and often thrive in social situations effortlessly.

I want to work hard, I want to put in the hours, I want to help somebody else with their dream so they can help me provide a dream for my partner; All I honestly need is just a chance. This is where the tears fall, I am literally begging for a chance, begging for an opportunity. 

There’s obviously more to it, but I’m 28 now and really, honestly, truly, I feel like I’m struggling now. I don’t have depression or anxiety I’m lucky their also, my mental health has always seen me be the rock for many but I can’t pretend, it’s hard and I am struggling.

I’m signed up with loads of government agencies, but it often tends to feel like I’m a number on a system helping them gather government grants etc. The information they share is aimed at unemployed people who may not want to work, not those that love to learn and want to create a real future for themselves.

I do not do drugs (anymore / I did used to recreational use cannabis but it had no adverse effects) and I don’t drink alcohol beyond the odd glass or wine or bottle of cider at a social function. 

I love to listen to others and feel I have great empathy in understanding others making them feel comfortable around me, beyond anything else listening truly allows me to learn so much - I believe everyone has something to offer big or small.

Right now, we’re staying afloat but my partners hiding her debt from me, I know she’s getting credit cards to stay above water some
months and I truly wish I could just work to make sure she is okay, but more so give us a better life. She has a better understanding of credit than I do so I trust what she’s doing, and she’s keeping up with payments so I get it.

Please Reddit, offer me advice, please tell me what I’m missing, I know suicide is never something I’ve contemplated, but if truly I’m
Unemployable as it seems I can’t burden my life on to other people, but I want to live, I love my partner, I love life actually, just I’m not sure how long I can stay positive, please help me to understand where I may be going wrong. All advice accepted, I can accept the truth, I can accept realism, please do not hold back if you feel you have absolutely anything to share.

I apologise for the longer post, I hope somebody catches this and I don’t fall through the cracks again, please offer me advice?",08Nov2020,1
124,"I'm dealing with this because of a very dear friend of mine.  She has been going through a bad episode for a few months now and she's said that it's been getting worse. I do know for a fact that she's going to therapy and that her mom has been helping her so I'm relieved about that. The last time we spoke was when she was in the hospital after having a small surgery.  She told me that she was getting discharged and we haven't spoken since then. This was about a month ago.  Before her depression got this bad we'd talk for hours every day. It started slowing down a few months ago before it eventually became a few messages every few days. At one point she apologized profusely about not talking as much and for feeling the way she did, but I told her that it's okay and that I wouldn't leave her behind. In fact, I've told her a few times to not to worry about me and to text me back when she was ready to, and that I wouldn't leave her behind or stop being her friend or grow to resent her because of how she's feeling. 

Honestly I want to text her every day just to say that I care and that she isn't weak or worthless and that she'll make it through this, but I don't because I know that it can get overwhelming. Every 7 or 10 days I'll send a message of encouragement/reassurance/meme, but I don't know if I should keep doing that. She hasn't opened the messages I've sent and they've been left on delivered since the surgery. She's a long distance friend too so I can't be there for her physically either. It's just hard to not be worried.

Also I'm sorry if this post reads or comes out weirdly. I'm new to reddit and don't really know what I'm doing. I have also posted this to r/depression. I just want all the help I can get tbh.",08Nov2020,1

126,"Here's the situation. My mother, myself (24 yrs old), sister (12 yrs old), other sister (20 yrs) live with grandparents. My sister managed to get out on her own cause she has a father mentor to move with. I don't. We've been here for 9 months since 2020 and corona stated. Basically, everyday, I am stuck here with my 12 year old sister. I had grad school until I quit for mental health reasons. My grandma and grandpa pick on my younger sister. I defend her as much as I can, but tonight was different. Grandpa called her a little shit to some of his family over the phone. So, now, my mother has decided to move us into a hotel.

This will be the 2nd time we have to live in a hotel. My mother will pay for it because she and my sister work. I'm going to be stuck with my 12 year old sister who is both rude and disrespectful. Doesn't mean she deserves bullying. This is going to effect me negatively because I'm trying to move out and my finances are going to go down. I always get dragged into this ludicrous shit. Trust me, I'm trying to start my life - not go backwards. I've no clos friends to crash with. Is moving the right thing to do for us?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Can tutuor online for a job which is 90% guaranteed. I've been babysitting my sister for 5 years now, never had the courage to start my life but I am trying now. I have 5k saved up, no car, but a phone, and a bachelor's in psychology. Can take the bus. I just don't want to be stuck with her kid or my mother's nagging. Please help.",08Nov2020,1
127,"Once again I’ve over worked myself. This Happens every couple months. My immune system gets bad, by joints start to ache. I feet fatigued most days and I just can’t sleep cause I’m so stressed but my won’t rest. I juggle college, and two high demanding jobs. I have to travel straight from work tomorrow 4 hours to the city to do a film set job for two days. Then it’s back to college three days. Working the rest and repeat.

128,"I’ve become an extremely envious and bitter person, nothing’s ever enough, I don’t care about anyone. I’m ready to lie if it’s easier, but before I was too honest with people. I feel so left behind, but I have everything I need - a family, uni, etc. I don’t know who or what to turn to. I’ve tried therapy, meds...

Example: I used to have a good childhood friend. Probably when I felt happiest when I was a kid was at his house, with his family. Now he never texts me. He has constantly distanced himself from me. This feeling is probably daily, from different sources. 

I feel really directionless and I don’t know how to regain what I lost. I just want to cry, I’ve felt so awful for so long.",08Nov2020,1
129,"Hi there, I’m an Australian 18 year that has recently left home from my verbally and emotionally abusive mother. I left with not much as the police helped escort me to a friends house. I have already had a thing sorted with the police so that they could support me in grabbing things but they were useless. My mother was still verbally abusing me and running out the house to my brothers car to abuse him too. They just stood there and rushed me. I was scatter brained and couldn’t think straight about grabbing the appropriate things, I felt rushed. Anyways, the police were no help, no one wants to even breathe the same air as my mother and I have important documents and things sitting in my room, that she’s threatened to throw out.

130,"I \[18m\] live with my parents and my sister who is 25. I don't like my sister because she is very annoying and super touchy and that makes me uncomfortable. Many times Im just doing my own thing and she comes up to me and tries to hug me or slaps my butt as a ""joke"" and I always tell her to stop but that makes her do it more and it makes me uncomfortable. She never listens and today when I make home after hanging out with my friends she tried to keep hugging me and I pushed her away. She was forcefully trying to hug me and I grabbed her throat to push her away and she told my parents and they were mad at me. 

I live in the US and my sisters name is on the house (my parents transferred it into her name because she had better credit or something and helped my parents buy it). Im scared shes gonna call the cops if I hit her again or she will kick me out (she said she can legally because its her house). What should I do? I dont wanna be homeless and I cant stand my sister.

131,"So, let me start by saying I'm a plus-sized person. I've been bigger all my life and since my early teenage years, I've taken to just hiding my body under baggy clothes, valuing comfort and not being seen over having an actual style. But I'm 20 now and want to stop doing that.

I feel like wearing decent outfits that maybe show a little more skin, are brighter in color, or are more form fitting would be a step toward gaining confidence. Howevee, whenever I try to step outside of my comfort zone, clothing wise, I get incredibly anxious and I feel like everyone will stare at me and laugh at me. But I know it's not helping me to keep doing the same thing I've been doing since middle school. Does anyone have any tips to get over this anxiety? I've tried to push through it, but it gets the better of me every time. (I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, but I don't know how else to describe it.) Thanks for reading.",08Nov2020,1
132,"I can’t keep pushing down my guilt into my stomach, it’s physically starting to hurt me. I (F20) followed my heart like every romantic movie in existence and chose love. I chose to get engaged to a girl (F23) who is everything my family disapproves of.

We are incredibly religious (and I am too), and so gay relationships are a big no no, yet in my research i’ve found they aren’t sinful as i was taught. I love her, I really do, and I want a future with her. But this guilt is unbearable. i feel like i’m betraying everyone i love. 
I plan to finish school and work for a few years, and once i’m financially independent, I move across the world to live with her in her country. 
the guilt is:
1) i am lying to my family. they’ll think i just don’t want to marry anyone. that i am abandoning them to live somewhere i have no reason to live. 
2) i am choosing my fiancée over my parents and siblings. i don’t want to pick. i keep trying to tell myself i can have both. i can be with her and my parents , visit them from time to time and just not tell them. but i don’t see myself living with a lifelong lie. it’s been 2 months and i’m already being crushed under this guilt. 

the last thing isnt really a guilt, but more of a fear. because i know i can’t lie forever, one day i will tell them. i’m scared. scared they’ll disown me, scared my siblings will never speak to me again. my brother and sister especially mean so much to me. i couldn’t live knowing they despised me and were embarrassed to be blood related. even as i type i’m tearing up at the thought of that day. 

i either become severely depressed with this lie or drown in the sadness of their reactions. 

I don’t want to end my relationship, this isn’t an option. i am committed. but this doesn’t stop my guilt and fear of losing my family. how do i cope? 
i appreciate any advice but i would value the advice given from those who have been in a similar predicament",08Nov2020,1
133,"So I just want to know if I’m going crazy, I have three friends, ones a girl two are boys and the girl always talks to the two boys and they’re really close, and whenever I try to join in and incorporate myself they just close me off and make jokes about me and one if them makes jokes about my sexuality, although they say they support me it doesn’t really show that to me clearly. One of the friends that is a boy and the girl always make jokes about me together, but when I’m on a call separately with one of them, it’s just normal conversation and they’re so nice to me. When it’s on a group call, they all gang up on me and make jokes and say I’m really sensitive. The other friend that’s a boy makes fun of me too but when I took a break from our friendship he said maybe we shouldn’t be friends because I’m too sensitive and that I need to work on it.

134,"Recently got over some drama involving my coworker. The coworker got pissed at my girlfriend over some dumb shit, and we wound up going through a lot of bullshit because of it. She started making threats at my girlfriend (call her Meg), which I took seriously enough to stay by her side 24/7 in case she actually decided to make good on them. Thing is, there were multiple times at work where i had to sit there and listen to her and her friend talk shit about Meg, including times where they were talking about what they were going to do to her, which basically consisted of more violent threats. This coworker straight up looked me in the eye and told me about how she was going to ""break her fingers with a hammer and watch her scream"". Im paraphrasing here. 
 
Obviously i have more than enough motivation at this point to do something, but im too cautious for my own good. I didn't want to do anything on my own because nothing would come of it. Say we got into a fight, i would be the one going to jail, and nothing would be resolved. So i decided to go ahead and get in contact with the police while we waited on her to act on her threats. Then i could take her down, preferably choking her out so i don't have to hurt her, and then I could be protected by self defense laws. We would have proof that this was premeditated and that we are not in the wrong. 
 
Long story short, nothing happened. I guess the violent girl sobered up at some point and decided it wasn't worth the legal trouble. And in the end, what exactly did i do? I wasn't able to defend her. I never once got in anybodys face over this. Any time they started antagonizing me, I would walk away. These charges that we started filing arent going to do shit if theres no solid evidence of a real threat. I sat back and let this whole thing play out without being able to do a damn thing about it. I think Meg handled everything surprisingly well, but knowing that somebody seriously has it out for you just can't be a fun experience to go through. 
 
TL;DR am I a coward for not doing anything to protect my girlfriend when someone was making threats at her? What should i have done in this situation?",08Nov2020,1
135,"Hello. I am a 20 year old girl from India and I still live with my parents. 
My father is alcoholic and abusive. He mentally and physically abuses me and mainly my mother. He is also involved with other women and refuses to stop seeing them. 

Last night, my mother and my father went to a party of their friends and my father insulted her infront of everyone. Everyone was doing Karaoke. My mom was hesitant to but was peer pressured to. Halfway through her song, my father screamed out “Your singing is terrible, BITCH”. Yes he said that publically. Everyone heard it.

136,"I (M, 22) graduated from college in May and moved back home with my parents. To be honest, I have been bored out of my mind. I don't really talk to the friends I had from high school, so I haven't had much to do but sit around the house. I only recently found a part-time job working retail so most of the people I am going to be working with I assume will be pretty young. Additionally, there is a pandemic going on, so I don't know how to make friends if there are no social events occurring where I could befriend said people. I live near a major city (Philly) so I was thinking about visiting there more often but I'm not sure who would want to hang out with someone that they don't really know while a pandemic is going on.

137,"So I (18f) have an autistic neighbor (23f) she is listed as high functioning. I know it can be controversial to say high functioning but it’s how she describes herself.  She is also an insane liar. I mean she has more criss crossed stories than anyone I have ever met. She was both bullied and a prom queen as well as being a pageant queen even though she is “incredibly shy”. (I have evidence that none of this is true except for the bullying)

I have lived next to her for years but it wasn’t until about four years ago when she graduated high school that she became a problem. I was a freshman and she was lonely so she would often ask if we could hang out. I don’t really like her because she lies about everything but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to hang out with her. Well eventually she got the idea that we were best friends. She called me everyday and would come over to my house all the time. I thought when I moved away to college I would finally be free.

Now that I’m in college she has just gotten worse. She calls me multiple times a day and our conversations last for hours. Even though I asked her to stop calling me so often she always does. I have tried ignoring her multiple times but she says that I hate her because of her autism. Witch is not true I simply want time to myself. One time in high school I got to busy to talk to her and she threatened to kill herself if I didn’t talk to her. 

I feel trapped like if I don’t talk to her she might hurt herself but continuing to talk to her all day takes a mental toll. I just don’t know what to do.",08Nov2020,1
138,"I'm (19 M) dealing with this because of a very dear friend of mine (19 F). She has been going through a bad episode for a few months now and she's said that it's been getting worse. I do know for a fact that she's going to therapy and that her mom has been helping her so I'm relieved about that. The last time we spoke was when she was in the hospital after having a small surgery.  She told me that she was getting discharged and we haven't spoken since then. This was about a month ago.  Before her depression got this bad we'd talk for hours every day. It started slowing down a few months ago before it eventually became a few messages every few days. At one point she apologized profusely about not talking as much and for feeling the way she did, but I told her that it's okay and that I wouldn't leave her behind. In fact, I've told her a few times to not to worry about me and to text me back when she was ready to, and that I wouldn't leave her behind or stop being her friend or grow to resent her because of how she's feeling. 

Honestly I want to text her every day just to say that I care and that she isn't weak or worthless and that she'll make it through this, but I don't because I know that it can get overwhelming. Every 7 or 10 days I'll send a message of encouragement/reassurance/meme, but I don't know if I should keep doing that. She hasn't opened the messages I've sent and they've been left on delivered since the surgery. She's a long distance friend too so I can't be there for her physically either. It's just hard to not be worried and to feel “rejected” for the lack of a better word.

140,I (20m) tried googling this but nothing really came up so I figured I'd ask here. Did you have to learn the 'correct' facial expressions for your emotions? Like I use to study how other people made their faces look when they were sad or happy or whatever so I could imitate it so other people knew what I was feeling. There are still some facial expressions I have trouble with like I dont know how to look apologetic or surprised and this leads to problems where people think I just dont care when I really do I just don't know what its suppose to look like. I also sometimes have trouble with understanding other peoples facial expressions and it usually lands me in trouble bc I was doin something upsetting or annoying them and I couldn't tell. I usually miss a lot of cues like that and don't get what people are trying to communicate to me if they don't just tell me point blank. Is this normal?

Let’s also say you’ve been in a relationship for a long while (over 3 years). However, the soulmate and the family are not clicking...let’s also say there is a constant pull (like a tug of war) for your attention. I have found that I cannot keep both sides happy. It always seems that I have to be putting one before the other. Recently, I’ve wanted to give up on both sides, which is a consistent guilt I have. For over six months now, I have wanted to ditch both sides and just live in an apartment on my own. I’m tired of the none-sense, but I’m not one for confrontation.

149,"Hello, thanks for reading.

I'm looking for some advice here.

Recently a mutual acquaintance connected me with a guy working a sales position for a small business. It seems they make decor, have a decent following. He was looking for a web designer to build an e-commerce site for the wholesale side of their business.

**On 8/31** I spoke with him on the phone, followed up by email and sent my quote, $1250

Didn't hear back so I followed up by email on 9/14, he told me my quote was higher than others, and that they found another candidate for the job.

He contacted me by phone the next day telling me the person they chose didn't work out, they didn't want to use Wordpress (which the designer recommended), and asked if I was still available to do it, and if I could give a lower quote for the job. He spoke with me a bit about his budge and what they were expecting from him, asked if he could help me out. I agreed.

I looked over what they needed from me, did some research, found the best solution (Wix), and sent my quote again on **9/15** ($1100).

He contacted me on Sunday, 9/20, letting me know that he spoke with the management team and they weren't comfortable using Wix. He asked if I could use Wordpress ""or any other hosting company"" but when we spoke on the phone he basically told me they only wanted Wordpress.

I told him that was fine, I'd do my research again for the best Wordpress solution and send the quote \*again\*.

I was a little busy so I needed a few days to get back to him, responded with my solution and quote on **9/24.**

He calls me that day and lets me know that they approved it to move forward. He tells me to get in touch with accounting to give them my payment info, says whatever I prefer should be fine.

I speak with accounting and they tell me the only option I have is PayPal. I've had issues with PP so I ask if they can just send me a bank transfer but they refuse. I set up a PP to receive the payment.

**On 9/29** I receive the half payment of $625 (half of the original $1250 I asked for, not $1100 but I figured it was fine).

**On 9/30** I begin setting up their site, sales guy advises me to contact accounting for any credit card info I would need to open the accounts. I email that same day, telling them I was advised to contact for it.

**Next day, 10/1**, Accounting guy responds and asks me if it would be possible to make those payments for subscriptions on the back end of the project. I respond that day and tell them not as far as I'm aware but I will see if there's any way to do it, but to not get their hopes up (I knew there wasn't)

**10/2** I confirm there is no way to pay for the subscriptions on the back end of the project. We would need to pay for the Wordpress subscription upfront in order to integrate WooCommerce.

...

**10/7** Accounting guy sends me an email asking if he can give me a call. He calls me and says sales guy has left the company, so as of now they need to postpone the completion of the wholesale site. He says that they'll definitely need it done, so he will get in contact with me ""probably in 2 months"". I say that's fine and I'll make sure I'm available to do the job. He makes quick mention of me possibly returning the deposit, to which I say the money is spent (it was) but I'm definitely on board for finishing the site later on.

...

**11/4** I wake up to a call from accounting guy telling me it's looking like they won't be needing the wholesale site, to which I say that's fine, no worry, mostly considering my wasted time and effort. Then he goes on to ask me if I could return the payment, to which I again say the money has been spent and I'm not really in the best place to part with that much money. He says maybe we can break it up in to smaller payments for me to return, I tell him send me an email about it and I'll follow up (I mostly just wanted to get off the phone).

His email:

&gt;Good Speaking with you just now. As we discussed, with no longer working with \*\*\* we don't really have the need or time for a wholesale website right now and so we'll need the $625 returned as soon as possible.  
I understand you are going through some financial issues right now, and we discussed either breaking the amount into half ($312.50) now and the other half next month. Or four payments of $156.25 over the next four months.  
Go ahead and take some time to look over your financials and jobs you have coming in and we will reconnect next week to decide which repayment option would work best.

I do understand why they'd want the payment returned but considering the timeline, their poor preparation, and the little bit of effort and time I did put into it, I don't feel I should have to return it. The idea of working other jobs to pay back another job which fell through seems crazy to me. I don't think I should be held responsible here. What are your thoughts?

TL;DR: Client sent half payment for job upfront, dragged feet, lost employee heading up the project, cancelled job, now wants payment returned almost 2 months after confirming.",08Nov2020,1
150,"Good Afternoon everyone! So basically I (21M) recently got out of the military and am currently between jobs/homes. Due to this my family agreed that I could take care of their home until it is sold due to my father getting a new job. Unfortunately the apartment that they are currently living in doesn't allow dogs or cats (unless de-clawed). So I am currently watching two dogs and a cat, which is easy to be honest. My problems comes in is the house has been sold and I need to be out of here within two weeks (also pretty simple, I have a good savings account and can get a job that is not in my career field). My problem comes in is my family wants to put the animals with other people for some unknown amount of time or have me take the dogs, get the 5 yr old cat de-clawed so they can take her or other variations of that. I think it would be horribly sad to put the animals in different homes due to the feeling of abandonment and was curious if anyone in the apartment rental business or house renting business could give me advice to exceed the two pet rule. I don't want to lie my way into an apartment and don't want to give the animals up. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",08Nov2020,1

153,"I am 21f, almost 22, and I live with a racists, homophobic, woman hating mother. It wasn't so bad before quarantine because we both had jobs and didn't see each other much, but now its to the point I cant stand to be home because I am stuck with my mother. It has got to the point recently, especially with the election, that she has driven away my POC friends and my own boyfriend, white male, because of her attitude towards everyone and everything. She is constantly belittling everyone, insulting everyone, invalidating every single thing anyone says and turns it around to make it about her. 

Now, im gonna do what she does and make this about me. I am a college student at a community college getting a transfer degree. Thanks to not having any individuality growing up I only have the skills taught in school and job experience. I do know a fair amount about environmental sciences which I have obtained on my own. I learn very quickly and can get along with almost everyone so long as they aren't rude. I tend to do things out of spite, like showing people I CAN graduate high school, I CAN go to college, I CAN do whatever I set my mind to and you cant tell me otherwise. But finding a job that pays well enough to survive off of is damn near impossible to find and housing is incredibly expensive. I am doing my best, working two jobs and going through online college. But minimum wage on almost no hours is hard. One job gave me three days of work in two months and the other job offers no more than 20 hours a week.... Quarantine doesn't help with places still not hiring... 

How do I find and obtain a decent job that I can support myself on? I am not going to make/let my boyfriend pay for my things because it isn't his job to be a sugar daddy.

154,"There’s a cute guy who works out at my gym and we always end up there at the same time. Most times we are working out in close quarters and we glance at one another. When we are farther away we end up consistently making eye contact from across the gym. I admire his hard work in maintaining his nice physique even though I was never a person that was attracted to men who build their muscles intensely.. let me tell ya, I am now. He’s quite handsome but I can’t find it in me to say anything to him. I’m wondering is this a one sided attraction or is he going to finally approach me. Side note, he doesn’t talk to anyone at the gym he just goes in and does his thing as do I, but the consistent glances that we have been exchanging are getting to me and I’m finding myself drawn to him.",08Nov2020,1
155,"My boyfriend and I would like to move across the country. I have a really good job and career and I make a decent salary. I’m not 100% sure if they’d let me transfer or work remotely if I asked. My boyfriend hasn’t been working due to the pandemic and his parents give him a lot of money. 

I have my own place and a lot of bills to pay. I also have student loans. I feel very nervous about moving because if my job tells me I can’t transfer or work remotely, I’ll be jobless. My boyfriend is jobless as of right now so I can’t really count on him. I don’t live paycheck to paycheck but I also find it hard to save a lot of money as my bills are quite a lot. My boyfriend won’t move in and split bills with me because he lives at home and doesn’t have to pay anything..... so I guess why move in with me, right?

I feel like my boyfriend is asking a lot of me. He doesn’t have much to lose but I do. It would be nice if he tried harder to find a job and maybe move in with me so we could split up bills. I could then be able to save some more money for the move. 

Am I wrong for thinking this way? It’s been putting a lot of pressure on me lately. I feel like if he really cared he’d wait for me to be at a comfortable point financially or want to help me... I just feel like he’s being a little selfish... any advice?",08Nov2020,1

157,"When I was 12 I was at the playground near my house and there were a bunch of teenagers playing basketball on the mini court they have. I started talking to them and long story short, one of the girls, Peyton, gave me her Snapchat. We started texting and she kept being really weird and sending sexually provocative pics of herself. She would always say ask me stuff like ""Have you ever masturbated?"" and ""What are your kinks?"" And once when we were back at the park, I let her put her hands under my shirt. I told her like 30 times that I didn't want to and that this felt wrong. She even pressured me to send her pics of my chest, which I did. She's moved away since and I can barely even remember what she looks like.

Whenever we try to tell her she did fine and she can improve upon her mistakes she takes it as a lie and tells us to stop trying to cheer her up. We could care less about the mistakes she makes but she points them out. Recently we were playing a competitive game and she made a mistake that almost lost us the game. The person on our team who was 10-12 said she had aids and she took it literally and said it was our fault we take things to seriously. Even though in game she is the one shaking when she is the last one left and she is the one that bashes herself. She has gone on and on about how its our fault and how she doesnt like playing with us. I had another person that i have cut ties with because they were not a good person. I am 14 and i have known her since 5th grade. After she makes mistakes she told us she hits her head really hard and then has to get off because of the pain.

160,"
A while ago my dad was upset with me for not cleaning the kitchen. I got in trouble for it multiple times and I wasn’t allowed to see people for a while because of it. I started cleaning the kitchen every night and when I asked for allowance my dad said no because I didn’t take the dishes out of the dishwasher after they were washed and when I put utensils in they weren’t organized and standing the same way, he also talked about how when I asked before I would do it but would stop. I explained that before if I got behind on something I would do it but then end up behind on something else and I eventually stopped doing my chores cause I felt like if I was going to catch up I needed to do everything but I couldn’t make time to do them because I still needed to take care of my other responsibilities. He told me to “be creative” and put 100 percent into cleaning the kitchen every time I did them and I wasn’t forced to do everything at once. I continued to clean the kitchen and started making food for my siblings. While this was going on I was behind on my school work and trying to catch up. A few days ago I asked for some money for games that I wanted to get my dad said to message him how much money I wanted and what games I was getting so I did but he never gave me the money. Today I asked him about it again and he said he would see what he could do. A hour ago he came into my room and saw it was a mess ( I was cleaning it before he came in) he got mad at my dog because he took the stuffing out of his bed and said he would beat and hurt him. After that he called my sister into my room and talked about how we didn’t know how a leg for a table got broken and why we didn’t talk to each other and try to figure it out but we can ask him for things. He then made my sister leave and talked about how I said I would catch up on school work but I was still behind and only logged in for 3 hours this week. I have been doing my school work but I’m doing it at about the same rate that it’s getting assigned. He said he would get rid of my dog and devices if I can’t catch up. I don’t have a problem with him taking my stuff away but he has been threatening to take away my dog since we got him. I started having trouble with my schoolwork even before COVID started and I haven’t done online school before so it’s just been hard to sit in one place and focus on doing it. I feel like all the effort I put in to start doing my chores and catch up wasn’t worth it and I can’t do or ask for anything until I do everything and there is always going to be more for me to do or something I’m forgetting. I feel like my dad just took his anger out in me because of what he said to/about my dog and how he brought my sister into it. He does these long talks about how he is being patient with me and how he won’t talk to me about it again but he still does. Is this normal for parents to do? And how do I manage my time so that I can stay on top of things and be allowed to do stuff again?",08Nov2020,1
161,"I (20F) live in a society where it's almost mandatory to love your parents and respect them because they raised you and all that. I know it's true, and I am grateful for them, but it's difficult.

Growing up I've always been soft, pretty obedient, and sensitive, simply meaning I cry easily. Whenever me and my mum gets into fights, I end up being the one breaking and crying because I'm that sensitive. There were two cases I vividly remember, one being me scribbling on the whiteboard downstairs about unhappy feelings, and my mum yelling at me to ""rub them off and bottle ur feelings, I don't need to know them"", and once where we were fighting and she yelled at me to ""kill myself, no one needs you in the family"". I admit I am overly sensitive, but when you're a twelve year old and you hear these, isn't it justifiable that you get hurt?

I also have two brothers who are both two years younger than me, and my mother dotes on them. Bias was clearly shown on a few notable occasions--(1) there's a mandatory exam in our country for 17 year olds, I scored 9As and 1B*, but received nothing but ""you could do better"". The coming year my brothers scored 9A (less A* than mine) and 1C, the other brother much worse, suddenly they are ""superhuman, intelligent, and the pride of the family"" and we went out for a celebratory dinner. I admit it may have been the way I worded things. When I scored that grade I went home and phrased it as ""my other friends got 10AS"", while my brothers phrased it as ""the test this year was really difficult"" - honestly the grades are modified against how challenging the test was, so difficulty of test doesn't affect test grade (2) I was appointed president of a dancing club, my mum responded really negatively, complaining that she had to fetch me to meetings and my grades were going to take a toll, (that was my first big accomplishment, not receiving validation and support really crushed me, and made me doubt my abilities), the next year my brothers got kicked out of their society, I pulled one in mine and he got vice president, suddenly we have a celebratory dinner and he's capable, has lots of friends, and a bright future. This hurt me the most. I accepted that I was a bother and fetching me to meetings and staying late to school was putting extra pressure on my mother, and then suddenly its different for my brothers?
** I love my brothers, and am proud of them. I try my best to not bring this up when my brothers are around because don't wanna invalidate them

I cry a lot, as I've said, and my mother always mocks me for it or sometimes uses this against me. ""learn how to take a joke"" - while joking about my weight (I'm 52kg at 161cm), my looks, my achievements (invalidating them). ""stop using tears for sympathy"" (but I cannot control it??) or when my friends are over she would say things like ""she's a crybaby/she can't take a joke/I don't know why you all are friends with her/when my friends praise me she'd go,"" oh you guys just don't know her well yet""-I cried once in response to that, which reinforced the ""oh she uses tears to make friends"" statement.

I honestly used to love her a lot, and wanted validation and support from her, a LOT. Although the paragraphs up to this point made her seem a really bad parent, sometimes she's not. She's really creative, really engaging, really smart, got to give that to her. She used to have sessions where she'd encourage us to explore our own interests and help us do mini research papers (I miss those times :"") I did an animal one and a mini encyclopedia on horses) She's also very sweet when she wants to be, and really goes out of her way to help you and support you. Etc I wanted a bolster once and she sewed one for me, my favourite color. Saw me struggling with dandruff and bought me dandruff shampoo.

But then you see. That's the problem. I get close to her and tell me all my plans and dreams and goals and vulnerabilities. And then suddenly she switches. When she's mean she uses all the things I say against me. I tell her about applying to this job (keep in mind this was my first venture, it was an mlm scheme, i met with the person in charge but obviously did not take up the offer), she supports me but later I find out she tells my brothers I'm ""stupid and naive"". That hurt. I looveee my dog. When were close I send her lots of pictures and cute things my dog does. When we're cool she responds with enthusiasm and sends pictures back, when we're fighting she threatens me with sending him away, which is really hurtful because I show you what gives me happiness and you respond by taking that away from me.

Besides this, when we argue, I admit I do get extra defensive and make no sense sometimes, but the way she argues is really manipulative to me. When she isn't on good terms with me, she treats the boys extra nice. I usually get quiet and just quit talking or interacting with her for days. She's smart enough to know that picking a fight with me outright would paint her as the bad person, so she focuses on intentionally hurting me instead. Once I ravished over a cute bear plushie my friend was making. She noticed and was like ""oh we can make one together"" in which I responded with enthusiasm. We fought later and the next day, when I was downstairs eating, she brought fabric, scissors and cotton near my line of sight, and CALLED my brothers down to make them with her. It hurt because I was the one who wanted it, and it was obvious she was doing this to make me feel unwanted. She does indeed do a great job in making me feel invincible when we're fighting, and many a time I feel unwanted, not belonging in the family, and isolated. It affects my relationship with my family too, sadly, now I really don't think I'm on very good terms with them. Even while I'm on the dinner table with everyone, she goes ""brother 1 and 2, take more fish"" loudly excluding me. Or just simply gives them extra food. Am I not part of the family?

When we fight directly, I feel like I'm constantly being gaslighted into feeling guilty about something I should never feel guilty about. We fight about unfairness, she tells me I overlook all the good things she's done for me, says I'm ungrateful and pessimistic and selfish. Selfish has since then been a characteristic she most often terms me as, going so far as to describe me to others as so. When I'm being loud and breaking down, angry and sad at the same time, she pretends to listen, which makes me share my vulnerabilities even more, and then says things like ""I think you have mental illness. Do you want me to take you to the mental hospital"" in a caring-sarcastic manner. She looks down on mental illnesses and mental health, often saying it's ""all in their heads, they're too weak to be happy"". As I study psychology, I oftentimes attempt educating her on it. I believe she now has a less negative view on it, but she uses the fact I am in therapy (I get free sessions) against me by telling relatives ""oh she has issues she's in therapy"" or loudly going ""oh she has a session later that's why she can't join us"" but in a way that makes me seem very weak and stupid. Not only that, I find her to be narcissistic as well (?). In fights she says stuff like ""no you are selfish"" ""you're so incredibly selfish that I don't think you derseve any money"" ""do you want me to cut your education? If not, shut up"" and when I try to reason and tell her what part of her behaviours I find uncomfortable, she goes ""your memory has issues? I think you're distorting everything that has happened"" ""I seriously think you have issues"", and then keeps repeating and phrases situations in a very manipulative manner that makes her seem like the victim-which she then posts to the family group. When she finds that she's losing or if i have a good counterargument, her response is - ""stop being defensive. Xxx (phrase naming her the victim). End of story"", then I can't reply to her or she will complain to my family that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but I just wanna explain my side of the story. 

Additionally, on my birthday I got loads of wishes and gifts. According to most of my friends, I'm optimistic and really really nice, pretty likeable, smart (my cgpa is around 3.9x/4), hardworking, with strong leadership skills. One friend made me a song, and I received many letters and a handmade bear plushie. The entire week my friends made an effort so every single day was filled with a new surprise. I got 3 or 4 cakes, excluding my families one, and my best friend surprised me with a sleepover in my house itself. On my birthday when I received all these I excitedly told my family, and my mum pulled me aside and said, and I quote ""you should really tone down on all these. You know your brothers do not get these gifts, you are going to make them feel undervalued and unloved"". Shock. What the fuck? It's my birthday?? It's honestly not my fault that I'm likeable and I get lots of birthday wishes? It's not my fault my friends are fucking awesome and willing to spend time and effort on me? It's not like my brothers do not have friends or the like, and I sewed them plushies and made them cards for their birthday because I also want them to feel appreciated. I just feel so goddamn hurt??

But I got to admit she can be really nice too, again. When my BFF planned the surprise to my house, she did it with my mum. And my mum was overall excited and enthusiastic about it. When my friends come over, she's really funny, confident, talkative, and friendly. No awkward moments. My friends absolutely love her. Which is also why I find it difficult to open up about this to my friends. It feels morally wrong to paint someone they all like in a bad light, so I just don't do it. I only go to one friend, who honestly told me she didn't really like the way my mum was treating me before I even told her anything. Because she already didn't like my mum, I find it comfortable going to her when I need to rant. It's liberating, but I only go to her when I really really need it. All the other times I usually just keep to myself.

I think my mother does an incredibly great job in making me feel useless, she says it herself ""you're useless and worthless, I'd rather spend my time and money on the boys"", she makes me feel like I don't belong, which happens to be what I'm feeling right now, manipulates the family into disliking me, coupled with the fact I am distancing myself from her and the family, because I don't want to cause drama within the family, makes me feel isolated because it seems they enjoy themselves more when I'm not there. Id like to think i try to understand her as much as I can. After school I take the transit to near my place so she doesn't have to go through the jam, when she fetches me back I get to the waiting area 3 minutes before she arrives otherwise she'll get mad at me for making her wait. I reach the transit at around 740, and wait 20 minutes for her to arrive to pick me. I'm alright with that because she's busy, I'm not the one who drives, and she's being more than nice to fetch me home. I genuinely believed in that, but recently (just this year I got my therapist), and I started to see lots of unfairness. My brothers get a ride home straight from school almost every single day, even though their school is really far from home, same with me. My mother reaches their school and WAITS for them, and doesn't mind it. On days they use public transport, they get a little upset with my mum, but my mum is apologetic. I realized how unfair it is. 

It used to happen less before the pandemic , because id spend most of my time in school nad reach home late, sometimes on purpose because I'm happier in school with my friends. My friends actually view me in a positive light, they support my dreams, and they enjoy me. My mother crushes my achievements. I can't forget the day I went home with a 3.98/4CGPA and she told me with a straight face, ""oh, what about the remaining 0.02"". I scored the highest for that batch of students. Honestly now that the pandemic has hit, everyone is forced to stay home 90% of the time. We have been fighting a lot. I disagree with lots of her views, she's very traditional and has the idea that women are weaker than men. And i really don't like it especially when she let's my brothers boss her around and seems to enjoy it? I don't like how that may affect and influence my brother to grow up with distorted views on gender. She's also extremely racist, and on these issue I tend to voice up against her.

I'm always initiating gifts. Mothers day gifts, birthday gifts. I'm always the one pushing my brothers to make them. I'm the director of personalized family gifts and I come up with the ideas. I don't ever feel like I get credit or am appreciated enough for it though. I've given up on individualized gifts entirely, she never likes me gifts. She loves the boys' ones. Soemtimes I spend money but she still doesn't like them. I feel very unloved. 

Currently we've been fighting a lot. My therapist has told me to distance myself from her, and the family if possible. It's difficult, part of me really loves them. Even though my therapist has basically told me it's a toxic situation, I can't help but feel unsure. Like if I'm just too sensitive, if I'm blowing it out of proportion, or maybe am I ungrateful or selfish or stupid and not worthy of love. It's breaking me and these nights I need imaginary friends to even feel happy and loved and fall asleep. I'm still stable to my real life friends only because I'm team leader in most assignments and many are counting on me. I also rarely show the negative sides of myself and conceal them quite a bit, hence I still joke around with them as though nothing is wrong. I feel suffocated. I want to move out but I have no stable income. I'm not even sure if I want to move out. The house is big. I just don't feel happy. Besides, the society I'm living in, children only move out at around 30 or when they get married. I don't think my family thinks it's a big deal. My parents are unwilling to drive me to work if I got a part time job, my mum threatens to take away my connection and data. I just don't want to see my family, I wish I could just disappear for a month. I honestly don't think I'm in the best mental health, but I don't know what to do. I can't cry or ill be seen as more weak and stupid. I can't just stay in my room or I'll be seen as selfish and unhelpful, which I already am perceived as anyway. I feel lonely because my parents have each other, my brothers have each other, but I don't really have anyone. I would hug my dog but I really don't want to be downstairs too much because my mother does and says lots of passive aggressive shit when she spots me. I can't actually voice call my friends or be too loud and happy because honestly my mum gets mad at it. She once saw me texting my friends when I was eating (I was eating dinner alone), and she got yelled at me, saying ""you spend all your free time texting but none helping out"", and ""if you want to be with your friends just leave the house"".??? All I did was come down and cook because I was hungry, and I was the only one at the dinner table so I find it okay that I text? Because of this I've turned my notification bell and vibrating off in fear she'll hear and get mad again. Honestly I do help out when she asks. She just tends to ask the boys to do stuff more, and they complain more while I just do stuff quietly so it may seem like I do nothing. I feel like she's trying her best to suck all energy out of me, and I hate it. I used to be really optimistic, happy, jumpy, excited, and full of energy and passion. I'm honestly very touchy and affectionate, hence the pandemic has really taken a toll on me, add on the family issue and you get bad mental health. My inner happiness and energy wants to burst out, but I'm afraid of expressing too much happiness. I don't ever want to give anyone power to use things that keep me sane against me anymore. I can't even journal because my mum has went thru them and gotten mad when I wrote negatively about her once. I'm coming here because they never use social media. And I want to talk to someone. Or have someone say something supportive. Whatever. 

I apologize deeply for the long post. Honestly just typing it out makes me feel so much better already. Lots of pent up frustration, anger, and sadness has been let out. I know it's partly my fault too tbh. I live in a relatively comfortable household, hence I enjoy a big room, lots of things I want I tend to get. Good food, and I'm more than grateful to be able to afford lots of things. I also acknowledge that I'm living in a household funded by my parents and are living off their expenses, not mine. In the future when I get a stable enough income I'll move out",08Nov2020,1
162,"I have CPTSD from CSA  and its effected me alot. I've been in therapy for 10+ years and honestly it's never really helped where career planning/jobs are concerned. My most recent therapist didnt want to discuss careers ""it is more a discussion for a career councilor"" and since moving I haven't been able to secure another (all are not taking on patients, thanks covid) 

I have had jobs since I was 15/16 but I wouldn't say they have ever been steady. I've been in most if them for a year or less. Most of them in vet medicine as a receptionist/admin or patient care. 

Both my parents are in veterinary medicine (my Dad is a veterinarian and my mom was Nurse/practice manager, now a veterinary business consultant). I did seriously consider going in to veterinary medicine or my medicine as my mind does work in that investigative way but I had 2 super sucky school experiences that ended up with me not caring and flunking out of a levels in the UK twice. I did finish my GCSEs which according to the universities is HS equivalent in the USA where I am now. 

The only job that I actually really loved was actually nothing to do with vet med. I was a sales operations executive in a wine company. I got that by saying I had a business degree I didn't have...but I should clarify, one of my favourite hobbies is studying along the course outline in universities, they publish everything so it's easy to actually just ""teach yourself"". So I was never flying blind or unable to do the work. Infact it was the opposite. I excelled. 

I was the youngest on a team of sales ops by about 10+ years- all with degrees and prior experience. My manager loved me- was really happy with my work. I got promoted to dealing with national accounts within 3 months of being there. I helped over 12 account managers manage the accounts of some of the biggest names in Hotels, Restaurants and pubs. (Radisson, Hilton, Gordon Ramsey, Jamie Oliver and over 200 pubs) I was good at doing it. I am good at solving complex issues in short amounts of time. -
 
But the company nearly went under. I jumped ship. At the time I couldn't afford not having a paycheck. I was the last hired and- even though they managed to secure a buyer and avoid administration, I couldn't risk it. 

Now that I'm in the US and covid happened I'm living with my mom, currently unemployed, and basically at rock bottom. Shes encouraged me to find my passion and been supportive of me going back to school.

I have no idea at all what to do... I am not stupid. I scored a 138 when I was 9 before we moved to the UK and the school here in the US wanted to send me to a gifted and talented school and said I was a candidate for mensa. I should be fucking smart enough to figure this out.

I hate the implication that if you don't have a piece of paper then you are ""stupid"". I hate my teachers for bullying me and destroying my confidence. 

I've considered everything from veterinary medicine, medicine (general practice or internist), densitry, lawyer (intellectual property) and finance. LOTS  of things in between and every time I think ""ah I finally got it"" I get this terrible feeling I'm not doing what's right or what will make me happy in the long run. I get this feeling like I'm not making the right choice and start second guessing. 

I've listed my strengths and weaknesses, I've made pro con lists for the careers themselves, I've looked at it from a cost perspective, and time perspective. I've even taken the myers briggs (INTJ) and ennagram test (5w6) to try and give myself of ""suitable careers"" to try and see if something sparked... and still... nothing. I know for a fact I HATE COMPUTERS that's it. 

Maybe I'm stupid after all? Is this just a quarter life crisis? I'm 24 I don't want to keep waking up in this house not accomplishing anything. I want to be dedicated, powerful and successful. I like helping people, I like problem solving, I need work to be fast paced and analytical. I like being that person that people are like ""thank you you helped so much"" or ""this is so effective how did you come up with this?""

 Black Friday is just around the corner and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to put together a list of essential items to find on sale. Hopefully I will be able to save some money on the bigger expense items 

So far I have the most obvious items that come to mind

**Kitchen**

\- basic set of cutlery

\- several bowls, plates, cups

\- large and small non stick pans + a medium sized pot (should take care of most recipes)

\- \~8'' chefs knife, 3'' fruit knife, several cutting boards ( i like polyethylene)

\- microwave, fridge, toaster oven

**Bath**

\- electric tooth brush

**Cleaning**

\- vacuum

\- laundry machine

**Bedroom:** will likely vary depending on each person. Most people should be set by just packing everything up from their existing room

I hope you guys can contribute to my list!",08Nov2020,1
167,"At the end of the last lockdown (so April), I found myself becoming friends with a guy who I've known for a while as he broke up with a distant friend and I knew he was alone. He's very much intertwined into my friendship group. I've found myself at a low point recently and since June he's pretty much all I think about. I've always said the reason I feel like this is because we're both going through break ups and this is just a coping mechanism rather than thinking I actually like him.

I could give you 10+ reasons as to why it wouldn't work. But apart of me really can't help but think there's something there...even if I risk my friendship. 

We became really close, we was my comfort when I moved cities. When I came home hes all I spoke to and called and now we've distanced. We spent the whole summer together. 

Now all I'm getting is mixed messages. He would never know I liked him because I've made such an effort to make sure he wouldn't


What do I do? Leave it and enjoy my new city (even though I'm home now because of rona) or shoot my shot?",08Nov2020,1
168,"Hello all, 

Im here seeking advice about my marijuana smoking habit. Ive been smoking weed for about 2 years, i mainly used it to relax and have a nice time. However during quarantine somewhere around august My usage increased a LOT, smoking nearly all day. For reference i used to smoke 2-3g in 4-6 weeks,  now i smoked 7g in 3 weeks. Part of this is because of quarantine. I have a part time job and currently looking for another as well to keep me occupied. I am feel extremely guilty and ashamed about smoking this much. However the thing that has me confused is that even tho im smoking more i am still getting all of my responsibilities done and i am actually going to sleep and waking up earlier. 

Should I be concerned?",08Nov2020,1

176,"i genuinely feel like i have bpd but i’m worried i won’t get the right diagnosis and then feeling embarrassed, itll make me completely shut down and never want to open up to people again. 

things i’ve noticed are explosive anger, especially over small things and it causes me physical pain sometimes where i feel so much heat in me and it makes me want to punch and throw things, i always end up taking it all out on my bf wirh mean words:(

i’ve always been very suicidal ever since i was 14, as-well as self harm, i never did it as habit it’s always periods of time where i’d do it depending on how i felt like one day i could be so down and hurt myself then the next couple weeks i’d just not do it, or i’d go 2 weeks doing it a few times a week and then stop for months? i also wrote a suicide note last year after my bf had broken up w me, i only knew him for 3 months but i was so attached.. i just know i can hit rock bottom soooo fast which is scary and it is a risk to my life. my boyfriend is the only thing keeping me here bc when i hit a bad point ik i’ve got him and i’d never do that while he’s with me. 

i have a major fear of abandonment where i’ll do anything to prevent someone from leaving, with my bf i will check his socials just incase, even though he’s the most loyal person i’ve ever met and talks to his friends only i always catch myself making up things in my head and i start believing it then i get bad anxiety about it. 

i always switch the way i feel toward people especially my friends, one minute i’ll love them and the next i’ll just hate them and think just shut up. 

i have some whack jealously when other people feel sad or suicidal, once a girl i knew attempted suicide and told my bf bc he asked why she’s in hospital, when he told me i got so angry and jealous and an urge to do it because it made me so mad, aswell as my friend who is depressed she always talks about how she suicidal and her parents have to be home all the time, she also self harmed the tiniest cuts and sent me a photo, it sent me into a panic attack and i got so angry i wanted to punch someone, now whenever my friends say she’s worried about her i get so mad i even said to my boyfriend that i’ll do it if any one mentions it because it makes me so mad. 

my boyfriend has also told me i have narcissistic traits but i always got so angry at him for saying that bc i didn’t believe that i thought it was just messed up if i had those traits but now it kind of makes sense.

i also get anxiety when people have a different tone, i start thinking oh god they hate me they don’t wanna be my friend anymore and with my boyfriend i get very emotional and start to cry and my anxiety increases.

i also feel like two completely different people, when i’m not somewhere i feel completely comfortable i feel so not me, as to when i’m home in my own space or with my boyfriend i feel like me, like i’ll be at school and feel like just someone else  and it makes me jusr completely hate myself, as to when i’m in a “safe zone” i guess where i feel me.

i also have a love hate relationship with myself too like one minute i’ll think i’m just the ugliest person and i don’t know what i actually look like bc one minute i feel skinny and pretty then i’ll feel so disgusting and ugly which causes me to go through periods of dieting or only eating one meal a day, then i’ll switch back to loving myself and eating again. idk it’s weird 

i’d write more but that should be enough, tell me what ur thoughts are plesee x",08Nov2020,1
178,"There's this professor I've had a crush on for about three years. I told him in the beginning. He said he was too old for me and also the professor. I think about him almost every day. I've had him for four classes.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I asked him if he had been attracted to a student and he said yes. I didn't ask who but I have a strong suspicion who it might be. A female student he's worked with for years who I'll call Lucy. I've wanted to know. Whenever he talks to an old student I think 'Is that her? Is that her? Is that her?' I do believe he would date a student. I heard a rumor that he went out with a student. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I went to his office during office hours to tell him about my weekend. He didn't mind. Before I could share my story, Lucy came in and he spent the next half hour talking to her. Ignored me. Didn't turn around or acknowledge me. By the time he finished talking, had to leave to teach a class. I cried in the bathroom. When I told him later that day that it bothered me and I cried he said he hadn't seen her in months. Lucy now works at the school. One time, in class he mentioned that someone who works at the school is ""dear to his heart."" He had pictures of her from a play he directed in his office, and pics of her on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Another time, he talked about how another female student had an eloquent face.

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believe if Lucy returned those feelings, he would date her.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I confront him about his feelings towards certain female students? I know he's going to say no. Even if he is attracted to Lucy he won't admit it.

&amp;#x200B;

181," TL;DR  
My dad  
\- enjoys hearing himself talk  
\- is unsanitary  
\- wants to one-up me, to be in control....and dismisses argument  
\- curses for the littlest of annoyances...things that he can't control or doesn't  


I want these behaviors to stop, but being as he's my dad that pays the bills and is currently letting me, a full grown adult, live at home rent-free- I'm hesitant to go and say it. My parents and I live together, though their marriage is a lot different then it was (neither of them wear their rings, to give you an idea), and my mom disagrees with some of his annoying behaviors but won't say anything anymore.   


I've told him to be more sanitary but he will not listen, as I've told him to cover his mouth and question if he really did wash his hands ( i still don't believe that he does it for 20 seconds as i've never seen him do it for this long).   


Little of our conversation is actually 'real.' The same remarks and what I consider to be stupid questions (Sees Me, with the tv on and under a blanket- ""are you watching a movie,"").   


His awareness has gone down too I think, along with some of his hearing (i think when his ears are pointed towards the subject, its somewhat better)  


He's inconsiderate. He doesn't seem to have much compassion or courteousness for me or my mom- it seems that he acts in his self interest (doesn't make a hearty dinner unless its to please my mom, whose personality is quiet to keep the peace, and when its just me and him- its usually ""get your own dinner"" or ""order out""). He'll do things that annoy both of us. Like slamming doors, when it's just SO easy to take 5 seconds to gently close it, and the response i get from him is, ""people don't think like that (to close doors gently).""   


Studying at home is a whole 'nother ball game too. I can't study when he's watching tv its too distracting for me and it's impossible for it to be turned down. When I go to another room, he's right next door in the next few minutes talking loudly on the phone.   


I am really trying to live with them and have even gone as far as to make conversation more interesting but holy hell is it difficult to clear my head to actually get things done when they're around.   


the response i keep getting is ""thats the deal with living with old people"" as implying they don't change for you. which is absurd, people can change no matter what age they are.   


On one side I'm sad that he's not the best version of himself that I think he could be. And also he's not a very good role model. 

On the other, I just want to one day point out all of the psychology and unconscious thought that fuels their behavior so they don't just shrug it off, and something actually changes.",08Nov2020,1
182,"i don’t really know how else to phrase it in the title, anyway
i met a friend on a subreddit about a year ago and we’ve been talking since, i’d say we get along and i’m pretty comfortable with them, but recently i’ve started to feel a bit scared/worried about them because of an experience that reminded me of some past-stuff (a sort of trauma)

so basically since the very early beginning of us talking, they would be all like “lov u”, *hugs*, *cuddles* and i thought it a bit odd as something to say to friends but i chalked it up as a cultural difference (they’re American, I’m not) 

i also haven’t ever had an actual friendship before, one where you talk often out of school etc, so i wasn’t even sure if it was cultural or just me being not-knowing, they also sometimes bring up that they’re in a lovey-dovey mood? again, maybe it’s just another word for feeling appreciative or something?

idk, i’m confused and i don’t want to bring this up to them first bc i’m scared of this topic

They've become annoying, they always ask for advice from us but then proceed to just flat out say ""No."". They put other people in our group down to make them self seem 'worse'.

Since then I’ve been working a bunch of temp jobs to pay the bills but I knew it was time to find a place I could stay at. One that offered a better pay than my last long-term job and also one with benefits (i.e. health care, 401k, etc.) , which I’ve never had before. I’m getting certified in dog training and grooming so I thought a job at a vet clinic would be good so I could learn a lot. I applied to several in my area and finally, about a month ago, I got an interview with one. The interview went extremely well and they had me come in to observe the clinic for a day to see the day-to-day operations, and finally after about a week I was offered a job there to cross train as both front desk and a vet assistant. 

The job is going to pay nearly twice what I made at my last long-term job and does offer health benefits and a 401k to full time employees. I’ve heard nothing but good things about working for this company and everyone there seemed really nice and fun to work with. They had me come in again to take photo copies of my drivers license and social security card and they ran a full background check which came back clean.

193,"I'm a little shaken up at the moment since some crazy things have just come out about my family. I apologize if I have forgotten any details, so feel free to ask for further clarification. 

So, a little backstory on my husband's side of the family; his father and mother had 3 children, my husband's older brother and my husband and his twin sister. His mother died when he was 5 years old, and his father remained unmarried for a long time. I myself was adopted at a young age, but reconnected with my birth mother about 2 years ago. In the meantime, I met my husband, and we married (duh). Due to a rough patch in our marriage, we both made the decision to open our relationship for a short time, and I became pregnant in this time. My husband and I decided to keep the baby and raise him, which all parties agreed on, and my husband adopted my son. We have since had other children of our own.

Here's where some family secrets really start tangling things and becoming shocking. A few months ago, we discovered that my husband's biological father is not the man who raised him, but rather his uncle! This was somewhat upsetting for the family, and just as things were starting to settle down from this revelation a new discovery was made: my birth mother and my husband's assumed father (biological uncle?) have gotten married. My husband and I were actually laughing at this, as the hilarity of being married as step-siblings just seemed to add a new level of crazy that we feel we have to laugh at to stay sane in our marriage. However, we recently became confused at where this leaves our children, specifically my son from outside of our marriage. Therefore, the question from the title comes in: is my son now my husband's step-nephew? Further, since I am now my husband's step-sister, and my husband adopted my son, does that make me the step-aunt of my own son? Or are we even considered stepsiblings, since his ""father"" is not his biological father?

Tl:Dr: My husband's ""father"" (biological uncle) married my birth mother; does that mean my biological son/husband's adopted son is now each of our's step-nephew?",08Nov2020,1
194,"Hi all, I’ve recently found myself in a bit of a tough spot because of something that happened a few days ago at school. I’m really anxious about it all and could use some words of advice. 
Two days ago around 12 at night I decided to take mushrooms in my dorm. I was doing them alone as my roomate/friend was asleep &amp; since they’re something I’ve done before, I felt comfortable doing them alone. It’s worth mentioning that my mental health has not been doing very well recently &amp; wanted to process my emotions while tripping. A few hours in, I grew anxious and panicked. I was also crying and unable to stop, so I got up to splash water on my face. When I got to the bathroom I got extremely light headed, turned as white as a piece of paper, was the most nauseous I’ve ever been and began to drip in sweat. Moments later my hearing and vision began to go and that’s when I knew I was going to pass out. 
Because I was worried about my safety and panicked mental state, I woke up my roommate who then got the RA. At that point i was sitting on the bathroom floor trying to throw up. I was also sobbing. When the RA came in I told her I had taken mushrooms, needed help and that I didn’t know how to go about seeking assistance for my mental health. It was an incredibly frightening experience for everyone involved. She then told me that she had to file a care report with the school explaining everything that happened, so I knew I’d be facing disciplinary consequences as a result of violating school rules. 
The next morning, I received an email indicating that I was charged with breaking school code by using drugs. They then told me that I would have an official hearing with a hearing officer (I think it’ll be my dean of students) in two weeks. According to the email, the point of the hearing is to have a conversation about the incident and get my side of the story. My question to you all is have you ever been in a similar position/know what this process is like? If I do end up getting expelled or asked to leave, are my chances of getting into another school completely fucked? I’m so mad at myself for letting this happen and potentially ruining my future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

195,"i need some genuine advice. i’m an 18 year old sophomore in college (young because i graduated high school early) and i’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 7 months now. i live at home due to covid, but was in the dorms last year. since moving back in i’ve had to deal with the minor annoyances of helicopter parents who literally say they are incapable of falling asleep until i get home from a night out with friends. (texting me throughout the night, i will respond to them to let them know where i’m at, what time i’ll be leaving, and when i’m home) i have to drive almost 45 minutes home, so they have a lot of issues with me being out late which is understandable, it’s definitely not safe to drive home if you are too tired. so on occasions where i have been more tired than expected, or for other extraneous reasons, i’ve asked if i can stay the night at my boyfriends place. understandably, the have been extremely hesitant but never gave me clear reasons or clear answers. so i never did because i’m an extremely obedient kid and respect the fact that i live in their home. however this has become more extreme, as me requesting to sleepover with a friend (girl) in the same area was denied and turned into a three hour lecture about how poorly behaved i am and i don’t respect them. obviously all the details are too much to explain in a reddit post, but it essentially boiled down to me saying that i understand where they are coming from, but don’t agree with their points. i expressed that i would continue to follow the rules they felt so strongly about out of obedience. my parents then proceeded to get even angrier then they already had been, and told me it wasn’t enough for me to be obedient, but i needed to change my values to match theirs and they couldn’t comprehend why i wasn’t. after me continuing to stand by my opinions, my mom asked if i was on drugs, basically. (i’m not) after these discussions, this one being the worst, i feel like i’m going crazy because i don’t know where all the extreme anger comes from and some of their arguments feel very manipulative to me. but i understand that i’m still a young adult and my opinion is only from my perspective. am i insane for feeling like this behaviour is too controlling ? if anyone needs me to elaborate on anything, i’m happy too. i just wanted this post to be as short as possible. please, i would really love some advice",08Nov2020,1

204,"I'm going to try to properly format this because this will probably become a text wall.

Overview: Going on to college in a little bit, already detached from high school life completely. Senioritis, but much more severe and earlier than it should come. Looking back on high school, a tad bit disappointed.

1) College Concerns: Worried that I will not get into my dream schools because my GPA/Test Scores are a tiny bit under what the average acceptance is. Despite having a holistically strong application, it is a tiny bit lacking on the academic side. Senior year is when I really got my shit together in terms of grades, and I am pretty annoyed at myself for not doing this earlier, as I cannot report what I am now achieving. (My GPA jumped from a 3.8 to a 4.2).  I feel as if I'm ready to abandon my video-game playing/minimal effort lifestyle that I took on in highschool, but worried that my past choices will hurt me. 

2) The real frustration comes in when I look back on what I did with my last 3 years in high school. I know that not everyone leads the partying lifestyle full of drama (and this ends up being a good thing),  but I really didn't do any of that stuff. Don't get me wrong, I had a great group of friends that I loved, but now since quarantine, I have sort of lost my interest in being with those friends. I still am friendly with all of them/hang out with them regularly but I have lost that feeling of really wanting to be with them. I now have 7-8 months of void between now and college, where quarantine is keeping me from interacting with new people, and I have lost interest in my old life. I still keep hanging out with them/playing video games because I don't know what else to do now, but it just makes me more depressed. 

3) Now for the inevitable teenage romance woes... I can't help but feel as if a girlfriend would be a help to all these issues. I know the whole debacle, the argument against girlfriends solving existential depression and whatnot, but hear me out here. While I am a virgin by all means, I have dated one person before, quite recently actually. I chose to end it because I felt horribly guilty about going through the motions not because I liked her, but because I wanted a girlfriend. This lingering guilt was the reason I never did anything with her, and I still give myself a pat on the back for not baiting both of us into something that wasn't genuine. However, that puts me back at square one, that being sad virgin. However, I am a \*particularly\* sad virgin because I'm here because of my own choice, if that makes any sense at all. If I wanted to take things forward and lose my virginity to that girl, I could have. Its a sense of intimacy and connection that's really been lacking from my now virtual life, and this makes me very sad, and it makes me start doubting my ability to make those connections in the first place. There's a group of (honors/socially awkward) kids I will occasionally go to parties with where there is the obvious intent to make some \*stuff\* happen, but we are all just too awkward for anything to happen between anyone. 

Anyone who has ever found themselves in a similar situation, or has any advice/comments at all, please help. Asking my parents for professional therapy, posting to reddit in the meantime. Really hit rock bottom, huh?",08Nov2020,1

206,I \[16m\] have had a crush on a girl since freshman year of high school but never have talked to her much. Ever since quarantine started I've been thinking about her a lot but she's from a very different social group that I have very few ties to (she also doesn't use social media). I feel like I won't see her again unless I do something because it's my junior year now and I take classes at my local college instead of my high school. I know and am friends with a few guys that go to the same church as her but I'm not sure how I could even use those connections to get in contact with her again (Without straight-up telling them I have a crush on her or heavily implying so).,08Nov2020,1

213,"Okay so here it goes, are you ready? I met this kid in 10 grade art class we were almost the only two emo kids in highschool this is was (2010 btw) anyway, so we had a lot in common. He played drums and it just so happened my boyfriends totally awesome screamo band needed a drummer (insert sarcasm on the totally awesome). Okay back to the story so we all got close in our last few years of highschool made memories under age drinking partying all that cool jazz. Friend joins Marines we lose contact for a while. A year or so later he messages me and wants to get break or whatever while he's on leave okay sure it's been forever dude. He go to breakfast he leaves again for where ever, fast forward we start talking and reminiscing the good ole days my life as seriously went down hill, I had went through very traumatic things in my life and was a homeless teenager living in my boyfriend's bedroom. He he really helped me out I really needed a friend my current best friend at the time wasn't always the best to me. But he was, he was always there for me to talk when is was feeling down and out about life and I was there for him when he wouldn't stand the military and everything going on in his life. We talked everyday never missed a day. Everyone accused us of sleeping together I have been with the say guy since 2008 and am in love with him. So I would never people just couldn't understand how two people of the opposite sex could be friends. But anyway I'm getting off track, my friend got out of the Marines and had no idea on where he was staying so me and my boyfriend turned out trailer into a two bedroom for him to come stay with us. Everything was okay he wasn't the best person to live with but we made it work and it was awesome to live with my best friend. Every weekend we'd all go out to the bar together or hangout and watch movies play videogames go out to dinner with our other friends, then he fell into financial troubles and moved out because he felt bad that he hasn't payed rent in a few months and we were also falling behind without his help. So he moves out and he still came over every weekend we sti had dinners with the friends every weekend and went to the bars and still talked to me. Okay if you stuck around this long bless your heart lol we are finally getting to the part where I need help! So he starts talking to this girl on tinder, sweet and innocent whatever, so she's in a with this this ""bad man"" and Im always telling him tell her to come over and ditch that guy, she can come over and hangout to get away from him apparently she was scared of him and that he was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards her, but she'd never come over. So my friend and her started seeing each other behind this guy's back for a while, she worked at a salon where I was trying to get a job but she made it very clear she didn't want me working there because she didn't want me to spill the secret that she was sleeping with him because her boyfriend's best friends wife worked there was well, I had also went to cosmetolot school with the manager and the wife so I knew them, I ended up turning the job down partly because of that reason. The girl and her boyfriend had a house together that apparently he tricked her into putting in his name and she couldn't get it out. Then the pandemic hit she started going to my friend's house and staying the night for days on end and him not talking much to me we would hangout and he had to be home by the time she wanted him home, so no more weekends over and staying the night. Eventually it turned to him not really taking to me or hanging out. Then our state got shut down and the family he was living with said that he wasn't allowed to hangout with me due to I was an essential worker and could have the virus. Okay I thought fair enough. She would send me snaps chats of them hanging out and what not they both got laid off during this and where together 24/7. he was able to come over for my birthday where we had plans to do what we did best, get ultimate plastered is what we called it. it ended up just be getting ultimate plastered and he acting like she was better than me all night and my friend not acting like him trueself. Then summer came and the state opened back up and he still wouldn't hangout with me, Me feeling some type of way messaged him and asked him why we never seen each other and he said oh well I can't just abandon her she's staying here with me and I'm not gonna leave her here to go hangout with you because she can't go home because the abusive now ex boyfriend lived in her house and couldn't go home and what not to evict him. And I, in my rage told him that I didn't feel sorry for her, looking back yeah it was kinda a dick move. The way I seen it was she slept around on her boyfriend made a tinder cheated on him and would stay at another guy's house all while this man supposedly beat her and she was terrified of him. I just couldn't understand it. I personally had never been in a situation like that so I didn't understand why she wouldn't just leave.  We had plans to all go to the drive in the night and she left and wouldn't say a work I told my friend she read the messages and he said no she wouldn't of done that, I assured him thats what happened. We went to the drive in she parked behind us and he gave her a coat and asked her to join us as soon as she heard my name she said nah I'm good and you can leave. I felt betrayed by my ""best friend"" I didn't care if she tagged along during a hangout I wanted us to be friends but there was always something there that she didn't like about me. Anyway so she seen the messages that I had sent to him and she half blocked me on Facebook. I was still her friend but couldn't see her postsand she never said why I figured she had read the messages sent to my friend and was mad at me. She then told my friend that the side how could have him. First of all HE WAS YOUR SIDE HOE! then apparently her ex boyfriend was singing the house over to her so all spring and summer he'd say it will be different when she doesn't live here anymore and can go home then we can hangout more. Then it turned to my friend wasn't allowed to hangout with me with her knowing so we hung out a few times with out her knowing. Then the birthday of my sister who had recently passed was here and since she's passed he's spent the day and night with me because of how sad I'd get and I called him crying begging him to come over and hangout with me until my boyfriend got home because I didn't want to be alone. He told me"" no, I can't abandon her. You know that, you'll be fine""  why don't you just say sorry to her you hurt her feelings. then I deleted him off all social media. I was hurt and upset. He didn't bat and eye nothing, he could careless. My other friend has seen him out to dinner with our other friends and her like we all used to do, and when his brothers birthday came up he invited me and I said im actually invited? And he said yeah she's gonna go stay with her family for the weekend. The next day I got a text saying she changed the weekend, my response so does that mean I'm uninvited? He then said oh I'm tired I'm gonna go to bed. Turned out yes I was uninvited as she was I all the snap chats and I was ignored all day and night. I wrote her a apology, not a good one. I told her that I was sorry for hurting her feeling but not sorry for what I said and that in sure she's sent messages to others not knowing that would of been read by the other person. I still try to hangout with him and talk to him he usually takes 2-5 hours to respond to a text and hangout is out of the question. I did go to breakfast with his mom and grandma where he told me that he can't say he's hanging out with me because she throws a fit. But other than that nothing. Me and his other friend that he grew up with and joined the Marines with FOUND HER ON TINDER!! she claimed it was to see if my friend still had his, even though her profile have a huge bio and like 10 pictures, he fell for it. Now my question is what do I do? I said rotten things that I can go back on and it's completely destroyed my relationship with my best friend. I'm so fucking sad every night because of this and I've told him that, but he doesn't care. Do I just delete him out of my life and move on ? Do I patch things up his girlfriend? I'm so lost.",08Nov2020,1
214,"I'm 16, have been friends with this guy for 10+ years, I've helped him alot and done alot with him; but all he does now is brush me off. TL;DR at bottom but I suggest reading please.

So my best friend (I'll call him Sean) has been incredibly weird lately and I feel like I don't even know him anymore. He got tired of playing video games so he stopped playing with me online (which is fine I see it as normal). But starting this year, he has just lied to me about being busy, denied it when I point out he lied, and just seems to avoid me constantly. He seems to have just focused only on texting with any girl he can now and acts so weird online and around people now. It's like he just tried to act in a way that he thinks would make girls like him but it's just so cringy fuck.

Anyways back on topic... This summer we planned on going golfing, playing soccer and tons of other stuff but not once did we do ANYTHING! Like every time I asked him he would say he's working or busy and then would post on social media that he just ditched me to hang out with other people and do what we planned to do! I'm just so fucking annoyed! Last week I asked him to come play poker with a gang of friends (*with masks on*) he told me he could, the a  couple hours before poker night starts he texts me saying he's busy with school work, but then he was hanging out with plenty of friends. He told me after that he would ""100% come this week"" but then again says he has school work... And guess what, AGAIN HE POSTS HIMSELF AT A PARTY! Like WHAT THE FUCK!

I don't know if it's just me, but this just seems like such an asshole thing to do. I've literally gotten depressed about this and cried before and I feel so alone. He's like my closest friend and it's like he doesn't even see me as a person anymore. I want to punch him in the face but hang out with him. He bought skis after I did just this week and hes planning on skiing with me alot but I don't even know if I can trust him anymore. I don't want to tell him to fuck off or befriend him yet because maybe he'll actually go skiing with me but I'm just so fucking annoyed and pissed off.

 I just need someone to talk to please, I'm really frustrated with this and I feel like I have no real friend anymore. I have others to talk to and hang out with bit I feel like I just lost a brother.

TL;DR
My 10+ brother-like friend has changed drastically and I feel he hates me. He lies about being busy and then blows off plans with me to hang out with other people and then posts it online. I feel very angry and disposable. We have plans to ski this winter so I don't want to get him to fuck off until then because I still have hope but I don't know if I should tell him how annoyed I am right now or not.",08Nov2020,1

223,"Hello Redditors, this is my first post! I’d just like to let you guys know some details before jumping right in.

I’m currently a student and am looking to work full-time over the summer. I start my job on the 11th of November. I have failed two pre-requisite courses due to Adhd medication not being available during my study time. During my time here in Sydney I was made homeless twice due to disagreements with my brother. He was constantly putting me in unavoidable positions, and whatever money I had was somehow being swept beneath me because his lifestyle was far too expensive (six year difference). We are best friends still, I understand that I don’t know how to say no to people I love. This puts me in horrible positions as I put them first over myself. 

I personally come from a really controlling family, who do try to help me (I see this); and I do appreciate their help, but so self righteous in their ways they fail to contextualize their methods with someone as different as me. I changed degrees after I realized who I was. That I wanted more for myself. 

So I moved out with no money! And thankfully centrelink has been paying my rent. I have avoided paying for food just by not eating and drinking water and coffee. This pushed me to find a job. Currently really happy, I live in a great new place with wonderful roommates! 

I was able to somehow survive the past couple of weeks. This is my question. As my course sequence requires these two courses (I have a double degree and I have no electives) I would like to do it over the summer. I want to save for a car, for food and put myself in a good financial position. The position is full-time and is minimum wage, (I would like to make maximum $4000 a month). It is an 8am-5pm job, which leaves room from 6pm -10pm. It is potentially six days a week. Can these two courses be fit in this extremely busy schedule? I would like to do 5 days, and then weekends is study time. I also want to hit the gym minimum for one hour a day. 

Is this possible? Or am I spreading myself too thin and potentially setting myself for failure?",08Nov2020,1

I’ve always been a depressed kid who wanted to die and I still am but the idea that my friends and people I really care about might die makes me literally shiver.

225,"My husband’s wife became his ex-wife after she “had a vision from God” that she should have an affair with her Crossfit coach. Predictably, her heaven-arranged marriage didn’t work out, so she recently found a new sucker.

He is entirely unaware of a few things:

1. That she had a 10-month affair, openly and vindictively, after she was caught
2. That she tried to have an affair with my husband’s brother for 8 of their 10-year marriage
3. That she sent people to the house to hurt her ex and burned his picture in front of the kids
4. That she was sexually, verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive for the entirety of her 10-year marriage

This new guy is a pushover - nice, sweet, and apparently incurious about her divorce. He is just like my husband (her ex) in all the ways she hated the first time around, and 100% will be abused and cheated on. She’s still in contact with her affair partner, so I’d argue she’s cheating on him already.

He hired a dating coach this year to help him build up enough confidence to start dating... and he found her. She will suck him dry, heart and soul.

Is it any of our business? Do we tell him? Do we say anything at all? Do we keep pretending things are fine between us and her when they pop by the house occasionally?

Honestly, I know it’s none of our business, but he’s going to be blindsided. It’s like sending a desperate-to-be-loved meek puppy into an abusive home, knowing you could’ve maybe prevented the inevitable. It’s keeping me up at night. Advice, please?",08Nov2020,1
226,"Last year I had some really, really good friends who actually cared about me. I ended up going to a different high school as them for no real reason other than that my cousin had gone to this school so I thought, why not. My older brother was also already going to this school and I figured I would be able to make new friends.

Turns out, I’m having a hard time. I definitely have a few friends and I’ve made a few connections. There are fulfilling aspects to my life. But overall it just feels like I’m carrying around a dead weight every day. Without my friends I constantly feel like something very, very important and heavy is missing from my life. 

I recently went to my old friend’s house and I hung out with maybe 6 other people I had gone to school with before I left. It was awesome. We hung out and laughed and talked and it was so easy to vibe with them. I realized just how much I was missing out on. I was going to a different school for no real reason (other than that my brother was going), and in going to this school I had instilled in my life some sort of constant anxiety and insecurity. In going to my old friend’s house I remembered just how safe and secure I used to feel and it highlighted just how scared and wavering I am at this new school.

I have the decision of switching to the high school all my friends are going to. But I genuinely don’t know. The only reason I want to switch is because of the overwhelming emptiness I’m feeling; in other aspects, this school I’m going to is perfectly fine. Sometimes it feels nice. So what if I end up switching schools, and it’s a lot worse than I anticipated? What if I switch and realize what a mess I’d gotten myself into by just deciding to switch for my friends?

These people genuinely mean so much to me. But when I’m at the school with them, will it really be worth it? Will it be worth it to have to get notes from others and study things I’ve missed (overachiever) and essentially have to rewire my whole mindset, as well as get into a new schedule,  even as I don’t know for sure that I’ll actually enjoy being with my old friends as much as I had anticipated? Is it right that I risk everything?

I don’t have an actual problem with the way my life is now. I’m doing okay on friends even if my situation is a bit iffy. But I just miss my old friends so much. I’m realizing that I have this incredible gaping hole in my life and it’s weighing me down so much. I cry every night because of what I think I’m missing out on, because of what I could be experiencing. Instead of feeling carefree and secure, I’m heavily troubled and anxiety-ridden. And the thing is, the thought of just leaving this school is a very freeing thought. I feel very little to no disappointment at the people I would be leaving behind. I’ve experienced happiness here but these people have made almost no impression on me. I would easily trade everything I have now to be back with my old friends. Why is there no magic at this new school? Why does everything seem bland and unremarkable?

So, should I suck it up? I know I certainly have the potential, even the guarantee to make more friends here at this school. I can be happy, and I wouldn’t have to take a huge risk or have to study the whole curriculum again. But school, for me, is my whole life; I have the genuine potential to improve my life drastically and be actually, truly happy. I could really feel alive again. What do you guys think?",08Nov2020,1
227,"Okay, so starting off; I'm pretty introverted and I just started actually talking and trying to connect with other adults so I apologize if anything I'm asking sounds either obvious or self-explanatory.

I was working tonight with one of my managers, and  she brought one of her friends to our store to hang out while we close. At first I was really worried that it would be a huge distraction to us, especially because we were already behind from the night before.
About two hours after her friend arrived, a guy she had invited to hang out with her had also arrived, he's In his mid 30s and is actually pretty cool from what I could get from the 2 hours of talking to him about deep thoughts and life, he said he was new to the area and he wanted me to show him around the city, I thought he was a pretty cool guy...
Anyway, he asked if it was alright to exchange numbers and of course I had no reason to refuse so I happily gave him my number, I think he'd be a really cool friend to hang out with; but the only thing that keeps repeating in my head is that I'm 18, and from being around other adults in that age group, they have completely different interests, and I guess I'm really only worried about if it's a good idea to really associate myself with such an older person and their group because of my age and my personal experience with people in that specific age group.

This really puts a lot on my mental because I've never been faced with a decision like this before, but I feel I'm ready to step out my own little bubble and grow up, any spare lights of wisdom anyone could spare to help light the way of someone transitioning into adulthood?",08Nov2020,1

I'm 26M from Australia

I'll make my story short. I live in Australia. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression that has prevented me from moving into a 'real' job, hurt my studies and motivation. It led me down a path of alcohol addiction and doing a lot of things I am not proud of. My family are supporting me on my path to recovery and I am planning to return to study. I was recently accepted in an Honours program for a psychology degree. Now that I'm getting treated I want to put my life back together and meet some great people.

I've also never slept with anyone because of this anxiety and fear of judgement. So I am still a virgin.

Hobbies include: Films and TV, heavy metal music, history, working out at the gym, psychology, US politics, art, trying different foods, occasional video games, atheism, writing, bushwalks, most things horror-related.

Not expecting much, but would love to at least talk to anyone. Please message me if you would like to chat. Have a good day.",08Nov2020,1
229,"Sometimes my boyfriend is so full of himself. He is so good at it, that everytime I try to reach out and help him through his episodes, he always find a way to make me feel bad about it. He makes me feel like I am worthless and that I am not trying enough. The mere fact that he doesn't need anyone else just gives him the pleasure to push people away.  He is definitely the spitting definition of selfish. But I love him and I still want this to work.

He used to hit us (bruised and bleeding type) we we were kids and now he just shouts and curses at us everyday. I can't leave our house yet because I have nowhere to go and I'm too mentally unstable (I experience psychosis and paranoia from time to time) to get a job. I'm trying to a good psychiatrist and used my saved money for treatment. 

There's a lot more else he did that produced us mentally unstable siblings but I won't go into that. I've been hiding in my room and I've ready confronted him with his actions. That just resulted into a verbal whipping. My mom and siblings are too tired fighting him but I just can't stomach to follow his f*cking whims.

231,"   So basically, I like this guy who I’d consider myself pretty good friends with. At first, we just had some mutuals, but over quarantine, we started talking a lot more and getting really close. We’d stay up calling until 7 am, have REALLY deep convos and give each other advice, and it was a whole vibe :’ )
    That is, until my friend, youssef, who knows I like him, tried to push him in the right direction. One night when my crush was talking about how badly he wanted a girlfriend, youssef told him that the two of us seemed very comfortable around each other and that we confide in each other a lot, so why not give that a try?
     Youssef told me he didn’t really give a direct answer; he just said he’d take some time to think about it but he really didn’t wanna date until college (this doesn’t make sense because he literally talks about how he wants a girlfriend all the time AKSHAKA I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND MEN). 
     But today I went to a party and he was there, and we had a pretty great time. But after I left, youssef told me that my crush had a talk with him about how he felt like the two of us were getting too close and he doesn’t want it to become romantic so he feels like he needs some distance so that doesn’t happen. He apparently acknowledges I did nothing wrong but he feels uncomfortable talking to me because the idea of the two of us being in a relationship does not align with what he sees, and yet he can't stop thinking about it. He said even though he talks to me it doesn't feel right anymore.
     So I’m kinda crushed !!! Like of course I understand if he needs to distance himself it that’s what’s best for him, even if it hurts me. But literally the fact that he’s afraid of it becoming romantic means he thinks it could and to me it just feels like he’s fighting it :( I don’t know what to do because I like this kid more than anything and even if I can’t have him in a romantic way, I don’t wanna lose our friendship because of this since that’s all I have left. I just really hope he communicates this with me directly instead of having to find out about it through my friends. Any advice on what I should do?",08Nov2020,1

The first time this happened a month ago, but it happened again tonight. As I was heading inside shortly after I realized he was doing this again, he positioned himself at an angle that would take better photos and seemed to snap several shots, I’m guessing between 5-10 individual pictures.

I’ve known Ben since we were really little so I couldn’t have just left him there and he was obviously panicked because he was drunk and high, so I left my house and went to pick him up. When I get there he says two other girls need a ride to get to his house where another friend was waiting for them outside. This friend was gonna take all 3 of them to their house. He then told me they were drunk but they honestly looked fine when they got in so I was like alright but they were giggly. Then like 20 mins later one of them pukes and tried to pretend like she didn’t and kept saying sue didn’t puke, but it was all over here, and she was obviously not okay so I tried to help her and said it was fine but she was really embarrassed and just started grabbing things in my car to clean it up. I told her to stop and that I would take care of it later but she was just so out of it and wasn’t listening. I dropped them off at his house and told him they looked really scared. He said he was super high and didn’t know what to do. I told him to get their friend or even their parents but that I was leaving and that I needed to clean my car now.

243,"Going to preface this by saying I have a lot of my own issues, and I tend to spiral and overthink things, so overall that's why I'm seeking other viewpoints from people disconnected from the situation so i can get a kick in the head with some reality, because frankly getting other people's opinions provide me with a much greater source of information to deal with things. Dunno why, I just don't do well figuring things out on my own(also apologies if this gets a bit rambly here and there).

To the point, kinda, I pretty much have two friends, both of which moved pretty damn far away to different places maybe two years ago? One I talk to regularly, or enough that we still chat without any problems. The other, though, idk, different story, situation. She and I met in high school, rode the bus together, lived in the same neighbourhood, we'd talk almost every day. That, understandably, changed when she moved about a thousand miles away. Kind of hard to keep up a friendship that far away, personally. 

Used to be fine, but things change, people change, circumstances change. I have my own issues I'm dealing with one day at a time in my life, and so is she. For a while things were fine, but lately she just doesn't respond to my messages, doesn't reach out. Sees them, just doesn't say anything. However, she still makes random posts on IG, posts stories and shit, even likes my art posts here and there, but again she doesn't do more than that. 

I'm assuming she's just having a rough time, and she won't let me help, even though I've listened to her when she's upset. We've talked about a bunch of stuff, so not sure why now she wouldn't reach out in that case. Unless, somehow, I managed to do something that upset her, but then she wouldn't even interact with me on another platform, right?

So, I'm just unsure what to do about this? I'm not one for confrontation, nor do I feel like that'd be appropriate here, and tbh I just don't do ""acquaintance"" kind of friendships where it's basically non-existent until they want it to be something(unless it's one with someone I'm friendly with, but never really interacted with too much enough to be upset by them doing something like this). I'm really fucking bad at dealing with this kind of stuff, as I assume might be noticed in this, so I just don't really know where to go with this. 

Feel free to ask me to elaborate anything if it'll help, and thanks in advance for the viewpoints of anyone willing to offer them.",08Nov2020,1
244,"Okay, before I start the actual post, I just wanna say: I love my parents so much. When I started buying clothes before my kindergarten year started in the fall of 2011, they allowed me to buy girl clothes, because that's what I wanted to wear. They don't tell me to make ""guy friends"", and let me remain friends with only girls. When I told them I feel like I may be trans, they said they accepted me and would even give me HRT if I felt I really was trans.

I'd also like to give a particularly huge shoutout to my mom. Her family history involves people from all over Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe, and as such, I've been exposed to nearly every culture in those areas. I celebrate both Christmas and Hanukkah, regularly eat cuisine and engage in traditions from Arabia, sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, Scandinavia, Russia, the Caucuses, Israel, and eastern Europe, and even engage in Buddhist meditation and yoga with my mom. It's amazing.

But sometimes I worry they're spoiling me. I'm 15, and still call my parents mommy and daddy. They still give me toys and stuffies on birthdays and holidays. In fact, on my 15th birthday (June 12), my mom bought me an 8 foot teddy bear.

Now, I have a job at Target. I can function in a regular school. And I have plans to live on my own and hold a job. (Ideally, I'd like to be a historian, but realistically, I'll probably be a math teacher like my paternal grandad when he lived in Toronto lol).

I don’t want him rejecting my requests without asking his boss. I want to receive a decision directly from management.  I tried Google, but I can't find their email or phone number. He keeps refusing to provide me their  email or phone with many excuses. 

1. He says their multi-billionaire corporation won't change clauses for small businessmen like me. Contacting management will be useless. Even if I do, they would say the same things like him and reject my request. Management will be offended if I contact them directly, because I'm expected to deal with leasing officer,  not them.

2. He says  management will think he did a bad job if I  contact management. He says he might be punished or get fired if I do.

3. He makes me feel bad. He says he can't do much about these onerous clauses. Escalating means I don't trust him. He says most tenants don't escalate. He'll be offended if I do.  But he's right — I DON'T trust him.  I have no way to confirm that management indeed rejected my requests, or if he forwarded them to management. I don't trust him to have done so! Why would he spend time to do it, when he knows ***I'm a little guy with no bargaining power***?

4\. Current Tenant hasn't delivered vacant possession of the premises. Officer says current Tenant will leave shortly, but he refuses to say date.

5\. If Landlord can't handover premises on the agreed commencement date (1 February 2021) for whatever reason, the Landlord is entitled to postpone the commencement by at most 9 months by written notice. But Landlord is entitled to demand me to take earlier possession at any time, by giving me 5 business days written notice. Tenant shall have no claim whatsoever against Landlord.

9 months postponement is TOO onerous.  I requested shorter postponement...2 months. Honestly even 2 months is onerous, but I'm trying to strike a happy medium. If Landlord can't handover by 1 April 2021, I got to look at other commercial leases to continue my business. I can't stop business for months! Customers will hate me or go away!

I am in a really weird situation and could use some advice. I met my boyfriend almost a decade ago and we have been in a long distance relationship. We know marriage is on the cards in the future, and we’ve talked a lot about where we would live after marriage. During our relationship I did a degree in his country and I fell in love with the culture, vibes and lifestyle there, and he has visited me in my country and has grown very fond of it. Our conclusion is that when we are still newlyweds we would live in my country (or move to another country if there were good job opportunities), but ultimately settle in his country when we wanted to have kids. I am 100% happy with this decision as I love that country and miss it constantly. 

Now here is the hard part. I have a family member that I have discussed this plan with, and it feels like every time we talk about it she is always determined in saying that we will settle in the country I am in currently living in. If I even bring up moving, she shuts it down and says that I will be making a big mistake and that if something were to happen between me and my boyfriend or with his family I’d be alone. The thing is, while I would be sad to be leaving my family and friends behind, I’m perfectly happy with settling long term in my boyfriend’s country  and being with his family (who are great people.)

So tonight we were watching a movie and we planned on going drinking with some friends. I wasn't sure if the friends liked me so I asked him ""Do they liked me?"" He said ""Yeah man they love you."" So I ended up buying a full bottle. 

While we were watching the movie he kept texting on his phone every now and then. I know this usually means he's gonna leave me later on. So the friends we were gonna hang out with canceled and so I was like ""Fuckkk I really wanted to drink tonight."" and he was like "" I know same."" So I said ""Well why dont we drink then?"" And he was like ""Im down."" So he walked across the street to get some drinks for us to mix it with. He got mango and mixed it and immediately felt a reaction in his stomach. So he went to the restroom, when he came out he said ""Yoo idk if my stomach can handle it."" He said it in a tone that meant he was going to go home. So I knew where this was going, this has happened multiple times in the past. I went along with it and showed how sad it made me because it did. He left and turned off his location on snapchat and I knew it. I snapchatted him and gave him signs that I knew. He then said ""Oh im at \_\_\_\_\_\_'s house incase I throw up loud, don't want my parents to hear me."" I know he knows I know. But if I bring it up he will try to say ""I dont have to tell you what i'm doing."" and I would say ""I know but why did you feel the need to lie to me."" He'll defend his lie until I look crazy and then I have to apologize. I DO A LOT like an INCREDIBLE amount of things for him. I work hard for his friendship only to be lied to a lot sometimes. We also plan on moving in together cause we really do get along great, its hoenstly just the lying. I'm in pain rn crying at home and he is further trying to make it seem like he is at home. I called him twice and he won't answer. I know he's partying without me and maybe its me but i dont get why. I don't get why at all when I dont party much. I feel like shit I feel so low. I feel horrible. But I honestly can't go on without being his friend, he is my best friend and I would do anything for him. I hate myself so much I hate myself.",08Nov2020,1
259,"I have this guy friend and he’s one of the kindest people I know. He’s so easy to talk to, loves all things wrestling and karate, and he tends to bring up his mother a lot. He lives with his grandmother and I’m nearly positive that his mother took her own life when he was younger. I can tell he misses her more than anything. Does anyone have advice on how to talk to him about her without being insensitive? Like she sounds lovely and I’m not sure if asking about what she was like would hurt him.

260,"I am a 37 year old man who loves anime. I have a teenage son who we will call J. He recently bought a German shepherd. Last week I had a night all myself with the dog.
  My son was at his friends house. My wife who we will call S was having a girls night. The dog is named Dan by the way. So I saw Dan in the living room his tail was wagging. I got a massive boner. It was the biggest one I've ever had. A week later I've been hiding what occured.

261,"I grew up in a flea infested dumpster / litterbox of a home and was beaten by my older sister til 11 when she moved out. I also stopped seeing my abusive dad at 11. The next 3 years I realized that my mother had mental health issues that were reflected through the homes condition so I ran away to my friends house the last day of my freshman year. 

I was forced to return home 4 months later to the same conditions and i ended up meeting someone online who took me when I was 16 telling my parents that I was allowed to rent a room. He’s like a dad sometimes but other times he just doesn’t care. He told me to go fuck myself tonight when I asked if he brushed his teeth and then walked away (I just turned 18). He’s been distanced from me since I turned 18. I’m guessing this is probably over soon and he won’t let me stay for college.

I’m either thinking of killing myself because I have nothing left to live for anyways or living in a tent in the woods til I starve to death. I know a great spot too for both. I don’t know why I’m even posting this to be honest maybe my subconscious wants somebody to try and stop me, that’s my best guess anyways but I just really wish I had been born into a real family like all my friends were. They have no idea how good they have it :) please love your family everyone even if you argue sometimes. Also if your parents truly love you, cherish the years you have left with them. 

I really hope you all figure out this pandemic thing. Good luck :)",08Nov2020,1

263,"So, my girlfriend and I broke up a while back, decided to get back into the game. Downloaded Tinder and so far it’s been decent...anyways I matched with a girl today whose a mindfuck. Usually I’m pretty good at spotting fakes or scams but I can’t get a read on her. 

It goes like this...I asked her if I could take her out on a date, she said okay sure why not then proceeded to send me her snapchat. *But the snapchat account is under a different name than tinder profile. First red flag. I asked her about that she didn’t answer, then she asked me if I wanted her onlyfans lol and she sent me her condo address in Toronto. At no point did she desperately try to force me to come over or anything and she talks normal...or else I would have known something is up forsure. I asked her if she wants do something tomorrow and she told me shes going away until Wednesday but I should hit her up then. I thought she may be an escort from her pictures, she denied it, but admitted to an onlyfans account. Second redflag is that her condo building is known citywide for airbnbs. Basically Im wondering if I should ever actually meet this chick? Is she just weird because shes on onlyfans or am I going to get robbed at gunpoint if I go over to her place lol cus not gonna lie....im curious.",08Nov2020,1

266,"So... all of my social media profiles are private. I only add my friends or family who KNOW me and know how I am. 

My husband’s (who I have been with for almost 10 yrs)  family would always try to add me and every time I would let him know he would tell me to just add them. I would explain I don’t really want to because I do use my social media as an outlet and say what’s one my mind and I don’t want to have to censor myself just so they can see a picture here and there. After a few years they started randomly mentioning their still pending friend requests to him and instead of explaining what I had told him to them, he got on ME for still not adding them. So I finally did. 

I hardly talk to any of them on FB or Insta. They are kind of just there and I forget they are there most of the time. 

Well, with the latest political circus that has been going on I found myself getting more and more heated about it. And my posts definitely reflected that. I’m not proud of it but I can’t take back two things I said. 
I fell into the hole of all this bull crap and said “I do not want to be friends or family with someone who can support this person” I also said in a post “eff you if you vote for this person.” Not my finest hour. I know this. 

So, This was months ago. 

My husband just a few days ago told me how I have caused tension in his family because I have insulted his brother’s wife’s parents. And now his wife doesn’t want to really have us at their house because though she isn’t a supporter of the person I dislike, she is a supporter of her parents and I hurt them. 

I 1. Completely forgot his brothers wife’s mother was a friend of mine. 2. Would never want to hurt this person as she has always been kind to me and I actually really like her. 3. Do understand everyone has different beliefs and everyone has a right to vote for who they want to. And 4. Made a human, emotionally driven mistake that i am aware of but can’t take back. This has been one of the worst years of my life and this definitely added fuel to my fire and i 100% regret my words and regret letting everything get to me and not having clarity. 

I just don’t know what to do. He was told not to tell me but he did “months later” and they haven’t said anything to me so I can’t have a conversation about it or apologize without throwing my husband under the bus for spilling the beans to me. 

Do I leave it alone? Just wait till that day comes? I feel awful for hurting my husband and would never want to drive a wedge between us and his family. 

I don’t know. Maybe this isn’t the right place to post or I shouldn’t have posted at all",08Nov2020,1
267,"I met my crush around 5 years ago in school, we were put in the same class for 3 years straight but we never really talked much but I still liked her. On the 3rd year of being in the same class was when we started to become close friends we talked everyday than the next year she moved half way across the world. We started to drift and havent sent each other a message since and only recently back in May 2020 we started to talk again but this time we became closer and closer and in August was when I realised that I loved her and thought she was the one but I knew she didnt feel the same way so i kept it to myself. Mid October I started to think of her every single day for the whole day, it started to ruin my school life so I decided I had to confess to her. So I did and to no surprise she rejected me, she said I was one of the closest guy friends she has ever had.

From kindergarten to fifth grade, I was always in a class with J. We shared the same bus ride to and from school, were in a few extracurriculars together, so we were pretty much always near each other. For some reason or none at all, I absolutely hated her guts. I thought she was annoying, too sensitive, always complaining about one thing or another. Not that it wasn't true, it was, it was just the way I treated her because of it that makes me feel bad that others have to share the same air as me. Everytime she spoke, touched or did anything I would make her feel like absolute crap without realizing it. As I stated before, we were pretty much always around each other, so it was a lot. I don't think I ever went out of my way to hurt them emotionally or physically ( I didn't touch her as a way of teasing her. ), I don't think I even realized how awful I was being. Now that I do, I don't know how to proceed? I don't know how to apologize, when to apologize or if I even should? I don't know right now if it would be for her or for me?

Hey guys, I never post or use reddit and don't expect much of reaction on this post, but at this point it would feel better just to tell someone. So with that out of the way here's my story.

I've been with my gf for 5 years now, she is my high school sweet heart. She and I have never had issues with loyalty or cheating which is why I am struggling so much with this. I left for Army Infantry OSUT in late September, I came back in January. She was acting strange so after 3 weeks of being back I broke and asked what had happened. She said she was ok, so I was ok.

But I asked if she had ever done anything with anyone else and that if she did to simply tell me and it would be forgiven, I'm just a sap like that I guess. But she maintained she had never done anything with words or physically except for one friend that tried making a moving with her while I was gone. She broke down into tears telling me this, and I reassured her that it was no big deal, that I love her and its okay because she didn't do anything. She said he came onto her and that she rebuked it and had him drive her home and that he didn't talk to him after that. (this took place in Februaryish)

But I just couldn't believe it. I had to know the truth, so when she was sleeping I looked in her phone. I wish I didn't. She had sections of conversations with him deleted and the stuff she didn't pitted me. Texts going along the lines of

Him: Wow sorry, Also I love you

Her: Oh its okay, I love you too.

The next day:  
Him: Helllllloooo I miss you!  
Her: Aweeee I miss you too honey bun!

Honey bun is what she calls me.

There's big portions of the text conversations missing too, looks like she just deleted the part that got really cheaty.

So reddit, I just don't know what to do. Do I say something to her? Am I going crazy and blowing this out of proportion?

Please, please help me Reddit.",08Nov2020,1

273,"Background information

Where to begin 

January 1, 2020 

I made some New Year’s Revolution‘s That I I really wanted to accomplish in 2020. 

Some of them include...

Getting fit 

Being more open

Putting myself out there and trying new things

Learning to play guitar 

Improving skills reading/writing 

Giving up soda for a year

Etc. 

I had a very good start I was working out every day, And I joined my schools lacrosse team, And even though There Was friendship ending drama in my circle of friends I would say I was being More open and met a few people. I lost 20 pounds in around two months Which I was very happy about because at that point I had an on going Losing battle with my weight that lasted over a year that was initially caused by bullying. Around mid January to mid February (can’t quite remember when) Me and my small inner group of friends Decided to work out as a group Only me and one other took it seriously but every morning at 4:30 we worked out until it was time to get ready for school at about 530 to 545. Two  others That I was becoming friends with at this time Also we’re working out and one day after a few arguments we decided to have a competition between my group and  their group  At the time I thought this was a good idea to get everyone to train really hard, and I thought it be nice to have both of my Group of friends to socialize together. But do to The drama that my friend group was going through at the time my friend Who I was working at with And my friend that was on the other group Got into a big fight And Other dramas I found myself split in the middle of these two groups that we’re fighting and despite my best effort‘s to stay In the middle I felt like I was forced to pick a side Because I Felt betrayed by the one group four assuming I was on the other side and attacking me plus I felt that the side that I ended up taking was in the right. Months of drama also made  me feel ostracized from my original group And that also caused me to pick the side that I did. After weeks of petty arguments and  fights that almost resulted in Full on brawls, Nothing serious ended up happening because right when  I thought The a real fight would happen Our  school Went into a “ temporary two week quarantine” there’s more to this that I will get to later in the year.

Now with lacrosse even though I knew nobody, I knew nothing about lacrosse, and I was probably one of  the most out of shape people there, I trained  my hardest to become good  and to fit in on the team, I will slowly making progress and was was starting to talk to some other players. But I was also feeling that I’m not ready four the season keep in mind everything before this was simply practice before the season started, I also live in a very competitive town sports wise, and was there out of shape first year lacrosse player, I was also physically exhausted from the long practices and working out every day. I think I cursed myself on the bus ride back to the school the last day of practice before we went to quarantine I said to myself this is gonna be the last time I do this (I still liked it but I was exhausted mentally because of all the drama and physically because of all the exercise) after that last practice I never did anything relating to lacrosse in the last seven months due to the pandemic canceling the season. Up to this point all of my goals were going well, I was quickly getting in shape I was opening up and trying new things, And I was finally part of something real. 

March 2020 

When my school announced that we will be going into quarantine for two weeks a part of me was excited to have a break, a  time to refresh and then get back into it, A month past with my progress obviously slowed but I was still trying after another month It was announced that we would be in quarantine until fall. At this point I basically Stopped, I stopped working out, I stopped dieting, I stopped practicing guitar, And really have no choice but to stop trying new things and being open When  put in isolation. May to September Was really just a big boring uneventful blur. Starting September school is still virtual but I started this program where I’m taking four classes at  my high school and then going to a tech school I was unsure I still am unsure if this was the right Decision But I loved it because for the first time since March I felt like I was learning something I was making progress and I was a part of something real. I’ve been making friends And just started getting back into working out But still had many other problems. Today I found out that the school is going to be going full virtual for an unknown amount of time. And it’s different at the school because for what I was doing you really can’t do it virtually.

Advice I’m looking for... 

I’ve gained weight And this time I can’t seem to motivate myself to exercise/diet like I did very successfully last time. Where that fitness competition story couples back in to play is that recently I have reconnected with those old friends and we started a round two of this competition. 

I’m mentally exhausted Of not doing anything  and not progressing as a person at all. And not just because of quarantine but in every aspect I feel stuck and like I need something new. Up to this point The only goal That I’ve succeeded at so far is not drinking soda for a year. 


I feel like I can’t get my message across but I don’t know how to word it I think I rambled too much in this and I Will try to post it again tomorrow something more clear and concise but if anyone knows what I mean I’m feeling stuck and wanting to become a new person maybe they’ll get it.",08Nov2020,1

I've (23F) been with my partner (25M) for 4 years now (2 years friendship and 2 years dating). We're also never-mets but we've seriously been the best of friends and great partners to each other. We plan to meet March 2021. We've had our ups and downs but we've always made it through. 

Recently however, since we've been much closer to talking about closing the distance, things are getting shaky. He's never really had many bills but now since he's moved to a new State, searching for a job and realizing the bills he might have I found it necessary to bring it up... Also because I don't work and have very little saved up so I unfortunately can't help much in that department.

After I brought it up, he started thinking over it and mentioned he had never thought of it before but now it's a potential possibility. I could tell that the thought saddened him but he also mentioned he sees other couples in relationships as well as other women and it hurts him even more because he notices them more than he should. That coupled with him mentioning that we could not make it if he can't financially afford us makes me feel very restless in this relationship. I'm starting to wonder if he really wants to make us work or if he's questioning us. I'm a very anxious person so it's hard for me to sometimes have an unbiased opinion.

Is this conversation normal? Are there any red flags that I'm not seeing? I'm worried.",08Nov2020,1

Essentially making up her own sentence out of the words I used.  And what she says literally ends up being untrue/false, but there are not any witnesses to determine that lol.

281,"
I  [F 24] purchased my first home about 5months ago in the town I grew up in and haven’t had any issues until now, and I’m not sure how to proceed if the current situation continues or ramps up. 

Last night I ended up calling the cops because a suspicious vehicle pulled into my driveway, tried to drive into my back yard, then ended up parking next to my car and turned off their lights. The driver started rummaging through his back seat and was acting very strange. My boyfriend works nights and most of the time I’m home alone, so I decided to call the cops as I wasn’t sure of the driver’s intentions. When cops showed up, the suspicious driver yelled at the cops and refused to leave at first. He yelled for about 10 minutes before the cop came to talk to me. 

I spoke to the cop and it turns out it’s the boyfriend of my neighbor who rents out the apartment across the street. I know nothing about these neighbors and have never spoken to them. The cop was told that the driver and his gf got in a fight and he parked at my house because he was mad. I told the cop I didn’t want him on the property, as the cop said the guy was pretty aggressive. So after 5 more minutes of the neighbor’s bf yelling at the cop, the bf goes across the street and parks in his gf’s driveway with his lights pointed at my house. The cop leaves and the guy and his gf are laughing and mocking me across the street about having the cops called on him for “just parking in a driveway”(which is confusing, since he told the cop they had gotten in a big fight...). I didn’t speak to him directly - it’s just what I heard him say while my window was open. He then started to honk his horn over and over at 3am for a minute or so straight before stopping. I was too exhausted to do anything so I just went to sleep. 

Now today while my bf was home sleeping and I was at work, someone kept knocking on the door and running. I have no proof it was the neighbor, but it is odd timing for it to happen after last night’s events. I know it’s not a big deal but it still freaks me out a bit. I’ve ordered a camera for security but I am fearful of things escalating since I am home alone at night so often. 

Now, my previous landlord’s father is the one who rents out the apartment to my neighbors. We’re on good terms and I’ve heard my old landlords father is nice as well. My question is that if the neighbors behavior continues/escalates, is it wrong to contact their landlord and let him know of his tenants behavior? Or is that inappropriate? I wouldn’t be doing it right now - I just want to know in case the neighbors behavior escalates into something dangerous. 

TL;DR:
Called the cops on a suspicious car in my driveway late at night - turned out to be my neighbor’s bf who is quite aggressive who parked there because he was mad at his gf. I do not know the neighbors at all. I fear that he may be spiteful and harass me in the future because I called the cops on him. I am home alone at night so I am a bit scared. If the neighbor’s bf ends up continuing his behavior, would it be appropriate to talk to their landlord about his tenant, or is that crossing the line?

Thank you to anyone who can give me some insight with this!",08Nov2020,1
282,"TL:DR  I met some new friends due to me being depressed and wanting to be social. I let my best friend meet my new friends I hand recently met and he has hanged out with them way more and without me being invited. Even tho it was to help him get out of his depression and be social it has made me feel worst.

So my friend I’ve known and met in high school , we have gone through a lot growing up and we’ve helped each other like homelessness, depression and financial issues. I had a serious betrayal from someone who i thought was a close friend (28F) and I ended up broke  and heartbroken (platonically) because of them. Third friend to lose my trust and throw it all in my face.
I was forced to live with my best friend and his ex-gf until I got my own place and it made me very depressed and defensive. After a while his ex of a few years broke up with him. So me and my best friend moved in together. We have been through depression because of our own issues and we’ve tried to coupe together with our issues. 
I’m we have both wanted to get out more meet more people  but due to COVID of course we can’t and just stay home. But recently after being at a new job for a few months, I got to know a coworker (21F) and we became cool friends to where we both started snap chatting each other (platonically). Eventually we both finally met up, just us two and her roommates. I thought the roommates were cool and I wanted to hang out with them more. one of them asked about my best friend, about how he is like and we decided to all hang out for the weekend. 
The roommates met my best friend and were kind of interested in his history due to us being complete opposite personality. He is abit awkward and shy but opens up when you get to know him. I am more open and more straight forward but I was still defensive about certain things.
Eventually found out one of my new friends, liked him so they started snap chatting. soon my best friend started talking to all of them and he went over to hang out with one of them at their apartment one night. I thought “ oh cool he’s being a lot more social and he might fine someone who can keep his mind off of his ex”. eventually found out one day after he went out for dinner with a co worker of his. my co worker/friend told me, my best friend had stopped by her house because her roommates invited him. I joked about it and poked fun of him being the “star” and i got a cold respond back that did hurt abit. Now this has become the 3rd or 4th time that I’m getting the cold shoulder. I also finally found out that all the times my roommate has going out was to hang out with them. 

So should I be jealous? I met and grew an interest in getting to know these new friends was due to past drama and having a history of having shitty BFs and GFs (Bi) that I needed to just make friends, socialize and be happy. The co worker I became friends with had opened up to me so I told them more about myself, feeling as she wasn’t a bad person and I could meet actual generous people. Me showing them my roommate was to help him make his own friends and ease him into being social and going out. Him being included into things with my friends was so he can go out and do more on his own, he has done abit by himself  but not as much as I try to so I wanted to help him out.",08Nov2020,1
283,"Hello , I’m 18 years old and just moved out of my moms house to live with a buddy of mine and it’s not like I was living in a toxic home or anything I just thought it would be the “adult” thing to do and thought it’d be really good for me. I’ve been working since I was 15 &amp; up until a few months after corona I quit my job at Whataburger to work from
Home and after about 4 months I stopped and took a break to chase my dream which was Being a YouTuber/Twitch Streamer. After saving enough money I had a full setup and gained 300 followers within my first month. Then I decided to move and now I work a full time job while doing school full time as well and honestly I just feel like I’m digging myself in a hole. My roommate has a side hustle you could say so he doesn’t work as hard as me at all and I guess that gets to me a bit and I just feel really alone and unmotivated To do anything anymore. I have no time to stream and when I do I procrastinate on doing my school work then by the time I finish it’s time to go to sleep and get back to work. I’m a really smart person but have no interest whatsoever in school right now and I just feel like I’m trapping myself in the system that they want me in so I don’t chase my dreams and it’s like I know what I need to do in order to chase my dreams but I just don’t do it and I don’t know why.",08Nov2020,1

I just stay in my desk thinking about so many things, looking for new ideas and projects and I just can’t. I end up so frustrated I end up hurting myself with a cutter. The cuts are not deep and I don’t bleed, I just end up with scratches. I have done it  3 times in this month.

286,"
TLDR; I had been with a man who was physically and emotionally abusive, but I was able to leave mid-last year. Despite it being over a year later, I still get upset/angry/scared when thinking about the abuse I had gone through. 

I had started dating this man like January 2018, we were about the same age (23M&amp;F). Around December 2018 is when I began seeing the red flags -- which I for some stupid reason decided to ignore. Several months followed of him hurting me, hitting me, strangling me, pulling my hair out, throwing things at me, telling me I was stupid and ugly, but also the reasons why he cheats on me -- when he would be slightly inconvenienced by both me or external factors (work, family, etc.). I also later found that he had stolen money from me and used my credit cards without my consent -- making it so i was in a real awkward financial position at some point. He used to justify his actions by stating ""thats just how he is"" or ""I'm just going to have to deal with his temper"". It carried out several more months, but I was able to break it off in August/September of last year. It really was me just going ghost and ignoring/hiding from him (we didn't live together to give some context).

After the breakup, I spent some time alone. Trying to aid my mild depression on my own -- while still tending to my other responsibilities. Not gonna lie, it was HARD -- but I began feeling myself again. I started dating one of my long-time close friends around the beginning of this year. Things have been going great with him -- he's caring, respectful, fun to be around, and just genuinely a wonderful person.  I couldn't ask for a better partner. 

However I noticed since the beginning of quarantine that sometimes there are things that trigger scared/angry feelings that remind me of my ex and the abuse. Very off-the-wall things like checking my credit score (knowing it had been affected by my ex taking money from me), discussing mental/physical abuse with my friends or current partner, seeing old photos of my bruised face/body, I sometimes have horrible yet realistic dreams about him that result in me waking myself up to cry. These are just a few examples. I don't feel like I let this situation weigh down anything I do and I'm able to function normally every day, but I can't understand why I still get so upset, scared, or triggered by these things several times a month. It makes me feel like I'm not 100% comfortable with myself or moved on from the situation. I'm just not sure what I should do to help with stopping these feelings -- do you all have any thoughts about this behavior, or advice to give about moving forward? Thanks for reading.",08Nov2020,1
287,"I cant do math. im 20 years old and ever since ive had my work in school graded, ive failed math. I look at numbers and they genuinley do not make sense. You could explain the process of a simple division problem multiple times, my brain just cant process it.

288,"So let me be real. I need some advice on my social life. I grew up around a group of friends, and as a kid I was always...a fool. I was selfish, fake, cringey, a snowflake, always in some phase of fandom (fnaf, undertale, etc.) and everybody looked down on me for that.

I also had severe allergies and was snorting every 10 seconds, making my voice weak. I never showered or bathed, and I would fake it because I hated baths for some reason. I would smell TERRIBLE and also wear the same shirt everywhere I went. I wore that down to a rag. My pants were torn at the bottom, and if I was laying down you could see my genitals. My parents tried their damn best to help me, and then I went through a depression phase (which thankfully I’m out of). They got me a little help, which didn’t do anything, because looking back I wasn’t even depressed.

I couldn’t ask for better parents, but do you think they did a good job just letting me act depressed and not get help for this listening problem?

My house is the central part of my group of like 20 families. I’ve known these people ever since birth, and now we’re having parties in my yard despite covid, and I’ve been avoiding them for 2 years. My parents tell me about how they always wonder where I am, and I struggle to hear them say “everyone loves you” and “they always ask where you are.” 

I’ve had a severe listening problem my whole life. It really gets me angry every time I think about it. My parents, teacher, anybody gives me basic directions, I wouldn’t be able to listen. I don’t know what my problem is. I would get punished for never listening, and I have a little trauma from all the times I would be yelled at (yes, yelled at, that’s how much of a snowflake I was) 

I never got any help for my supposed “depression” and ever since covid, I haven’t left the house in 8 months so I can’t see anybody. Today, I still have fears of my past. I’m always around everybody I’ve known my whole life, and I’ve never met anybody new (seriously) they know how much of a snowflake I was, I need help. I know it’s wrong not seeing them, but, fuck, I’m crying right now man. I can’t live like this. 

Today, I have very low self esteem. My ego lies and tells me I do personal development courses, but I only get the information and don’t apply it. I still lie, but always feel terrible after. I’m afraid I’m still the way I used to be, because I still smell terrible (because my family can’t afford good soap or anything good for a skincare routine) and my face is riddled with acne. I recently shaved my head to try and get a new haircut, but now I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. 

Throughout this pandemic, my sleep schedule has been fucking me up big time. I still can’t think straight. If I still get yelled at, or called out on my listening problem, it fucks me up big time. I spend like a week down in the dumps afterwards because of who I used to be. I seriously need advice on what I should do now.",08Nov2020,1
289,"I honestly don’t even know where to begin. My sister has suffered from repercussions of a trauma and she’s been diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression. She is also on meds for her increased paranoia, anxiety, and depression. In the last 4/5 days she has expressed to me that she thinks that each and every person has a special connection with god and that can manifest in 6 different ways (I don’t remember what ways she said) but she said that the way she feels that she is connected to god is the fact that she feels really connected with the energy around her. This includes being able to send and incense smoke to go pin straight and getting a feeling/surge of energy that feels like something bad is going to happen and then something bad does happen. An example of the something bad happening thing that she told me was that she was hanging out with someone from Tinder and she had a sudden feeling that something bad was gonna happen and the guy got a phone call like 30 seconds later saying his aunt, who practically raised him, passed away. It was one thing for her to express it to me as her sister, but today she starting telling my grandparents, my cousins, and even our brother’s gf. It was just so weird to me that she is so serious about this and is even telling multiple family members. We grew up semi religious (grandparents were orthodox but our parents were more chill) and in middle school she wasn’t really religious at all, so this has all come a surprise to me. I am all for being spiritual and being connected with the energy around us, but the way she talks about it sounds is irrational and borderline psychotic. I am on here to figure out if I am blowing it out of proportion or if this is a topic I need to explore further. I plan on asking her later today in a way that makes it sound like I’m just genuinely curious - which I am, I just don’t want her to feel like I think she’s just plain crazy - I don’t, I just don’t know what to do/support her/help her do what’s best for herself.",08Nov2020,1
290,"Hi! So... this feeling very uncomfortable for me to write and I’m really just kinda shocked. So I’m bi, I’m very open about it. And He knew going In to our relationship (one year in October) that I was and I was quite vocal. I knew tho that he had some more conservative views than me, who is very much aligned with liberal views and beliefs. So today we were having a conversation where my partner tells me that he purposefully used the wrong pronouns for a non- binary person. I immediately told him that’s not cool and explained why. Added that he didn’t have to like it but it gave nothing to respect someone. He responded saying that they were trying to take away his rights to use he/ him/ mister titles. I explained that they simply want to be recognized and accepted. I am cis, I do not truly know but I tried to explain to the best of my abilities. He mumbled something about there only be two genders and that it was a mental illness anyway. I said no it’s not. He said that everyone in the community has a mental illness or we were to convinced as children to need to be different. I expressed that this was not at all true and that it undermined not only my  experiences but perpetuated a false narrative that we are somehow broken or less than. He said well no not you you act “normal” I talking the rest of them. He then continued on about not wanted to have kids and the he would rather die than have a child that was non-binary. He has said little comments like “ I wish you were straight” or “ hope you don’t leave me for a women” ( which I have not taken lightly what so ever) at the very very beginning of our relationship and then this out of nowhere. He then said he had to go to work in the morning and had to go to bed. I didn’t disagree but rather said we will continue with this tomorrow. I just don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to tear apart everything he was raised on however I don’t know if I can live with the fact that he admitted he wishes he could change a whole aspect of me. Not only that, but the simple fact that he is not willing to even try to look form my perspective when I have made multiple attempts to see from his. Is there anything I can say?

298,"Hey guys,

Well, I just got an email from Flickr saying that I need to delete or download my thousands of images from the last five years that I had backed up there or they will be auto deleted. So, naturally, I decided to download and preserve them. 

Well, I started going through them and what a realisation I had. 7.5 months ago, I joined the Navy, something I wanted to do for years at the age of 23. I have only been out of intensive training for about 4 weeks and haven't had any personal time before then - even to think.

I was in a relationship from the beginning of 2017 until March this year, it was long distance (Melbourne to Netherlands) and we REALLY loved each other and he was perfect for me and I for him. I think that we were in a slow motion break up for about 6 months - but not out of not loving each other. We were both going into work and emerging from University. I think me joining the Navy was the straw that broke the camel's back. It pushed us both into a sudden and inescapable realisation that we couldn't spend 3 months a year twice a year in each others countries'. Professional work just doesn't allow for that.

I messaged him a couple of weeks ago and asked for his new address for a christmas card and asked if he wanted to stay in touch. He said he had moved on, but would be happy to talk occasionally. I agreed and thought that was reasonable, but he also gave me his address for a card.

The photos made me realise that since I joined, I haven't thought about being single at all. ALL I can think about now is the good times and it's breaking my heart. The last four weeks is all I have had to actually think about being single and it's almost 8 months after the fact.I want to send him a christmas card, it will be the first christmas in 3 years where we won't be together but I know he has moved on. I can't help but think he has moved on because he has had time to process it and I am worried that I haven't moved on because I haven't.

I want answers, but I don't know how to ask for them and I don't know if I should ask for them. We didn't break up out of malice, we were both in tears when we broke up and I think I have had two conversations with him since and the worst part is that I know I still love him.

What do you think I should do people of reddit? Send him a Christmas card or don't? If I do should I keep it simple or include another note to him asking him some questions? Or should I just send him a message and ask him the questions over WhatsApp?

The last thing I want to do is upset him. I know he could never have lived in Australia and followed his passion and I remember one of the last things I said to him was that I would rather him not be with me and happy than him be with me and miserable.

I loved him so much and I need some advice to give me clarity to see through all this BS in front of me - I can't go think through this alone.",08Nov2020,1
299,"So to explain ive had this conversation a couple times with my dad where he says even now during a damn pandemic that i need to go out more.

Other times id go to a friends house on a weekend maybe and thats it. but most weeks id just be at home and only go out for uni classes and then return home immedietly after. Im introverted i dont like being out or doing thins i dont want to when theres no reason for me to do them. Its not like i have no friends and i also have a gf ive been seeing since the beginning of this year 

Since the pandemic hit ive basically been in my room except to eat or go out with my girlfirend on weekends iim a gamer and a college student so im in my room for my classes and for when i game but he cant seem to ccomprehend that me going out for a walk and sun is just boring and meaningless to me, he mphasizes alot of the sun but i take vitamin d supplements and dolt like being out in the sun since its so hot where i live. 

Im perfectly happy with how i am right now till i finish my degree but he keeps saying im in too much when especially now theres really nowhere to go thats safe and wont put me and the rest of my family at risk of getting infected so i just opt to stay in except for saturdays when i go out with my gf

I got in an online argument a couple of days ago with someone on Instagram. I did say some stuff that was rude, but they were way worse, and I ended up blocking them. I didn’t say anything that could get me in trouble with the law or with my school

Then tonight, I get a bunch of screenshots from this random account, claiming to be the person who was harassing me a couple days ago. I looked through the screenshots, and shockingly enough, I find a screenshot of my Facebook page (it was in my linktree in my Facebook bio since I use it solely for professional purposes), and a DM that looked like it came from my IG account. I kid you not, it had a horrific message there that looked like it was from me, but I DID NOT WRITE IT

The person claimed they would send it to my school if I didn’t apologise to them. I said no, because I wasn’t going to apologise for a fabricated DM. That is bullshit, especially over something as silly as an online argument, something I never thought would go this far. Y’all I’m lowkey fearing for my safety and I’m not 100% sure what to do.

After weeks without contact, she returned to the hotel and resumed her work.

Only just yesterday, she wanted to print out papers using the hotel PC from her thumbdrive. When I noticed what she printed was fake Medical Certificates, i immediately called it out on her by saying that its wrong and it goes against the law. 

She only smirked and scoffed as I tried to advice her, saying that this is the only way to make fast cash. I just told her that she would end up behind bars if she were to get caught to which she replied that the students who bought them will be in trouble, not her.

Whats more crazy is that she used a name from a legitimate clinic and a general doctor in the MCs and she charges each MC about 25-50$ per piece.

315,"So I’ve suffered from depression and was having a really hard time with my life. Then one day I learned about the effects of not getting enough sleep, and been practicing getting sufficient sleep ever since.

It’s scary but it feels like my depression just.. disappeared. I can do house chores and homework again and was in a better place. I couldn’t believe it.

Anyways my friend is in a similar place and I want her to get a good sleep schedule too since I know she’s not sleeping well. But I know how irritating it is when someone tells you to “just sleep/just exercise” and I know even the simplest of things can be hard for someone facing mental illnesses. It feels like there’s no cure. And I also know that it won’t solve everything but it really helps. 

So how do I actually tell/make her to get good sleep?",08Nov2020,1
316,"This is going to be long!

A little backstory into my situation. I am (23F) very passionate about my career, I fought to pursue it and I am pretty good at it too. The problem - my parents don't let me pursue it to the fullest limits because they like having me under their control. They worry constantly that if I'm let to my own devices, I will stray far away from them and there's nothing they could do to bring me back. I was never let to do my job to the fullest as my parents want me to come home every few months and the city I was working was far away for me to take leaves and travel every three months. 

Now due to covid, they made me come home and made me quit the job too. 7 months of joblessness and I'm going crazy. Did some freelance online but it was something completely different from my career path. My home town has very less, very mediocre opportunities for my stream of work. 

With their controlling behaviour, I always wanted to stay far away from home. Now that I'm home, my parents have started looking for guys to get me married and I'm absolutely not interested in marriage. I have constantly voiced it out but it has gone to deaf ears and I am for now sucking it up and staying at home. 

At this point, I am considering a business plan to set up in my hometown, with barely any or minimum investment. I never liked starting a business because I was worried that I'll be stuck here and my opportunities to leave town will get out of my hand. I also believed that business is a lot of work. 

I have with me a perfect business plan now. Minimum investment, minimum effort, but a lot of potential. The only reason I am considering business is because after 3-6 months, I can hand it over to my parents or appoint someone to pursue my career and I will have constant revenue coming from the business. It will be set in my hometown but can cater to customers from anywhere. Since its minimum investment, there's almost nothing I lose except maybe time. 

I am worried though, that maybe after 6 months, the business will still need my constant support and I will lose any opportunity to leave town for my career. I am worried that I'm giving more time and opportunity for my parents to take complete control of me and emotionally manipulate me into getting married, because its the right thing to do according to them. 

Should I go ahead with my splendid business plan? Or should I just leave town and pursue my career asap (which I have no clue when)?",08Nov2020,1
317,"I’m exhausted right now so please excuse any errors. 

I’ve had nightmares recently. Most of them are fuzzy and undefined, but they were of fires and loneliness. My most recent dream was vivid and clear, and also in 1st person (Most of my dreams are 3rd person). 

I kept seeing this terrifying girl walking through our house, and a fireman walking through the walls. In the dream, it was called “the end times” like the biblical event, except it didn’t follow that.

I’m sitting alone right now and utterly terrified. I never had nightmares as a kid so I don’t really know how to deal with them.

I have NEVER been caught cheating or cheated on a paper in college. This is the first incident I have ever had and i am seriously stressing my self out. Early in the semester for this specific class we had to write a paper (same length) and I did it just fine with no incident. I am hoping because he has seen me do this assignment fine before he will be lenient and just fail me for the paper and not the class. I’m scared because I don’t know what will happen.

This is at a community college btw. I have already told my teacher what happened and hopefully at the very worst he will just fail me on the assignment but I’m not sure at this point..

Like I don’t mean sex, just a thing where we cuddle and all that shit but there’s no feelings involved. It’s the only way I can describe it.

But like, she doesn’t wanna be in a Relationship with anyone rn, which is like, idk I think that’s good for me. But we’ve also had a Rocky relationship and she can be a difficult person sometimes so aksing straight up like, “hey can I come over and cuddle some time” just woudlnt work. 

She doesn’t like being touched as it is, I’m not sure why but I can understand it, so like, I just dk what to do. I can’t get rid of the feeling cause I’ve had it for like a month now of just, trying to figure out if it’s a crush or not.

323,"    I don’t know if this is the right place to post this kind of thing... just minutes ago I had  an experience that felt off and I don’t really know what to make of it. It is nearly 10pm and I am sitting on my bed, on my phone. My bedroom has windows that look out onto the sidewalk. While the neighborhood I’m in has a good bit of “walkers”, I live in a pretty small city, so it’s still kind of rare to see anyone walking at night. 
    My curtains were mostly closed, only open enough for someone (who is really looking) to see the back of my head. I start to here a conversation happening on the sidewalk. I then here a super high pitched whistle, the kind that is clearly meant to get someone’s attention. I turn around and see the very vague outline of a man and a woman. 
    The man starts waving at me as to get me to come outside. A lot of my close friends live down the street from me, and sometimes knock on the window to get my attention. I assumed this was one of those times. I squint at them, though I can’t see them very well they resemble my close friend and her boyfriend. 
    I run out to open the door but quickly realize it isn’t them. I ask “who is that I can’t see you?” I am met with an unfamiliar, older voice, and he asks what I’m doing. I can now see it is a man that must be in at least his 50’s, and a much younger girl, probably in her very early 20’s. During the interaction that follows, the girl never speaks a word. I tell him I am doing nothing, and ask something along the lines of “can I help you..?” 
    I go halfway back in the door and make it pretty clear that I am confused and a bit startled. The man either does not catch on or doesn’t care, and repeatedly asks “what are you doing?” “Are you partying?” I tell him no, and he continues to ask things along the lines of no one in your house is up to any fun right now? In a way that suggested he wanted to come in and party, I think.     
    After I grow more firm in my responses, he tells me he lives down the street and asks what I’m doing for Christmas. In a very confused state I tell him I don’t know. He says “well I’m gonna have to come over during Christmas to party with y’all!” This entire time he uses “with you” and with y’all” interchangeably, even though there’s no way he knows who else I live with nor does he know if they are there or not. 
    My house is with two other girls around my age, I am 19, my roommates are 20 and 21. We don’t have people over often, especially considering we are in a pandemic... so there is absolutely no reason for this man to deem our house some sort of “party house”. I tell him “well I’d have to invite you before you did that”. I finally end the conversation, shut the door, and they leave. I don’t think either the man or young woman were on hard drugs or drunk.. at least it did not seem that way. 
     I felt very confused the whole time why a stranger would feel comfortable calling someone out there bedroom at 9:30pm. I still can’t tell if being creeped out is warranted or not. One of my roommates left for the night so it is just me and one other young girl sleeping in our house tonight. Should I feel unsafe or does this just sound like an awkward guy that wanted to be  friendly to his neighbors?",08Nov2020,1

She says she has anxiety an introvert and has autism (though she has never been diagnosed)so that was the reason why she would snap at me if we spent to much time together. But, I never said I was completely innocent and have apologized if I ever unintentionally crossed boundaries. She never respected mine witch was lighten up on the teasesing becuse it becomes a bit much.She vented to the school gossip after a fight and called me a slut even though she denied it to friends and said she was mildly apologetic. She wrote me a VERY long letter and sent it to me over discord about how much she hates me and cant stand me even though she would actively come over during quarantine to walk and ask me to walk her dogs with her. And admitted in the letter that she lied and did call me those horrible things. Because of her threat towards me I told her that of she threatened to hurt me again I would go to the police. At the end of her letter she said the police couldn't do anything and I was the most self-centerd toxic person shes ever had to deal with.She made me feel worthless and constantly put me down yet I'm feeling guilty over a one year relationship.

I have had a lisp for my whole life and I have worked with therapists for my whole life to try and solve my problem to no success

I have always wanted to do YouTube but my lisp has stopped me every time I try to hit upload because I fear that no one cares and that it’s annoying to listen to me

329," (TEEN) He knows I smoke weed at least twice a month  and now he wants  to try it with some boy he’s been talking to for about a month or so they had met somewhere I can’t remember, they’re the same age though.He had told me  he wants to try weed with me when we had a sleepover a week ago but I wouldn’t let him.This was like two weeks ago. Anyways I’m going with him to smoke.The problem is the boy lives 35 minutes away and my best friend is in love with him so he wants to finally hang out. He keeps promising my best friend that he will come to our town but there’s always excuses although they are valid. We don’t even really have a way to get to where the boy lives.I’ve talked to my best friend about four times about how weed could trigger their mental illness more because they’ve already been in the mental hospital for self harming. Before I became a regular weed smoker my first experience with it  at 12 caused me to have panic disorder for about a year; I was on anxiety medication. I have told my best friend that and they then say say they’re in a good headspace, which they are— I can confirm. I don’t want to be the reason why my best friend might go into psychosis or develop another mental illness,I feel like if he hadn’t known I smoke weed then he really wouldn’t want to try it. Second of all, I don’t wanna feel like I’m responsible (for lack of a better word)for allowing my best friend to smoke weed  35 minutes away from home although it was his idea.

330,"So, I was an escort for the past 4 years and I was leaving for a client but turns out he's getting married. I joined a sexual exploitation program because I was so out of touch with reality, I thought pimps were chasing (but they weren't). During my time in the program, my personality somehow changed and my mom is acting so different. I abused antidepressants and adhd medication while I was escorting, I also made a mistake of oversharing pretty much my life story with my mom because at the time i thought I was in ""the game"" and the guy I liked (as a joke) said ""did your mom tell you to marry a rich guy"" and so as a result, I ended up telling my mom too much, I called her everyday in the program because I thought somehow either this guy I liked or my ex pimps got a hold of her and that they were sending a message through my mom. 

Honestly, this is a Christian program and I truly feel it's almost like a cult and I think that THEY must have contacted my parents because now my parents hate me, like, SO much, our relationship has somehow drastically changed, I think the program has contacted my parents and fed them some story because my mom is so against me using medications even the prescribed amount and somehow she's using methods that get me to overshare this stuff and it's pathetic and sad, does anyone have advice?",08Nov2020,1

337,"Hello! It's my first time using Reddit and I think I need some advice.

Here's a little background: I have close friends (all of them are women) that I've known for almost a decade. We did almost everything together during those years, and after a while they kind of viewed me as their 'mom' friend (their words not mine). 

They come to me for advice whenever their feeling down, they tell me their fears, secrets, crushes, things that are troubling them, they talk about their parents, and things that are kept secret from their family were also told to me. So basically they trust me with everything, and my job was to listen to them, give them advice, support them, or just straight up just tell them what to do to make their situation a lot better. 

That kept on happening for a few years. 

The pandemic came in, we changed schools, and we were only able to talk/communicate through Messenger. 

Now here's the problem: I hated it. Well, back then it was fine, because I thought they weren't able to get the help they needed. I spent years just listening to them complain, and I kind of feel like a therapist more than a friend to them at this point. 

Now since online school started, they start to message me frequently. They complain that every single day they were given a minimum amount of 10 assignments that were all due the same week. Every single time a message pops up on my phone, I know it's them, and it's either they need help or want something from me. Sometimes I'll stay up to 2 am, texting them, listening to every breakdown, I call, and I hear them crying every time. Repeat for a few months. 

Then at one point one of them sends me a screenshot of some kind of quiz. I remember that it looked like those ""Are you depressed?"" quizzes you get from Google. So I'm assuming that she self-diagnosed herself. Questioned me If she's depressed, I said I don't know, and the conversation ended there. 

If I don't respond to them (I turned off notifs bc it kept on lagging my phone), they spam me, and some of the messages were ""Where were you when I need you"" or ""She ghosted us"" (In our gc) etc. I wanted to tell them that I was busy, but I think it's too late since the messages that I received were now a few days old and I saw it just now. 

They send me selfies of themselves crying, and then again, if I don't respond for a few minutes, the spamming happens. If I do get to respond, the conversation lasts up for more than 3 hours of themselves complaining again. I give advice, then they stopped messaging. 

I'm so exhausted. I'm so tired. I pushed my problems away just to fix theirs. I want to help them so much, but I can't keep doing that forever. Sometimes I feel so guilty if I wasn't able to help. I see my younger self when their vulnerable, and I don't want them to end up the same way as I did. 

We're friends for almost a decade now, and I don't want to end our friendship just bc I had enough of their complains.

What should I do?",08Nov2020,1

The thing is I wanted to explain why I did what I did, not because I was angry. I know I’m bullheaded but I try to be as honest about myself as I can and often it comes off as being incredibly blunt. I try to live as close to my personal principles as possible and often that leads to arguments, but I love arguments because I love intellectually attacking ideas to understand and evaluate them. I was drunk and argued with her about it, I never called her a bad word and honestly I’m more embarrassed by how pathetic and bullheaded I sounded than anything.

so me (29m) and my kids mother(30f) are going through a custody battle for a little over a year now. I document every single thing she does I have the kids Tuesday,Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until 6 pm court ordered with Friday and Saturday being the only overnights. However they usually stay and extra day or 2 every week. I do not drink or do drugs, I sign my kids up for sports to keep them active, I go to every parent teacher conference, and have them in bed asleep by 8:30 everyday. I also take pictures before she comes just in case she decides to wake them out of there sleep just so they can stay at her house. 

Moving forward this is the third time she has brought a heroin addict around our children and won’t believe me about it because she’s so desperate. I reached out to her boyfriend’s baby mom and she confirmed and sent me documents of his addiction and told me their kids go to therapy because of him now. My kids mother’s boyfriends baby mom also told me she reached out to my kids mom and told her he’s not okay and to not be involved with him. I’m scared for my babies life and I do not want them to go home tomorrow what can I do?? 

Please help me I’m begging!!!",08Nov2020,1

348,"First time poster. I’m trying not to go too deep into detail, but this is difficult for me to talk about. Here’s some background info. My parents have been happily married since before I was born. Growing up, I would say that our family dynamic was great. I have one brother [20M] who I’ve always been close with. I’ve never questioned the bond between my family and I. 

A few months ago, I was received a long and detailed message from someone claiming that we share the same father. Right away, I could tell  that it wasn’t a scam. There were too many accurate details about my dad’s childhood. She explained that she had no desire to establish a relationship with my father. Her reason for contacting me was because she discovered that my dad had children, and she couldn’t live without trying to know her half sister. There’s much more to what was said, but she wasn’t 100% certain because there was no proof that my dad was her biological father. Her mom had her at 16, and my dad would’ve been 15 years old when she was born. A week or so later, I replied to her message saying that I planned on talking to him about it. After 2 more weeks of driving myself crazy, I confronted my dad. Her story was true, but he also didn’t know whether or not he was the biological father. There were other men involved, and her mom didn’t want a paternity test at the time. My dad reached out to her and offered to take a paternity test. She accepted, and the results proved that he is her biological father. Her and I have not had any further contact, but my dad has been talking to her. 

I want to say that I have absolutely no negative feelings towards her. This is not her fault, and I truly feel for what she’s gone through. Do I wish that I wouldn’t have been the one to receive her message? F yeah. Being blindsighted and having to process the things that she said was, hands down, the most difficult thing I’ve ever gone though. I don’t understand why I had to carry the burden of my dad’s past. And now, she actually is establishing a relationship with him, and I’m the one who’s left alone and forgotten about. If her intention wasn’t to know me, then I wish she would’ve gone to him first. 

I know that to some, this may not seem like such a big deal. But I’m really struggling. I can’t let go of the anger and betrayal that I’m feeling, and I’m hurt. I wish my dad would’ve told me himself. He was only person that never hurt me or let me down. Now, I feel like I don’t even know him. I think about the fact that I’m not his only daughter. I’m not even his oldest child. I’m supposed to be his little girl. I’m supposed to be the only person he’d ever walk down the aisle on their wedding day. 

I want to find a way to move on and let go of the negative emotions that are consuming me. I’m sad all the time, and I feel like I’m losing my family. I’ve never really experienced what it’s like to cope with something, so I’m appreciative of any advice on how to get out of this place that I feel stuck in. 

Has anyone been betrayed and found a way to forgive and move forward?",08Nov2020,1

350,"Dear Readers
I have been confronted by a problem that my gf has recently shown me. So my GF has friends, who are, from my perspective, pretty chill and cool but when I talked to her, she referred to some times when she just wasn't invited to activities and such. They are a group of 6 but sometimes they just leave her out of the circle and do stuff together in a group of five. Although she always gets invited to like big parties, let's say birthdays, at other points they just don't invite her at all. Now I thought, okay, as long as they invite her to more special situations it is still good. Well, now it seems like the only reason she gets invited is that they don't seem unfriendly or just do it because of a kind gesture. But now I'm worried that she is going to get hurt by the time coming. What can I tell her? She seems very connected to her past and it would be pretty sad to see her childhood friends leave her out. As a side note, sometimes she goes out with one or two friends of that group but not that frequently.

I really enjoy talking to them and all, but I'm 14 and so naturally have to follow my parent's rules. They usually meet up late, 10-11pm-ish and I can't stay up that late. My parents (or my mother and stepfather) are pretty strict and I have to be down at 7 to eat and then stay down there until 9, when I go to sleep. 

I know they only do it because they care, and I'm not angry at them or anything, but I'm really enjoying talking to these people and I can only do it on very rare occasions.

Should I be honest and explain the situation to them or what? I'd be really disappointed if I don't get the chance to talk to these people again.

For some backstory I had a childhood of T-absent or uninvolved parents. My dad was a unreliable insane man who flew around the world spending all his hard earned monies on prostitues and drugs.

My extended family was manipulative as hell and full of shit. In short I grew up learning the only family you have is the one you make.

Hi! 

In the past month there has been a lot of tension in the company I’ve been working for the past 6months, 7% of employees globally will be laid off and there is a lot of uncertainty whether my team and I will be among that 7%. For sure there will be change and most probably a big change of role for me, from an executing and hands-on position to more of a trainer to other colleagues...

I’m 23 and just started working a year ago, I still have a lot to learn and I fear in equal measure both being laid off and the change of role, as I really don’t want to stop executing campaigns (I work in marketing) to train people with the little knowledge that I have. 

That’s why I started sending my CV around, and this nice company contacted me for a first phone interview. I know it’s an initial stage of the process, but I worry how to explain the employer the situation that I’m in, since nothing is certain yet and I’ll probably will know at the end of 2020/Jan 2021.

362,"I swear my health is becoming worse and worse with new ailments all the time. 

So in 2011 I was diagnosed with a type of cancer called Burkitt’s Lymphoma. I was 19 at the time and had come to terms that I had a form of cancer prior to being told. I had a lump on my neck the size of a fist and had spent months trying to find answers until I got the referral I needed. 

I went through numerous pick lines, infections, no energy, massive weight gain,given medication I was allergic too, I had a cyst on my butthole and had that cut out, constant sickness and basically spend 9 months in hospital. And of course people leaving my life because they just didn’t care or understand the situation. 

But recently I’ve accrued more and more ailments due to my weak immune system and my body starting to give up?

1. My butt tears when I poop because the cyst was on the rim of the hole and it’s weakened at the end of the scar. 

2. My knee has weakened muscle tissue and constant pain due to affected growth going through chemo. This was due to basically being bedridden during a time where my body was still growing. 

3. Constant eczema on my face and other areas of my body. I can not keep a beard or any facial hair because if it. I get far too itchy and I look deceased. 

4. Constant chaffing around my legs. No matter how much cream I use it always comes back and causes intense pain and discomfort. 

5. My eyesight was perfect before I was sick and I’m unsure if this one is related but every year I also now have to get a stronger prescription and It gets harder and harder for me to see. 

6. My guns bleed no matter what I eat. The dentist claims there’s no reason for them to be but even if I eat a banana, I bleed. 

7. My wrist has been getting more and more pain and harder to move. Suspected to be tendinitis but could be carpel tunnel. I do have to get an mri quite soon. 

8. Tendinitis I get every time I try to work out. I have to take things easy or I’ll only be able to half stretch out my arms and feel like I’m constantly cramping. Another reason why working out is becoming harder and harder for me.   

9. My most recent ailment is a torn penis. I because I get bad eczema as well as balanitis, I have torn multiple parts of my penis. I have to now also use a cream and dip it into a container of warm salt water. 

10. Once again because of the chemo my back causes me extreme pain. Bending or lifting can cause me to have server lower back pain. 

All of these issues as well as working 50 hours a week and having two young children make it extremely hard to live my life to the fullest, but I still do try to have a positive outlook. 

If I can get any possible solutions to any of my issues please let me know. But I’m sure I’m more unlucky than anything else. I use cream daily on my private areas, I’ve both my knee, back and wrist and do exercises for them as well.

One day, my classmate recommended me a discord server. So I joined, it was about anime. I am there for some time and I met some amazing people. They are all LGBTQ.

Let's call them P, K, M

So, they are all eating under necessary amount because they body shame themselves. Pike literally, the only reason. They are trying to get rid of weight in ridiculous ways like not eating at all.

Basically, K is mentally ok. They are doing it for short period of time, planned for less then 2 weeks, and they eat at least something so for this time, they should be alright. (I hope)

Then, M. M is basically a lonely person considering themselves shit. Basically me. They often actually forget to eat or drink, but also consider themselves ugly. (Not true, they're all beautiful) I am able to get M to eat because we call on discord daily.

Then there is P.

P is being verbally abused by everyone around them. P is not eating, has headaches (Low sugar flow into brain) and stomachaches (Missing energy). I am worried about P and I don't know what to do. I am trying to keep everyone alive, succeeding at M and K. But P is just murdering themselves and even admit they don't care if they die. I seriously need help.

369,"Hey reddit, throwaway account here, and first time using reddit so I apologise for any formatting issues or anything 

So I (18F) have a boyfriend (19M) and we have been together for over a year, and a couple months. I honestly love him so much and he has been the best person ever to me and is a lovely person, but there is a slight thing that makes me a bit sad sometimes. He has a very bad memory (he doesn’t have any medical conditions or anything, I think it is just stress) as in he doesn’t even remember my birthday or our anniversary. 

For example, for our 1yr anniversary we were supposed to go out somewhere and just have us two and we had planned it like 2weeks in advance and made sure we were free on the day, but then the day came and we ended up having to work and then afterwards he forgot and only remembered after I mentioned it when we got home. 

And another thing is that he sometimes forgets to compliment me even when I dress up super pretty for our date nights, and so I feel like I haven’t dressed up enough or am not pretty enough to be complimented. (For anyone who says treat people how you want to be treated, for context I always try to compliment him every time I see him and always tell him how much I love him, I definitely treat him how I want to be treated)

And I know that I might be overreacting but it makes me a bit sad when he doesn’t remember things like this as I find them really important. I know that in his household there is not much affection shown, and so I don’t blame him at all for this, but I want to ask if there is anything I can do to help his memory become stronger? Or something like that 

I have talked to him about all of this and he does know that it makes me sad when he forgets stuff like this, but then I feel like he forgets the conversation because nothing in his behaviour really changes. 

I’m not sure what to do here, all I want to do is just help him learn a way for him to show affection, but I’m not sure it’s working. Does anyone have any advice for me please?",08Nov2020,1

375,"hi everyone. i've never posted here before, but i'm at a loss and don't have anyone irl to talk to who isn't my parents. i'm not sure if there's subreddits that are more focused on issues like this, but if there are i'll move my post over there.

i am 14 years old, and i have a half-brother who is 25 years old. for the first 7 or so years of my life, he didn't live with me and my parents because he lived with his mum, but then one day he was kicked out and sent to live with us with only a few hours of preparing. it was due to drink-related issues, and that was when he was 18. i've never really had a brotherly connection with him, and i don't have any memories of him before he came to live with us, or any positive memories in general so i guess that's where the problem lies.

since he's lived with us, he has almost systematically messed up big time, and it's almost like there's a specific equation of actions he'll do; he gets super drunk, does something really dumb and stupid (personal favourite is when he got lost in london after wandering out of a club absolutely shit-faced and my dad having to get some of his friends who drive cabs involved to find out where he was because he had no idea), dad gets mad and yells at him, he goes to his mum's for a week or two, then comes back, everything's awkward around the entire house while they're sorting out new boundaries and then we're fine till he does it again. it's been happening for years at this point. last night he did a drunk zoom call with his mates, fucked up the kitchen and apparently ripped the door off the dishwasher, according to what my dad said (mum thinks he's probably stepped on the door as it's been swung down). he's just leaving on his motorbike as i'm writing this.

the reason i'm asking for advice is because i don't know what to do around him. my parents can't really kick him out, unfortunately, because he doesn't have enough money to buy a flat yet (i think,?? i'm not really sure about his financial state really). but honestly? i'm scared of him. i know i don't really have a reason to be scared of him- he's done nothing to me during any of this, but i am still scared. is this an ok/fair reaction? the only memories i have of him are him fucking up and then leaving and hearing my dad yelling at him because he's an idiot, but does that warrant me being scared at him? i'm just confused and this has been going on for a while, so if my thoughts are jumbled it's probably because this is the first time i've really said anything serious about it anywhere. i understand i'm a kid, but i don't really want to be friends or treat him like a brother because this is all i've ever known of him for my entire life. i just don't know what to do.

if anyone could help me feel a little bit more at ease with this situation, i'd be really thankful. i hope you're all well :) thanks!",08Nov2020,1

So I just turned 41....and didnt have the best of lives thus far, but I have a lot going for me.

after 25 years of hell i feel like i want to start over.
I couldn't get GED (i just cannot do the math despite trying over and over, maybe adhd?)  and my health isnt greatest since 14 but ive reached a point i want more out of life. I actually make pretty decent $$$ with my skills alone, i dont need a lot of the material things society wants, but im not happy. I want more. I didnt have a family growing up and cant now (??) being gay (greatest dream of mine)

but I always was the kind of person to believe our efforts and determination can make us achieve what we want outta life.

Heres where I have the problem and what has kept me from trying as I cant seem to get this outta my head, and i hope im wrong:

isn't society age based?

like you must be married with kids by 35
you must do collage in your 20s
etc etc?
you cant start a career outta school at 52, has to be 20s, etc

I would like to go to school and/or find a career
(im an exceptional musician in a fairly unique sorta way but I HATED touring/busking/working it as a job so no dice there)

isn't it true that older people are not hired even?
I mean, shit, doesn't someone's hard work turning life around show they should have a chance???
I wanna live and experience and search for where i belong.

and i wanna say 41 is the new 21 for me.
I haven't aged a day; I look and feel identical then I was at 20, no, better now once I work out and improve health. ill live till 120 if i have to, till im satisfied.
people take it easy in old age? I did that part already ill just change the order?

Who says I have to be X at Y age?? I'm no different a person i ever was! improved, even!
I can decide what order my life goes???

I don't want to believe its too late for me because society says so.....
This world is so messed up, but why can't someone who truly wants a better life not be allowed to have it because we all have to fit into some timed itinerary???

Bottom line I could be waaay wrong about this and have an improper belief that society must follow said timing.",08Nov2020,1

Sometimes i’m not even interested in something serious, and They aren’t either, and some girls still get distant. I don’t get it. It can go from having fun, sex etc and then getting totally ignored, from one Day to another. And most girls i’ve had sex with have not had more than 5 sex partners. So in my head i think that automatically makes me a bit more special, but i guess not. I always make sure that they’ve had a great time and they often say “we should meet again”... but really not showing that form of interested

406,"It’s fact that 2020 has undoubtedly been the worst year of me life. In December 2018 to January 2019 I suffered with bad anxiety and panic attacks, I shortly over come this and got better. It was stress with work and how my manager was treating me so I left and got a new job. My girlfriend at the time was the most amazing person I’ve ever met in my life. She helped me no matter what. She lived 4 hours away in Scotland and I from England. I moved up in the October and moved in with her family. It was a huge struggle because I left my friends and family but I felt it was needed. In ways now I still think it was needed. 

In March we then went into lockdown and absolutely ruined me. I was back in how I felt 2018-19, panic attacks, anxiety, depression and sadness. Yes I was with my girlfriend, but I couldn’t see my mum, it was my whole family’s birthday, I had people die in my life and everything spiralled out of control and i couldn’t do it anymore. There was problems in Scotland with family issues and it did not help me. 

So...I left. I left my girlfriend, i left Scotland. I left someone who gave everything. But I was so fucked up I didn’t know what I was doing. I just needed a break from everything and felt like I needed to be home and somewhere familiar to me. I soon regretted it but it was to late. I understand I hurt her, I understand there’s no trust. 

For the last 5 months I have worked incredibly hard on myself, I’ve lost weight, I’ve got so much more commitment and determination and desire to improve myself. But what I have not improved on is that I cannot get over her. I love her. I miss her. But she’s moved on. We spoke over her birthday but she’s now not interested which is most painful. Just to feel dropped. I wish I could have got better whilst being there but I couldn’t. I wish she could still feel things for me after 5 years of knowing each other. 

My next plan over the year would be moving back to Scotland and having a flat to myself, working on myself still because being back home is not what I can deal with anymore. There is so much anxiety of being back home but when I go up I feel so much calmer and it’s where I’ve always wanted to be. So my plan is to work and save every penny I have and go back, find myself, make something of myself. 

I’m worried I wouldn’t meet someone like them. I’m worried I’ll be alone. I’m worried if I get someone they would not be as loyal. I’m so scared. I would not wish how I feel or felt on my worst enemy.

My mother is 69, a bit ignorant, control freak to the max, and just one of those people who annoyingly nags about everything. Every other word out of her mouth is negative. She’s constantly talking shit on my father about how fat he is, how sloppy he is, how he smells bad often, or she’s going on about how no one at work likes her (shocker). She’s awkward anytime she’s around other people who aren’t her family. My guess is because she doesn’t have as much control as she does over her family. 

And my dad, well all those things my mom rags on him for are true. He often stinks. Sometimes he even smells like pee. It’s gross. He is one of the most sloppy eaters I’ve ever come across. Breathes heavy while he eats, drops food on himself, makes groaning noises while he eats.... and it literally disgusts me. I’ve tried for years to get him to take charge of his health but he’s so food obsessed it never happened. 

They’re not progressive people at all... I struggle to remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with them. 

So, after that background.... I met a really great guy and I’m falling for him. He’s asked about my parents and I just kinda shirk it off and change the subject. I won’t be able to do this forever. I don’t want him to EVER meet them because I can barely be in the same room with them. How do I execute this without hurting everyone’s feelings? Despite my disgust and resentment I still love my parents and don’t want to hurt them... but I also don’t want to mix the two. My older sister hasn’t spoken to my parents in years and although I hate her for it, deep down I understand. I don’t want to go that route though.

414,"My friend who suffers from severe anxiety, autism, and bipolar disorder is obsessively thinking that an old coworker of his who he used to buy alcohol from (he was underaged) is out to kill him because he blocked him on Facebook and Twitter. 

Around 6 months ago he found a crushed Soda can and a brick on his car and ever since then he obsessively thinks that the guy who he blocked just a week before hand is the one who did at as a warning.  Fast forward 5 months later and he remains convinced that people are after him for a variety of reasons. 

It's gotten so bad he obsessively stalks the old coworkers account and said person's friends' accounts on social media and even freaked out back in October when he saw someone who looks like one of those coworker's friends at his apartment complex, and he remained convinced that it was the guy setting his friend up to stalk him.

I've tried telling him if he really upset the dude the guy would've definitely done something by now, and how considering it's been a month since he thought the guy was stalking him, something would've also happened by now in that regards.


It's tearing his life apart and he's becoming borderline suicidal.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got an uncle(my mother's brother), he's usually quiet and talk so less but once he talks, he usually whisper something bad to my parent, siblings, me or other people. I always think that it's because of our family problems like fights between my parent and her siblings because of something I don't know(I only know about the fight because of my grandparents' assets but I think it is more than that). So here's the thing when he drunks he usually shouts about past problems and it's kinda bugging me since sometimes he cuss all the time, says something about killing us or about us being dead; he has a history of getting physically abusive but now he is only doing it with words which makes me feel scared since if it's physical abuse, we can just report him, with words I don't know any laws that can be used to him. I also have this thing that I feel like he might hurt one of us someday. Please do know that I can talk with him but not often and it is usually like ""Did you already eat?"", ""May I borrow this?"" or ""Let's eat"". There's time where I can talk with him fully but it is so rare and it is usually when he's ""ok drunk"".

420,"Hi,

TLDR: How do you know what you want to do as a long term career? Demotivated since moving back to previous role due to Covid redundancy. 

I know I'm in a really fortunate position to still have a job at this time, I'm just struggling with staying motivated. It sounds selfish but I'm really struggling with it.

I've never known what I wanted to do with my life, I had ideas when I left school but it didn't work out for one reason or another (teaching or joining armed forces). I started out in retail for a mobile phone company (UK), worked up to Assistant Manager where I stayed for 10 years. Once I reached a point where I was frustrated that I couldn't progress I left and became a branch manager for a car hire company. It was alright but quite underpaid for the hours that I worked. Fortunately a friend recommended me to where I currently work, customer support centre for a software house. I've been here 3 1/2 years now, team leader for 2 years. In Feb I applied and was successful in getting a Project Coordinator role, the manager intended to get me into Project Management. 6 weeks later I was furloughed and 4 months later made redundant from that role.

I've been lucky that my reputation in the Support Centre allowed me to move back to the same role as before in a different team, within a month I'd managed to get on top of the teams issues from the previous lead losing their motivation and performance is at a great level again. The problem is I've felt so demotivated myself since moving back, I feel trapped. Project Coordinator was an opportunity to really build a career but that was taken from me. With only 6 weeks experience nobody outside the company would give me a second glance. I literally don't know what path to look for? I cant do this role forever...
I love working with people and feeling like I've achieved something worthwhile and tangible. I've thought about HR or Social Work but I can't afford to drop salary to do an apprenticeship or to go back into education. Especially without knowing that I'd even like the job...

How do people know what they want to do in life? I've just bumbled along, faling into a job, progressing to a reasonable level, hitting a ceiling and moving on. I'm just at a loss and so frustrated now.

423,"So my freshmen and sophomore high school gpa are really low and i have been feeling really bad lately. I didnt realise this until i was applying to colleges. My junior year is decent, i have a few As, few Bs, and one or two Cs. My senior year is going good so far, mostly As, but im still very sad about my previous grades and it looks terrible on my transcript. Now i know colleges also look at improvement in grades through your years in high school, but im still really scared that i wouldnt get accepted to some colleges. Im just wondering is someone else has been in a similar type of situation and if they could share their story and what happened. It would really give me hope and if it didnt turn out well for any of you, atleast ill know what to expect.

424,"so am in a LDR with this dude that lives across the world from me and stuff. We text every night.


I’m convinced he is the one and the love of my life just everything clicks with him and stuff. We are generally pretty close and we’ve opened up to each other about a lot. Every time he feels down i try supporting him and just showering him in unconditional love and support, and i try to make sure he always has space to talk about himself and his interests. sometimes i dont really know wut to say cos he knows more about wut he’s talking about than i do, so idk if im doing too much of a good job but im trying. 



What i’ve been having problems with is just expressing myself to him. I cant do that. And whenever i do it just feels like he doesnt care, and if he does he makes a lil effort to show so, which I appreciate lots but it still kinda hurts cos it’s not much and i feel like im asking for too much. whenever we talk about other stuff or when he talks about himself and stuff he actually seems into the conversation and genuinely putting effort to hold the conversation up and stuff which i like, but whenever i start opening up about my feelings he doesnt say much and just generally saying very little, it seems like he doesnt actually care about what im saying. It seems like he’s just saying stuff to say stuff and not actually communicating with me. It really hurts tbh. Hes the guy i wanna open up to abt my feelings and insecurities but i dont feel like im being supported or validated whenever it do. It feels like it doesnt matter to him, like hed rather talk about something else than abt me. I feel like crying every time i do i feel horrible, and whenever i say i feel bad when i open up he doesn’t seem to acknowledge it and i think that’s prolly more so my fault tbh. I’m really insecure and ive tried communicating before how i am and how i need extra support and love and stuff to feel better but he doesnt really go that length to give it to me. Every time i open up about my feelings i just feel like complete shit afterwards. And talking to him about it makes me feel worse tbh, because i feel like he doesnt care. I always try being nice and sweet as possible with him whenever i open up cos i dont want him to feel bad whenever i do. This stuff is kinda hurting my feelings a bit and stuff and everything else is perfect with him except this part and it’s been really getting to me. I’m a really sensitive and emotional person and i feel uncomfortable talking about my feelings with him which makes me feel worse cos hes the person i wanna turn to. He’s nice about it whenever i open up but it feels like he just doesn’t put in effort to show he actually cares about how i feel, which really hurts. And then he just leaves after i open up and stuff. He doesnt really comfort me all that much when i open up. Idk if im really stupid for feeling like this and stuff i prolly am. Im a pos. Im really sorry i feel terrible


Is there any way for me to comfort myself and validate myself when im feeling like this? What should i do? How should i respond to this? How can i fix this? It doesn’t help that ive been feeling worse than usual lately too :c",08Nov2020,1
425,"I don't feel like there's anyone I can turn to in real life without being judged.

I feel like a fucking loony for sitting here in my bedroom at nearly 5am(had to edit that twice while writing) laughing at the absurdity of life after a shroom trip.
I don't even know how to state this without seeming hypocritical. Here I am asking for advice without being judged yet if I were to read this myself I'd think it's from some deranged person or a lonely neckbeard.

Basically, the only thing stopping me from improving my life is myself.

For the longest time, I was heavily depressed. My interests and hobbies morphed into ways to simply get through the day. There was no passion for anything; no will to live.
As a result of this I obviously stopped caring about my appearance and allowed myself to gain a lot of weight. 

This is what I had always envisioned of depression. This state of hopelessness. When you are here, there is nothing anyone can tell you to make it better, because you they can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.
I'm not sure if I'd even call this a mental illness. In retrospect, it all seems very logical to me.

Most people have some sense of purpose. Stuff like companionship, wealth, providing for a dependent, or feeling like you want to make a difference.
I thought of people I know. Some people only cared about money and their personal well-being and others were the polar opposite who put society over personal gain.
So why is it so crazy to think that a person exists that doesn't care about any of those categories? Is it a mental illness for not having a reason to continue? Why and how?


Anyways, about a year ago I found a purpose. I found a reason to seek greater education and companionship. However, I thought my appearance was an obstacle holding me back from achieving either. At the time I had very low self-esteem from what I let myself become. I spent many months improving my physique and I'd like to think I've overcame my self-esteem issues.
I feel like I am above average in terms of attractiveness, semi-intelligent, and I no longer feel down about comparing my progress in life to others.

So why is it so fucking hard to do anything that would benefit me as a person? There's nothing holding me back but myself, yet I'm not going anywhere.
For the first time in my life I have goals and ambitions and can't think of a single thing holding me back. Yet I'm making zero progress. I always thought depression was the lack of wanting to do anything and thought I was out of it by finding a purpose. But now, even with a purpose, it's overwhelmingly difficult to accomplish anything. 

I needed to improve my high school grades to apply to university so I joined some continuing education classes. The problem is that these are self-paced and it's so easy to let myself get distracted or fall into a pit of procrastination without any deadlines. Everyone says I should ""make deadlines for myself"" but how the fuck do those work if I can freely push them back without punishment?
This applies to everything in life. Why can't I accomplish anything without any external pressure? Why do I need a punishment to improve? I feel like a person should be capable of this yet I'm not.

Also, I know everyone is self-diagnosing themselves with ADHD these days and shit. I read into it a lot, and I mean A LOT. I genuinely believe I have it and got a proper diagnoses. I'm currently taking Conerta, which does help me focus sometimes, but doesn't provide motivation or focus on what's important if that makes any sense.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk or whatever. I'm gonna try to catch some sleep tonight but I'll read comments in the morning(or afternooon I guess) if there are any.",08Nov2020,1
426,"I’m a musician that is lucky to have some work right now. I’m a songwriter &amp; producer &amp; recently a highly influential agent that I have been in touch with a few times over the years got in touch with some of his own very rough demos asking if I could “spruce them up”.
So I’ve been turning these VERY rough ideas into actual songs, &amp; he is very happy with the results so far.

The agent is a big player in the movie soundtracking/scoring world &amp; I really feel (hope!) that he is testing me out to see what I can do. I would dearly love to move into this world (this was how we originally started talking), &amp; we have developed a really good working relationship (I do whatever changes - no matter how crazy - he asks for, all the while making the songs ready for broadcast or syncing).

I really want to ask him if he wants to make this arrangement more official &amp; for him to take me on with his agency.

Any tips on how I should approach this?

I’ve been a musician my entire adult life &amp; have never really had a “boss” before that I need to communicate my needs to effectively.
I know I have the talent &amp; drive to be a success in this field, I just need someone to make the bookings &amp; this guy is one of the best!

The thing is I really don't care about this, it doesn't seem like a big deal but in my college I've seen fights start over much less. I'm also from a small town thus people expect me to take things like this much seriously.

X is taller than me. I have this uncle (let's call him Y) who's constantly made me feel less about myself. About my appearance, height and what not. I don't hate how I look, but I'm not that confident. The past few months have been the worst, and also bothersome. Y and his family invite my sister and spend quality time always. It didn't brother me before but it's becoming way too noticable that they're avoiding me(they invite my mom and dad too but only my dad stays back with me or is usually busy). 
I can't help but think what I've done wrong, it's getting to me. They literally invited X to go with them to their ranch and asked me when I'll leave so they can go. I hate that I'm letting this get to me, but there are too many incidents like this. When I Iet it go and move on, they pull some shit like this again and bring me down again. I wish I could just cut contact with them, because it would give me a peace of mind and help me move on but my mom says I'm overthinking things and that I'll lose people if this is how I deal with them. 
If you're wondering if I've tried talking to Y, he's told me multiple times that he and his family only want to bond with X and my mom. I've tried to connect with them too but this is how it is and has been for a while. I really don't know how to deal with this and need advice.

Also I forgot to add, Y and his family always belittle me. They say things like oh X looks better than you, X will have an amazing spouse, we have to worry only about you and etc. Basically they're trying to cause a rift in our relationship ( X and I), but that's not happening.",08Nov2020,1

432,"So last December I learned I was getting letting go from my job at a company I’ve been with for 15 years(they threaten layoffs every year, got a 6 month severance). Love the company and loved my job and coworkers, management...etc. So I applied and accepted a job with another telecom company it’s a smaller more regional and rural provider, I started right at 1/2020. Well they ran into issues with COVID so because I had many connections in the telecom industry I volunteered to be one of the new people who would resign due to wanting to take some time off and pursue a few other personal things. Now, here’s the problem I’m running into, I started back with the new company in August after having a great conversation with the old sales director. He tried to get me more salary (which didn’t happen) and told me hey, I’m laid back to do your job hit your number and you’ll never hear from me. Well, we have 6hrs of conference calls 4x a week and a giant 3 hour market call on the 5th day of the week. Pretty hard to try and find new customers when you’re on calls all day. But on this Past Friday, I got a call from my old company’s HR department asking me if I would consider coming back to the company, at a higher salary and a different job title(one that I wanted before I was let go)and working for one of my old managers. They are also bridging my lost time for pension purposes. Now that the back story has been laid out in a cliff notes version, how do I tell my new manager that I want to leave again.

434,"I'm 19 and planning on going to uni within the next few years (couldn't this year due to health issues) but something I'm very worried about is that I'll be homesick for a long time after I first move away to a city some four hours away from home.

Five years ago I was crawling in my skin and screaming on the inside to just leave everything behind and never look back but over the last three or four years I've grown a lot closer to my family, especially my grandma and brother and I can't bear the thought of not being around them every day anymore.

I've never been apart from my family for more than a week and even on those occasions I was incredibly homesick and just wished I could either be home or have them with me wherever I was.

I'm concerned about this affecting my life once I move away and apart from the health issues it's the biggest thing keeping me from actually enrolling into uni because I know I won't have the strength to handle it.

I know I'll probably eventually get better about it but that might take years or it may never even happen for me so I want to know if there's any way to prepare myself now for it and force the homesickness to affect me less.

441,"Okay so, you’ll all obviously want context, so I’m gonna try my best.

My friend started dating this guy either 5 or 6 months ago (can’t remember exactly when), and at first, while surprised, I was happy for him! He said before he liked him, and he was the one to ask my friend out, so they started dating. It was initially polyamorous, with the dude my friend dating already having a Girlfriend. So off the bat it wasn’t a normal relationship, which is perfectly fine, I personally have nothing against people in polyamorous relationships, it doesn’t harm me, why should I care? Anyway, things are at first pretty fine the first two months, but around the third month, my friend says how he feels he’s being ignored constantly.

This raised my concern, as, I’ve known him since 7th grade, so he’s practically family to me. So I ask him why, and he stated how, despite his attempts, he’s constantly ignored by his boyfriend and his friends. I didn’t personally try to start anything, as I thought maybe he would bring it up himself, which he said he would. However, this kept going on for the rest of the month, and the months to follow.

Around month 4, his boyfriend broke up with bis Girlfriend, why exactly I don’t really know. I thought maybe this would allow him to get more attention from his boyfriend, but this didn’t change anything. In fact, I think it made it worse. My friends mental health really dropped at this point, with him often saying how he feels like he feels like he’s gonna have some sort of episode that will ruin his relationship with his bf. This, of course worried me, and I tried my best to help him, and told him to get a therapist soon.

This month is what’s really getting me close to trying to tell him he should break up with his bf. He dm’d me saying he had his worst breakdown yet, but, was worried about what his boyfriend thought about it, and asked me for advice on how to cheer his boyfriend up. I don’t know, but this nearly made me go ballistic. If it was the worst breakdown yet, shouldn’t he be worried about himself? Sure he should make sure his bf is okay, but way I see it, self care takes first place when it comes to important shit you should focus on.

So yeh that sucked! The college I went to i only have my 2 best friends with me which im grateful for but , it's really weird because most of our other friends all went to a different college which was closer to our high-school. This college however has 3 hour lessons which are absolutely boring as hell considering i do betc business and media studies . In addition to that its so awkward on our 15 minute breaks which we all happen to have at different times meaning  i just aimlessly wonder around the college because i don't know anyone else, I also always thought I was really good at socialising however it came out to me that I'm so bad at it , and that probably because when i joined high-school literally my entire junior school went to the same high-school so i already knew everyone .

I closed and moved into a condo a few weeks ago. All has been well, but lately there has been some very disturbing things happening. Vibrations on the floor from my downstairs neighbor!!

I’ve been going nuts thinking I am developing vertigo or something, until I went outside snooping and peeked up into their unit and noticed a ceiling fan going full blast right below my bedroom. Now I can only assume that’s the culprit of what I am feeling while laying in bed. It’s also happening in my living room when sitting on my couch, but I wasn’t able to see anything that could be the reason. I assume there’s another fan going full blast that I wasn’t able to see.

What can I do? I obviously cannot tell them to not turn their fans on, but this is disturbing my peace, and quite frankly, my mental well being.

Thanks for any advice",08Nov2020,1

454,"My best friend of 6 years is in a tricky situation. About 9 years ago her half aunt met a guy and got married, he has 2 children from his previous marriage. For many years she had no relationship to them and they weren’t really considered family. However about 3 years ago she developed feelings for on of the sons and with some of the family’s blessings they dated. The family had no problem because they were not blood related and her aunt was her half aunt and wasn’t necessarily a close family member until 4 years ago . They broke up recently and now she’s carrying around so much guilt. She’s afraid of what people will think of her, she knows there’s no blood relation but she felt like she did something wrong. Even though she ended the relationship because she thought it wasn’t right she’s still beating her self up. I told her if she wasn’t blood related to him then it’s fine and he’s history now to not worry but she still is. And advice on what to tell her ?? She’s also afraid that if others of her family finds out they dated that they’ll disown her. She’s scared to be humiliated by future partners. Help any advice ??",08Nov2020,1
455,"I've only been working a day or two a week at my job, a job I hate but just put up with since it works out mostly well for my ""social"" life, the hours suit really well for me to be able to hang out with my friends online who are mostly in the US, whereas I'm in Australia. 

I just found out today that we're most likely going to re-open this weekend, and we'll be open Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for the moment, which has me quite bothered due to the fact I'll most likely be working Sundays, which is when my friends are most active to play games as it's their Saturday.

I can't really ask for the day off, as my Manager/The Bosses of the place aren't ones to give time off unless it's absolutely necessary, especially since we've been off so much recently due to Covid.

I worry that I'll miss out having fun with them while I'm at work and stuff once we re-open, I feel pretty lonely when I'm not hanging out with them in Voice Chat or playing games with them.

Any advice on dealing with my Fomo/problem would be appreciated, I'm not really sure how to alleviate what I'm feeling.

I'm gonna hopefully commit to a different sleeping schedule so I get up earlier and sleep earlier to fit their time-zone a little better while still being reasonable to my own.",08Nov2020,1
456,"I work at a very large fortune 100 company. I am doing well at my job and want a promotion. Of course, I get the whole office politics thing but personally I am a very self respecting man with a strong moral compass. Lately, the team who would be super influential in landing me that big fat promotion have been talking to me and saying that they love my work and that honestly I am the best suited candidate for the job. That said, they feel that my ethics is in the way of me landing my job.

Cut a long story short, in my role we deal with a lot of vendors and many of them are given contracts at exorbitant prices because they are related to the bosses. Recently, we gave an ad agency a job for 75% more than market rate because she was the sister of the big boss. I personally felt that her output was good but her high prices and rates are detrimental for the company because we good have gotten the same job at a much lower cost. I raised this issue with my team and they said, this stuff happens everywhere and I should be cool with it if I want that promotion.

They said, if I want my big fat promotion they would totally give it to me because they love my work and know they can't find a better suited candidate. But, they said, they are a bit weary because they feel my ethics might lead to me outing them and they are concerned about that. They assured me that no one can fire me from my current role and that they would love to see me get that promotion but not if I felt like my ethics would stop me from them awarding such kind of jobs to these vendors.

I am conflicted because these things are common in the country I work in but I would never be able to live comfortably with myself knowing that I was one of the approvers on these contracts if I got the promotion. I also know this story will be fairly similar if I switch jobs. If I voice my concerns to upper management either these guys get fired or I get fired because maybe even upper management knows and does these things themselves. Shall I ignore my ethics and self respect and suck it up and chose to ignore this behavior? Or shall I take the high road and stay at the level I am even if it means giving up the chance to earn more? I am not strained for the money, I do well for myself currently but who doesn't like extra money? In general, my impression in the company is stellar and people love me, especially my juniors.

TLDR - Is it worth ignoring my ethics to land a big fat promotion?",08Nov2020,1

I, 21F, seeking an advice about being 'superior' and 'insecure' at the same time.

Ever since I was in elementary school, I had this feeling that I should be at the top of everyone. Heck, I also thought that I am the prettiest of them all, but in real life, I'm just pretty much average like everyone else, and I acknowledge that, like it's just normal to me. 

I just hate the fact that I almost see everyone as a competition.. I gotta be honest, I'm so insecure of myself and I'm afraid of being left out by anyone else, but I don't really want to fight them. 

For example, I've talked about my friend about my plans. We have the same plans in life, just pretty normal plans (like getting a job, travelling, etc) and now  when she talks of it I'm scared that someday she might be successful and I'm not.

I want to remove this feeling because I want to keep a clean and pure intentions with anyone, and I want to enjoy life without the fear of comparing myself to others and seeing them as competition.

Thank you for anyone who's willing to give me advice.",08Nov2020,1

I feel like I should start this out by saying I’m truly the happiest I’ve ever been, at least I’m definitely the most mentally stable I’ve ever been.

However, when I was cleaning out my phone today I was noticing old photos from last December when I was at the highest weight I’ve ever been. My mom had just OD’d and I was falling out of love with my boyfriend at the time. It was a rough time mentally, and physically I looked horrible. At the time I felt like I looked decent but looking back it was such a shit show. 

Since then I’ve lost a substantial amount of weight (in a healthy way), I’ve gotten mental help, am no longer with my ex, and am in a finally stable household where I don’t have to worry about anything seemingly ever. There’s nothing for me to panic over anymore. 

And yet, I don’t know why, looking at these old pictures of myself instantly made me cry. I don’t mean shedding a tear, I mean full blown crying and checking myself in the mirror. I wish I could hug this girl in the photo and tell her everything will be okay soon. 

Right now, I don’t know how to cope. I don’t know why this made me so emotional and any advice would be helpful. It’s the middle of the night so I can’t really talk to anyone I’m close to right now.",08Nov2020,1

What makes this even more embarrassing is that I was Romeo and it also has the solo I sung before my voice broke when I was 11. (I also had urticaria multiformae at that point so I looked kinda ill).

468,"There’s this girl I’ve had a thing for for about the past year and a half and I’ve been not acknowledging it that whole time (I did know though I just didn’t engage with the thought) because we’re in a friendship group and I didn’t want to damage things if it went wrong. We’ve talked intermittently on social media and I definitely could tell she was interested in time and I expressed the same back, not through direct words but just behaviours, like spending 6 hours talking to each other into the early AM’s etc. About 2 weeks ago we were out at this event and we hadn’t talked at all in a while as she was seeing someone. We were talking alone and my cognitive function was very impaired from alcohol to say the least 😂, so I was being a little bit flirty, not obviously but giving vibes. Anyway she just said to me “Me and X are not together anymore” out of the blue. I took this as a signal and yeah just said to her that I’d had a crush on her for quite a while but didn’t want to pursue it cos I didn’t want to fuck up our friendship group. I don’t really remember much of our conversation. I think I remember her saying that she was interested too? I definitely remember her saying though that she wasn’t looking for anything right now, and at the time I remember thinking “why’d you tell me you broke up with X then?”. Anyway about 10 minutes later she gave me a look and I just said fuck it and went for it and we kissed a couple of times. Now the context is out of the way. 

We messaged a bit more that night after we went home, then stopped for a couple of days. I saw her when we weren’t drunk in a group setting about 3 days after the kiss. Then we didn’t talk for about a week. I literally could not stop thinking about her. That kiss just kicked something off inside of me. Anyway I messaged her some funny video (it was a precious inside joke between us) and we then talked over text for the next 5 hours, and I mean like you don’t close the app, discussing all these different things like childhood memories etc etc. This is low key a vent and asking for advice at this point haha. But yeah that text conversation was 3 days ago. It’s been about 2 weeks since the kiss. Yeah basically I remember her saying “I’m not looking for anything right now”, but she’s giving me the vibe that she’d be interested and we’re compatible just not right now. Maybe in a couple years lol. My problem is I just can’t stop thinking about her, to the point where I feel like it’s actually starting to do my head in. To the point where I feel like it’s starting to damage me mentally - wanting this attention from her and wanting things to go further but then knowing that she doesn’t want to take it further right now. I just can’t get her out of my head. I’ve never really had this happen before. I’ve kissed girls before and had past relationships and so on, this time it just feels different. I really feel like she’s someone I could click with long term, and i think I’ve known it for a while and this kiss just brought all of that to the surface. If you guys have any other advice on the situation I would also appreciate that. Should I talk to her about it? Do I just pretend it didn’t happen? I kind of want to know what I said to her when I was drunk. I don’t want to come across as too much seeing as we’ve kind of just been playing it like it didn’t happen.

She doesn’t understand why people reject her invitations and wants to see me more often.

I have to pack my clothes in a backpack and keep the bag closed the entire time so that my clothes don't absolutely smell. You can't get rid of the smell. It smells across the entire house and it's just awful and hard to get out of clothes. I hate it. There's nothing to do there. I have a computer there and a tv, but other than that, there's nothing. I like going outside and doing stuff rather than sitting inside and playing games, but there's literally nothing to do outside.

487,"I was dating a girl who I met online, so it was a long-distance relationship where we haven't met in person, and after 4 months I notice some things about her that didn't make me feel comfortable going long term with her. I broke up with her because the long-distance side of things wasn't working for she kept coming up with excuses of why she couldn't video chat when she could send pictures. At one point she says she would end of her life if this relationship didn't work because she stated that after both her parent's death she would want to see them. So I fell into the guilt trip of staying with her thinking I can help her overcome that feeling. After a while, I wasn't happy because I realize the relationship was only about her and felt it was time to get out before it became too far so I kindly explain to her that and stated that I wanted to be friends. From there she brings up the ending of her life and kept trying to guilt-trip me on not breaking up with her. At that point, I refer her to medical help but after feeling harass by her I blocked her.

The problem now is apparent someone is now messaging me saying shes in the hospital and to contact that person but whats shady about the messages is that the person only text me and the style of the text looks like her, then another number tries to contact me with both being different area codes, plus when I check her Instagram on my backup account shes actively following people so I don't know if she trying to trick me or what. Obviously, I don't want anything bad happening to her but I also don't want to be fool into a trap. 

Should I keep blocking all incoming messages or take the risk to make sure if she's in the hospital to explain to the doctor's what's up?",08Nov2020,1

I am entering an art contest for scholarship money because my family is kinda broke and can't really afford to pay my college (i.e. this contest is kind of important). (Un)fortunately I am an overachiever and have my mind set on this idea, which seems kind of impossible for me to execute given my conditions.... that's why I'm here. 

 My idea is to make a collage of many different people, smiling and doing a specific pose (won't disclose rn) - accompanied by a sentence in their handwriting (not disclosing this too rn). The only problem is that I can't go out and ask people to do these things and take pictures because 1. my parents won't physically allow me, 2. that violating coronavirus procedures in my area...

She starts crying and he wakes up and just try’s putting a pacifier in her mouth which isn’t doing anything so I swaddle her up put her in her crib and put the white noise on my phone that usually gets her to sleep and walk out of the room. While in the other room I hear him get up and pick her up and yells no. I’m like wtf? So I wait a little while longer and can hear her start to cry again after a few minutes and again he goes hey, no! Now it’s not much yelling but he raises his voice and very sternly tells her this. At that point I walk in and say don’t yell at her no like she’s a dog and he gets upset with me saying don’t talk to me like that and again I say don’t talk to her like she’s a dog.

I am 15(f), I had sex, don’t judge me for having sex this young, It was my first time after year of dating him.
We used condom and it did look okay both before and after.
I am concerned because it was probably my ovulation around that day and for the first few seconds we didn’t actually wear the condom, because my bf was afraid, that we will be “broken”, by which I mean he will lose his erection and we didn’t want to waste that condom.
I took pregnancy test, on the second day I didn’t got my period and it was negative.
Now I still don’t have my period and I am freaking out about test being broken.

Even though I didn't choose to be autistic, I still feel bad because these people say I'm ""worthless"" and ""unlovable"" for having a social disorder.

Although I have plenty of supportive friends and family who love me, I sometimes worry that 85% of the world is toxic like these mean people I see on social media, I worry that there's no hope in humanity and that the world is too hateful based on stuff I've seen on social media.

I met this guy online and we had been talking for like a two month period and he ended up insulting and demeaning me toward the end and he thought me merely expressing that I can't do that to me is manipulative and controlling.

let's just say that it ended with him calling me the worst piece of human shit and that I ruined him and completely broke him and gave him trust issues.

&amp;#x200B;

he has no positive feelings for me anymore and thinks I am a complete monster and human shit, he wants nothing to do with me; so he might try to discard me and make me feel like shit one last time by posting the pictures somewhere.

I am dependent on my family and they're very conservative and I'm in a third world country, so if these pictures get out with my personal information included that would be very bad for me. As for the nudes, I made sure to not have face included in them and deleted metadata.

501,"I'm 16, have been friends with this guy for 10+ years, I've helped him alot and done alot with him; but all he does now is brush me off. TL;DR at bottom but I suggest reading please.

So my best friend (I'll call him Sean) has been incredibly weird lately and I feel like I don't even know him anymore. He got tired of playing video games so he stopped playing with me online (which is fine I see it as normal). But starting this year, he has just lied to me about being busy, denied it when I point out he lied, and just seems to avoid me constantly. He seems to have just focused only on texting with any girl he can now and acts so weird online and around people now. It's like he just tried to act in a way that he thinks would make girls like him but it's just so cringy fuck.

Anyways back on topic... This summer we planned on going golfing, playing soccer and tons of other stuff but not once did we do ANYTHING! Like every time I asked him he would say he's working or busy and then would post on social media that he just ditched me to hang out with other people and do what we planned to do! I'm just so fucking annoyed! Last week I asked him to come play poker with a gang of friends (*with masks on*) he told me he could, the a  couple hours before poker night starts he texts me saying he's busy with school work, but then he was hanging out with plenty of friends. He told me after that he would ""100% come this week"" but then again says he has school work... And guess what, AGAIN HE POSTS HIMSELF AT A PARTY! Like WHAT THE FUCK!

I don't know if it's just me, but this just seems like such an asshole thing to do. I've literally gotten depressed about this and cried before and I feel so alone. He's like my closest friend and it's like he doesn't even see me as a person anymore. I want to punch him in the face but hang out with him. He bought skis after I did just this week and hes planning on skiing with me alot but I don't even know if I can trust him anymore. I don't want to tell him to fuck off or befriend him yet because maybe he'll actually go skiing with me but I'm just so fucking annoyed and pissed off.

 I just need someone to talk to please, I'm really frustrated with this and I feel like I have no real friend anymore. I have others to talk to and hang out with bit I feel like I just lost a brother.

TL;DR
My 10+ brother-like friend has changed drastically and I feel he hates me. He lies about being busy and then blows off plans with me to hang out with other people and then posts it online. I feel very angry and disposable.

I am really scared for the future as my parents keep telling me I should get married although I've told them I'm not ready yet im scared that any man I meet won't be able to get his head around my previous relationship and won't be able to accept that im not a virgin so im gravitating on giving him another chance as I dont feel anyone will be willing to get over me being in a relationship with someoen else and will  always use this against me.

After a while we had a good experience in a summer camp held by our school, we are in the same group and was doing all stuffs together. After the camp ended, me and her exchanged our numbers start making lots of conversation day after days after the camp ended. So we get into relationship afterwards after 3 months knowing each other. When I was 18 years old i was offered to continue my study in this college far from my state and i start do a lot of online gaming and stopped contacting her. I actually never cheat on her and we also never quarrel.  The thing that ruined this relationship was the addiction of gaming after I joined college. It made me ignore her and sadly after 6 months she found a new lover. And they now have been together for over 7 years. But deep down I still love her, I never forget her and regretted all of my decisions. After 2 years, I found her instagram and we started to chat again thru the app, making jokes, exchanging idea as we used to be. I also dropped my gaming addiction. After graduating from college, fate brought us together again as we work in the same company as of now and had to meet each other every single work day. She's as dazzling as ever for me, no one has ever made me look at them as I look at her. I really thought she is the woman that im gonna spend the rest of my life with.

505,"My friend, Mary (fake name) has been dating this man, Jacob (fake name again) for roughly 7 months. In the beginning when she introduced him to us he really did seem like a very nice person; he absolutely adored her and treated her very well.

However, recently she’s told us that he’s been rather emotionally abusive to her. We’re all still studying and Mary works part time to save up money, she usually works on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She tells us that he’s always very angry when she has to go to work and she also let us listen to voice messages he’s sent her, I won’t go too into detail but the messages included stuff like “why can’t you just spare me ONE day?!”, verbally abusive insults, threats to hit her and other insults. He’s also blocked her numerous times just because she sat next to another man during lunch break, and tried guilt tripping her when she spent time with other friends.

Obviously upon hearing this we were all very shocked and we told her not to bother with him anymore and to leave him. Mary, however, is very close with Jacob’s mother and she sent the voice messages and threats that Jacob sent her to his mother. Needless to say, she was horrified that her own son would say something like this.

Here’s the part that we’re all quite unhappy about: Jacob’s father is abusive to him, and that’s apparently where his abusive treatment of Mary stems from. Jacob’s mother asked Mary to give him a second chance (we told Mary that he didn’t deserve it) and she actually did. She gave him a list of shit he couldn’t do and told him that if he threatened her or verbally abused her again she would leave him.

We’re all quite worried and kind of angry at Mary. We don’t think Jacob deserves another chance after all he’s put her through for MONTHS. We also don’t think that it’s good for her to date such an abusive person just because she respects his mother and wants to make her happy.

507,"Hello reddit,

Well, my current life situation involves living with my niece, and I'm the one who spends more time with her. She was raised by her grandma, and she never said no to her, so at first it was very challenging trying to explain her why she couldn't do stuff.

I'm not really happy about having to be the responsible adult most of the time as I'm 22, work full time (remote) and study, but I adore her and wouldn't neglect her. 

Here's the thing, she (6yo) won't listen to when I tell her no unless I get mad and start yelling, i even try to explain her the reasons but she would just try to give me excuses. This happens with things that I consider dangerous, like opening the window (it's a huge window she could easily fall), trying to climb a ladder while I'm on it painting, and that kind of things. She just won't listen or would start making excuses.

I've noticed that spending time with her is draining, and is constantly correcting her. I don't want her to feel like all of her is wrong, but at the same time she has no enthusiasm for anything except for her tablet. She won't draw unless someone draws with her, same with toys and any other activity.

What can I do here to help her? (And help myself) I try being a good example to her, but at the same time I'm drain, and whenever her mother is around I try not taking any responsabilities related to her.",08Nov2020,1

Last night I started messaging with someone here on a Reddit hookup community and she told me to get Skype. I got Skype and we Skype called and talked for a short bit, I’m very confident she is real since we were having a legit conversation. She sent me some pictures of what apparently was her, and at the moment I believed her. She asked me to turn on my video and I obliged, and showed my face, after that she wanted to see the rest of my body so I’m sure you all could imagine what happened there. Afterwards she had to go and said she’d call me tomorrow and that we could hookup next weekend. Shortly after that she deleted all the pics she sent me which immediately made me suspicious and scared. I deleted my Skype account I made for her, and deleted my Reddit account. I started stressing pretty badly about if she recorded me, if she posted it somewhere, if my family would be disappointed, etc. This morning I made this account just to look on her profile and see she deleted her previous posts but made a new one pretending she is in a different country. I read another very similar post like this basically saying to delete your account and ignore her and it should blow over, but I saw a very few saying to hire a hacker. I can’t help but feel guilty/sorry for not doing anything about it while other dudes even more gullible get it worse than me. I don’t know if it’s ethical to hire a hacker for something like this.

Should I keep my money for this month to use on myself? I give my parent rent and do work around the house. (My sibling doesn't bother to help, and he pays 100 less than I do in rent for a personal spite reason towards our parent.) The thing is, I've given my parent my stimulus check to replace appliances in the house they are broken. I'm planning to give them the next one if it's given to me for the same reason.

The reasons I want to hold my money this month is purely for selfish and immature. My parent upset me very much and keeps seeming to push me over the edge with this. They won't bother to buy appliances, and constantly have us go to their friend's house without warning me to wash clothes. They're old-fashioned and slightly narcissist, but they're the only one who's been there for me. Despite their faults and despite mine. I suffer with a few mental illnesses (anxiety/panic attack/depression/agoraphobia) and they only seem to truly acknowledge them, when it's of benefit to them or I'm at the point of having a horrible attack. I'm just honestly tired of being in such a state of depression, that I want to keep my money for a month to buy something for myself. It's not going to cause a money strain or put us in any trouble financially, but I still feel bad for doing this?

When we first started dating he had a couple of closish friends, but no one there for him properly. As the years went on after he left college, it dwindled to seeing and speaking to no one really other than me in any great capacity to my knowledge. 

I love him to death and want him to be happy as possible, but he just has this lonely vibe to him and doesn't seem to be happy about not having friends. I've asked a few times in the past about it but as I know how touchy a subject it is (having been there) I never want to delve very far as I don't want to upset him about it. 

He really struggles in social situations especially with new people he doesn't know very well and even in situations where we're having a nice open conversation with one or 2 of my friends he really struggles to input. I have tried many social occasions to try and get him to talk with people but it never works out. I always find myself in a sort of mothering way trying to get him to reach out to people and I feel pandering and condescending.

We both have anxiety but I would say I have a better hold on mine, whereas he can't help himself but just stop and freeze. 

I guess my issue is I don't know how to open up a talk about this sort of stuff because I know how sensitive this issue was for me at the time. I really want him to have friends because I want him to be happy and not lonely, and if worst comes to worst and we end up breaking up (which I will preface I have no intention of doing) it would kill me to leave him alone. I end up feeling guilty about him being alone and feel like there's more I can do but just not sure where to go.",08Nov2020,1
521,"Hey , 
22 m male indian here and I feel dead rn honestly.
Last 5-6 years are so depressing for me . It all started after completing my 12th when my dad didn't give me money for college and told me I can join next year ( I got a decent rank in ipu university) and just next year we lost our house because of my fuckall dad and then we moved to another place on rent and just after a year we got kicked our because my dad was unable to pay the rent and from last 2 years I'm stucked at my grandmother's place ( mom's mom) place and my grandmother kicked out my father after a month or so and I don't have any idea where he live and honestly I don't give a fuck about him. My laptop, my clothes everything is at the old house and I fucking hate living at my grandparents place. My nanu ( moms dad) chants around 4am very loud everyday and I got so pissed off today like just because of him I'm only able to sleep for like an hour or two and currently I'm not stable financially  to move out . Also since I was so pissed off on him I told my mom about this and then she got depressed about this situation and scolded my sister and ny sister (she's 17 btw)packed her bag and idk where she went . After calling her idk how many times she came back home after 2 hours and told me that it's all my fault . I think I'm a terrible person who just rants everyday and honestly I miss my privacy and a lot of stuff is happening everyday and I feel mentally ill. Also I was doing online course when my dad told me to join next year but then he didn't even paid full fee for my course , almost 97k inr is still pending . I think I'm a terrible son, brother , grandson and a friend. I'm literally thinking about jumping off a bridge tomorrow and just get done with life.",08Nov2020,1

523," Me and my mother used to have a really great relationship; my father died when I was 10 and we only had eachother, but recently  after I got approved at college and she got a boyfriend our bond is slowly and painfully deteriorating. I'm still living with her due to the pandemics and I was waiting my presencial classes to start to move to a new town.

 I'm a great daughther, I really am, she never had to worry about me. Recently, I realized I was doing all the work in our relationship, I was the one showing love and affection, she just never reach out to me; If I don't try to have a conversation with her, we won't talk. I don't know what to think anymore. Two days ago it was her birthday and she spend the whole day without looking at me; we had had a small (very small) argument about the dishes one day before, but i dont think it justifies the treatment I got. Now it seems like she regrets it, but she doesn't try to approch me. I'm really tired of it. It seems like I am the parent. 

 These dynamic of us spending days without having a proper conversation happens a few times per month. I'm tired. 

 I'm considering to move out, even without having a practical reason to do so (I'm financially independent of her). I know it will hurt her feelings, but I also know I deserve more, I don't understand why she doesn't show affection to me. 

 Should I stay at home, explaing my feelings and try to reppair our bond (I've done it a couple times already) or move out?",08Nov2020,1
524,"Okay so my problem is exactly what the title says. 
My family is very blunt. They're not mean and they're not making things up to make me feel sad on purpose, they're just that kind of people that will tell you if you're an idiot...and to be fair I am a disaster. I don't know any other people so I don't know if I do this outside my house.

Thing is, when they say these things I usually start tearing up. I don't mean to make them feel guilty or angry, the tears just start appearing. 

That wouldn't be so troublesome on it's own. But once I start crying, the commentary that triggered it starts replaying in my mind, and I remember other commentaries and my own self-hating thoughts (is that what you call them? English is not my first language, I'm sorry), keeping my little show going for like...an hour, until my eyes hurt and are swollen.

Also wouldn't mind it if I could make it go away easily, but my eyes and face look like that dog who ate a bee for the WHOLE DAY. So even if I go to my room until I've calmed down, they can tell by my face and may get upset aaaand we start again. I used to think crying was ok bc I was letting my emotions out, but honestly it's just annoying. If it were of any help I would be able to learn from these experiences, and I'm not.

I have tried ""processing"" these thoughts, letting them flow or whatever, but the only thing it has caused is more crying. The fact that some of the comments are right make me more depressed. I'm not the kind of person who gains strength from hate. 
Id like to know how to grow thicker skin *and* be able to learn from the remarks. And how to stop my brain from replaying the commentaries-events.

525,"Hi there! I'm a new intern in an office who has been working for about 2 months. Last week, something happened at work that involved me being careless. There was an email who came in from a client but I did not check it, which hindered my supervisor from giving me work.  I was recounting that experience to my intern friend (who works at the same office) along the lines of how careless I was, and my supervisor (who was involved in that situation) happened to be around the area (but I did not notice her). At this point, I don't exactly know how much she heard/what she heard/if she heard me. While I did not say anything bad about my supervisor, I'm still afraid that I might be misunderstood by her.

526,"Throwaway

My fiancee(23M) is going to law school, and I(24F) have a steady job. Neither one of us ideally want kids in the next 3 years until he's out of law school. I'm planning on getting on nexaplon before we get married( courthouse wedding). Now I've known people to get knocked up on nexaplon (only two) supposedly. 

I asked what the hell would we do in case of a unplanned pregnancy in the next three years. His answer is always ""I don't want to think about it, and I don't know, the chances are slim."" Here's the thing, I need a answer. And the whole "" we'll get there when we get there."" Is starting to get old. He's more of a life makes unexpected changes type, but this is a hill for me to die on. This isn't some spur of the moment plan, this would be a whole ass baby. 


I've flat out told him, were either gonna have to double Dutch with birth control or he's gonna have to give me answer. He claims I'm being the asshole because he can't give me a answer and being unreasonable and there's no reason we should have two types of birth control.

I've talked to him about what I would do. I absolutely do not want a baby his first year. If I got knocked up second or third year, I'd probably keep the baby, but I don't want to be a single parent. We ideally talked about having 3-5 kids, but there's also the worry if we don't get pregnant immediately out of law school we might not be able to have as many as we want. Idk. I just don't want to be a single parent with a absent husband and have our kids never really interact with him because he's too busy. That's not fair to them. I know he'd make a great dad, he's got all the great qualities of one, and he wants to be a dad, I just don't know. I just don't know, the risk seems big to be me and he's just shrugging it off. Where do we go from here?

TL;DR me and fiance are at a impass on what to do about kids. He won't give me a answer. I don't want to have to postpone the wedding because he can't give a answer or an idea of anything.",08Nov2020,1
528,"I’m 17F. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes being a girl is nice. I feel pretty, my body is fine. In fact, I think a lot of people would say I have a pretty ideal body except that I’m slightly overweight.

But sometimes I wish I wasn’t a girl. Sometimes, for days at a time, I feel like people are purposefully reminding me that I’m female. I don’t want to transition into a male fully, either. I’ve thought about it and I think I’d miss being a girl too much.

Some days I just wish I could pass myself off as a boy in front of people who had no idea I wasn’t one.

I don’t care to tell my parents about anything. They wouldn’t care anyway, and I’m planning on going away to college soon.

529," a bit of background info I am sad. in the school I used to go to everyone hated me and most people bullied me and so after a few event I forced my parents to move me to another school and I am with a small group of 3 other people, a trans person (female to male), a lesbian and my ex witch is female, I thought I could open up to them because I put on a fake face so I don't get sympathy or pity, its easier, I started to open up(the way I grew up was that I don't know anything social or its hard for me at the least, I prefer older stuff so idk anything new, I don't own any social medias apart from reddit, discord and new to twitter but I don't really use it) its about 2 year after we became friends and a year from when me and my ex became a couple, I was every open to my ex. I was a massive asshole when I first went to the school but I have gotten better and I don't think my past self should effect how they see me now

its started I broke up with my ex bc there wasn't enough communication on her part and I was sick of ""I cant talk after school"" ""I can't msg"" and after I disappeared for a bit of getting my emotions in line in the end and when I came back after a really short one this one time, only 1 week, she was angry at me and would not talk to me and ignored me.one day me and my ""friends"" got into a argument after I was confused about things and I was asking questions after all 3 of them screamed at me on call for about 1 hour I left and my ex was being really bitchy after I was looking for help on my emotions, she 180 her emotions and it was like that whole year didn't exist, I didn't need that. after that they would hang around my locker for long time after school and would obviously talk about me ""behind my back"" it was awaked, I was in a class with 2 other very nice people but I guess only nice bc they have sympathy

these 2 people tried to inv me into they little group but it was obv no body wanted to see me and I knew that, so when they where like ""oh come hang out"" I would just slip away into the back of our oval where I would sit by myself and their group thought I was trying to migrate when I wasn't but the thing is my old group was talking to the group I was trying to be invited to so my group old group was saying things like ""He's racist"" ""He's talking shit about you"" and so on (some thing I don't want to say bc its disgusting) none of it was true, so they hated me before they even had a good look and now that has spread and everyone hates me apart from the 2 nice people in my class

in there point of view I am sometimes annoying and they think that I am annoying for being confused about new stuff and not understanding social things, I also have a big hate for this world and I am quite open about hating most things, I would also disappear for my emotions and I guess that upset them, but apart from all that I was honest and trying my hardest to understand people.

Weirdly enough, it never bothered me much throughout the year, but it has been something that I slowly picked up on during quarantine.

He's full of shit, because I know for the fact that he said those things, but confronting him about it has proven to be useless because I've hit a brick wall with him.

537,"I have been a fan of a lot of different artists and listening to their music or watching them perform has mostly been a positive experience. It inspires me to create my own music or helps me beat anxiety and boredom. However,sometimes I get too emotionally attached to one of my idols. I obsess over the negative stuff: the drug addictions, mental health struggles, negative press or the mysterious circumstances of their deaths (Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley,  Brian Jones, Michael Jackson e.g)
I dont feel bad because I want to have actual relationships with these people but because I relate to their pain and I feel so bad about what happened to them.
I know some people may say, just stop watching/listening to an artist when you feel too consumed by the negative stuff. I just went through a phase of anxiety and apathy, nothing could excite me or bring me much joy.

Anyway, we’ve been together for like 6 years. She starts seeing an old boyfriend. He starts getting feelings. She starts getting feelings. They kiss. I should have left then hey? She tells me about this, I ask “do you have feelings for him” she says “I don’t know, I think I do”. Should have left again. I still stuck around. Few days later, this ex started messaging me FROM MY SO’s ACCOUNT threatening me for 4 hours, while I worked. “ThEsE aReNT tHReAtS tHEYrE wArNINgs” he says. I went to his house, smacked him. My SO turned out to be at his house, gave him a massive hug before she leaves and proceeds to get mad at me for “taking matters into my own hands”. She claims she was unaware of the threats. She still keeps a solid contact with him. 

We leave that town together. Move in with her parents. She still keeps contact with him. Ffw 6 months, she still keeps contact, the messages are getting flirtatious. I’m planning on leaving her parents place to live in my car because her parents are the fucking worst. Egotistical, narcissistic, pathological liars, just the whole fucking shabang. Anyway, the whole time she is telling me that she will stop talking to him, she will tell him that she’s taken, she will tell him that she loves me and me only, but none of that EVER happened. “I love you xx” he says. She just drags it out and avoids it all. He has now told her he loves her multiple times now, and for all I know she can be saying it back. She talks to him on the phone EVERY DAY. And has the nerve to get angry at me for standing up for myself? She speaks to him every day, more words than she says to me in a day. And yet I’m the one stuck wondering what the fuck I’m doing. She told me I was the reason that she kissed him; because I got all in her head asking what she’s doing with him, and I told her she’d gain feelings for an ex boyfriend and I was uncomfortable with that and she told me I was stupid for thinking that.

I feel I’m going to be stuck in an angry, betrayed loop that I won’t ever get out of as long as this guy is in the picture, and I’m just not willing to do this shit anymore. It’s gotten to the point of suicidal ideations just to comprehend a bit of happiness. I can’t and won’t be a god damn doormat anymore. Everybody is cunts and it’s hard to see otherwise when I just get bent over by every single person I meet. No more, and this is my first step!

547,"I've always just seen him as a guy who makes mistakes but never means to. I wouldn't say I had a bad childhood, my parents split when I was 4 years old and my dad refused to move out of our 3 bedroom house, so my mum had to move me and my sister to a tiny place in a rough area, spending my trust fund to do so. The idea was she'd have a bit more time to pay back mine versus my sisters but she was never financially stable enough to repay it because she only had a part time job and 2 kids to raise. Today, I was excited to spend time with my dad, we're in lockdown here so I don't get to see many people and we made plans to see eachother, but he just didn't show. I haven't even had a text from him. I was really sad about this so I messaged my sister, which brought up the conversation. For context on what sort of stuff he would do, I've copied and pasted the message from my sister, and written a couple of other examples. Note that Faith was a beloved family dog that we got after moving away from my dad, he didn't own her or help look after her in any way except for playing with her when he visited on weekends. I've been diagnosed with high functioning autism and severe comorbid depression and anxiety, also just to clarify:

""Not believing in your diagnosises and acting like mum was an awful parent for years when she was doing her best, a lot of shouting, being drunk and passing out when he was supposed to be looking after us, smashing stuff, screaming at faith purposefully to try and trigger her seizures, blaming mum for ""killing faith"" in front of us seconds after she came back from the vet and was in tears, coming over to steal alcohol, keeping us outside in cornwall and when we went home ill, blaming mum""

And there's more. I remember once he came to my old school to see me after he called the police on my mum for a 'bomb threat' (he took a joke made online, which was on a private account that he shouldn't have been able to see and took it completely out of context and tried to get my mum arrested) and I wouldn't talk to him, and when my mum picked me up afterwards she was really panicked because she knew I didn't want to see him at all. 

There have also been occasions where he's put me at risk by knowingly putting me into situations that he was told I couldn't cope with because of my diagnosises, not to mention he's tried to turn me against my mum and sister. He's also got a habit of making plans, like today, and then just not showing up, leaving me feeling completely heartbroken and really disappointed.

I'm glad I didn't put the pieces together sooner. I've always had this feeling of anger towards him but I figured it was just teenage angst and bitterness that I couldn't have both parents in the same room for important moments in my life. 

Now that I've realised just how awful he's been though, I don't know how to deal with it. I've been trying to fix my relationship with him over the past 6 months, and I don't feel like it would be right to just stop talking to him so suddenly. I don't want to talk to him though, and I especially don't want to bring up the past to him because I don't think an apology will help, it'll just make everything he did more real. What do I do here?

I make my own cigarettes, and thanks to the tobacco that I use, one cigarette feels like three, and I still smoke around 20-25 a day. This has a detrimental impact on every aspect of my life.

Because I smoke, I always feel like shit, especially the mornings when I wake up feeling sick and dizzy, as well as having zero energy. It always takes me around half hour to get out of bed. I also suspect that I have sleep apnea, but I'm not sure, it could surely explain some of my symptoms, with an added bonus that smoking is a stimulant, meaning that it takes me longer to go to sleep, and when I to, the quality of sleep is reduced thanks to the need to smoke, that doesn't go away in your sleep. Now, because I sleep like shit, I don't have energy to do anything, and because of that, I almost never work out. Because I don't work out, and I sleep like shit, adding the smoking, I don't have neither the energy nor the motivation to eat better. Because of my diet and lack of exercise, my sleep suffers. 

You get the picture. It is really bad. Not to mention all my other bad habits like wasting most of my day (not on social media, thank the heavens I have zero interest in it). It takes me 3-4 hours to drink my coffee so I can fully wake up and stop feeling groggy, and then I just lay around, watching Youtube or anime, and occasionally doing something productive or worth while. At work, my performance is mediocre, the same in bed. I think I might have actually developed erectile dysfunction. 

The next thing is grooming. I feel like shit, so I don't have the energy to take better care of my appearances, and I'm also really apathic and cold, meaning that my self-confidence is suffering. 

When I was 13 I first found out about the world of self-improvement, and I achieved the great feat of implementing a lot of great habits into my life just in one summer break. I was fat, but in three months, I lost 25 kg. I started meditating every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. I started working out, eating really really well, reading like crazy, discovering and exploring, finding out about binaural beats, lucid dreaming, visualization, meta learning, the mind palace, nootropics, proper nutrition, intermittent fasting, tips and tricks about productivity and discipline, my sleep was awesome, my motivation through the roof, my cognitive abilities off the charts, as well as picking up some passions like beatboxing and Sherlock Holmes, and everything was fueled by pure curiosity. 

At 14, I started smoking, as well as high school, and over the years, everything that was good and healthy in my life started to fade away. In most of my highschool years, I was actually addicted to energy drinks. So 8 years have passed and I'm a mess, I hate myself and my life, I don't feel depressed or hopeless, just really stuck, and I can't seem to find my way out. I won't mention anything about my current relationship because she might find out and I'm not really sure I'm ready for it, but I'm not satisfied about that aspect of my life either. I struggle to make ends meet, and I'm really fucking exhausted. 

I even read and listen to a lot of great audio books such as ""You can't hurt me!"" by David Goggins and atomic habits as well as the subtle art of not giving a fuck, and many more, but nothing seems to stick for more than a week or two, and I keep coming back to my old self. I tried quitting smoking for like forever, and again, nothing seems to work. 

So, guys, having said all that, I really look forward to what you have to say. I really do feel stuck, and your help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",08Nov2020,1

We planned this 1 month ago. 1 week after they decided to uninvited me from it because they said it would be awkward and they didn't wanna baby sit, they are all 14 and up. It honestly hurt when they told be but I just said whatever. My mom asked me if I was ok with all the snacks and food they were having on the picnic because I tend to gain pretty easily, I work out though lol. Anyway I told her yep because it was only for a day but then I remembered and told her I wasn't going. She asked me why and I told her they didn't want me to go because they thought it was gonna be awkward with me around. I cried lol. And I don't even cry that easily -_- apparently it hurt a lot more than I though it would. My mom was especially shocked that I cried lol because I REALLY don't show my emotions too much. Anyway my mom got mad at my sister and said she couldn't go because I wasn't going. And that even if they wanted me to go I still wouldn't go because they just wanted my sister to be able to comes my mom said that the age difference between me and one of the members was only months so why wasn't I allowed to go. Now I feel bad because as of right now my sister isn't going. Was I being a brat? Ugh I don't want to be a brat. I need advice on how I should react to this. I should ask my mom to let R go fore sure right?",08Nov2020,1
553,"I (23f) have been in a really bad place for a really long time and I can’t seem to shake it. I semi-recently broke up with my boyfriend who I was living with. I reached out to my family and asked if I could stay with them temporarily and they said no. They didn’t help me at all in any way. So I found a room to rent in a house and I have been here for a few months. 

I don’t really see or talk to any of my roommates. I have been going on tinder and bumble just so that I can have interactions with people, even if it’s just sex. Always ends with me being disappointed or sad. There’s so many scumbags. And I am also really really ashamed about even being on dating sites (would never tell family or anyone from work about it). 

I am also really ashamed about how much weed I have been smoking lately. It’s been everyday, pretty much any time I’m not at work. I don’t want to admit any of these things to my therapist. I always feel like I can’t be honest about the “bad” things I do. 

I seriously have no friends or family that I can reach out to. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to get better. I can’t be vulnerable in therapy, so it’s not even helping me. It’s also so fucking expensive and I really don’t have a lot of money. I just feel so much dread. I don’t know how life will get better. I don’t know how to go through life without a support system. I don’t know what the fuck I am supposed to do when I feel so unstable. I just want to call someone and cry and distract myself but I have no one. Not one friend.",08Nov2020,1
554,"I work as a security guard at a mall. At least a third of the people don't bother to wear masks. Our area has a lot of COVID infections per day. Four stores have had to close this weekend because of COVID infections among the employees, with every employee at one store being infected. I had talked with them face to face (ie. no social distancing) just a few days ago (and surprise they weren't wearing masks). I started getting a real bad headache a few days ago, and now I've got a bunch of nasal congestion and shortness of breath. 

While I don't know for sure that I'm infected, I also don't feel comfortable working while it's a distinct possibility that I am. I encounter and talk to dozens of people every day, and pass by at least a hundred. 

My supervisor doesn't share my concerns, and says that I have to continue working unless unless I show real signs that it's COVID and not the flu or I get a positive test result back. The only place I can get tested today is gonna cost me $150 upfront, though they say that they can get me results within an hour. That's a pretty big cost, especially seeing as I'll be out of work for a bit, maybe longer since they could decide to just fire me and get a replacement.

I have no one to talk to about this. Everyone I know doesn't take this pandemic seriously. I don't know what to do. I don't want to put other people in danger, but I also don't want to lose my job.

557,"Me and my cousin have been best friends since we were 7ish. We didn’t always get along really well but a few years ago we got really close, planned to live together and were in a band together. She always mean so much to me and I put her above everything, relationships, family, other friendships etc.

My life is her life and vice versa. I’m older by two years so I’m more experienced in certain things however specific things like singing, talking to people, confidence etc she’s way better. 

It might not sound bad but she copy’s everything I do, when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. I cant like anything without her taking it and making it ‘hers.’ I cant even tell her about the most important things to me because I know it will be hers soon. All my friends like her better and the second she’s left out she’ll seek everyone’s attention by doing dramatic things. If I’m having a bad day, hers will be worse. I just hate being around her because she’s ALWAYS trying to one up me. 

I deleted social media a few months ago but my nana always tells me how she posts things constantly degrading herself and waiting for someone to take pity on her. I wish people could see how much of a bitch she can and has been. 

When I first came out as bisexual she said it made her uncomfortable and would always slag me off to her friends. Now she’s come out and I’m happy for her but it wasn’t fair of her to put me through that. She took the piss out of the way i dressed but now anything I wear, she will have the next day.

558,"Ok im kinda lost here. Im a guy and I love gay sex. I just love dicks in general. I love them in my ass, in my hand, deep in my mouth and throat etc. Idky tho. Im not gay i like women. I prefer women. I just like guys sexually, not romantically. And as much as i enjoy gay sex i dont want to do it. I dont wanna live this kind of life yknow? Everytime i nut to the fantasy i feel hella guilty. Can someone help me figure out why im obsessed with same sex lust? Heres a few reason why i think so:

1. Could be coz back in about i think 2015 i had ate tons of popcorn. Like i wuz literally on a popcorn diet. I ate popcorn for like 30 days straight. And towards the end of the month i had to poop out a lot of popcorn kernels. One day my asshole wuz itchy so i scratched the outside. Then i felt a kernel kinda lodged inside my asshole (like yknow how the asshole has walls before u get to the rectum? Yea there). So i got the idea to lube up my finger and dig inside. After i did i got the kernel out and scratch my log cutter and it felt incredibly good. Then i think u can figure out the rest. I went in and out and felt sexual pleasure and ever since ive been sticking things in my ass.

2. My sisters friend used to kind of molest me. Long story short we were both young, i didnt wanna tell coz i thought id get in trouble, plus sum things she did felt amazing, etc. But one specific thing she did wuz dry hump my butt. Could that be it? 🤔

3. Im thinking i might've just been raped as a baby by sum perv and now im reaping the literal seeds the dood probably planted in me 🙃

              When I was 12 my brother (15) licked and sucked my nipples on two different occasions for like a minute. When it happened I didn’t really care, and just thought of it as an annoying thing like if he had tickled me, and I punched him on his arm, pushed him away and said something like “ew you’re so disgusting” and he laughed it off.
          I didn’t feel afraid or violated, I just felt irritated and mildly disgusted. Apart from that we have had a pretty normal sibling  relationship.
         But now that I’m older and remember it, it sounds weird as fuck. I’m not sure if I’m over exaggerating by thinking it’s sexual assault. A part of me thinks it was just weird kid behaviour like slapping a friends ass or if I’m subconsciously making excuses because he’s my brother.

567,"So here's the story. I have recently in the past few months had not great luck with men. I've had guys ghost me a lot or just not be super interested in me, which is fine but it was just starting to kind of frustrate me.

So last week, I went to a little halloween party with a few girls in my sorority and then I came back home and my roommate had some friends over. She had texted me that one of the guys I might like or think he was cute, and when I met him I did think he was decently cute. However, I was drunk and he also didn't say much during the night besides when we were playing drinking games. My friend told the guy he should ask for my snap, so he did and we parted ways.

I waited a few days for him to maybe snap me, but he didn't so ultimately I just ended up messaging him and asking if he would want to hang out because I thought he was decent enough when I met him.

So we meet up for coffee and... he's just not that interesting. The date felt like an interview. I understand that people can be shy and that's not really a problem, but I was asking a ton of questions and he wasn't asking me anything. When a topic would fizzle out, he would kind of just sit there awkwardly until I could fill the silence. The conversation was honestly like pulling teeth. The worst part out of all of this, is that I realized he really isn't that attractive to me. When I met him it was dark and I was drunk and I thought he was kinda cute, but in sober broad daylight I just couldn't see it.

Now, i'm usually really not picky with appearance, like if the personality is there you can become way more attractive to me and appearance doesn't matter a ton. The problem is, the personality just wasn't there on this guy and that almost exacerbated the appearance issue.

My roommate asked me about how the date went when I got home and I told her the truth and she seemed really disappointed. Later in the night, my other friend came over to hang out with us and I was getting kind of frustrated because they kept asking me things like, ""well what was wrong with him"" or ""why was it bad"" and I just couldn't give them an answer that didn't sound mean or shallow. One of the worst things was when my friend said, ""Hannah this is what you've been wanting and now you're just not into it,"" insinuating that just because i've been having boy troubles lately I should settle for whoever comes along and is nice to me.

Here's the thing, I feel like i'm allowed to have preferences and opinions and if somebody doesn't appeal to me, that's fine, somebody else will be great for them but it's just not me. The guy asked me if I would want to hang out again and I said yes just to give him one more shot, but i've decided if nothing changes on the second date i'm just gonna let him down nicely because I don't want to lead him on.

I guess more than anything from this post I want to ask, am I being too shallow and picky? I feel like my friends are basically saying, ""beggars can't be choosers"" to me, but I feel like i'm still allowed to have a certain ideal of what I want.",08Nov2020,1
568,"I am getting my sister in law a present for my family's Christmas. Every year I make some kind of art, usually a drawing or a painting or something. It is a secret santa, and so every year we all get a different person. This is the 2nd time I have gotten my sister in law.

Last year I got my sister in law, and I painted her a picture of her child and my sister in law's grandmother (so her kid's great-grandmother) reading a book together. I think she really liked it.

I want to make a notebook of my own custom paper and fill it with drawings of her children, her and her sisters, her parents, etc. but I feel like it might be a silly gift and she would rather something of practical use. She is extremely busy and I know she already has a lot of art and/or framed pictures or whatever that are just sitting around because she does not have time and/or does not have room to hang them up. So I feel like giving her another work of art might be too much.

The reason I want to make a notebook with my own custom paper is because I saw something online about how to do it, so I want to do it purely for the experience of making it, and the gift for my sister in law is kind a of nice additional side thing to it. Like I said though I am hesitant to get this for her because she has a bunch of clutter in her house already.

What do you all think? Would getting her a collection of drawings and pictures and all that flatter her? Or do you all think I should get her something she can actually use to de-stress her life?

I told her she can't be talking to these people, and she hit back with ""I can't let people have that kind of platform, cause what happens when someone listens?"" 

How do I convince her not to fight these. I promised her no one gives these people a second thought, especially around here.

When he wasnt around i started to ask our friendgroup about some of the lies he told us and we all said some of the shit he told us and chatted about his 'friends'. one of my friends messaged him about something he said about her, then later he messaged being like what the fuck is wrong with you why would you tell her that and shit i just ignored it.

Many of the adults give very helpful advice and so do the club seniors. But at the same time we do many activities and strive to go beyond excellence most of the time (motto of the group)

It seems pretty good right? Except I’ve been spending a lot of time there to the point where I’ve become like a core member in which many club juniors depend on and there have been more and more responsibilities in which I have to handle

The thing is I’m starting to feel more overwhelmed and have thought of quitting several times except I do not want to disappoint the seniors or adults of the club nor do I want to leave the juniors without someone to look to by leaving

581,"Hi! I've currently got an S8 Active. It is a Samsung. I've had it about four and a half years. It's the ONLY phone that's survived me this long.
Long story short, I'm clumsy. I drop my phone constantly. I don't want to worry about my phone breaking when it falls. I know I can get a good heavy case, if there's a really really good phone I'll go for that.
If there's a good smart phone that'll survive me, let me know. Otherwise, tell me about the best functioning phones that I could buy. I currently am on sprint/t-mobile. I CAN switch to Verizon, if it matters.
Thanks!!",08Nov2020,1
582,"So today really got me broken, let me start by saying that my dad scratched me on the forehead today.

I can admit that I kicked him on his leg too(because I can't take him anymore). So the reasoning to me kicking him was that he rushed into my room just to start yelling at me for “not having done my homework” which I already finished, which led to him yelling at me for not putting up my keyboard (the instrument), and I said “i will do it as soon as this round is over'' as I played amongus on my phone with some friends at that moment, and the round was soon over. And fixing the keyboard is literally putting it on my desk and plugging it into electricity. But what does he care. He started yelling at me while I tried to finish the round so I could get off and fix it, because I didn’t just wanna randomly leave without explanation, and I couldn’t unmute myself to tell as he was screaming at me. So he started trying to drag my phone from me and scratching on my hands to get it, and that of course hurts and it annoyed me that he couldn’t wait 5 minutes, but yeah as he tried harder and harder and it ofcourse hurts to be scratched on your hands so I decided to kicked him back to get him away.(this is technically not the only reason also because I can’t deal with him anymore, he has been acting bad since, forever, I mean the last post I did here is an example, and I can give countless of cases where he is bad) after I had kicked his leg (he didn’t even fall or look to have needed to fall) he tried to slap me or scratch me but failed as I got my hands up, but he got one nail finger on my forehead, and so I got scratched, and because of that I tried to kick him away again as it hurted and I was still enraged at him. and because of this he tried to reach for me again but couldn’t and just decided to unplug my computer and everything to it and took away my computer and phone and said I would never get it back. 

Yes of course you take a phone and computer which is my only access to people who gives me my emotional support, who I actually love and that helps me, and I mean they took away the only entertainments I have, talking and playing with friends and drawing, so yeah they don’t really have anything more to take away from me, and so I have nothing to lose. I mean they can take away my school computer (which I'm writing from right now), but doing that would take away my access to most of the school information and prevent me from doing some of my homework(they seem to have forgotten about it so far) .But yeah I can’t take it, my emotions is just jumping out of me. he have started to call me(has happened before too)  useless, sutpid,i can’t become anything, you will not be worth anything, because I got an E in my German (even tho I've been working hard to get it better as my old teacher taught us nothing), while otherwise the lowest grade is an C and I got lots of Bs and As.

and then they are asking why I don't want to do stuff with them(even though they force me to anyway), maybe because as soon as I talk they WILL find something to complain about, and how fun is it to be constantly worth nothing and being called useless, that you can’t do anything, wasting your life.(just an example was when they forced me out on a walk with them yesterday and I ended up being complained about everything I like doing, that I'm wasting my life, I'm not gonna be able to become anything, my german again and it is draining me). I got the suggestion last time to try give him a letter, and I've been trying to write something but I really don’t think it will work, he is really narcissistic if I point something out about him he rejects it and starts pointing out stuff about me who doesn't even need to be true, yeah that is a thing I've seen, he loves blaming me for stuff out of no reason at all and often not of true reasons, I have countless examples if needed, and I can give later if needed(this is already longer then I thought I would make it), but yeah, I don’t know what to do anymore, I can't take it really I can’t(I've literally been crying for an hour right now) , my mental health is draining more and more for every day.

I gave her my snap, and I got an add from an arabic name which made me sus. But i checked her score and it was 58k. I figured it was okay. I sent a nude (no face), then she unadded me, after saying she'd send one back. I didn't care at first, because i figured she was just too shy to send a pic back, or did it for laughs.

585,"For reference, I'm from the US and my school has a hybrid learning model (some students go in person some days and other students go the other days).

Anyways, there's this guy at my school, D, who is a grade below me. Based on actions I've observed, he appears to be a shy guy.

We had a math class together last year and worked with each other several times on partner and group assignments. During the first semester, my teacher used assigned seating (which was why D and I worked together), but she allowed us to choose our seats during the second semester. Although D usually sat by himself, he chose to sit at my table group at some point, perhaps because he sensed that I was (am) like him.

This year, D and I are in the same hybrid group, meaning that we go to school in person on the same days, and we have math class together again. On days where we go to school in person, I've noticed that there have been at least several instances where I've seen him staring at me. 

Given this behavior and his past behavior, I think D is interested in me but is hesitant to make the first move. I want to approach him too, but I don't know how I should do it. Do you have any suggestions for how I can talk to him?",08Nov2020,1
586,"Just yesterday, my mom was out in the front yard for the first time in a while, because she stays safe indoors for the most part. Our next door neighbor, who I know from her facebook to be pretty anti-mask and covid-denying, walked on over to my mom, who was wearing a mask, and asked her to button her shirt cuffs for her, (which is odd enough on it’s own). My mom accepted and mid-way through, she started to make conversation and my neighbor brought up the fact that a kid at the school she worked at tested positive for coronavirus. 

Now, I don’t know how valid that is or if she said it just to rile my mom up and spread her covid-enlightenment, but my mom did get riled up with her. My mom asked her why she wouldn’t tell her before walking on over to my mom and informed her that she might’ve just transferred it to her. She refused and starting spurring nonsense about Biden and how she’s strong enough to not be infected. My mom denied her claims and told her that she is in the exact age group that is prone to the virus.

Now i’m asking for advice here because I feel like my neighbor should be held accountable, but i’m not sure there’s really anything my mom can do, and if she can, it won’t be worth the effort.

588,"Keep reading for the back story, otherwise just scroll all the way to the bottom.

I’ve been at my apartment since summer of 2017. I got this apartment with a boyfriend of four years who left me for another girl back in may 0f 2019. I’m over that but the reason I provided that info is because there’s a lot of history and memories to this apartment.

Recently my boyfriend of 9 months left me. 2020 has been a really bad year for me because I lost so much money from taking care of my ex and my friend. I also lost a beautiful car due to my friend crashing it. She was never suppose to drive it and drove it without my permission. She was paying me back and basically decided to not pay me back anymore and left my apartment without telling me. I went from having 8,000 in my bank account to 100 dollars in 2020 because of this car accident and because I was paying for everything to keep both of them surviving. (They both were living with me.) I finally hit my breaking point, I am only 23 years old.

My ex just left a few days ago. I’m hurting from just everything that I lost this year. I’m financially doing better so that’s good, I still have a car, just sucks it isn’t as nice as the previous one I had.

I’m not moving anytime soon because this apartment is cheap and helps me save so much money.

I temporarily deleted all of my social media for atleast 30 days. I blocked my ex completely. But I want to do a cleanse. 

I want to just cleanse all the sad and negative energy in my home. How should I do that?",08Nov2020,1
590,"I've been feeling really alone lately. The only person I could talk to was my therapist. But now that my CBT is over I have to have a new therapist for the next four months. Because I had no one else to talk to I would look forward to her conversations. But I don't know, I feel so alone. I dont talk to my siblings and they're really terrible siblings tbh and i dont have any mates. I used to talk to one girl that i thought was alright, but she would only message me when she wanted something. I messaged my online mate today. So that felt okay. But I dont really have anyone physically with me and it feels terrible. I went to the hospital a few days ago and they bought up the isolation I feel. It never occurred to me in a weird way.

Now she tells me she gets blunt with them and tells them to piss off, but they call her a few times every now and then. 

My gf used to be known to also make prank calls to people, and even though she said she only prank calls girls, I know this is a lie, but as it’s so immature anyway I don’t care, but am I wrong in feeling pissed off that these guys still call her even though she tells them to piss off?

I feel like we have deep conversations, tell some private stuff about ourselves, I love the way she sees the world, I really love a lot of things about her. So yeah I realized that I was developing feelings for her. 

I just don't know if it is too soon, and even if she reciprocates those feelings. But I just can't talk to her normally since I figured that out, and I would like to things to either go back to normal, with me not freaking out every two seconds, or develop into something more.

Should I  wait for clearer signs from her part that it's the good time? Or should I just tell her upfront?",08Nov2020,1
593,"Sorry in advance for English mistakes.  
I (22f) have always been shy and introvert as a kid, with occasional moments in which I was more open to people, but generally I've been always described, and considered myself,as shy. But, since my teen years, the time my character developed into what I am now, I noticed some behaviors that for me were normal, and which I just considered as parts of my particular character. The thing is, if I imagined someone I knew having my behaviors, I would immediately think they are complete weirdos. Anyway, the suspect of being autistic comes to my mind since one year circa, and I finally decided to post this after I watched videos and read posts in which autistic people described what affects them in their everyday life, and I actually recognised some of those behaviors. It will be difficult for me now to elencate all of them, so I'll just start with some. First, I don't like being with many people. I will stay with them for a while, then I'll feel the urge to go to some hidden spot and stay there by myself until I get completely rested. Sometimes it's hours.  In these situations, I often get extremely irritated, I notice everything people is doing, and after a while I will just start being super irritated and pissed at everything, even the silliest things. When the irritation reaches the top I'll usually get hysterical- mildly to heavily. After the hysterics, I usually feel like I can't speak, and if someone is asking me questions, it's hard for me to speak and give an answer. Btw, I usually enjoy social gatherings when I can just sit there and observe the other people. I'm very clumsy and awkward when I have to greet someone, I'm unable to say pleasantries, I tend to avoid contacts with strangers, I feel embarrassed to eat in public places, I in fact never go to a restaurant or I'll feel uncomfortable all the time. Just yesterday I refused to eat a pastry at the bar with my friends because the cashier was still behind the counter. I can't wear helmets of any type, the idea of wearing one gives me panic, if I'm going on a scooter with someone I will literally refuse to wear it, it's stronger than me. I don't like hats. I needed months just to be able to wear a mask without panicking. To all this background, there are some weird things I do all he time, I can't tell them all because it's too much, anyway the people who know me just think I'm a little bizarre. I also used to believe that, but ow I really feel like my behaviors are invalidating me. 
I'll finish with one thing I'm very proud about: the last winter I went to Russia all by myself ( I live in a southern European country) to visit a friend, I was hosted in several couchsurfers's homes (extremely awkward), I stayed there for 17 days then I came back in March when my country was in full pandemic and my flights were cancelled, and with no phone because I dropped it and broke it in Russia. The most terrifying time of my life but I'm extremely proud of myself for it. This was out of context and I apologise if I bored you. So, are these behaviors typical of autistic people, or can also non autistic people have them? Am I just weird? Do I have some other mental illness? Thank you for any reply.",08Nov2020,1

I'm a nice outgoing person and I'd literally do anything for anyone. I dont even know you irl but I'd take a bullet for you if it meant you got to spend more time on this planet.

598,"Okay, context: My friends and I are in our last year of high school in my country. I moved to this country 2 years ago and found myself a group of friends immediately (not because I’m cool or anything, the head teacher introduced them to me and we all “clicked”). There were originally 4 of us, then 5, then 7 for  short while earlier this year, went down to 6 and then the story begins when my closest friend (F) in the group left the second week back because of the “leader” of the group (V). It’s a long story, but can be simmered down to: V was controlling and overall disrespectful towards F for quite a while and F had had enough. 

Now time for the story: So, since F left, V has been weird with me... it was tense most of the time and we’d have the same petty arguments they would have before (but I’d normally drop it much faster). There’s also been quite a few comments that were obviously directed towards me, and ignoring me if I tried to join in on a conversation. It was getting increasingly hurtful and noticeable, to the point the newest member noticed and we talked about it later. I decided that I would try to leave the group for a little while to see if that would let things calm down (assuming everyone is just tense because of COVID). 

About a week ago, I found our F had been self-harming a while ago. And on Thursday, a series of event (involving F forgetting her jumper in PE) ended in V (as well as the school, quite a few other student and her parents) finding out as well. 

After that lesson I brought her to her friend who she hangs out with quite often, we brought her to the office and she was brought to the equivalent of a school counsellor. While she was with them, I went to talk to V. (Our other friends were in a practical exam, and there was a girl with V, to, I guess, give her support?) I found her in the bathroom, upset and ranting. Apparently I accidentally gave her the impression that F’s issues were her fault (okay, I’ll admit, I didn’t have a great reaction when she outright asked me) and she was very upset with that thought: “I really hope this isn’t my fault” and “ugh, I feel like a horrible person”. I, being fed up with her making herself seem like the victim whenever something goes wrong involving her, and butting her nose in everyone’s business, said “yeah, how do you think she feels”. 

Queue the human equivalent to a bomb going off: “I KNOW EXACTLY HOW SHE FEELS! AND IT F****** SUCKS THAT SHE CANT TELL ME STUFF ANYMORE” and “NOW I FEEL LIKE A HORRIBLE PERSON BECAUSE YOU CANT GIVE ME STRAIGHT ANSWERS”... etc. And because I don’t deal with people yelling at me very well, I stood there in shock. She and O left me standing there after about 30 seconds of V screaming at me. I took a minute, acknowledged the other person in the room, and left. I went to sit with a group who’ve I’ve been becoming closer to in recent weeks and I’ve been hanging out with them at break and lunch since. F is okay-ish and she is really happy I stood up for her, but is sorry I got yelled at and is absolutely pissed at V. My mom wants me to try and deal with it on my own unless I really can’t (life skills and all that jazz) and I’m conflicted. They haven’t come to talk it out yet, only one of them (friends from the group) has so much as smiled at me, and I really don’t know wtf what to do. I don’t want to lose these people as friends completely since we’ve been through so much together, but I can barely look V in the eye at the moment. I feel stuck, please help.",08Nov2020,1

600,"Throwaway Account.  


I'm 16 the youngest out of two.

How do I stop being sensitivity I ask this question because anytime I am being yell by my parent(or brother) I instantly cry some reason I don't know why. 

When I am with other people I just don't they don't affect me to cry as my parent it takes a lot for me to cry really when comes to a random person but when it comes to my parents and close relative it doesn't take a lot really.  


For example my mother would yell at me for anything for example I got yell at for not doing one side of the bed properly ( I was helping her do her bed) I did not have the urge to cry I just felt little embarrass.   


Usually when ever my mother ask me to do something she is not always specific sometimes so when she ask me to get her a brush so she can sweep the dust on the unit (Top of an cabinet or closet) she was holding a vacuum  I got brush from my brother one that you use to sweep ( she for one). 

She met a different brush a attachment on the vacuum she never told she met that she yelled at and in my defense I did not know you can use an attachment like that on vacuum itself because I always use it with another attachment this pole looking attachment you put on it my fault I initially chalk it up to it being my fault and that I just an Idiot.

Although my middle brother (or the middle child) of family he usually make fun and calls me names anytime I make a mistake or cry out because of something that is my fault or maybe not like for example one time long time ago during quarantine I will admit I blow my nose in front of him and his gf while they were eating in the kitchen my brother was pissed and said that do have to do that I fought back and defend then he said it was all of the principle of situation and I was wrong fine I toke the L and left to just cry for being idiot.

When happen next was my brother then also call me out for crying then escalate further by asking why ? I told him I didn't want to be bother and try to go downstairs then my parent asked what wrong? I yelled and said nothing bad move on my part and then I told them I didn't want this to happen then my brother and said this and I quote "" This would not happen if you did not act like a little girl "" then my parents told him to stop.  


I then went to tell this to my one of my friend he claimed my brother escalate the situation further and that it was not my fault it just that I need to take a deep breath and try deescalate sometimes (I think).

I actually am interested in politics and I had done quite well on most courses and even got a scholarship for two semesters, but studying was always a pain for me, I never read all the materials I was supposed to and I probably only had good grades because most teachers boost grades in my university. I have to start writing my thesis but I can't decide on a subject and even though there are a lot of topics that I'm interested in at first glance, I hate the idea of spending months on researching, reading, writing on any of them. 

I have no idea of what I'm gonna do after I graduate. I was thinking of pursuing a master's degree in something like Political Science, getting specialized in elections as that's probably the biggest job market in the field, but I don't feel motivated enough to actually put in the work. 

My parents gave me some financial support for the last three years, but I also worked and had my own money. Still, I can't imagine how they would react if I told them that i failed to write my thesis or that I didn't go for a master's degree.

I thought I said something weird, I was really worried I did something, because the truth is... I’m terrible at socializing. I’m a work in process, ever since quarantine, I’ve been on Omegle talking to people just to get rid of my awkwardness, and it’s gotten better, but I did get nervous when I saw she’s texted back.

I asked multiple people where I messed up in the conversation, nobody knew. I was actually really disappointed in myself, but then I noticed that she was starting to post less everywhere. She hasn’t uploaded a new pic since the beginning of October, she wasn’t uploading to her story as often, TikToks were slowing down. I kinda knew something was odd. One day, I noticed she changed her TikTok bio to “ty for the love. wont be postin for a long time. luv y’all&lt;3” and that’s when I knew something was really wrong. I texted her asking if everything was okay, and she never opened it. She started posting even less, and yesterday she deactivated her second TikTok account. This is an issue considering she was literally the least problematic TikToker out of them all, the only time you heard about her in those “TikTok Shaderooms” was when she got hacked, she was NEVER involved in drama. 

Today, she posted on her story saying “wanted to address a few things. i know i have deleted my spam on tik tok. i am posting some videos on my main maybe a few promos but shortly (next week or two) i will be deleting my main aswell. to those who respected me and spread nothing but love i want to thank you for such an amazing few years. but to those who have led me off my socials, i hope you find some positivity in your life rather than prying into a 17 year old girls privacy and life. i want to be happy and life my life without the negativity and i think this is the best option for me. just wanted to post this in advance. love y’all.”
This isn’t normal, something is going on, and it’s a shame that genuinely good people are being ran off of platforms in favor of these toxic ass creators. She did say she was staying on Instagram and she might reactivate her TikTok, but this has been really odd for her. I wanna see if everything’s okay and shit like that, be there for her like I’d want someone to be there for me, but she isn’t responding back to fans, most likely for privacy reasons. I do know two of her friends, but Idk if asking them to talk to her would really be appropriate. What’s the best way I can help without getting in the way of things?",08Nov2020,1

613,"Everytime I spend money I feel so bad about it, and a part of me hates myself for enjoying spending money on things I don’t need. I genuinely get mad at myself for thinking about buying nonessentials.

I’ve been fighting myself for so long about buying new clothes. Most of my clothes are from middle school (I’m in college), and the rest are hand-me-downs/presents, so I’ve always told myself I don’t need to buy clothes. There isn’t anything “wrong” with them, but sometimes I hate my clothes because they don’t feel like “me” or my style.

I just get so fed up with my wardrobe that I just start spending money on things I want. I usually end up loving what I buy, but I always shame myself for using my money.

For example, pre-corona I went to Goodwill because I love visiting thrift shops. I found an army green pullover hoodie and a leather jacket, both of which I really wanted. Still, I kept on going back and forth (the cashier and the person behind me ended up convincing me to buy the stuff). I wear them all the time and it was a good decision to buy them, but I can’t help but think it was reckless because I didn’t “need” them.

My rational brain keeps on berating me and asking “why can’t you just be happy with what you have? You shouldn’t be spending any money!”

I don’t know what the right thing to do is. I don’t have many expenses (most of my college is covered by grants/sholarships) but I only work in the summer so I can’t replace money as soon as I spend it. What do I do?",08Nov2020,1

I owe $7800 to a credit card company. My debt has been bouncing from collection agency to collection agency , they’re usually want to settle for $4000

I owe $3000 to my previous college.

With incoming insurance money and what I have saved up, I’ll have around $7k soon.


Knee-jerk reaction - pay down my debts

The problem is I only have this rental car for 2?more weeks which is pushing it. I need another car to get around but another problem is my credit score is upper 500’s.

I’d prefer to pay for something outright, that won’t majorly affect my ability to pay down my debts again.

My mom prefers I get something awd/4x4 with ground clearance to better weather the elements, i feel , although it’d be nice, it is not needed where i live. 

The main struggle comes from my dad. He really wants me to get something less than 50k miles. Something legit. Any semblance of the car I’m looking at being a lemon he’ll try his damndest to steer me away from. 


Ideally I wanted to pay down my debts, and finance a car i’d actually want to daily, but i don’t think 2 weeks is enough time for my credit score to reflect all my paid down debts.

Week 2 =Off- Monday &amp; Tuesday, Days- Wednesday &amp; Thursday, Off- Friday - Sunday

623,"My girlfriend broke up with me three weeks ago. She’s causally talking to other people and I’m casually talking to other people. Although we’re no longer in a romantic relationship we’re still promising to remain really good friends. We’ve been through so much together and for the longest time we thought we were going to get married to each other. We’ve always been best friends, though we broke up when we both realized we were needing different things from our relationship.

I was on the swim team for the college we went to (which we both graduated from this year). Many of our friends as a result come from the athletic department and we were lucky enough to be invited to plenty of parties during our time there. When things open up again I definitely want to head down there with some fellow alumni and party with my former teammates. Although my main intention is to just have a good time with my friends, if the opportunity to hook up with a girl there comes up I don’t see any reason to turn it down. After all, I’m single now and if my ex chose to hook up with someone we both mutually new I wouldn’t mind it either. I think the only issue is if we were to hook up with someone we were both really really good friends with, since that could create a lot of drama. But I don’t see there being any problem with either of us hooking up with people we were friendly with but not that close to.

Right now my ex is saying that neither of us should hook up with people from school at all. She says that would make things weird between us and that if she were to find out about me hooking up with someone she would block my phone number and never talk to me again. I personally think that she’s being controlling and that she’s in no place to tell me what I can or cannot do, especially since we’re no longer together. I’ve felt controlled by her in my relationship before. Now that I’m single now I just want to make my own choices and do things for me. I’ve spent the last three years giving myself away to someone else but now a lot of friends and family are encouraging me to be selfish and do what makes me happy.

I definitely don’t want to throw away our friendship but at the same time I want to feel free to make my own choices. I’m afraid mainly of being the asshole in this situation. That’s also the main reason why I’ve never broken up with her myself. I just could never think of any situation where I would do that and wouldn’t feel like a complete dick. Things are different in this situation though since we’re no longer together. I want to do what’s best for me and my own happiness but at the same time I just want to know that whatever I do, I’m in the right. I don’t want all her friends to think I’m an asshole. I don’t want people placing that label on me. I also don’t want to do something I regret and throw our friendship away. But at the same time I want to feel free, and I’m frustrated that even after breaking up I’m still not getting that. Any advice regarding this situation would be greatly appreciated.

624,"Job Advice- Please (how to handle a to IV work environment?)

(It’s long but please help!)
I’m 32, single and an RN. My job is my life, really. I’ve worked in a few outpatient surgery clinics, worked at each for several years. I started a new job in July, someone I know put in a good word and I was hired with a pretty decent hourly pay increase. It is a single doc specialty clinic. I should have seen red flags from the beginning because they fire people, well, a lot. The employee turnover is huge. 

I was hired under the premise I would be solely working with other RNs. When I started, it was me and another nurse. Liked her very much, she was smart and hard working like myself. 

The job is very demanding. The RNs do EVERYTHING. We write every bit of the office notes, send all prescriptions, mark/numb/set up for all in office procedures...everything you can think of. The doc sees the patient for two min and gives treatment plan, or she will do the cutting for minor skin surgeries (she doesn’t even suture by herself). 

The practice sees 50+ patients a day, with procedures and telemed appts being scheduled over “lunch.” I have only ever taken 3 lunch breaks since I’ve worked there. There’s no time. 

Patients are usually pissed because they either have to wait forever, or bc the doc spends one min with them (or both). So I do a lot of apologizing. I am very well aware that a lot of doctors are very particular about things, and that “they are the boss.” Ive worked with doctors before and had great relationships with them!

My problem is...I don’t think I respect this doctor. She is unreasonable (I am a very hard worker and try to go above and beyond yet she will still find something “not good enough”) and she talks crap about other employees, usually alluding to her thinking they are dumb. 

The second nurse quit and for about a month and a half, it was just me. Same patient load. It was a lot. I wanted to cry often. Yet she was still demanding. I was frustrated. There were times when I couldn’t fake smile and kiss ass and would respond to her demands with an ‘attitude’ (I say this because I was reprimanded for being disrespectful...my ‘tone of voice’). I asked for an example of when I was rude and was told “I don’t have to give you anything because I am the boss.” Okay, I take responsibility and apologize, but I honestly kind of stand by my actions bc I was overworked and frustrated, and they didn’t care. More patients=more money. (I’m also reminded often by my manager that I make “a lot” of money and no where else will pay me that much). 

So, instead of hiring more RNs, they hired two medical assistants, I get it they cost less. I’ve worked with awesome medical assistants before and I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, they hired some duds. Spent a week training two MAs, one quit and they fired the other. Two more MAs...one is nice but lazy (the doc only sees the nice...I see the lazy bc I’m constantly fixing her mistakes). They fired the second one bc she wasn’t keeping up. Now we have another new MA who is smart and I like. 

I love my patients and I hate how I’m forced to rush everything bc of her patient load and the demand to do more to make more. She tries to sell very expensive cosmetic treatments to patients that don’t work nearly as well. As she promises (there are a lot of complaints).

The other day I had a stressful day, training the new MA, the other MA still making pretty big mistakes, and dealing with her micromanaging. I was washing blood off of my hands and she sought me out to tell me to grab the last pt of the day from the waiting room because she “had to leave.” I replied with “I’m going to finish washing my hands.” Maybe I said it rudely, very possible since I was frustrated, but apparently this was over the line to her. 

I got called into my managers office and reprimanded like a child for “being negative” and disrespectful. (Mind you I swallow a lot of shit from the doc and go to bat for her daily with all these complaints). So, I get upset and defend myself. Now I struggle with anxiety, I’m not great with eye contact and I fidget during meetings and such, but I listen and I’m a damn good employee. But apparently my “issues are not an excuse.” I’ve never gotten any positive feedback or “good job” from the doc, I feel like a kid desperately trying to please it’s demanding mother. and now I’m being told that I have to bring MORE to the table to earn my keep. I mean I couldn’t stop sobbing. I should have just quit then, I’m dreading work on Monday knowing the doc doesn’t like me and I co stay my need to worry about my job. 

I do have moments of frustration that I’m sure other ppl would be better at hiding, but I really do try and I’m great with the patients. Always. 

I don’t know if I’m supposed to plaster a happy face 24/7 and kiss ass (even if I don’t respect it) and just worry every day or if I should find a different job. Like I said, I live alone and don’t have many ppl to talk to about this, it’s really eating me up.",08Nov2020,1

627,"First of all i know this is a decision no one can make for me and that what you would do may not be the best for me to do but i'd really appreciate some input:

So a few months ago I (22m if that matters) returned to my homecountry in latinamerica after finishing my philosophy licence (for usa people this is the equivalent of a bachelor's degree) in France. I came back to my country with the idea of taking one year to think about what i wanna study for my master's degree, philosophy leaves me with a lot of open doors and since my parents aren't flooded with money i want to make a choice i'm almost sure i'll like so that they don't have to pay for extra years as i go from one degree to the other. For the last year or so i've been considering aiming at being an editor: i love books, specially fantasy novels, and i like the idea of helping people develop their ideas for books. Plus this would help me get better at writing as i also think i would like to be an author further down the road when i'll think i have better understanding on how to better write (yes i also practice writing on my own). So far i have no other field that really interests me to continue my studies but i'm still not 100% sure if i wanna go with this one.


Now, since i wasn't going to be just scratching my ass for the year i'm spending back in latinamerica, i looked for a job and found out that call centers actually pay fairly well, especially if like me you know another language besides english and spanish. So i went for that and, apparently, i'm great for it: i've only been working here for like a month and a half (and the first month was actually just training so i've only been taking calls for 2 weeks) and my team leader is already talking about promoting me, says the few calls of mine he has listenned to were great and that in a little more than a month there's a few mentor positions openning up and i'm the first person he thought of and that if i want it he'll start prepping me and use one of his recommendations on me (apparently his superiors asked him for 2 people).


Now cue in the dilemma: i'm a person who struggles a lot with mental health. I've had depression for nearly 10 years, suffer from anxiety, low self-esteem... and France felt amazing. I loved living there and i had a couple of months where i felt really great, I made some amazing friends, really got to feel at ease and i think maybe even started to climb out of the depths of depression. But it's also there where my future feels less certain (a master's degree i may not like and if i do, a very competitive workfield).
In latinamerica i have a rather goodlooking career ahead of me, a workplace where i can grow a lot (for reasons it takes too long to explain me and the members of my team have a lot of options to get promoted) but also a country where i don't feel very great. I won't name it as to not offend any potential readers from my country but ours is a country of closed-mindedness (is that even a word lol), insecurity, racism and sexism. So basically i got an almost-assured good career in a place i feel bad most of the time and a rather volatile career chance in a place where i feel great.

630,"TLDR: Got hired as a medical research assistant a few weeks ago (temp job lasting minimum of 8 months). While I appreciate finally having a job, turns out it's really more of a call center/telemarketer role involving lots of cold-calling that I dread doing. I know it's my own fault for not asking more questions during the interview. How do I get used to this job? Please help me reframe the situation in a more positive light so I don't dread doing it every day! 

&amp;#x200B;

Details/vent: I recently (a few weeks ago) got a new full-time job as a medical research assistant at a big university. I was excited because it's been really hard to find anything due to the pandemic, and even before the pandemic I had a patchy resume. 

Based on the interview, I knew \*some\* of my time was going to be spent trying to recruit research participants over the phone, which I was okay with, it's something I've done in previous jobs. I thought the bigger chunk of my time would be spent interacting with already-enrolled participants, administrative work, abstracting/reviewing medical records, etc. I should have asked more questions, because it turns out that actually for 75%-90% of my day I am expected to be cold-calling random people and trying to get them to answer survey questions/sign up for studies over the phone. 

I appreciate that they hired me, but I'm really disappointed. I feel like a telemarketer, not a research assistant. I had only one week of training, most of which was just about corporate policies, because the vast majority of my job will just be reading the same scripts, over and over, to people who mostly  don't want to hear it (not surprising). I have a bachelor's degree and research experience, and I was hoping this job would let me learn new skills/grow in my career. The worst part is, I have some social anxiety and I loathe having to cold call/bother people every day. I have been feeling dread every day after work because I know tomorrow it's more of the same. 

This job is temporary for 8 months, with the possibility of being extended. Quitting before the 8 months are up isn't an option, I have a patchy resume that I'm trying to fix and I need the job. I also don't want to burn bridges with this organization, as it's a major employer in my area where jobs are relatively scarce. I am just trying to find mental ways to reframe it so I don't dread doing it every day.",08Nov2020,1

Call me selfish I don’t care but marriage and having children are not right for some people,some people are not made for that.Honestly I don’t even mind marrying someone for the sake of my parents or my family or the society but having to have children is the deal breaker. I can never imagine myself as a mother as a parent and I can’t even think about the horrors of having to give birth or carry a child I just can’t. While I do constantly worry about finding the right guy who would let me fly and achieve what I want in life without pulling me down I’m also worried about letting my parents down because THEY LOVE CHILDREN. Especially my mom, i’ve never seen anyone who loves babies more than her and it would break her heart if i tell her that i don’t want children. She’s sacrificed and gone through so much for us so it might not seem fair to her but what about me? I love her so much and I don’t want to upset her but she’ll probably disown me or something if tell her the truth. I don’t know what to do. Help please!!",08Nov2020,1
639,"I'm a man who wants to date women. I spend most of my time at work. Women I work with are able to see my good qualities. I feel accepted by my female colleagues but that is all they will ever be to me. I do not want to risk my career by dating one of them and women have suggested to me in the past to date my co workers because of the reasons I just mentioned above. I know people meet at work and the results can be great. It's not for me, no offense. Dating apps also aren't for me. Again, no offense.

**I completely understand** that women feel safer dating a man once they have gotten to know them but this is usually in a situation where there are repeated interactions such as at work or consistently meeting at group gatherings whether with friends or others. I think these are both limiting situations. What if the woman I am interested in isn't in any of these situations. What if I just happen to see her while I am at the store or waiting in line at a cafe? When I asked about this before a lot of the responses I got from men and women were that it's wrong to approach a woman in this situation because we're ""*not entitled to their time*"". I never said I was entitled to anything. What I am saying is that I could go a very long time without seeing a woman I am physically attracted to and then it happens. I can either speak up politely or I can ask myself ""what if?"" countless times later. Also, as I said already, I understand women feel safe with a guy when a friend can ""vouch"" for them or if they got to know them for a while. This doesn't make a guy any more safe than if they met spontaneously without any prior interaction. I see it as a blind belief yet it's held true by so many. How often do we hear ""*he didn't seem like that kind of guy*""?

When I was younger (high school, college time, a little after college) I would be in situations where repeated interactions happened and I had total confidence that the women I was interested in would see all of my good qualities and say ""yes"" when I finally asked them out. To sum up a few of my experiences:

* I had one woman go completely cold on me and all I did was suggest eating somewhere. All contact stopped. Several months later they saw me and asked me when I was going to ask them out again.
* I had one woman tell me that she was waiting for me to ask her out again because women never say ""yes"" the first time. When I explained how asking multiple times can be seen as harassment she said those women were ""dumb"".
* I've had women flat out laugh in my face, tell me I'm ugly, that I'm out of their league, and many other hurtful things but as a man I am not supposed to express that these experiences hurt my feelings. I'm expected to be stoic and just try again. It hurts a lot. We had a whole campaign (and rightfully so) condemning men who didn't know how to be proper gentlemen but we have no such thing for women. It's seen as a good thing among women when a woman turns a guy down in a rude manner even if the guy was polite.

These experiences have led me to not wanting to invest much time when pursuing women. I'd rather find out much sooner if they're interested or not because it really hurts to be very optimistic and think you're doing all of the right things only to wind up still alone. When I get rejected I don't blame women. I have no bad feelings toward them at all. Instead I start to question if I am really the great guy I see myself as. I question if I am as attractive as I think I am. I start to think that my life is not as exciting as I think it is and that maybe I am someone no woman wants to be with. It's a horrible feeling.

When I approach women in public settings I still go in hoping she'll see my charm, wit, and good looks. I hope for the best but I always get rejected. What can I do to stop being written off so fast?",08Nov2020,1

643,"Every day all I do is eat, sleep, smoke/drink, repeat. If I don't numb myself in some way I cry all the time. This is not an exaggeration. I'm in my mid 20s and at this point I have no idea what I'm even doing. I have no direction in life, no drive. No passion. My friends complain I've gotten boring, but when I ask them for help, they don't understand, they only tell me to take anti-depressants, medication. But I'm in therapy, and my therapist doesn't think I am depressed. 

I think it's not depression, it's just a shitty life. I have so many problems, I can't possibly deal with them all. I'm chronically ill as well, which doesn't help. I just can't function as well as other people. 

It seems impossible for me to turn my life around. I can't find a job I don't hate. Came from middle class, but now I'm so poor I eat bread or noodles 7 days a week. I don't have family anymore so there's no one out there who cares or who I could talk to, besides the few friends who don't know what to do with me. I am so sick of myself but I don't know how to change. This isn't the life I want.",08Nov2020,1
644,"I moved in with my fiancé and my future fil in June when quarantine was ending. We'd spent 3 months apart and it was awful and I never want to go that long without seeing him ever again, but we had to do it to protect our families who are both vulnerable. We'd been living with our families because we were both working in the town my mom lives in and it was just easier whilst we were working there because I don't drive so couldn't get from his to work, and it was easier for him to stay over when he was working late shifts. He couldn't move in with me because my room was too small to fit his things in, he has his pc which is very important to him and cost a lot of money and also my sister is autistic and it would stress her out a lot. She likes my fiancé but she doesn't actually speak to him much because she's shy, and it's like a new person moving in which would be too much for her.

My mom constantly makes me feel guilty for moving out, always saying I need to stay over, and I think she thinks I'll move back in with her when covid restrictions are better even though I've told her many times I live with my fiancé now. I do go and see her every week, if I could I would see her more but I don't drive and she works on the other days.

I haven't actually spent a Christmas with my fiancé yet, and I feel so sad every Christmas that I can't see him (buses don't run and everyone wants to drink so no one can drive me and my fiancé drives a motorbike so can't pick me up). I love Christmas, and it makes me sad when I can't spend my favourite time of the year with my husband to be. I've spent boxing day and new years with him but it's not the same.

This year, since I've moved in with him, I actually have the chance to spend Christmas with my fiancé. And this year, his Christmas will be different too, usually him and his dad go to his grandparents house, but they can't because of the restrictions so I want to be with him because it'll be hard for him. I tried to talk to my mom about it but she kept saying my fiancé and I should go there, but that's so unfair on his dad to leave him by himself all Christmas. I can go and see my mom on Christmas eve (if restrictions allow) but that's not good enough for her.

I don't know how to talk to her about it because every time I try she changes the subject or cries and makes me feel guilty. I shouldn't have to feel guilty for being an adult, growing up, leaving home and spending Christmas with my fiancé. Once we get out own home it'll be different because then we can see everyone, but right now we're still broke so we're saving up.

How do I talk to her about this?",08Nov2020,1
645,"Hi everyone ! I’m writing here because I need to get an answer and see if I’m not overreacting.

I’m a nanny in LA and use a yahoo group called « peachhead nannies » to find families to work with. Last week I had a trial day with a new family... i didn’t expect that much workload and they basically wanted a housekeeper. Making the parents bed, their laundry, their meals. I really like working as a babysitter and not as a housekeeper. So I send an email after the second trial day and said «  it doesn’t work, but here’s the website that you can use to find another nanny ». The family doesn’t answer to my emails anymore, it’s been 4 days, and didn’t pay my wages for trial days. It’s only been 3 days, ans 7 hours total, but cash is short and it’s the first time that a family refuse to pay me. In their last email the dad was upset that he had to search another nanny but I really don’t feel comfortable working for them.

What do you think I should do ? Text them? Text the mom only ? I was thinking about posting a warning message about the family on the yahoo group to warn the other potential nannies 😠😓",08Nov2020,1
646,"Me and my friend are supposed to work on a side project together. A few months back, she was initially very excited and kept in contact often. Now over the past 2 weeks I haven't really seen her at work when we were supposed to start last week. We've been pretty personal with each other, and I do like her. Maybe she's distancing because she noticed I like her? We follow each other on Instagram. And while not a big deal i inadvertently discoveres she blocked me from her stories which featured information about our project. Not gonna bring that up because it's none of my business but that obviously put me off.  Has time to post on social media, but can't respond for weeks about a joint collaboration. It's frustrating because I did set aside time for this last week. I also have an opportunity to leave the company we both work for today. Honestly try to avoid posting this on reddit but I'm about done with this. Not sure what advice I'm seeking. Should I check in with her? Just move on?

So about 2 years ago i was in contact with this guy. We were best friends at first and fell in love later. It wasnt the time for both of us and we got in many struggles here..i was stupid enough to walk away instead of keep trying and i still havent forgive myself about this. He was and is the one for me. Sinds then i cant stop thinking about him. I dream about being with him and have a future with him. The problem is he moved not long after we lost contact, and he doesnt use social media at all. I dont have his phone number anymore. I do know where he works but showing up at somebodys work is to creepy for me.. 

I dont know what to do, does he even want to talk to me after al the things we went through? He's worth all the effort to get to know the answer but i just dont know how to get in contact without pushing myself directly in his face. I know i broke his heart by leaving at that point and i dont forgive myself this either. This also makes is harder for me to get in touch because i dont want to make him upset again. If he went on with his live and forget about me, i dont want hem to feel bad because of me contact him uninvited. So yeah redditors, please help me out. What should i do?

Me and partner have a holiday booked for Mexico cancun late February next year we booked this before covid and now have to pay our final amount, we’ve only put the deposit down which is £500 out of the final £3k. I’m aware flying to Mexico right now would require a 2 week quarantine even before the U.K. lockdown 2.

I was wondering if anyone was in the same situation, I can’t seem to find any information that shows that Mexico has ever been off the quarantine list since this started. Would it better to just cut the lost and loss the £500 than continue and hope that not only the U.K. but also Mexico are both fine to fly to February. My partner works from home but unfortunately I’m a key worker so can’t afford a 2 weeks quarantine

I know this sounds trivial with everything thats going on and it is to be honest, but I’m really just looking for any genuine advice.

657,"My boss and his favorite subordinate have displayed a pattern of unprofessional behavior for the last year.

Over a year ago my group was in a period of growth and transition. My original boss, Matt, was set to retire by the end of 2019. He was a good guy. Easy to work with and still made his expectations known. We got along really well and he always spoke very highly of me to his supervisor, even saying I should replace him because I always did my best and set the example for conduct and professionalism. Our supervisor, Bob, praised me a number of times. Admittedly, I was curious about being the team lead but I wasn't exactly vying it for it so I'm not bitter about not getting the position.

A few months before Matt was to retire, his replacement, Wesley already a manager, was picked and began training with us, along with his right-hand, Sherry. They both worked together in a different department. As the first weeks went on I was approached by a total of 8 people who worked with them in the other department warning me how difficult they can be. I took it with a grain of salt because for all I know maybe those 8 people are crazy. The first month went pretty well, we joked around and they offered good ideas.

Then the dynamic changed. One day I come into work and Sherry is berating a fellow coworker over some truly minor in front of  Wesley who didn't speak up. So, I stepped in and asked what was the problem. The fellow coworker, Jesse loaded up a cart with material to take to the warehouse but the elevator was broken but he didn't know that when he loaded the cart. So I asked, ""Is this really a big deal? He didn't realize and I don't think you even need the cart right now, Sherry."" Sherry then walks up to me and quietly tells me to shutup. I decided she gets one. If she does that again, next time we're going to have a real problem. Apparently, Sherry was on a warpath that week and pissed off somebody else and word got to our supervisor Bob who came by one day to find out how things were going since they arrived. I explained what had happened and how I handled it and Bob praised for handling it exactly how he would have. It was clear to me when Bob spoke to Sherry because one morning both Wesley and Sherry wouldn't even say good morning to me.

I got over the incident pretty quickly though I would have liked an apology from Sherry. Ever since then the vibe was different. Sherry apparently lied about me according to Matt, who told me what she said. She complained to Wesley and Matt that I wasn't doing my part to inform the group on a developing matter when I specifically told her about it. That's some real pathological liar type shit.

Over the last year we've had some new people come and go and she has made an effort to lie about me some more, in particular about the initial incident she and I had. I like people to make up their own minds about Wesley and Sherry so I never briefed them on how shitty they are. What has always happened is the new person would come to me and echoes the same complaints made by everybody else. That they're difficult, petty, and dishonest. One of the newer guys told me he overheard Wesley and Sherry criticizing one of my emails to a researcher, saying ""that was stupid, he's just trying to make it look like he's doing something."" What I gather from this is that Wesley is actually showing Sherry my emails. With Covid we lost everybody in the group except Wesley, Sherry, and myself. By this point I had decided it was best I keep to myself. Fortunately, my kind of work lends itself to being very independent.

It was just us for 7 months until we hired somebody who used to work with Wesley in the old department. Wesley got in my face one day and tried to gaslight me. He wrote me a note asking me to go to the warehouse and take inventory after lunch. I went straight to the warehouse but the scanner out there wasn't working so I walked back to the main building to grab another scanner. I run into Wesley and I acknowledged the note he gave me and before I could explain that the scanner wasn't working he got in my face and gave me attitude. He didn't believe that the scanner wasn't working because he and Sherry used it last night. I replied, ""I'm sure you did use it last night but it's not working today."" Then he asked me if I knew how to take inventory and I said, yes, you pick an item on the shelf and you scan it to that shelf."" This exchanged weirdly repeats itself 2-3 times and Wesley getting frustrated raises his voice and says ""I need your help on this!"" I said, ""Yeah, I know that's why I came back to get this scanner."" Then I walked away from him. 

Recently, we got a new hire who actually worked with Wesley at the old department. His name is Eric, he's a good guy and easy to work with so naturally we get along well. And he even shared some of his previous encounters with Wesley in the past of his own volition. Wesley once got mad at Eric when he got into a car accident and sent pictures to everybody in the department except him. Wesley called Eric into his office and said that it was very disrespectful. Eric said, I called you and let you know I was in an accident and that I wouldn't make it into work. I think Wesley felt left out. 

Over the course of two weeks, Wesley was giving me all kinds of shit. He accused me of showing favoritism to a technician in a different group by doing their work for them which was false and I proved it to him. Didn't get an apology. He accused me of leaving chemicals on a cart for 3 months when I just picked them up that day, somebody else messed up the inventory which I proved. No apology or even benefit of the doubt in the first place. 

I didn't get why he was on my ass so much until Eric told me that story. Wesley feels left out. Despite all the bullshit Wesley gives me I think he wants to bond with me, but since he's such an asshole all I give him is my professionalism. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, here comes Eric and he's been on site for a couple of weeks and already we're bonding and laughing. Wesley is clearly jealous. I'm very well-liked by nearly everyone on site. Some people sooner come to me for help than Wesley because I am easy to get along with (also, I'm very good at what I do) and Wesley isn't. 

Eric has told me several times now that Sherry has been badmouthing me about my work ethic to Wesley, claiming I don't do enough meanwhile she sits at her desk for most of the day. Eric says they both laugh at my expense. We handle chemicals and transport them around the site so it's a job where you have to be moving a lot, not sitting on your ass. I don't really care what Sherry thinks, but Wesley does and he has a direct influence on my raise. Wesley at the very least endorses this behavior by not condemning it and I think it all goes back to when I reported Sherry to Bob. In his mind, I likely crossed a red line. I have more stories and I document every unpleasant interaction with those two on my phone.

TLDR: Boss and his favorite coworker badmouth me, gaslight me, and outright lie about me. Should I report this to HR? Should I go over my bosses head to his supervisor, Bob (who likes me)?",08Nov2020,1

663,"Ok so I'm new and on mobile.

I'm (16F) living with my mom, step dad, and older brother. My parents are divorced, but I still see my dad, we just don't have a super close relationship. I'm incredibly close with my aunt on my mom's side(her only sister)and grandmother. My grandparents and aunt pretty much raised both my brother and I since my mother was single up until I was 4, and had to work a bunch. My grandfather, rest his soul, passed away and it shattered me. I developed some pretty bad anxiety and depression around that time, I was 11. I've dealt with the anxiety completely on my own until I had a mental snap at 13 and finally told my mom. She took me to the doctors and I was prescribed fluoxetine for my anxiety. Once I ran out of the prescription, she literally never got it refilled. It helped so much, but she said she didn't want me medicated for it this early. Which is stupid because I was diagnosed with dyslexia (dyscalculia) and ADHD by scottish rite in the second grade, and she wanted me medicated for that. Anyways the main point is that now when we argue, she says she doesn't if she gives me a panic attack because she's tired of dealing with my bad behavior ( I'm not a bad kid, this is for things like not vacuuming the litter room) so I just stopped telling her about my panic attacks, and I wish I never told her about it in the first place because she just throws it in my face. Then she gets mad that I don't come for these things. We recently got into a huge fight and she said that we had no compassion and are selfish (a girl fell and got back up, but we didn't ask if she was ok) and learned this bad behavior from my aunt and grandmother (my mother hates them) and banned us from going back.(they pick us up every Friday and we spend the weekend with them and come back on Monday, we've done this EVERY weekend since 3rd grade) so she sent us to our fathers for the weekend and will continue to for the foreseeable future.  She also didn't like that I wore a sweatshirt and leggings to school, so she said that the homeless people dressed better than me and, once again, said that my anxiety was my fault and she didn't care about it, I've started breaking out in a rash as a physical symptom from how bad my anxiety is lately. Later that day she said she didn't want to trigger my anxiety, and that I needed to talk to her about it. 

I'm really upset because what she said hurt, and I have no one to go to about it because she'll just throw it in my face during an argument. I love my aunt and want to move in with her because I hate here. I hate my stepdad, mom and my dad who was absent almost my entire childhood. My mother would let me be homeless before ever going to live with my aunt, though. Another problem is my education in the city I live in is great and I'm almost done with school. My plan is to just stick it out, then move to Michigan (I'm in Texas) for college. I want NOTHING to do with them once I'm out of the house.

664,"I’ve kinda grow up with anxiety and it’s gotten really bad ever since I lost my close friend group and gained weight. 

I have bad habits like staying up too late and sleeping in too late too. My family loves to remind me of this. Today I woke up at 7 am and remembered that I told my Mom that I would go to church (because I took a break from going). However, I guess I feel bad asleep and then work up 10 mins before church started. And it takes half an hour to get there. 

I felt terrible and then figured I could leave before my Mom and her friend got back (they went to an earlier time) but low and behold, they showed up only a few minutes later. I got very embarrassed and depressed, knowing my Mom would be mad, and so I just went back to sleep. I didn’t have the courage to come upstairs until it was noon. My moms friend say me and said hi but my Mom looked disappointed. So I’ve been feeling terrible all day. 

I want to get better at managing my schedule, but it’s so easy for it to got wrong and I’m too self conscious to move on with my day.

671,"I(22M) have recently joined my father's business, we are consigning and forwarding agents in the pharmaceutical sector. My dad(48M) has been running his business for the past 29 years and is quite successful. Two years ago, our biggest costumer that lives in a different city and has been in business with us for 7 years approached my dad to hire his brother in law (42M) let's name him Mr.N as he was facing a really tough time in his life financially and had no job skills as he used to operate a small business as a broker for raw material in the textile industry and that business went under and he didn't knew anything else. My dad agreed without giving much thought to it as we are always expanding and need manpower and the person was in dire need of help was related to our biggest costumer so we couldn't say no.
His job was to collect payments and bring new leads if possible for our surgical equipments locally, we sell across 78 cities, 3 states and the share of local market isn't substantial. His job would entail 4 hours of on ground work i.e. visiting few of our customers in radius of 10 miles in the heart of the city and couple of hours calling to confirm orders and sometimes delivery. Everything from the fuel, to his phone bills are considered a business expenses.

Now to the present, a week ago my dad got a call from one of our customer stating that he will pay the remaining cash tomorrow for the goods he received this morning, to which my dad got really confused. The reason for confusion is that we never take cash, payments are made via online banking or through cheque as we are at the CNF level orders aren't for couple hundred of ruppes but lakhs ( one hundred thousand for my American friends ) hence taking cash for anything is impossible and rarely comes a small bill hence cash payments are completely eliminated in our business from the beginning.
Turns out that Mr. N was charging customers that he brought in a cash premium for every unit of product sold as they were cheaper than the buying from anyone else as we supply are goods directly at company rates with fixed margins from the company so margins of distributors, wholesalers and retailers are eliminated.
Turns out at some orders he was earning more than we were via are margins, and has been for the past 12 months. 
Now my dad is very soft in nature and quite a mellow guy, known for his goodwill and kind nature in our community and in the business community also. My dad won't fire or even scold Mr.N instead he asked him what his expectations are that aren't being meet in his job and what can he do about them. Me on the other hand, I want to break his legs. 
Thank you for taking out the time to read this post, all thoughts and advice are welcome.

676,"Having a debate with my husband currently. We live in CT and his parents are in the Southwest. A move for us would take 3 days (of driving). Currently, we spend around 1700 a month on rent and utilities, and I am due in May 2021 and will be spending 800-1700 on daycare costs per month.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to convince my husband that we should move into his parents house in the southwest. They have the room for us, but the problem is that both me and my husband are in school (both currently online due to pandemic). He is in a Ph.D and has the spring semester and 1 class in the fall, but he needs dissertation hours and that tuition is only covered if he can continue teaching (i.e. if we move and we are no longer online, they wouldn't be covered and he won't continue to get an income). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in school as well (part time) and will graduate in May 2023. I have a part time job currently which pays well and will lead to a full time job after I graduate(if we stay in CT, which I doubt we will).

&amp;#x200B;

We are both completely online for the spring at our respective schools, and we don't anticipate a vaccine by the fall, so we think the fall will be online as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, there are a TON of factors that tell us we shouldn't move. BUT. If we move, INCLUDING using money to break our lease and move twice (assuming we have to move back to CT to finish school and that the pandemic doesn't last until 2023), we would save around 20 THOUSAND DOLLARS just staying with his parents even January - December of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

So my husband and I can't agree and can't seem to make up our minds about whether we should move or not, so I'd really like some other opinions.

679,"

Essentially, I have become so used to my negative emotions, which I’ve had for so long, that I now have a very high tolerance for them. This has decreased my motivation to change.

Moreover, I’m starting to almost enjoy beating myself up mentally. Sometimes it almost feels like I’m m purposely inducing these “negative” states in myself. I think this is partially because the idea of not being self-aware of my faults terrifies me and I never want to forget them so that if/when someone else points them out it won’t be a surprise to me. But the other maybe larger part is that I’m becoming addicted to the emotional intensity, and negative emotions are as good as positive ones in satisfying that craving. 

This isn’t an excuse, and I know I’m capable of changing, but I’m finding it difficult mostly because I don’t really want to stop. But part of me does. The main reason I want to stop is for the sake of others around me, and for the sake of other people’s perception of me. I find myself constantly trying to understand how this behavior might come across to others and I do realize how annoying and draining it is. I do not want to be seen that way.

Last night I found out it wasn't a dream.

He cheated on me, one week into our relationship. He said it was meaningless, that it was only ever online and only once, and it only happened because he was self sabotaging and self destructing. I can understand self sabotage, I've done it before but I've never cheated on anyone. He had completely forgotten it happened, and it wasn't like he tried to hide it since the messages were still there. He said it hasn't happened again since and won't in the future because he's happy and found what he needed in me.

Conveniently the messages are now gone, deleted. He says he doesn't know how to delete messages bc he's not very tech savvy, but idk what to believe. I have no option to trust what he says about their ""relationship"" bc I can't go and fact check it now, because its gone forever (unless yall know a trick to recover deleted Instagram messages). I also can't help feeling he deleted them to try and gaslight me (he didn't know what I was talking about until I brought up key details but the messages were then gone)

Since it was only a week into our relationship, I don't feel like I should be too angry, especially since he was in a very dark place, but it really hurts because the language he used towards her was very passionate. He called her beautiful and she called him sweetheart.

He called me beautiful this morning and it made me feel like shit. I think I need to tell him to not call me that anymore.

I don't know what to do. I feel stuck. I thought we were good, but now all I can wonder is if he's gonna do it again if he reaches a dark point in his life, how much he actually knew this woman, why I wasn't good enough for him then. I'm trying to be understanding but this has rocked me and I just

I don't know what to do. We just moved in together, we were about to start our life and then I find these messages that he'd completely forgotten about.

What stings the most is that he's made a point of saying if I cheated it would feel like a betrayal, bit he had already cheated.

687,"Hello,
I am currently living in a city that I moved to 5 years ago after graduating with a master degree in my field that is different from my hometown.

After school I got the sense that my family did not want me to live near them - similar to when I left for school also away from my child hood home. 

One year ago I was let go of my job in my profession and it's left me questioning a lot of my values goals and direction. I came up against the professional body and my employers for trying to apply my experiences living and working abroad locally. I was feeling lost and planning to move back home and then met a girl. It was going great but eventually my depression from my lack of passion and direction in my field boiled over and she broke up with me. I momintarily ended up in the hospital just before COVID for attempting to end my life. I am working in a construction job to scrape by and just trying to lay low. My family wants me to move home but I don't want to be a burden. There are no opportunities locally right now in my field and further more I feel as if I need to leave this place too.

I'm not sure where I should go.
My instincts tell me to move away from this place I have lived in and away from my family and to just find a basic job to survive and just sort of drift away.

I've lost a lot of my drive and I feel like I'm just in the way and using up resources. I feel like a burden to my friends and family who all have their own important things to consider and do. I would much rather just remove my self from the equation because I get the sense I am not helpful to the greater good any longer. Recently there was some local opportunities to apply some of my thinking regarding the profession and none of my friends let me know. I asked them about it and they said they would try to apply my thinking but didn't catch on to me feeling bad about not being kept in the loop on something I would definitely be passionate towards...

As a little background, my family is fairly small as both of my parents only have one sibling they aren’t close with so it’s always just been my immediate family and I’m the oldest of four kids. My mom and I have never been close as following her mother’s death (my grandmother) she dealt with her grief poorly and became emotionally abusive to me and my siblings. We’re urged her many times to seek counseling but she doesn’t believe mental health is real or important. 

My dad however, was the greatest parent I could hope for. We were incredibly close from a young age and he’s been my closest friend. I used to call my dad every day until this summer when he passed away from a years long battle with lymphoma. This was especially hard for me as my boyfriend of almost three years had broken up with me a few months prior. He said it was because the relationship was too serious for him but I suspect part of the reason was that I wasn’t as fun to be around as my dads worsening condition caused me to spiral into depression. 

Currently, I’m working on picking myself back up, completing school and trying to plan for the future. I’m lucky to have many amazing friends but I often hear them calling their parents because they need an oil change or have a question about getting a credit card and it’s scary and overwhelming to feel like I don’t have a person like that in my life.

I am LOSING MY MIND. My ex and I broke up a while ago and I needed help with the rent so a longtime guy friend of mine moved in. Huge mistake.

He leaves a huge mess everywhere, doesn’t flush the toilet, never helps with chores and he cries ALL THE FUCKING TIME over the littlest thing.

696,"Okay, before I start; I just want to clarify that this is NOT a troll post. I’m legitimately asking a question and for advice. My energy level has always been on the lower end and I decided to start exercising frequently (about an hour a day) and my body just feels like it’s about to give up after a session. I feel nauseous, dizzy and I feel like I’m about to throw up just from exercising. In addition, I also just feel too exhausted after a workout that my energy level drops even lower than the original one that I had. So now I’m just wondering if all of this “Exercise give you more energy” is True or if it’s just BS. Obviously I know that it’s true and that there are facts and research to prove that it’s true but darn, I feel like death after a workout. By the way, I do Aerobic exercises 3 times a week and then 2 times are either upper or lower back and then Sundays are rest days... Any suggestions on how to get the most out of Exercising and getting more energy without feeling like a dying whale gasping for air after it washed off on the beach?",08Nov2020,1
697,"My apologies in advance for the long wall of text, but I feel like context is important.  Let me first start off with this: I know exactly why my brother and mother behave the way they do, I know their reasoning and while they aren't exactly trying to cause harm... Well, sometimes they tend to forget the world around them I guess?

Starting off with my brother: he's nearing his thirties, works a fulltime job. He tends to be quiet and shy towards those he doesn't know very well. Typically, he only has a couple of subjects that he likes to talk about, and will hyper focus on them. Meaning that he won't talk about anything else, but those things. He still lives at home, as do I, with our parents. I suspect he might be autistic, but he got tested for that when he was still a child but the test came out negative. 

My mother.. well... I kinda admire her. When she was my age, she migrated to this foreign country, without being able to speak the language. She found my father, married him and suffered through the abuse that her mother in law bombarded her with. My mom is a strong and hardworking person, doing whatever she can to give her own 2 children a better life than she had. 

My father and I used to have a rocky relationship in the beginning, but these past few years or so, we began to grow much closer. He can be a bit ignorant and uneducated about certain topics, but can I really blame him when he didn't even finish secondary school to migrate to a foreign country? After migrating, he basically started working fulltime until he retired some time ago.

The thing is... I've been really growing to resent my brother lately. I think he's an entitled, lazy and spoiled ass that can't do anything on his own. Why you ask? First of all, he doesn't contribute ANYTHING to the household. My parents own this house, yet he doesn't pay them rent. I live in this house too, but I try to make up for it by doing some basic household chores. He, on the other hand, does no such thing. When my parents or I ask him to do a small thing, such as put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher, he will turn hostile and say he's going to do it later, but never end up doing it. Rinse and repeat with everything we ask him to do. My brother is a VERY PICKY eater, I'm not even joking when I say that he doesn't eat 95% of the dishes cooked here at home. When my father or I cook dinner, he refuses to touch it. My mother goes out of her way to cook him stuff that he likes, which is usually unhealthy stuff (think fries, pizza, fried chicken, etc.). 

My brother hates our father, which I can understand. Growing up, our dad was away most of the day because he had a very demanding job. He wasn't the best dad by all means, but he is far from the worst and he definitely tries. Nowadays, my brother full on DESPISES him. He will face away from him, turn his back on him when eating dinner, avoid him at all cost and berate our dad for being ""so dumb and stupid"" for not knowing things. My brother will frequently badmouth or berate other people, oh but if any of us open our mouths to say anything that's not 100% positive about him, we will explode. He accuses us of targeting him and being angry at him. Which literally once happened because our dad once asked him to turn off his electronics if he was going away (2 computers, 2 electric fans and his nintendo switch were turned on while he was downstairs watching tv). 

One of the things that I am really tired of dealing with.... Is his inability to read social cues. I'm a fulltime university student, currently doing a difficult master thesis subject that requires a whole lot of time and energy. Many days, I spend conducting experiments at the laboratory, or I'm at home working late hours to analyse my data or creating an experimental setup. That already takes up so much of my time and energy. Then,  there's the fact that I co-parent our new puppy, which also takes up much time and energy. Needless to say, at the end of the day... I am tired... I don't want to think nor do I want to do anything. But very moment he sees me, he tries to engage in very one-sided conversations that are quite draining on me. Remember how I said that he tends to hyper focus on a couple of subjects? Yea, he likes to talk about the news or various gaming topics. At the end of a tiring day, I really don't want to hear about how many people died of X cause, what kind of tragedy occured, whatever thing that makes me lose my faith in humanity, what event I am missing in-game (because I barely even have time to game anymore) or what the latest news is on a game that I quit playing close to 7 years ago.

The worst thing is, my mother is enabling his behaviour, all of it. He doesn't have to do anything, because she does it for him. So you get a almost thirty year old man who has never even changed his bedsheets or ever done his laundry, because his mother does it for him. She excuses all of his behaviour. An example of that: some time ago I was in the middle of exam week, meaning that I was cramming as much as possible. I was up late at night to study, and I needed the caffeine to fuel me. So I bought a can of energy drink to get me through the night. He asked me if he could have it, and I told him no because ""I really need it for the cramming session tonight, I have an exam in two days"". He proceeded to drink it anyway. And I'm not proud of it, but I threw a fit. I was FURIOUS. To me, it felt like he was blatantly disregarding my feelings. Wanna know what my mom did? She went to the grocery store and bought at least 10 cans of energy drinks. Then she looked at me and said ""So, now you don't have to throw a tantrum anymore"". It was like a slap in my face. To me, it was more important that my brother apologize and have him understand that he shouldn't overstep his boundaries. But like always, mom just solved all his problems for him. He still hasn't apologized.

I hate to admit this... But I am so jealous of him and I am starting to resent my mother for her preferential treatment. I by no means, want to be the favourite child... But sometimes it just feels like I don't even matter to her. Everything my mother does, is to make my brother happy.  But I don't think he deserves this treatment and I'll explain why.

Many years ago, my mother got diagnosed with malignant cancer. It was a very dark time in our lives. At the time, I was still in my first year at university, and I took it hard. My mother, went from being a strong, indepent woman, to a frail person who was too weak to get up from bed. I was devastated, but I had to be strong for her. From that moment on, I did all the housework, all the cooking, the cleaning, all while struggling with my education. But I didn't care, I wanted my mom to be safe, be happy and able to rest properly. I was there for her, after her surgery, I would visit her in the early morning until the evening to keep her company. And during her chemotherapy sessions, I was there even when I had to skip lessons. There was only 1 time in which I couldn't visit her during chemo, but I still called her while she was in the hospital. My brother though? NOT once has he ever visited her when she was in the hospital. On the day of her surgery, I was anxiously pacing around in her room, biting my nails off while waiting for the nurses to give us any news. They said they would update us at 2 o clock... But then it became 3 o clock.... 4 o clock... By the time it was 9 at night, I was an anxious mess because I was scared something went wrong during the surgery. My brother though? He kept complaining that he was hungry, that he skipped lunch and dinner. I know people process fear differently but seriously? Our mother is having a life-altering surgery, we don't know what the fuck is going on and he is going on and on about being hungry? 

Fortunately, my mother recovered. But my mental health started declining and somewhere along the lines I developed depression. I didn't even know that there was something wrong with me until I sat in a public park, crying my heart out and wondering if life was even worth living, when it was only causing me pain. I have, since then, sought out help and underwent therapy. I'm happy to report that I feel much better and that life isn't so bad anymore. Unfortunately, therapy also helped me realize that my mother displays preferential treatment towards my brother. I understand that he's a bit 'special' and requires a bit more guidance than I do. My brother and I are complete opposites of each other. I've always had the drive to be more independent, to do my own thing and I dislike having someone monitor me so closely. My brother, however, has trouble making decisions on his own and tends to be more on the careful side. Still, this preferential treatment doesn't quite sit well with me. 

One time, I poured my heart out to my dad. I told him that it felt like mom didn't give a shit about me, despite me trying to be there for her, always. I was there for her, during her darkest time of cancer and my brother was absent. I told him that it felt a bit unfair. Ever since that day, my dad has been looking out for me. Sometimes he does these extra things for me and he's been extra kind to me. In return, I do my best to help him with whatever he needs and we've been doing more fun things together as well. 

The thing is... My mom berates my dad for doing those extra things. Saying that it is unnecessary and that he is stupid. I defend my dad, saying that he has his reasons for doing some things (though if he's actually doing something stupid, then I agree) but my mom vehemently stands by her point. To me, it almost feels like she's ridiculing my dad for caring about me... I even told my mom that some things he does, he does those for me (and she still thinks it's stupid). 

So.... Basically, long story short: I am growing resentful of my brother who I think is a bit of a brat and my mother, for enabling him. I don't want to dislike or hate them. I keep trying to build a proper relationship with my brother, but I inevitably find myself annoyed with him because of how spoiled he can be. And I'm salty about how my mother treats my brother as ""the golden child"", who can do no wrong. Mom would rather throw dad or me under the bus, than my brother. 

What can I do to stop my feelings of jealousy, of resentment? Or maybe I need a reality check for being entitled and spiteful myself? I really don't know anymore.",08Nov2020,1

703,"Hello, I'm a 17f. I had a teenage mother who seven children and I'm the oldest. She kicked me when drunk and high and I just didn't go back.

Its been a little over a year since then, ( it happened a month before my 16 birthday) and I've stayed at family since then. A lot has happened since then she had lost custody of my siblings, is being forced into treatment and hasn't tried contacting any of us.

As the oldest of nine children is tough, I've never met two of my siblings and the rest other than my only full biological sister I basically raised. I'm really bitter about that since I had to deal with undiagnosed mental issues, neglect from my parents, and the two years of sexual abuse. (Everyone believed me except the woman who gave birth to me and he was found guilty and charged. I wasn't the only victim.)

Now I live with my uncle and three of my sisters, I've decided long ago once I'm an adult I'm going no contact TO EVERYONE. I have no reason to stay and staying is hard. Everyone in my family has their own problems and own lives I don't fit in.

710,"Last year I started my own clothing brand, I showed it to my friend near the beginning and he asked if he could join doing illustrations for it, I agreed 

Over the last year he helped me in developing the first line and doing the illustrations. During this time I have made several mentions of bringing other artists onboard but he’s always says he doesn’t like that idea 

Fast forward we’ve released the first line and now trying to work on the second. I let him go away and do some drawings for it. He showed them to and I gave some feedback on things that could be changed. He flew off the handle and was seriously angry at me. Over the next couple of months I have several really angry phone calls from him because of it. 

Now recently I told him again I want to get another artist involved, he flys off the handle more than usual and really starts laying into me and telling I have to use the drawings he choices and I can’t get use anyone else’s. At this point I’m thinking fuck this, it’s my business and I’ll do what I think is best for it

Now I’m not sure what to do about this friend really. We are barely speaking and when we do it’s so heated. I don’t get the big deal in bringing someone else in and I think he’s being pretty controlling and what I can do when it’s not his business

717,"Hey all, first time here and would like some advice. 

So my girlfriend of 2 months has very bad trust, abandonment, and suicidal/cutting issues. No matter what I do ( and I’m not perfect I fuck up ) she never trusts me, constantly thinks I’m breaking up with her when I bring up a problem or issue I have instead of listening to me, and threatens to kill herself. She threatens to khs whenever I go to the gym or try to leave the house. If I don’t have her “permission” and drive without shoes on or drive with the Windows down, or don’t FaceTime her when I go anywhere she looses it and threatens to kill herself. Now I don’t always comply because all those things together are ludicrous, unnesscary, and extreme in my eyes, and I can’t always do them. And she has my locations and everything and still refuses to believe I’m actually there because I don’t like to be on my phone all the time.
 
I recently have screen recorded her cutting herself and saying she’s going to khs if I go to the gym. She has previously been in the hospital for a month for attempting suicide. So when I told her I screen recorded she lost it and was screaming she didn’t want to go back, etc.

She’s truly a lovely girl when she’s not a slave to her anxiety and depression and whatever is going on in her head and I love her. But I can’t continue to cut out all my friends, family, and everything I do and just sit at home and be a hermit (yes corona is going on, but there’s still things I have to do). I just want to help her but she refuses to listen to anything and continues to wallow in her own pity and depression.

I am confused with what I should do to get her help. I’m not going to send the videos I have to her counselor (who she cant afford to go all the time) or mom or the police yet at least because I know she doesn’t want to go back. But she needs help and even if she doesn’t want to, it might be what’s best for her. I have never dealt with any of these things before so I’m at a loss for what to do. 

If anyone wants or needs more details to make an opinion, etc. Just lmk and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

718,"21F) dates an abusive manipulative (38M) homeless man who got me fired...

For starters I was working at a homeless shelter , he was one of the residents living there with his fake service dog. We instantly clicked. Yes there was an 18 yr age gap but that didnt keep us from being with each other. I’ve never been with a man until he came along. He was really sweet but then it seem like all he wanted was sex. I told him I’m not ready to have sex until I’m married. He was very understanding. 

Our birthdays were both the same month. His birthday was weeks away. We decided to get a hotel. Nothing too sinister. All we did was cuddle. Then my birthday came along and I finally turned 21. I got us a hotel assuming all we would do is cuddle again one thing led to another. He was getting a little too freaky and wanted me to take off my clothes. I repeatedly said “no” and he kept insisting, he wouldn’t take “no” for an answer. So I finally caved and took off my clothes and we had sex for the first time. 

I wanted to take things slow but apparently it was the whole opposite. There were a couple of red flags that I was so blind to see. For starters I had a best friend (35F) she was also working with me at the shelter. She was the only person who knew about our relationship. 

They both became instantly close. He would run errands for her. Go to the store buy her snacks or even go out of his way to buy her breakfast. His excuse was “I want your best friend to like me”. I felt like it wasn’t his job to make her feel better, or compliment her just so she can feel appreciated. They would even talk without my knowledge but when I asked what they talked about they both said that it wasn’t my business. Also there were a couple of times when him and I were on dates he would message her cute things like “I miss you” and “I wish you were here” ( he didn’t do it behind my back, we had a group chat with all 3 of us.)  On my birthday we came over to her house to drink and eat. He complimented her by saying “if you can cook like this everyday I will marry you.” She was flattered and he kissed her on the cheek. I felt very uncomfortable. 

 A month later it was her daughter's (17F) birthday. We all went out to eat  before I had to go to work. He decided to stay with them while I had to leave. He had a whole photo shoot with them. People also confused them as husband and wife but he didn’t make it clear that they weren’t together. I was pretty jealous at the fact they hung out without me but I didn’t make it a big deal. 

Well one day he needed to go see a car that was a 2hr drive. I asked “did my friend take you.” He said no and came up with a long excuse. I had a gut feeling they were together. I then messaged her and she also said no. My suspicions weren't over. I went on her Snapchat and saw her location was on,pretty clear they were at the same location. I played it cool. Waited until he came back to the shelter to see if he would tell me the truth. He denied again and said he took a Lyft going and coming. 

I showed him proof that they were in fact together, he laughed at my face and called me crazy. I then called my friend to see if she would tell me the truth but nope. I went off on her and she ended up blocking me literally off everything. I was literally in tears. I was devastated that the two people I love would lie to me. They  both blamed me that it was my fault that they had to lie about hanging out with each other due to me constantly getting jealous. Since that day I’ve never talked to her ever again but as a naive girl I was still with him. 

Fast forward a week later…him and I were fooling around at the park around 1am. He was forcing me to tell him I love him in person. He tried pushing me off the bench. I then accidentally hit him in his “private area”. He instantly slapped me and started yelling. Calling me out of my name. He was so menatally  and verbally abusive but at this point I was so used to it. I apologized several times but he didn’t care. He left me alone in the dark at 2am knowing I have to take the train which is a 1hr 20mins commute to my house. It's not the first time he walked away from me. So I didn't really think much of it.

A week after the incident he messaged my male friend who was also the security guard  at the shelter to tell me that it’s “over” and “ that he wants nothing to do with me”. I was perfectly fine with that I had no intentions being with him after he slapped me. Once he broke up with me, he moved on pretty fast. He started flirting with the entire staff, including security literally right in front of me. He even gave one of them a ride in his new car.

Imagine the pain endured for months looking at my manipulative abusive ex flirt with everyone. He even went out on dates with my ex best friend and her daughter. 

He would constantly break the rules but I’ll just turn the other cheek, fear of him snitching and getting me fired. He eventually told residents and staff that we slept together. He also started to spread rumors about me. 

I was speechless every time. I couldn’t believe a man that I once loved could do that to me. To make matters worse he came to my house threatening me over a bracelet that meant a lot to him. I told him multiple times that I don't have it. He threatened me by telling me if I don’t give him the bracelet he will report me to my boss claiming I stole the bracelet and slept with him. 

He told me he had an apartment and just needed a week for it to be ready. His words exactly “I don’t need the shelter but you need this job”. He said he came over to give me closure. I told him “you literally hit a girl over an accident” he said “you're lucky that’s the only thing I did.” 

There were a couple of times he would message me at work after the breakup  just to bother me but I simply ignored him. The moving day finally came. I wished him congratulations on his new apartment. He ignored me. I was just simply trying to be the bigger person in this whole situation. 

Hours later I got an email from him, attached to the email was my boss. He had attached several  screenshots that proved that me and him were in a relationship. My boss instantly fired me. Sad part is he “won”. He was a manipulative man who got me fired over a bracelet. I loved working there. I was actually making a difference. Now he continues to live his life with his new car, new apartment and now he’s with my ex best friend.

For some odd reason I feel the urge for some type of revenge or at least talk to him. Not sure what to do I can’t just let this go.",08Nov2020,1
719,"This post is going to be fairly long, but just because I want to give all the details that could be needed.

I'm a 20 year old male from Romania. I wish to move permanently and my main goal is moving out of the country, preferably to the US, as soon as possible. I am currently studying psychology (full-time) in Romania and I'm in the 2nd year of my studies (out of a total of 3). I'm fluent in English, Romanian and German and may start learning Russian soon.

What is the best way of moving to the US? I've done a fair share of research on the internet but most official websites don't provide more than impersonal definitions and I could use some experiences that some of you may have had/heard about and perhaps further information.

I would be moving alone, no family or anything attached. My interests are mainly how to get a job in the US as a foreigner, how to legally enter the US and how to gain permanent residency and citizenship further down the road.

I would also appreciate some advice on my educational path. Do you think a degree like mine would be useful? Why/Why not? What kind of jobs could be out there for me and how can I apply to them (again, provided I am a foreigner). What can I do to improve my chances of success? What skills/abilities should I look into? 

As for my experience, since the university schedules are very disorganised here (courses are spread in the whole day instead of having a longer block of classes) I haven't had the opportunity of a part time job or anything similar so far. However, I did work as a personal assistant and translator for around 2 years for a teacher (&amp; a delegate of sorts) sent from Germany to my high school to oversee and organize language exams sponsored by the German government.

Also, I think it's important to mention that I do not expect a red carpet in the eventuality that I reach the US and I am not afraid of putting in hard work and determination to achieve this goal. It is something of huge importance to me and I wish to do it as fast and efficiently is possible. I am also considering certain european countries (like Germany/Austria/Denmark/Sweden/Norway/UK) but only as a last resort or stepping stone for the ultimate goal of moving to the US. In any case, the US is the ""#1 priority"", so advice oriented towards that is most appreciated.

If you'd like to know any other details that may be important and I haven't thought about, ask me in the comments or PMs and I'll reply ASAP.

Many thanks in advance!",08Nov2020,1
720,"My (31,f) grandpa pretty much helped raise me. I grew up in his house for most of our lives and I’m going through waves of grief right now. He passed last night after a long critical illness after falling and having to get brain surgery. 

In many ways I already grieved him. He was never the same. I was with him while he was being taken by ambulance to the hospital that was doing the surgery, holding his hand, both of us knowing that he might not make it. But he did and then he just suffered for months. I didn’t visit too much, mostly because of the pandemic. It was just agonizing to watch and the house was always crowded when I went. 

I already had covid and got it very severely. Prior to that I suffered from undiagnosed autoimmune disease. These sound like excuses but it’s just been a really rough few years and it’s like I don’t want to deal with any discomfort. Obviously I can’t not deal with this. It’s here, happened, he’s being buried tomorrow. 

I just feel too self conscious and upset to speak in front of so many people, but it also makes me feel like a terrible person. I grew up in his home. I was the first grandchild. Am I horrible if I don’t speak in front of everyone tomorrow?",08Nov2020,1

I’m 17F and my bf is 18M we have been dating 3 months  yesterday  we went to his best friends birthday party and got drunk there I may have gone overboard when him and his friends started a drinking game his friends gf stopped drinking after a couple rounds but I don’t know why I decided to keep drinking even though he told me a couple times maybe I should stop cause I was getting hammered but I didn’t listen and kept drinking so I was kinda drunk at the end of it 

Before we left I ended up drinking with his friends gf and had already thrown up into his friends toilet but my bf didn’t know so as we were walking back to his dorm room because he lives on site and my parents are strict and don’t let me drink I remember struggling with walking so I guess he must have carried me and I remember throwing up on him and all over myself then I blacked out 

I woke up the next day in his bed in wearing cloths that belonged to him he left a note on the bedside table that basically said he had to go somewhere and that I should eat these instant instant noodles that would help my hangover when I got up I saw that I had absolutely trashed his toilet and bathroom with dried vomit  on the walls of it and all over the floor and all clothes pilled up in a corner except my bra and under where which was hanging and drying 

I feel really embarrassed about what I did plus I know that since it’s a small bed he must have slept on the floor because he had pulled up various junk to keep me on my side in his bed and I also feel bad about all the cleaning I would have to do plus I’m scared that I embarrassed him in front of his friends as well I feel kinda bad that one of the first time he saw me fully naked was washing vomit off me (only other time was when I dropped my towel when walking out his shower)

I’m not sure what I can do to make it up to him or how can I feel a bit better over this he was right though since the noodles he left me helped a lot

I really want to help my boyfriend, but I don't know how. We've been dating for a year and a half ish, and I really care about him. We're planning on moving in together mid-2021, and the relationship is a serious, long term one. A bit of background, I have chronic depression and anxiety, and I recently lost a friend to suicide.

Lately, I've noticed an increase in what seems like depressive behaviours. He had said sometime in the past couple weeks that he wanted to die, as a joke, and when I bugged him to take it back, he told me very seriously that he would be lying to me if he told me he didn't want to be dead. That really concerned me. He also said that ""\[he\] wants to be happy but \[he\] can't"", which was a bit of a red flag.

Coupled with school stress which is pretty much constant with him, I'm really worried. He's trying to get in to see the school therapist, but that's a few months away and I don't want things to get worse for him. He's also worried about being unemployed, due to COVID. 

How can I help him without being too pushy? I'm a little freaked out due to my friend's death, because this is similar to what she was like before she took her life, so it's hard not to come off as overbearing.

I know solving his problems isn't my responsibility, and that's not what I want to do. I just want to be able to support him until he can get the help he needs. I've been in therapy for 10 years as well (finally finished\~!) and I have a fairly good understanding of mental health.

754,"I come from a religious family that has not been good to me. Like yeah, I was never hungry, I had a bed to sleep, and I got the best education in the state but they have done nothing for me emotionally. I moved to dorms in college and lost myself and, I will admit, acted very irresponsibly (drinking, sex, drugs, late nights and skipping class etc) that impacted my grade. I guess it was all those years of suppression coming out since I felt liberated. I was acting like a kid my first-half of freshman year. Second half, I straightened out. Got my college paid for on my own, got a job I liked, slept at a decent time, way less parties and I stopped with the recreational sex bc it wasn’t safe nor was it doing me any good. Then corona hit and I had to urgently move back home since I was kicked out of the dorms.

I’ve been here since and it’s not doing good for my mental health.

I’m nearly 20, I’ve launched my own company that’s doing well, 3.9 GPA with a couple weeks left in the semester, and am doing so much to further my career. But, my parents don’t support me. And it’s fucking with me.

I wake up early, go to school, finish up homework, hit the office, crank out some company building work like a brand book and setting up meetings or sending follow up emails, pack my stuff, go to my part time job in IT then come home a bit into the evening. Needless to say I’m out of the house from 7AM-9PM M-Th. Friday’s I only have mornings. Weekends are solely for my company and when the meetings take place, where I pitch my ideas to possible investors or even collaborators, etc.

My parents hate this schedule. Now I know what you’re thinking: “just move out” and that’s what this post is for. If I leave, I lose contact with my siblings, the “respect” of my parents, and I lose the stability of having some backing that’s been around my whole life and I’m having a bit of trouble doing that.

It’s not that I DON’T have support. I have friends that have gone the extra mile and have a spot ready for me on their lease. Friend’s parents who have offered me a bed to sleep in with minimal fees until I get back on my feet. My bf cleared an entire space in his closet and is set for having me join him and has been one of my biggest support.

But I’m scared.

Even writing this I’m starting to cry and I can feel the pain in my chest. My parents raised me with a heavy hand and I’m scared of having anything like that come up again. They set a curfew for me, a rule that I’m not allowed to leave on the weekends, and constantly mock my appearance, say I’m not going anywhere and this is a waste and I’m wasting their money (which, I’m not because I literally continue to pay for my college, car, groceries, clothes, etc) and it’s fucking with me.

One of my mentors told me that he knows I’ve got the drive and the fire to be an entrepreneur and business owner but, the fact that I can’t even make Saturday meetings at 2pm with investors that he’s helped me and put the time in to CONVINCE them to give two flying shits about my business is pissing him of, and, rightfully so.

I’m planning on telling them today that I am moving out. I am telling them, not asking them. But I don’t know how to break it down in a way that would convince them and not come off as disrespectful.

So many negative events happened this year, specifically covid happening and with all the deaths happening. I truly am sad about everything that has happened around the world and the death count.

But I find myself enjoying 2020 for some reason and the only friend I’ve told this to said I should keep that to myself. 

I’m an introverted and a natural loner, so having college being a “stuck in my room” kind of deal was actually enjoyable for me. My freshman year was shitty because I didn’t know how to make friends, so I was surrounded by people who seemed to enjoy school while I was just watching and hanging in the library doing the only thing I knew how to do which was school work. But after we were sent home, it was just me and my technology that I love. My video games, my books, my school work, everything I loved surrounded by me nearly 24/7. I enjoyed it. Online school was tough and it still is, but I find it a little bit refreshing to me.

Of course we all get lonely from this and especially 2020 was a very lonely year for me. I haven’t really told anyone this but I lacked self-confidence and self-esteem prior to this year. I wasn’t confident with my body, my sexuality, just everything about myself. For some reason, the loneliness changed me and I rly don’t know how, but I feel as confident as ever. Maybe tiktok helped and I know I don’t rly use that app, but seeing people from the lgbtq+ community on there when I’ve never talked to someone in the community irl, it just made me confident with who I was and I found myself walking in public with some kind of confidence I didn’t know I had.

I haven’t told anyone about how confident I feel in my body and myself; I want to label 2020 as one of the best years I’ve had because as someone who is a loner and has had a bad mental health state, it’s one of those years that has made me want to take a deep breath and smile and just spin around with my arms open because I know I’ve changed into someone I should’ve been from the start. But at the same time, I feel like a jerk for labeling it as one of my best years because of everything that happened with the pandemic. As well as seeing many students complain about the online system. I do feel like a jerk which is why I never say it’s my best year when I’m asked that.",08Nov2020,1

763,"I'm a 26 year old female.  I had a really rough, abusive childhood (mostly from my mom and her ex boyfriend), and I was in foster care from ages 13 to 18.  After aging out, I tried going to college but ended up withdrawing halfway through the semester because of my grades and issues with Residence Life.  I tried going back with family, but nothing had changed there so I was basically on my own.

For the past 8 years since, I've basically been off and on homeless, and when I wasn't I was mostly living with others.  The only apartment I had in my name ended with me getting evicted.  I've dated men just for a place to stay, and relied on them/their families.  I wasn't necessarily doing this maliciously; for me, I was just trying to survive.  I've been in 2 abusive relationships due to this dynamic.

As far as jobs and schooling, I've had trouble in that area as well.  I've failed or dropped out of 6 different colleges, never staying more than a semester or two.  Ive probably had 20 different jobs, and quit all of them due to mental health or just being generally dissatisfied with the job.  I'm horrible at budgeting/money management and often have my priorities f-ed up, resulting in me being in a bad spot.

I'm very intelligent and did well academically in my K-12 years (National Honor Society, high GPA, etc.).  So I know it's not lack of ability; I'm not really sure what is causing all of this.  I also go to therapy/psychiatric treatment and take medication.

I guess, with that being said, I have 2 main points/questions:

1.  Is it possible for a person (of normal intelligence and bodily function) to be incapable of living independently? Based on the information given, do you think this could be the case?  If so, what should be done in that situation?

2.  If you do **not** believe I am incapable of living independently, then what steps do I need to take to achieve stability?

764,"So a number of times my boyfriend has jokingly (or maybe not so jokingly) suggested I should make an OnlyFans to make some money, but when I've said, ""maybe I will"" he chimes in with ""only if he gets a cut"". When I've argued and ask why he deserves any money, his reasoning is that he's 'allowing me to do it'.

765,"My mother is in that gray area between bad parent and emotionally abusive parent. She's never hurt my physically-- let me just make that clear right off the bat. She's not that bad of a parent. But she does yell at me (NB15) and my younger brothers (M11 and M4) a lot, and kind of gaslights and guilt trips and tries to control all of us.

She's incredibly strict-- I'm not allowed to have my phone/computer in my room, I'm not allowed to use them after six, I'm not allowed to have social media, I have time limits on almost all apps. She uses MyCircle to enforce this. For those of you who don't know what MyCircle is, it's this thing that blocks apps and websites via the wifi router. It's scarily good at doing it's job, and there's no getting around it. The only reason that I'm able to be on reddit is because she doesn't know I'm on it.

The main reason I think she could be abusive, though, is just how she kinda quiet-yells whenever I do anything that gets on her nerves. By ""quiet-yells"" I mean that her voice isn't loud, but her tone is really, really scary, and it would be less frightening if she was actually yelling. For example, if I forget to put my plate in the dishwasher, she'll yell at me. And sometimes she's right to yell at me, because she asked me to and I forgot. I've got an incredibly horrible memory, which isn't an excuse, I know, but still. Sometimes I just forget stuff.

The most prominent thing that screams abusive mother to me is when I told a teacher I trust that my younger brother (M11) was making me uncomfortable. Naturally, my school called her. When she picked me up, she lectured me the entire car ride home about how I should have told her instead of the school, because my brother was ""too young to know what he was doing"". And she does have a point about the first thing. Maybe I should have told her. But I just have absolutely no trust for her, which I think she might know? Because she wasn't like ""why didn't you tell me"" she was like ""you should have told me"". 

But the thing that prompted me to write this post was what she did yesterday. So, she has this thing where she flips out if I lock the door to my bedroom out. She insists that it has to be open so that she can check on me every night. Personally, I find this so, so creepy, but whatever. A lot of parents do that. Last night, I forgot to unlock my door before going to sleep. So, what does she do? She hides my hairgel, and refuses to tell me where it is. It kinda sounds funny when you read it, but she was straight-up yelling at me when I asked her to tell me where it was. I wonder if she's entirely mentally stable a lot. Anxiety and OCD run in her family, along with other things.

There's no doubt in my mind that she's a bad parent. She's at least part of the cause of my anxiety and depression. But then I read all these horror stories about people with abusive parents, and I realize that I have it so good in comparison to them. It makes me wonder if I'm making all of it up for attention, and even though I don't think I am, I guess I could be.

Do you think that she's abusive, or just a bad parent? Am I overreacting? Should I tell a teacher or someone about what's going on?

I'm so sorry about the length of this post. Thank you to anyone who read through the whole thing.",08Nov2020,1

so, ive found someone. and i've felt in love. she was like, idk, obsession. and for sure she does like me. she hugged me, she visited me when i was in hospital, we talked a lot, met a lot, and it lasted for 3 months straight. and yeah, one day, after 3 months, just before the day that i wanted to tell her all about my feelings (for real, not figuratively, it was really planned and of course it was fucked up), she started to ghost me and after 2 weeks she said that she dont want it to become serious. after all of the time with her in my life it felt like...catastrophe. i did everything i could and after all of that i got rejected, it wasn't enough. i didnt blame her tho, didnt start arguing, its her choice, i can't do anything about that, we stopped being in contact at all, ok, but it literally destroyed me.

now basically every time im alone with myself i keep thinking about her, about what can go wrong and stuff like this. im doing it for like 6 months and im exhausted. yeah, being with friends helps, but just for the moment i am with them, short delight. and then this quarantine started and i was...alone. now i cant start doing what i like, i stopped every new begginings, and when i thought i was ready to move on, the school started and i see her every day. it fucked my mind again and i continued to overthink about her and us. and all this relationships things and discussions that started occasionally with my contemporaries really presses me too, finishing me off.

We've been planning on me moving in with him for Highschool for a few years now but that was back when I actually liked him. See, I sure as hell don't have the worst dad in the world, he isn't abusive or neglectful, but he is a piece of shit. I've never really been into sports, but for some reason my dad never realized that and tried to force me to do sports anyway even when I didn't want to and I hated it, especially when he would get angry at me. My dad will get angry over the littlest shit sometimes and his very presence is an annoyance to me. Apparently, my dad also left my mom with tens of thousands of dollars in THEIR debt, which I'll probably sue him over when I'm older with my mom's permission. The education system already makes me feel depressed, and my dad's high expectations only makes it worse. I also feel like he will tolerate any disrespect directed towards me but then when I give it back he will give me a lecture. It isn't just my dad though, I would also be living with multiple other family members all of which are annoying in their own way but aren't necessarily as bad as my dad. Overall, whenever I am at his house, I just feel a sensation of misery. This is probably because I am so used to living in a small household where I can have pretty much the entire house to myself with all the privacy I need because my mom is at work for most of the dad while my grandma is somewhere else while at my dad's house it is packed full with other family members. I think it would be a good time to mention that I am an introvert, which I am. The reason I put quotation marks at the beginning is because although I am technically living with my dad, I am going back and forth to and from my dad's and mom's house because I have online school.

805,"Hi everyone,

I honestly have no idea who to talk or turn to, so first off, thank you so much in advance for even taking the time to read this. I'll try to be brief, but I'm kind of a mess right now.    

So, about me really quickly: I'm a 33 year old single woman with no children who has no idea what to do with my future...in the sense that I feel torn on where to live.    

Why I'm here: For the past four and a half years (prior to this summer) I was living in NYC. I enjoyed it for the culture and diversity, but I also really struggled at times as I was so far away from family, and so, I kept daydreaming about moving elsewhere...**eventually.** Well, when COVID hit, my roommate suddenly decided to move home once our lease was up (three weeks before said lease was up...but I can't really fault her, given the weirdness of everything). Since I couldn't afford the rent on my own, and had very little time to decide, that prompted me to move back to my home state on a whim and see how I felt about being ""back."" I put that in quotes because I moved to an entirely different part of the state than where I'm originally from. More on that in a minute. Also, as a note, I am lucky enough to have a good job that allows us to work from home since COVID, so I'm extremely lucky in that--for the foreseeable future--a job isn't the main crux of my problems--and that is a HUGE privilege to have, and one I'm *very* aware of.

Why I'm struggling: So, while I wasn't ready to come back so suddenly, I ultimately made the choice o be by my father, more or less, as it's where he retired. Long story short, my mother and only sibling passed away suddenly a few years back, so now it's just the two of us, and as he's aging, I really want to be around him more often than NYC afforded me the opportunity for. (Also, he's since remarried, which is a strange, uncomfortable situation, but putting aside my feelings there, my dad is my main reason for being back here.) HOWEVER. I feel really anxious about being here outside of my dad. I have no friends here, and due to the current world situation, I can't exactly meet anyone new. Which I completely understand and respect. (Also I'm super introverted!) I am single without children, and in the Midwest at my age, that is a very odd thing indeed. So, lately, I've been finding myself really missing NYC, but the idea of moving back also stresses me out as it would mean giving up the proximity to my dad, which just...hurts. But I'm also not happy here. Each option feels like the wrong one, and I just wish someone could tell me what to do. So, hi!

**TL;DR:** 33/F/single/no kids, unexpectedly moved back suddenly to Midwestern home state from NYC this summer. I wanted/want to be by my dad (my only family left), but I'm extremely lonely here, feel listless, and think I may want to move back to NYC. But I'm terrified that if I do, I'll regret not living by/spending time with my aging father, and I think a lot of that stems from fear/trauma of previous passing of my family. I'm just lost.",08Nov2020,1

816,"Hello! I’m terrible at advice and giving people advice. I’m looking for some ideas for a helpful response to a manic bipolar episode text message from my uncle. 

Here’s some background information because I’m sure everyone is confused! I’m going to try to start from the beginning without this being too long. 

My uncle has a list of mental problems, bipolar disorder being one of many, and my family has been trying to help him for ages now. He lived with my grandma who recently passed away about two weeks ago. She had consistently tried to help him get help in preparation for her death, but he never did. He’s completely distraught given her death. He’s also had terrible relationship problems and has never had a relationship stick. He has had a crush on a girl for twenty years now (so he claimed in the message he sent me) and the girl actually has a boyfriend of 10+ years and two kids with him (I don’t know why they never married). My uncle went on about how she had completely used him, that he’ll never love again “she killed future love” for him, and a list of names against her (evil, pathological, pathetic, etc.) 

The thing is that this message was long enough that when I took screenshots to show my mom it was FIVE screenshots. I sent it to my mom to inform her and to see if she got anything similar to it. So far, he hasn’t sent this message to anyone else. I used to be close to my uncle until I was about twelve but then we drifted apart. It’s very out of the blue now for him to send me any messages let alone one like this. If I was the only one he sent this type of message to then I want to be able to send him a helpful and thoughtful message back because I feel like he just wants someone to talk to. Anyone know how to even start a message back to him? I’m completely lost on how to give him some helpful advice.

818,"TL;DR: I've been stood up twice on the trot, should I avoid disappointment again or wait it out?

Hi there, I am a 20 year old guy from the UK. I am currently single and a student at uni. Over the past 2 months on 2 separate occasions I had dates planned with 2 different girls. Both seemed up for it but ultimately rescheduled and eventually aired me. Obviously they weren't up for it from the beginning or just flaked last minute. I have my opinions on this and don't see why fully grown women can't just be up front especially as we haven't met prior and have no ties to one another. 

I have been speaking to another girl for the past 2 weeks and I recently offered to go for drinks. The conversations were engaging so I figured it might be worth a shot. She agreed of course but then went on to extend the ""date"" for the week after because of uni which is fair enough. 

Again I am getting hard de ja vu and feel like just ignoring her. I know however that is beyond childish ,so the gentlemen in me wants to just say ""sure that's fine"". However I can't be arsed to wait on someone who isn't 100%. Part of me wants to tell her to be honest if she's not interested but that will make me come across very insecure. 

Any suggestions?",08Nov2020,1
819,"I am writing here to ask for advice because I feel like I am out of options. This might be a bit of long read but bear with me here for a bit. 

So both me and my girlfriend play world of warcraft. We used to have a really good relationship but this all changed when she started talking to a guy from an infamous RP server that is known for sex RP stuff. At first I didn't give it much attention since I trusted her and thought she's just in it for some innocent fun. At that point we were living together because of the pandemic period. One day she suddenly said she wants to go home and she left. After that I found it very hard to get to meet her and every time we met she said she wanted to break up with me and we ended up fighting. At that point I didn't really suspect she was up to anything funny. I thought it was just because I didn't give her enough attention while we were living together and she started feeling neglected. I took her out a few times since she wasn't completely cold towards me and we even had fun together. A month later she said she wanted to have sex with me, and after we did it she confessed to me that she had been doing stuff with that guy from Argent Dawn while we were separated. Apparently that guy is quite rich and got her quite a few gifts. She didn't get with him for that in the start, he did it because he had quite interesting fetishes and she was intrigued. My girlfriend is barely 20 and I am 28, I figured out that she was just curious, or that she just wanted to take advantage of his money, so I forgave her when she returned to me and eventually she said she will end contact with him.

This is when the problems started. This guy who apparently became quite addicted  on all the 'content' my girlfriend had provided him started threatening her that he would not let everything end like this. Even when she blocked him he would keep sending long emails or messages via pay pall transfers for her to read. He kept guilt tripping her about how he ruined his life and how everything would be solved if she did just one movie that takes 5 minutes a day. Naturally she didn't want to do that, but he kept gloating about how he gave her so much money and that this is the least she could do for him. Let me clarify something, all the money he gave her he did so voluntarily as a gift. She never asked for this and the total he gave her was a sum under 1000 pounds, which is probably nothing to this guy. When he saw that this isn't working he started making ambiguous threats along the lines of 'If you don't do this for me I won't let it rest'. Knowing as that guy had quite a bit of sexual content of her and scared of the fact that he might post everything on the internet or to her closed ones, she secretly started making videos for him again. Eventually she came out crying to me telling me that he keeps asking her for stuff even now. I wrote him a message asking him to stop because frankly he's destroying her mental state with all those degrading demands that he makes of her. The guy has a really sick fetish that I would rather not mention here. Of course this didn't phase him and he offered her a deal that if she continues making videos for him until the end of the year he will stop after that. Frankly, he started asking her for small stuff but today I found out that he asked her for something really bad and she complied. He is conditioning her to be his obedient little sex slave, he is even rewarding her with small amounts of money based on how well she performs. When i found out about what she did today I told her she has to stop or I will end our relationship. I don't believe this guy will keep his word of not asking for anything after new years eve and I feel that if i let this go on she will be so conditioned to just doing as he says that she will not be able to refuse him anyway, that's why I want to put an end to this one way or another. 

I do understand that this situation is something that my girlfriend got into through her own stupid actions, and that technically she completely betrayed my trust and love. However I cannot simply abandon her in this situation. Right now I am the only one she can rely and trust. I am not happy at all about being in relationship with a girl who broke a 2 year relationship for some guy she met online, especially since she had quite some sketchy stuff happening with some other one year before but I caught her and ended it quickly back then so it never escalated into anything like this. I am not very good with women and that's why I never had a serious relationship before this one. Maybe I am just clinging to this girl because of that, but deciding what to do about this relationship comes after fixing this mess.

 Nonetheless I cannot really back away from this situation as I am the only one that can help her right now. I thought of a few options like contacting the police, but the problem is that we are from an eastern European country while he is from the UK. I don't believe our police can punish him and I don't know if his local police will take action for a report coming from another country. We don't have the money to take him to court or any idea how to do this whatsoever. Also technically if we get the police involved this guy might just post everything online and it will be almost impossible to take it down when everything is on the internet. I really don't know how to solve this difficult situation, or how to punish this guy for his actions. If you have any ideas I'd be glad to hear them.",08Nov2020,1

Do sport because it’s the key for a long life. Love and love and love. Hate will never bring you the light, hate will never get you to the top, life is too short to be pissed off all the time.

The one thing I want more than anything is someone I can feel completely at ease with and open up to. I know it’s a cliche but I imagine the movie friends or relationships where they can get really deep and feel at ease. But there is just no one I can do this with. 

No matter who it is I feel uncomfortable talking deeply about me. Even with my therapist it’s hard at times. 

I don’t know how/where to find this. Part of it is just me being private and generally not trusting people, but another part is because there is no one I feel I can do this with. I read the stories of people who know someone else really well and can tell when they’re wrong etc, but I have none of that. 

I’ll leave it here because I’m rambling. But does anyone else share this feeling, and does anyone have any advice on how to work towards overcoming this/is it just a me thing?",08Nov2020,1
831,"So me and my boyfriend love together and due to my childhood I'm a very clingy and easily attached person. My boyfriend likes to call me his puppy cause I'm a very loyal and easily attached person and am the type to be a people pleaser. He doesn't always like it too much but some of it he finds cute. 

I've realized that I'm way too clingy for my own good. And that I've started to get very paranoid and maybe an possessive in our relationship. I don't want to scare him away but I can't help it. I'm just so scared he'll leave me alone like everyone else. I don't want to be alone anymore and he may as well be my only joy and what's keeping me together. 

I hate how I'm like this but it feels like a devil is in my shoulder whispering into my ear and deluding me. I can feel my paranoia growing day by day. Even though it's quarantine I'm scared he's out with other girls or something or that he's planning to move out. It scares me so badly. I want him to stay with me. I don't want him to leave. 

He's expressed that he loves me and wouldn't ever leave me but apart of me can't help but think he's lying to me. And my self-esteem is just plummeting. I feel like he could never love me with how I am. That he's just lying to me or pitying me and it really sucks. I can't even trust him and I hate it. I feel so undeserving but at the same time I don't want him to leave me alone. The thought of it terrifies me but if I keep this up he might actually break up with me.",08Nov2020,1

833,"I (23M) have been crossdressing since I was 8 years old. My parents used to come home from work (and still do) at around 9pm every night, so I had plenty of time to crossdress. It started with applying lipstick. Eventually it went on to mascara and nail polish. I started wearing heels and then bras, skirts etc. By the age of 15, I could fully pass as a girl. However, I never went out of my house and none of my friends knew about it. My routine was simple. Come back from school, have lunch, dress up (took an hour), do the household chores and then my homework. I would change back to my boy clothes before my parents came. When I turned 18 I went to college and I was secretly craving the chance to crossdress full time. And I did. I pretty much had full practice on how to walk, sit and move like a lady. I also learnt how to do a female voice (via YouTube). During my 4 years in college I was a woman 95% of the time. I was pretty lowkey, didn't make any close friends. No one found out my secret. After graduating last year, I got a job and unfortunately I couldn't crossdress at work because they had my official documents and knew I was a man. I wore a bra underneath my office attire to keep myself sane. 

Here's the thing, I'm pretty sure I want to get married and start a family. I don't have a girlfriend and I have never been in a relationship. But assuming one day I will, I want to get rid of my crossdressing habit because it will interfere with my marriage. No woman wants a man who is basically a woman all the time. However its is part of my life now and I'm beginning to think I should've stopped a long time ago. Any advice?",08Nov2020,1

In the past 5 years I’ve had two children and couple jobs. I had no problem being social at work, but it honestly always ended one of two ways 1) I was working with college age people who’s idea of quality time was partying down (I live in a college town) and I’m just not a party person or 2) I felt it was prudent to keep my coworkers separate from my home life.

836,"At the moment, I am doing 10 GCSES: Maths, English language, English literature, Geography, Business studies, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics and Spanish. My exams are in 2-3 weeks. I've studied casually for the past 2 weeks primarily on the 3 sciences, math and Spanish because they are the most important to me. I came up with an idea of revising but I have no time to do half my subjects then.. I made it so that every day after school, I arrive at 4:15, I do whatever I want for 5-15 min, then eat within half an hour. I would then study 30 min of every subject until bedtime with 30 min to fall asleep to finish off work.

I chose a wide range of subjects to broaden my options but am so confused because I have no idea what I like. I like all my sciences but also want to make money? What do I become? My grade average currently is 6-7 for all subjects except a 5 for Spanish primarily because I don't care about it. I just wanna learn Spanish, not be tormented by the boredom of it.

838,"Let me start off by saying I never usually ask strangers for help (I like to solve my own problems without help), but I'm very upset and have no one else to turn to. I live with 2 roommates, my friend and his brother. We both served in the marine corps (rah) for 5 years and got out last year. We've been very good friends since then, and I love him as a brother.

I think it's important to say that after I got out, I've been having the worse time of my life. Depression and anxiety got the best of me and I've just been dwindling since. I talk less and less to my other military buddies and my family. Majority of my time I spend alone.

I like to think myself as a strong figure. Never showed any sad or weak emotions. I felt like I've had to keep the strong guy act for my family and friends. I needed to be strong in front of them, especially my mother (ever since she had a manic episode, I knew I had to be her shoulder and keep up the strong son act). I bring this up because being strong is so tiring on the mind and body.

Anyways, my friend is the abrasive type. Will say whatever is on his mind no matter the situation. He is a loose cannon and it doesn't take much to set him off. He has gotten better, but its still in his core, if that makes sense. He's a bit of a narcissist, but he's working on that himself. He also likes to give demands more than ask (pretty sure due to his job in the corps) and I don't like being demanded. I've made that apparent.

So we are sitting on the couch watching TV and he snaps his fingers at me which is an issue for me because I don't like being snapped at. I told him not to do it again. He just smiles and does it again. Something in my mind just snapped. I said ok, got up, and went straight to my room. I've been avoiding him since then. This was 3 days ago and he knows something is wrong, he just doesn't want to admit what he did and apologize. I know this doesn't sound like a serious problem and there are bigger and worse things happening. I honestly don't know what to do. Am I really just overreacting? Should I apologize for being so distant?",08Nov2020,1

841,"So my dad is usually a pretty chirpy guy and he usually always has a positive outlook on stuff. I remember a lot of times feeling tired and groggy in the mornings with him and he would smile, make me a cup of tea and tell me that I had the choice whether to make this a good day or a bad day. It’s something I remember a lot now and it’s stuck by me even though it may be simple to other people.

Recently he’s been worrying me, we’re on lockdown here so he hasn’t been able to do the things he loves (kayaking) and he works from home a lot in the same chair all day. I go to school and when I come home he’s still working, he’s got a high paying job and I think he’s stressed a lot. I remember on Friday I walked out to the kitchen and he had his head in his hands, said something about work stress and people falling out with him at work. He had a surgery on Wednesday to remove a birthmark he had and he’s been in a lot of pain so that’s also made him feel even worse this week. The thing that really made me worry was I woke up in the morning and saw his coat was on the chair and he told me he couldn’t sleep and went on a walk at 1am. The place he walked to was about a 50 min walk each way. He didn’t come home until after 3am. He never really walks anywhere so this is completely out of the blue, I don’t know if I’m worrying over nothing but even later tonight I saw him in the kitchen and asked how he was and he just sighed and said “another day”.

843,"When I [34M] moved to Louisiana in 2018 for work I met this girl [33F] from tinder. We went on 3 great dates before I had to relocate back to Toronto which I was pretty bummed about. Even though I left the country nothing changed and we would talk everyday. We finally decided to meet up in Philadelphia for a weekend for a music festival. I tried to kiss her but that didn't go as planned. She went back to Louisiana and I went back to Toronto. We texted for about a week and then she ghosted me for the next year. 

At the beginning of this year she messaged me out of the blue and we picked up where we left off. We would talk everyday for about 9 months. Even though we are in a different countries the connection felt strong. I would send her flowers, we sent each other gifts for our birthdays, I would buy her dinner on the regular, and we talk on zoom for hours. We would talk about traveling so I decided to offer to fly her out to Cabo for 5 nights. She was hesitant at first because of work and travel during covid but she decided to take the trip after a few days of thinking. She said she needed to know if it would work with us. 

The day finally came and we finally were together in Cabo. It was great to see her again,  she's honestly the most amazing woman I've ever met. We had a lot of drinks and had some really deep conversations where she admitted to ghosting me because she wasn't ready for a serious relationship and still wanted to date. On the second night there I made my move and we started making out pretty heavy but she didn't want to have sex, I respected that. The rest of the trip we would kiss but but she avoided the heavy making out and the touching. It made me feel like she lost interest mid trip. The trip came to and end and she kissed me goodbye at the airport before we went our separate ways 

It's been about a week since the trip and she has been really short when it comes to texting she's definitely not communicating like we were a few weeks ago. We haven't even tried to talk on zoom. It's really hard to tell if she's still interested in me. I sent her a text last night telling her how I felt about her and how much I enjoyed the trip. She replied ""thanks for everything, I enjoyed the trip too."" I was hoping she would open up and tell me how she feels.

Should I ask her if this is something she still wants to pursue? Should I give her space? It's been driving me crazy because I developed feelings for her. What should I do?",08Nov2020,1
845,"A few months ago i had this thing with a guy. It started out as kind of a ons but it happened several times. Before we ever did anything we always kind of flirted with each other and there was always this tension between us. I tried to just stay friends and not do anything because he is 10+ years older but this tension became so strong. Skip forward- the last time i slept at his place he told me he was interested in me and that he didnt want to hurt me. A week or two later he was dating someone. It all confused me so much because why would he tell me he was interested in me if he already had someone else when he didnt want to hurt me? so recently i drove him and his gf and two of their friends to a party and the others went inside while he sat in the car. and he told me he was sorry. but the thing i find more confusing is that this tension between us is still there. It has been every time we’ve gotten eye contact, even after he started dating her. like we locked eyes when we sat in the car and it just got completely silent. like it felt like we were going to kiss so i had to look away. like when she is there he ignores me, but when she isn’t he tries to talk to me. i dont know if he just wants to fuck me or what. but he also told me one time that he didnt only want to fuck me. he is a really genuine guy so i dont think he was lying when he said he didnt want to hurt me and when he tells me that he’s sorry two months later it seems like he cares. idk if i should talk to him to get some closure because i cant keep going around thinking about him non stop. i want to move on, but im so confused that i cant get my mind off him. but i also dont want his gf getting mad and i have no intention in ruining things for them. i just want to understand.",08Nov2020,1

Okay so even to me this sounds irrational so please bear with me. 

I’m 24, still a student and living with my boyfriend and fur babies in the UK. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and been struggling ever since. I’ve tried therapy but because there is no obvious trigger for my MH conditions, I find it hard to engage and there isn’t anything from my past to have caused it. I’ve been on 4 different SSRI’s over the years and I’ve found one (escitalopram) which has worked for my GAD and CDD but never 100%. I’ll get on to the actual point now. 

I left my A Levels when I was in 19, started uni but dropped out due to MH. 

When I was 20 (in 2016) moved to north England to live with my boyfriend &amp; I thought moving away would help me out a lot and that a fresh start was needed. I started uni again but my depression only got worse, I would spend all my time in bed sleeping &amp; I never had the ‘uni experience’ because I lived with my boyfriend &amp; stuff but that was fine with me as I didn’t want to live in uni accommodation because I found it expensive for what you get. I also never went on nights out because I didn’t really enjoy spending all that money on drinking. I dropped out of uni AGAIN due to MH. I took a year out and my MH was so bad I was unable to work and we were living on my boyfriends student loan &amp; wage from his part time job, but it was a massive struggle for us. 

We moved out of this town and moved back in with parents for the summer of 2018 and then moved to a major city in the north of Leeds where I started uni again for the third time (I’m still there now, due to graduate next summer) and I’ll be 25 early (ish) next year and I feel like I’ve let depression steal the best years of my life. I’ve spent so much time in bed sleeping, or in the house due to GAD or broke. I feel so frustrated with myself for letting those years slip past me with absolutely nothing to show for it. I’m graduating 3 years late, I can’t drive, I haven’t been on holiday since 2017, I haven’t been to a festival since 2013. Late last year &amp; early this year before covid, I was starting to get myself back out there, I was going to the club, I was having days out, I was feeling motivated for this year to FINALLY get some memories under my belt but it’s just not been that way.

I (F20) haven't been taking care of myself at all. I put on some weight the past 1,5 years and I'm starting to feel less comfortable in my own body. Also, I'd like to be fitter in general and go for a walk with my boyfriend without sweating so much... I'm working on my diet and this is going fine, but again I'd like to be fitter.

857,"I have a friend who was super cautious (from what she said) about the pandemic. In fact, they seemed kind of extreme about the pandemic at first. I’m immunosuppressed and had a hospital stay this year so I appreciated it.

Anyone I do stuff with during the pandemic is given a chart with low, medium, and high risk activities. I tell them to give me 14 days before seeing me if they are doing medium or high risk activities.  I’ve been really direct and consistent about this. We live in a state that requires indoor masking etc.

I don’t do much indoors with people usually and she invited me over to meet her new baby. Towards the end of her pregnancy, she had told me several times she was having family quarantine for 14 days prior to seeing the baby so I wasn’t concerned.

While I’m there, she tells me another friend visited. I expressed: “they haven’t been taking any precautions. Did you ask them about it?” I felt on edge, but she reassured me they have been careful, but I was a little concerned about the honesty there.  Her husband then comes home from the grocery store and explains he had to take his bandana off and put on a mask or they won’t let him in ___ store.  At this point, I’m just frozen.  I had no idea they had stopped wearing masks in public places??

I begin asking really direct questions and it comes out her in laws go to in person church and have been in their home recently.  I just stop questions.  She knew my boundaries, she lied or omitted stuff from me. 

I told her we wouldn’t be doing indoor play dates for the rest of the pandemic.  I had to tell people, all other people who have health risks in their family, I was exposed to these situations.  She knows people I have been seeing and their health issues.  I was put on no play dates for 14 days from some people, which is understandable.

After more thought though, I feel when she reaches out next, I will just be saying I’m not comfortable with doing anything until the pandemic is over.  I like her as a person and I’ve enjoyed sing her friend, but this was violating and I caught her a few other times lying to other people about what she was doing (I stayed out of it, but it made me very uncomfortable). 

I really even question if we are friends anymore with these boundary violations.  There was no apology or remorse.  It is fine if she makes different choices with her family, but I don’t like that she made them for me too when I stated what I was comfortable with. I feel like she was annoyed she got caught.

This is a difficult topic and it does deal with abuse so trigger warning.

I'm the youngest sibling and my oldest brother was in a relationship with a woman 4 almost two years. It was just a fling at the start but when he found out she was pregnant because he's a responsible adult he said he would support he in her decision. They end up together but she has turned out to be emotionally and physically abusive to my brother. She's kicked him bit him attacked him while he's holding their child. Accused him of cheating . But because he loves her and wants a family unit he stayed. Although they have just broken up I think he does want to get back with her and I don't know what to do. Honestly  saying I don't like her is putting it lightly but I know he still loves  her so don't want to go full offensive and loose his trust and confidence  or make him feel ashamed if he does go back to her.

We started working on a project car together, a ‘49 Crosley rat rod build. I tinkered on it for four years, did virtually all the work myself with her chipping in now and then. We broke up this last spring, and had to decide what to do with the car; we came to a decision that I would “buy out” her half of the car. So we did so, and moved on. Fast forward a few months and I’m finding that I am lacking motivation to do anything on the car to complete it.

Part of me wants to finish it, and drive the hell out of it, partially because I’ve had a couple videos made about it and have plastered photos of it in progress all over my other social medias, partially because I’ve got so much time, effort, blood, and sweat invested in it.  The other part of me wants to pull my engine and trans out of it and see if she wants to buy it, or if not just list it for sale online because it reminds me of her and the hell I put her through and I don’t know that I could ever take a future gf for a ride in it.

Background to me: M, 16, and not in a good mental spot, haven't been for a couple of years. I tend to just isolate myself from my family and stay in my room which for me is perfectly fine.

Her, on the other hand, has been this way for quite some time. She will get violent if you even crack a joke in her direction. She says ""she has demons"" and jokes about them, but IDK the validity of that. I don't know if I can even defend myself sometimes because I'll end up in trouble.

Today she legit threw a punch at me because I was checking something on the weapon loadout she made for Warzone, then spun the story to think that I had thrown the first punches, and said she would call dad if I kept hitting her, when in reality she kept encroaching on my space and hurting me. I fear one day she'll get upset over a little joke when neither of my parents are home and she'll grab a knife and stab/kill me. Its messing with my brain because I get in trouble no matter the outcome in my parents eyes. She's basically the perfect child (gets in trouble rarely) and I tend to get in trouble more for the fighting than her. 

What can I try to do to help myself in this situation?

870,"my boyfriend hasn't had many guy friends in his life and is unsure how to deal with this.

It started out well enough, they both like to play a bit of music together on the weekends. The neighbor himself seems like a nice dude (helped my bf out as much as he could when he got a flat tire, offers hits of weed etc...) They seem like they have a pretty good friendship going on.

This issue is that the neighbor will play his bass LOUDLY, for six hours or more, over what seems like the same riffs. Him practicing isn't the issue, its just the intense volume that its at. It vibrates the entire apartment and is now affecting my boyfriend's mental health because you can't escape it. My boyfriend can't enjoy his own apartment over how loud this bass is.

So, my bf has asked the neighbor four times now to turn it down and has explained that the bass travels and is intense. To his credit, he does turn it down, but the very next day he has the volume right back up again. Boyfriend is starting to feel this is just disrespectful and rude because he has to ask so many times over the same thing. Boyfriend no longer feels like practicing music over the weekend with the neighbor because of it.

It has now gone as far as boyfriend wanting to place speakers against the wall and blast music back as well. I convinced him not to, because it seems like a route for petty music wars (neighbor has admitted in the past that he cranks up the volume when a past neighbor asked him to turn it down)

I am trying to convince boyfriend to do a one last hail mary and talk to him (again) about just how badly the bass is and how its affecting him. Boyfriend considers going to the landlady, music blasting, and just full on moving; with his reasoning being that if the neighbor really saw him and respected him as a friend, he wouldn't be doing the same shit over and over again (fair enough)

He would like to know if there is a better sort of way to go about doing this, or if his neighbor is indeed an asshole or just socially inept .",08Nov2020,1

874,"I'm extremely embarrassed to tell this story but I could use some advice and need to let it out. 

There is no excuse for poor actions, regardless of the situation. Sometimes, those actions are driven by significant insecurities and depends on how extreme they are. Everyone experiences them differently. I, for one, am in a pretty good position in life. I have a career, graduated college, am a physical therapist, have my puppy, have a new car, and just bought a house. I'm in my late 20's. I have fought a lot of inner demons and have won. I came a long way from losing everything I had (money, school, job, etc) to something in my life.  I felt worthless. 

When I had lost everything, during that time, getting cheated on by my first true love was very, very difficult for me to deal with. Getting cheated on by someone I fully trusted lead me to completely break down and lose everything I had (stated before) because of the effect it had on me.  I can deal with stress and difficult issues, but the toll this took on me was different.  I invest a lot in my relationships, whether it's with family, friends, or lovers.  And when I get screwed over, I take it very personal. I grew up being alone, no siblings, my cousins lived far, I sucked at school, i got bullied every day for years, everyone thought I was weird, barely any friends, it was great. 🙄 I'm a sensitive dude, what can I say. 

I eventually rebuilt myself up to what I wanted to be, and it worked out great, but the damage of the infidelity hit me hard, and it continues to haunt me. I have not had a single relationship last me more than a year. Throughout these few years, every girlfriend has dumped me because I was either too ""needy"" or I didn't trust them, which ultimately has me acting anxious or has me doing/saying weird things.  I have been going to therapy for a few years now, and everything was going great! But for whatever reason, trusting someone has been very difficult for me when it came to intimate relationships.  I have walked in on girlfriends having sex with other dudes when I visit them from out of state for a surprise. I have had girlfriends think I was crazy for thinking they had a thing for my best friend, only to find out that she has been trying to text him behind my back and he went along with it.  I've been hit hard.  

I recently got into a relationship with this girl a few weeks ago. We instantly clicked, I really like her. I know what I want, so I knew I wanted her.  Out of all the women I dated (my confidence levels have gone up immensely since therapy and working on myself), this girl won me over.  I haven't been this excited about someone in a long time, and with all the women I have dated.  She's beautiful, smart, hardworking, sweet, funny, fuck... my hearts racing just talking about her.  She did not ever have any complaints about me, but this one thing I did....and I did it because I was insecure in my ability to have someone not cheat on me or be good enough. 

I made a fake Facebook profile and acted like another guy when talking to her (Childish and embarrassing, I know).  My intention was to see if she was worth while before I invest more time and feelings into her.  I felt the need to protect myself, I just wanted security.  It turns out she was honest the whole time.  I was happy to find that out.  Not so happy when she found out it was me. I don't know how she found out, I didn't tell anyone (not trying to justify doing it).  She called me out on it, and it took a while for me to fess up to it.  It was incredibly embarrassing, and it was hard to own up to.  Now, I'm sitting in my room typing this out with full regret and feeling of stupidity because how can a grown man do something so childish? I lost someone who had every potential to reciprocate the love and effort I give, but my stupid insecurities drove her away.  She no longer talks to me, she is ignoring me, and I don't blame her.  

I want to attempt to win her back through explaining myself, apologizing, proving to her that I am continuing to work on this even more than what I already am.  But I don't know how.  Any advice on what I should do? I really want to win this girl over.",08Nov2020,1

877,"My dad is... Interesting. To try and keep things short I won't go into to much detail unless asked for it. So I'm still a teenager for reference. My dad also just got back from a year long trip. 

So for starters, ever since I was little my dad told me not to cry. For the list 5 ish years I have barely allowed myself to cry and only now am I beginning to think it's ok. 
My dad also yells at me a lot even over little things, and now, if an authority figure even slightly raises their voice at me I move to the verge of tears. I told him this and he laughed at me and said, ""is that why you look like you're gonna cry right now?""
He also holds tight to gender norms. He has told me not to have a boyfriend that wears makeup and skirts because I may as well have a girlfriend. He also laughs at me and tells me that he doesn't like that I'm more girly now, and missed me being a tomboy.

Now moving to today. So me and my mom went to go pick up dinner to bring back to my dad and brother. We got back and my dad looks at the meal and then starts asking where the buffalo sauce is. My mom and I point to the little cup next to him and say, ""that is."" And he turns and raises his voice and says, ""Do you think I'm ret**ded? I know what this is and it isn't buffalo sauce!""

My mom: well I asked for buffalo sauce so that should be it...

Dad: it's barbaque sauce I'm not dumb. *Throws his other sauce at the table*

My dad walks away for a second then comes back. And then turns to me and my mom. 

""Both of you need to stop acting like I'm reta**ed. I can tell when my effing sauce is."" Then he turns to me and says, ""you're mom can get away with it sometimes but you can not. If this crap doesn't stop I'm going to grill into you.""

He yells at my mom as if she is another child and not his wife. She doesn't stand up to him because he is bigger and louder. He even talks about how he wishes I was a boy because he can't spank me as punishment anymore since I'm a girl.

880,"We’re both in our mid 20s and have been together since March. Said “I love you” to each other in August, even though we both wanted to say it months prior. We have an amazing relationship. Easily the healthiest and happiest one I’ve ever had. I’ve never been so utterly in love with someone and felt so positive about a future before.

We have not discussed moving in together, but we both talk about moving (I want to find a better apartment—and currently live alone, he lives with his parents and is actively looking for a room with someone). He was recently offered a really amazing deal to have an apartment to himself that he could afford. I’m very, very excited for him but I guess I can’t help but feel a little sad that it seems like he wouldn’t want to find a place together in 2021. When things hopefully calm down a bit (Covid wise) and when we’ve had more time to develop our relationship. 

I know it sounds weird, but I can’t help but feel somewhat rejected/unwanted? He has a wonderful relationship with his parents so it isn’t like he has bad living conditions. Of course he wants to move out and move on though, I totally get that... and I genuinely am excited for him to take the next step in finding a place. I guess I was just hoping that I would be included, as silly as it may seem. We haven’t been dating for a year even but we have such a strong and mature relationship already.

Is it odd to always want to see your SO? If I could, I would fall asleep and wake up next to him every single night. Yes I would want time for my friends and vice versa, but I would be overjoyed to be with him and some spend time with him every day. Sometimes I feel like I’m smothering him even though we hangout 2-3 nights (*occasionally* one weekend day a week) which I don’t think is a lot of time. Sometimes we’ll have dinner together, but usually he’ll come over my place around 8pm after having dinner with his parents. Then we go to bed between 10-11. So I really don’t get quality time with him. 

Occasionally we’ll have “long weekends” together where he’ll stay over Friday and Saturday night, sometimes Sunday too, and if he doesn’t have to work that weekend then we’ll do something on Saturday and/or Sunday. It’s really rare, but every time it happens he’ll say how he loves being with me and loves waking up and having breakfast together and so on. So it kinda makes me feel like he’s on the same page, but I don’t know?

Things like today—he stayed the night last night (came over around 7pm, we went to bed around 10:30pm) I had a chance to visit him at work for 15 minutes and he was like oh what’re you doing tonight? I said nothing, just going home to relax. He said he might watch a show, so I said oh well if you want to come over and watch it together, you’re more than welcome. He just laughed it off and said I love you. Obviously we aren’t together tonight, which is fine, but I feel kind of rejected when it happens. I’m thinking that he would want some alone time for himself, but I wish I could stop thinking this way... 

I really don’t know how to handle it. I find myself stressing about this so much and comparing myself to others who live together and so on. For reference I have lived with an ex before and have almost moved in with another one (both were a few year long relationships) so I know what it’s like. My boyfriend has lived with friends in college before but I don’t think with a girlfriend.

We've got a separate gc for political discussion which, although it's remained civil, seems to have gone really hard line trump supporters. We don't live in the US, but they seem to believe in trump's absolute superiority to any other candidate. 

Tonight kind of sparked by one of them saying how interesting it was that, having lost, no trump supporters were ""tearing apart cities"".

It's devolved into wether the BLM movement was violent, that the police are being unfairly prosecuted and that the mainstream media (including BBC, guardian and nature - the scientific journal) significantly biased.

The think is, there's a decent 5 or so of them, each of whom I generally respect all acting like these are totally reasonable things to believe without sources. It's certainly possible I am the biased one - everyone in my family shares remarkably similar views - but I'm honestly struggling to understand their side. I don't have the mental reserves to keep trying to refute what they say, so I think I'm going to leave the chat.

884,"My parents told me a couple of weeks ago that we were going on a trip to a European country for around three weeks - a month. I wasn't really excited about a vacation because of the pandemic, online school and being suspicious of my parents reasons for going on one. However, after I spent two full weeks trying to convince my parents that going wasn't a practical idea and that I just didn't wanna go, I realized that it was pointless to keep trying to convince them so I gave up and shut my mouth.

The day we were leaving I had such an unsettling feeling, I was unusually pissed the entire day, which was weird because when I went to bed the night before I felt fine. Fast forward another week, we are now at our destination and I'm actually feeling pretty open-minded to it all, when my dad pulls me aside. He takes me to a cafe and basically says that he plans to relocate our family here ""for atleast a couple months"" and put my younger siblings in school here. 

I'm absolutely shocked, because obviously I wasn't expecting to suddenly be stuck in a random country where I don't speak the language and stick out amongst everybody, during a pandemic... I explain that I really dont think thats a good idea, and would rather go home instead. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time my parents lied to me like this. Years ago when I was a kid they tricked me into living in my home country (where I'd never been before and couldn't talk to anybody for months cuz I didn't speak the language) and then left me there with relatives I barely knew for a year, and I still hold a grudge l/no longer trust them as much over that. 

I thought this vacation was different, now that I'm almost an adult and since its been almost a decade, but I guess my parents still haven't changed. Anyways, my father told me that the reason we were doing this sudden move was because of my younger siblings' attitude problems, and they felt a ""change of environment"" would help since other punishments weren't working. This really upset me because I felt like I was being punished for something I didn't do. I've always done my job at home and kept up with my schoolwork and whatnot, so it hurts to see me be punished for no reason when I do everything right.

I tried to explain this to him, but he kept countering by saying that it was ""for the good of my siblings and our family."" I said it clearly wasn't done for me since I'm not the one with the attitude problems, but then he went on a rant and called me a selfish brat for saying that. He kept going on about how it was good to be in a country with other Muslims so his kids won't be corrupted or whatever, but I said that if that's what he thought why did he have and raise kids in the U.S? Then he got all mad over it and went on another rant. Finally, he said that he may let me go back but it won't be for months, and basically implied that if I kept ""complaining"" as he said, he would sell our home in the States to spite me. 

I tried to appeal to my mother, but she basically flipped the entire conversation to me not caring about my parents' feelings, and said I was selfish and heartless. Now I'm really frusturated and this has been taking a toll on me physically and mentally. I've been really sick lately, have not been able to eat (most food just doesn't taste good to me, even my favorites, not entirely sure if its not just cuz things taste different here) and I've been flipping between feeling nothing and feeling trapped and sad. 

I spent most of my time here in bed, trying to use my phone to take my mind off things, but all that would do is remind me of my home and all the people I've left behind and won't see for awhile, if ever if I happen to piss my parents off. Eventually I'd end up sleeping most of the day through, something I've never done before (I hate naps, but now I've found myself taking them to make the day end quicker). My school work has also suffered because of this (I'm still expected to do online school and the time difference stuff + the funk I've been in has fucked up my grades). 

Both my parents are of zero help, and everytime I try to say I'm really sad over this, they turn the convo into me being a bad daughter for not blindly going along with what they say. I'm not allowed to talk to my siblings about it because my parents are hiding everything from them til they finalize things with their new schools here, so my siblings don't have meltdowns or try to run away or something. Everytime I have a conversation with one of my siblings, I feel my parents watching me like they think I'll tell them. 

I know I'm being dramatic, but I honestly feel so trapped, only stuck with my family most of whom I dont get along with, and it feels like my life as I knew it is over.

I (22F) just moved to CA to work at my animation job, I have my own apartment now and currently work from home. I've just moved in about three weeks ago all the way from GA. My mom helped me move things as well (parents are divorced). 

I've moved several times in my life (this is my 9th move) and for once I finally feel like I'm in a stable place, and I'm comfortable. I feel truly at home now with a new sense of adulthood and responsibility, and I like it. However, my mom wants me home for Christmas, and so does my fiance's family. They get together in Florida every year, and I'll be marrying him in around a week via a simple courthouse wedding, so I know they'll want to finally meet me (he's Canadian so I haven't had the ability to meet his family yet.) I don't want to let them, or my mom down. Thing is, I don't *really*want to go. I know it's selfish, but I just got comfortable here, I finally feel settled in, and in less than a month I'm going to be leaving this sense of comfort for about a week. (I'm also an introvert and personal space/time to myself means a lot). It's also an issue I have with COVID. I'll be taking three planes, one out of CA-&gt;GA, Staying for Christmas, seeing family, and then GA-&gt;FL For my fiance's family, then FL-&gt;CA. I'm extremely nervous about being in planes like this and then being around so many people most likely without a mask (because family can't possibly have it, right? 🙄)

I don't want to disappoint anyone though, and I know if I don't go home for Christmas or see his family I'll disappoint them. I just don't *want* to but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm not sure what to do. I want to stay home and be comfortable, and take a week off instead of travelling during COVID around Christmas. I just don't know what to do.

My dad was also poor when he was a kid , but he worked hard to get us a better life , and he did. Now I feel guilty for all the good things that I have and the good life that I have . I know is not my fault that people stuffers, but the guilt is killing me. What can I do?",08Nov2020,1
890,"I guess I just need some advice on if I actually have trauma or not, or if I'm just being a dumbass. Also trigger warning! 
For context, I'm 18F, in my first year of college. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety. I'm also the oldest with three younger siblings.


When I was younger, whenever my brother would intentionally try to provoke me and we would fight, my parents would tell me to ignore it, or I would be punished, but not him. I still have a really strained relationship with him, some of the more recent things hes done is grope me (intentionally, my parents told me just to ignore it), ignore me attempting to set boundaries, or when my dad was taking me to the hospital and told him  and he said he didn't care. 

I can tell whenever my parents are stressed out or in a bad mood just by them talking or sighing. I was always scared to spend their money as a kid. I lie to them constantly because I'm scared to get in trouble. 
My mom constantly makes demeaning and passive agressive comments. Whenever we have talks about what I need out of them, they promise things and never follow through. 
I've always had to be the 'second' parent, I was expected to remember appointments and give directions to my dad, since around the age of 10. 

I'm sorry if this post is confusing or dumb.",08Nov2020,1
891,"To any LGBTQ+ people, please DO NOT order from Pride Palace. I ordered a flag and three pins from them in March and they arrived in July (five months) and they didn’t even come together (they both came in a month apart). I emailed them three times with zero response and even messaged them on their Facebook page where they did respond but completely ignored what I said and didn’t reply after that. It was free but it costed twenty-one dollars to ship. I’ve even read other people’s experiences on here where one had to go as far as to threaten to sue them in order to get their stuff. If you’re looking to buy any LGBTQ+ stuff then I’d advise you to order from Etsy or any other business, just not Pride Palace.",08Nov2020,1
892,"Hello!

I need your help. I'm struggling with life. 
At first, I wanted to write here my entire life story, give as much info as possible, but I'll do that later, maybe on more fitting subreddit. Here's the short &amp; sweet version. 

I need a wake up call. I have a great life, student at good university , great job, friends and everything and I'm losing it. The why is a bit longer, but super short version is anxiety attacks and procrastination. 

Now I want to make this clear  

I'M NOT DEPRESSED or at least I don't think I am. Yes, sometimes I'm sad and feel down, but most of the time I want to fight. I want to make the world a better place. I want to make the best version of me. I want to win! I'm pumped with energy and I'll get everything I want! 

And all of a sudden, before the task I have to do... I stop. And it's not a hard task, it's a homework, or ""send an email to school"". So I do other stuff. I write  emails to our president (yes. European country) I volunteer for clean up for my city block, I try to make new things (I'm working on a better mask right now),...

but my school's work is piling up, my job's work is piling up 

and both are simple (study civil engineering, so average chemistry, average physics, slightly below average maths (no proofs)) I'm very close to getting my degree. I don't think it's wasted time if one drops out but I'd still rather get it.

What can one do to help focus his energy (and I think I have loads and loads of it) in the right direction? 

I think this is a tipping point in my life. If I won't act now and push myself in the ""right""direction, I'll have it much harder in life later on. 


Oh, Reddit, Reddit in my phone,
help, so I don't have to groan.



TL;DR I'm overflowing with energy and ""let's do this"" vibe unit I have to do something in my school or job.",08Nov2020,1
893,"Okay for context I’m an 18 year old male and I asked out the most amazing , smart, funny and beautiful girl ever and she said yes to my ugly awkward ass. We got on really well, could talk for hours about anything, we went out 5 times and I loved being around her. Here’s the part were I’m an idiot:  5 times I didn’t kiss her. It terrified me because well I’ve never kissed anyone before outside of spin the bottle and I’m awful with social cues. After 5 dates with nothing further than hugging obviously she came to the conclusion that it wasnt gonna work out. Course I get it. Truth is though I feel terrible because I ruined everything by not having the balls to kiss the most amazing girl ever and I just really regret it. I’ve talked to mutual friends and theyve all said she really liked but she felt that it lacked intimacy or it’s just weird I didn’t kiss her We’ve agreed to be friends and we’re going for a walk and idk whether to try and have a relationship as friends while having a massive crush on her and constantly being reminded of my failure to fucking kiss her or to tell her that I want to try again or kiss her or something. Any advice is appreciated thanks.",08Nov2020,1
894,"Once a week or so, I get sudden bursts of uncontrollable emotions, usually negative ones, including anger, sadness, annoyance, frustration, etc etc. It’s usually a combination of those emotions.

For example just a few hours ago my dog was whining at me because she knew it was near dinner time. For a bit it was funny, then I just couldn’t handle it and got so uncontrollably angry. Then I felt sad and guilty for that anger and cried for a bit. Now I’m pretty neutral, trying to figure out what’s up with me lately.

This happens in all sorts of situations. Once, my friend was hanging out with me and at some point I was overwhelming annoyed and frustrated for no reason. I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry after that and it was embarrassing walking out with semi-puffy eyes. Or another time I had a Zoom meeting and I started to feel really stressed, frustrated, angry, depressed, etc. because I hated being in that zoom and I hated the fact that I have no idea where my life is going.

These outbursts of emotion only happen for a few short minutes and then I feel fine afterwards. But it’s been starting to take a toll on  my mental health because I’ve turned to punching or scratching myself whenever I start to feel like I’m about to overreact about something.

Does anyone have any advice as to where I could seek help, what might be causing this, or if this is a normal thing? These “episodes” tend to go once a week for about a month and then I’m fine for a while. Any tips?",08Nov2020,1
895,"I was a big guy all my life. I use to weight 390 pounds. I had type two diabetes. I was on edge to taking insulin because my obesity was getting out of control. One day I decided to change my life. I wanted to look better. So I put myself on a 1500 calorie diet. I cut out soda. Junk food. I make my own healthy food. Two years later I went from 390-185 pounds.

I feel happy and more confident about myself than I ever had before. The problem is that I’m left with all this extra skin. this makes me feel ugly. I can’t afford the surgery. The skin is there. I have to wear belly shaper that holds my remaining skin in place. I do look more flattering in clothes but at the end of the day it’s there and it makes me feel ugly. 

Ever since I lost weight I’ve been getting attention (I’m gay) and a couple of people had asked me out and other things like that but the reason why I reject them because of my extra skin I have left when I was fat. I don’t believe that anyone will love me the way that I am. whenever I go on social media like Instagram and I see in the explorer photos of models and men with good bodies I start to cry and get depressed because I will never look like that. 

I do give myself credit for achieving this weight loss and getting rid of my diabetes. People tell me that diabetes is a life long desease and it’s not. getting rid of diabetes was easy. If had to do with change in my diet while taking my medication. So now I’m 185 pounds and my doctor said medicine is no longer required. I no longer take medication for my diabetes and high blood pressure. She checks my blood every 6 months to make sure things continue the way it is and it has. 

My question is, how can I have my remaining skin removed? Is there a place that will help me finance the surgery or something? what options do I have? is there a company that will work with my insurance or something?",08Nov2020,1
896,"So basically for a very long while I have been telling my mother that my dad is abusing me. I mean he kind of stopped because the older I got the better comprehension and understanding of things I gained. I learned what and what not to do to make sure I don't accidentally poss him off. I also realized what he was doing and got more assertive too. 

He still tries a beard me when I upset him but he doesn't do it as much. Now he kinda just threatens me. I know hate his guts. And other then him abusing me I have lots of other reasonably reasons to hate him. 

At this point I didn't care anymore. Even if he recently did beat me I showed a lot of apathy to it. I'm just being petty by telling my mom all this time he was abusing me. Mainly because I know back then my mom wouldn't do anything when dad was chasing me and she certainly won't now. 

But a few weeks ago she and dad got into an argument sometime around morning when I was awake. From the line ""i didn't beat her!"" I could safely assume they were talking about me but I checked in with mom and confirmed it was about dad abusing me. 

She told me that he said he didn't and said she wouldn't be doing that again since my mother had been very insistent in not getting involved in me and my father's ""quarrels"" . 

I ended up arguing ""ya but he did"" and she responded ""he said he didn't tho"" and then I responded ""but I'm saying he did"" the conversation ended up ending there. Even though I'm totally over it right now I can't help but feel angry about it. For real, if dad were to beat me up right now it'd hurt and I'd be shaken up but I probably wouldn't care. 

Thing is I don't think it'll be easy to prove since it's not like he punched me in the face of broke my leg. I don't have any bruises or scars on me. Nowadays he's better but I doubt he's changed. Everytime I think that he proved otherwise. I don't need CPS called on him I just want my mom to realize and admit he was abusing me. 

But it's not like I can record him, there's no use to it if I provoke him myself and he's much more tame now but very unpredictable. Plus that'll just make it seem like I was setting him up and invalidate things. 

It's hard to say whether she knew or not since I always went to her room when he tried to beat me and hid behind her and she just seemed annoyed. And it's not like I was happy like I was playing tag and neither was dad. But she must've gotten into that fight with dad for a reason.",08Nov2020,1
897,"
I have a 750 word count admissions essay. I wrote a lot about my life story (bad home life etc) and I felt that to put it into 750 words was already cutting it down to what I could explain. I let my friends peer review it and they said it was a good admissions essay but felt that it didn’t meet the prompt well...

Prompts: 

Why should we choose you? 


The thing is I don’t know why they should choose me. I kinda feel like I’m gas lighting myself but I feel that there’s nothing special about me. And from the way I grew up I just feel that it’s normal not to feel special and I feel a bit Uncomfortable basically “bragging” about my good points (especially if I feel that I have none). I also was never able to attend clubs or any extracurriculars cause of my home problems. I thought maybe if I described my situation the college would understand. But my friends feel that I can’t just tell them my life story but need to tell them why they should choose me. I’m stuck. I feel that there’s no specific reason why they should choose me over other candidates. I don’t know why they should choose me in general. My friends told me to write about how I persevered blah blah but how does that apply to why a fashion school should choose me?",08Nov2020,1
