0,"Hello Reddit. I’m new to this app. I guess what finally made me download it was to get some answers on something that has been bugging me lately: 

Is Life Worth It? 

I don’t expect you guys to know 100% on this topic, because humans since the beginnings of time have been trying to figure out what the meaning of life is. You guys on here seem wise, and I need some help on collecting my thoughts. 

Before I continue, I’m not depressed or suicidal. So don’t worry. This is just something I genuinely want to get to the bottom of. It’s okay to be curious and question things. If you reply by saying life is meaningless and not worth living, I won’t kill myself over it. So feel free to be honest with me. Let’s have a deep conversation. 

I’m just a soul who happens to be put here on this Earth with no context on how to live it. I’m a soul who wants to experience everything out of life. I want to meet so many people with different beliefs and backgrounds. I want to travel the world. I want to learn new things like playing the piano or be fluent in Japanese. I just want to feel like I absorbed every moment I could out of life before it’s too late. I want to get the full ride. I mean if I’m here existing, might as well right? 

This is what makes life beautiful to me. 

But is it worth it? 

I mean we are all going to die anyway. As time goes by, people would forget about us. 

I’m 18 years old. People say I’m too young to give up quick, that I have a whole life ahead of me to be worrying about the meaning behind life. But I want to know the answer now so I can put in effort or not. 

I guess I just need someone to tel me how to live. I need someone to help guide me in what to do. 

So tell me, Reddit. Is our existence worth anything?",15Oct2020,1
1,"Before I even start, just to stress I had absolutely NO idea that he was in a relationship. I actually asked him directly when we first met and he told me he was single.

All of this happened about a year ago. I met a guy at a bar and we dated briefly (like 2 months). He told me he had an ex girlfriend who lived in a different country and they had been doing long distance but it hadn't worked out- he lives in the UK, and she lives in Luxembourg and they were in a bit of a tug of war over who would move their life permanently so they could be together. 

As we were dating a few red flags came up, and after a while I told him I felt like something wasn't right (I thought he just wasn't over his ex). He denied he was talking to his ex etc etc etc and then long story short I confronted him after seeing some stuff appear on his phone that he couldn't really talk his way out of. I assumed that he was just considering getting back together with his ex so I dumped him on the spot. He rings me the next day and I confirm again that I don't want to see him any more, but I'm a bit curious to know the full story because I knew something wasn't right so I ask him to tell me what was honestly going on. He says 'fine, if it's really over I'll tell you', and admits that he **never broke up with his ex.** They've been together dating long distance for 3 years. The way he talked about it was absolutely awful, he was so nonchalant about everything, spoke of her badly and I really sincerely doubt that I am the first girl he has cheated on her with. I am not the type of person to get involved with any of this kind of stuff, so I was completely freaked out and just basically blocked him off everything and told him to leave me alone and that I never wanted to see him again. He then wrote me a letter that I never responded to. Like I said, this all happened almost a year ago but the guilt of it all has eaten me alive, and I feel like I'm being an awful person by never telling this girl and prioritising getting myself the fuck out of the situation. I think about her all the time. Anyway, the reason that I'm writing this message is because I periodically check her instagram (which is private but I can see the bio and profile picture), and I did so about 30 minutes ago and she's just recently changed her bio to indicate she might have moved to the UK and my heart just completely sank. I feel like I need to say to her please please PLEASE do not uproot your life for this man, but because it all happened a year or so ago is it worse for me to bring it up now? And now she's potentially in the UK???? I feel so fucking awful about the whole thing and I don't know what the right thing to do is.",15Oct2020,1
2,"TW/CW: Animal neglect. 

Look, guys. I'm not and never was a guinea pig person. But when I moved home and saw the conditions this poor fur baby was living in in my high school best friend's home (combined with her begging me to take him), I had to adopt the poor thing.

This friend, we'll call her Eileen, had waited until I moved back in-state after getting my degree to even tell me she had adopted a guinea pig, and at that point she had owned said piggy for 9 months. She begged me to take him, saying she didn't want him and she thought he'd be ""more fun and cuddly"" than he was. When I took a look at his living conditions, I was appalled. Eileen kept him in a cold back guest bedroom with the blinds and curtains closed, light off, and in a rarely-cleaned cage. What's worse, Eileen almost never saw the pig. Her husband would go into the back bedroom in the mornings to change into his work uniform, give the pig some food, and leave. The pig would not see another living being until the next morning, when said husband would feed him again (husband was clear that this was not his pet, but his wife's). I didn't know much about guinea pig care at the time, but it didn't look good, y'all.

I agreed to take him, and the night I came to pick him up, Eileen handed him to me with a cough and sniffles. She said he must've just recently developed the sniffles, since she hadn't noticed it before. I refrained from pointing out that she never saw the baby boi, so he could have been in this condition for more than a week or two. She told me that if I took him to the vet, she'd pay the bills.

I took him to the vet the next day, and it turned out he had a sinus infection. The veterinarian said that the infection was caused by his poor living conditions in his previous home. Cold room, depressing environment, no company, no room to play around or run, and no fresh veggies to eat = dying guinea pig. For context (I did not know this before becoming a piggy owner), guinea pigs cannot breathe through their mouths, so a sinus infection/stuffy nose means slow suffocation. I got him on the appropriate antibiotics after a $700 bill (Xrays, culture, exam, and meds). I let Eileen know the cost, but didn't confront her when she didn't help pay. I thought it would be a one-time thing.

Unfortunately, my precious piggy will never recover from this. I've gotten opinions from 4 separate veterinarians, and they all agree that piggy will have this for the rest of his short life (about 4 more years). They advised me not to get him a pig partner (for fear of spreading the infection -- this has been debated), but to spend as much time with him as possible. I built him a cabinet cage by hand that gets covered with a thick blanket every night, and he runs around every evening for 2-3 hours with fresh veggies and playtime. Recently, I did the math. I've had the pig for almost a year. Eileen's negligence of this piggy has cost me about $2500 at this point, and will cost me $1200 per year for the next 3 years. He has had no other health problems, only this very serious and chronic changing sinus infection.

Me realizing the extent of her negligence had me thinking about how she used to hit and throw things at her cat if he drank water while she was sleeping. She watches and is complicit in her husband's unwarranted and violent abuse toward their dogs. We are no longer friends.

Today, little piggy got a culture, and I didn't have the money in my bank account to pay it. It was humiliating. Just like many people during this pandemic, I've lost my jobs. I asked my parents for money to help pay for my guinea pig's vet bills. Can you even imagine? It was horrifying. So I've got this idea that I should Venmo my old friend a request for $2500, just for the vet bills up to date, to show her that her actions (or inactions/negligence) have consequences, and I'm paying for them.

Should I ask her for money to help pay for the results of her negligence? I'm sure she won't actually pay the ""bill"", but I want her to know the extent of this issue she caused.",15Oct2020,1
3,"Well well well, i'm 19 \[m\]  and still a virgin. It doesn't bother me, but, you know, it's not like i'm happy about it. Just to make it clear, i'm not an incel, i don't hate women and i'm not a goblin, i just had some pretty bad depression when i was younger. OK, enough talking about my shy dick and let's get into the question.

Some time ago i went for a vacation at my cousins. It was fun, met a lot of people, including this older girl that liked me quite a bit. She was very touchy and everything, couldn't get more obvious that she wanted to, well, fuck. The thing is i didn't like her that much, and just ignored all the VERY insistent and persistent clues.

Fast forward to a week ago and my cousin tells me he's coming to town, whith this girl and some other friends. I'm conflicted about this situation. On one hand i'm actually not really interested in her, on the other hand ""IT'S EASY PUSSYYY BRO!"", as one poet friend of mine said. 

As i said before i'm not bothered by my virginity, but i actually am, a lil bit. I know the older i'll get the stranger it will look, and i don't want it to prevent me to get a girl i'll actually care about.

What the hell should i do?",15Oct2020,1
4,"I dont know why or how this happened but a few years ago i started gaining more and more anxiety when anyone touched me. At first it wasnt really a problem my heart rate just rose but that was it. Now when people try to give me a hug I jump and physically shake. Ive never been sexually assaulted or anything to that matter, but i have dealt with self worth issues. I told my therapist this when i visited her and she brushed it off saying it was normal. But now i physically cannot be touched without having a panic attack and hyperventilating. What should i do? Is this a bad thing? Should I even worry about it?",15Oct2020,1
5,"I don't even know where to start. So for a good 6 months now, I've had some minor symptoms of depression like extreme lack of willpower and motivation. Wasn't all that bad so I hadn't thought much of it. About 2 or 3 weeks ago, though, it's been getting pretty bad. I've always been an over thinker to the point where I hurt myself, but recently my thoughts have just been absolutely destroying me because they're telling me my life is pointless. I opened up to my mom a little bit and that just seemed to make me feel so much worse, even though she was so kind about it because she understood. Then I opened up to a friend I've recently become closer with (I'll call her B) She opened up to me as well and we are going through a fairly similar situation. I've not had as much fun hanging out with friends as I used to, she hasn't either. (This is part of the reason we have become closer because we are something  new and exciting to each other). I feel like im wasting my life away, she does too. We both feel pretty lonely. After that it kind of put into perspective for me that the things I feel aren't as normal as I had originally thought. So here comes the part I need help with. I completely stopped talking to my friends (except for B) since last night. Which may not seem like a long time, but for us it is. We talk all of the time and are fairly close. I'm pushing them away and I don't want to. It's like something is telling me I  hate them, but they did nothing to me at all. I don't want to come out of this with them hating me, but I literally can't make myself talk to them and I dread having to see them in person. (B and I have been talking about this and she has done the same thing with her friends). The worst part to me is that I feel somehow lighter and happier without them. It's a nice feeling because obviously happiness is scarce for me, but it makes me so guilty and selfish that I have to stop talking to my best friends because of it. They have been kind of making me feel bad. Since I've become close with B, I feel like they look down on me for it. When I talk about her to them they seem to hate me. And they never seem to care about how I feel, which also makes me feel kind of bad. I got a text today from one of them asking me if I was okay because I haven't been texting them. I said I haven't felt like it and they just left it there. That made me feel kind of bad. Needless to say, reality is not my favorite place right now, so the only thing keeping me somewhat sane is the Harry Potter books, my dreams, and my attempts to shift to my desired reality. Now that I'm realizing how much of a mess this post is, just do with it what you will. If you took the time to read about my mess of a life and give advice, I love you. Really. Thanks for caring.",15Oct2020,1
6,"I want to just be happy...

I’m not motivated, assertive or ambitious.

I have basic plans and am going for them (career,were I want to live, retirement etc.) but I’m not “obsessed” with productivity/or having some huge lofty goal. 

I want to be at peace, I want to just enjoy my life and be happy without putting pressure on myself to succeed at something huge or in everything that I do.

I want to learn as much as I can about things that I like  and help people around me...I want to go where the wind my take me..I guess.

I don’t want to dedicate my life to impressing others or even myself..again I just want to be happy...

However from what I see around me and read etc. one should be “productive assertive and ambitious” always chasing for bigger and better things and always wanting to win. I don’t know if I’m like that and I fear I won’t make friends or fall I love because nobody will respect me or care for me because I’m not like that...at least right now.

Is there something wrong with me?",15Oct2020,1
7,"I saw this post on Reddit today where someone wanted advice about her sister who was having sex with the father of her 2 year old son right in front of him. It was horrific to read, especially as the kid had started emulating what he saw. I hope child protection services save him. I was thinking ""how could anyone be so twisted?"" and then I thought ""omg I was in the same room as my parents in a separate bed until I was around 2, same as my brother 7 years later"". Which led me to the disgusting conclusion that our parents probably *did* have you know while we were in the room because when else could they for 2 years?

All the comments said having sex in the same room as your kid is child abuse and now I'm super upset that my parents did something wrong. I'm 20 now and I have never ever had an inappropriate comment made or any weird behaviour from my parents. They are totally normal and now I'm freaking out they aren't because of this post I saw and the comments about how it's abuse to have sex even if the kid is asleep and in a different bed. I genuienly had no clue about sex until I was 10 and got ""the talk"" (I thought holding hands and feeling true love on both sides caused pregnancy guys!) so I definitely haven't been ""scarred"" . My parents are pretty prudish and yeah they'll hold hands or kiss cheeks but that's litreally it in front of me or my brother. Is it really that strange?",15Oct2020,1
8,"so basically i saw this guy over the summer; we met on tinder, went on a few dates, and started seeing each other casually over the summer. we would meet basically once a week from july-september. we go to school on opposite sides of the country, and we both know that a ldr wouldn’t work for either of us since we’d both had bad experiences with them. so we kept it simple, but we both said we’d be there for each other once the summer was over, as we had established what i thought was a really close bond. we talked almost all day, every day. obviously, we have other friends and are preoccupied with things regularly, so we weren’t glued to each other. nevertheless, we had something consistent. something genuine.  
september arrives after a blissful summer, and he goes back to school for the fall. his demeanor towards me begins to change almost instantly. he begins to talk to me less frequently—a few times every hour turns into once an hour. then once every few hours. then once a day. then, one day he texted me good morning, and after i responded, he didn’t text me anything until the evening the following day. he sees my story and i see him posting on his private snap story, so it’s not as though he isn’t 100% busy. i understand that we wouldn’t have the same closeness to each other once we were far away, but it seemed as though he became a completely different person within the span of a week, two weeks max. he said that he wanted to be friends, but he didn’t set any boundaries and expected me to understand his intentions.  
after he hadn’t texted me for two nights, i made a rash decision to take him off everything. by the end of the night, i knew that i had made a mistake. after getting drinks with friends and consulting them, against their advice, i texted him a few days later to apologize. we make amends, and things go back to normal, at least for a little while.  
while we would then text normally for a few days, something odd begins to happen again. we texted on thursday, and he said that all’s good, he’s just doing work on his mac but his roommates are having a fight and his phone’s pretty broken—half the screen isn’t working and he isn’t getting messages. i respond and then he doesn’t text me after that. fast forward to saturday, he swipes up on my snap story and i respond a few hours later, and he responds to that with a one-worded response later at night.   
that sunday, i reach out to him but i don’t get a response from him throughout the day even though he looked through my social media. i texted him pretty passive-aggressively after being left in silence for the entire day saying something along the lines of “i don’t know why you said that you wanted to be friends if you just keep pushing me away.” no response. on friday, i sent him a tiktok, and he usually responds to those. nothing. on sunday, i texted him this huge paragraph voicing my concerns and asking for communication. it just doesn’t make sense to me. yes, his phone might’ve indeed been broken, but he has a mac and on imessage it said that my messages were delivered. i don’t understand what i did that made him deliberately ignore my texts. he looked through my snap story every day that week and he posted several times on his various stories on social media, so he’s clearly not completely occupied. he doesn’t respond, so two days later i removed him on social media.  
all i ask for from someone is communication and transparency. maybe he was busy or had other things going on, but since we told each other basically everything over the summer, i thought he trusted me enough to keep me updated about his life beyond small talk; i know i would have. perhaps i could have coped with this in another way than removing him from social media, but given our past and what we used to be, i don’t understand why he would just ghost me so casually. i would’ve understood if he’d set boundaries or even responded with “i’m busy,” but clearly i was his last priority. all he did since september was send mixed messages and fuck with my mind through mind games. we’d both experienced awful people in the past, so i thought that something like this would never occur. even though we were platonic at that point and we weren’t seeing each other anymore, i thought that we would be close friends. everything seemed so right that summer, and i thought that we had a close bond. to this day, i still haven’t reached out, and nor has he. he did make a spotify playlist with songs about summer flings that end in sadness—songs from melodrama by lorde basically. but other than that, nothing. what do you guys think? did i act irrationally? was he in the wrong? thanks in advance.",15Oct2020,1
9,"So I'm going to try to make this comprehensive.

There's a girl, whom I've been close friends with for about 5 years now.
A couple of months ago since Corona time we started to hang out a lot more and I started catching feelings.
In this time she was with this guy who she was crazy about 
At one point I went to her house and she told me that she had feelings for me (sometimes) and I told her that I have feelings for her as well. We kind of had the agreement to hold off our 'potential relationship' until we (she) were ready.
Keep in mind that all the times that we were hanging out with friend we were really close, as in holding hands hugging constantly etc.
At one point we were drunk at a party at our place and she was extremely flirty that night. I spoke to her and told her that it wasn't fair what she was doing (the whole clinginess) while she is with that other guy. I told her I would take a step back and see her less often (she really didn't like that).
I failed. I was still clingy with her when I saw her with friends (albeit less than before). 

A few months passed, and she is acting as if nothing happened, talking about other guys she's dating etc.

I still see her once every 2 weeks or something, but keep being dormant for some reason. All the while still hurting about this until a certain extent.

Today I was at her house with some friends and she invited this guy over. (A friend of hers).

She was being a bit touchy feely with me but I stayed dormant.

There was another girl who seemed interested, but I basically ignored her.

After a while I saw her dancing with the friend she invited really infinitely and I still did nothing. 
Some more time passed and she slipped into a room with him.

I felt really shit at that moment.

So I was standing in the balcony with the girl who I mentioned before who seemed interested, but the spark was gone.

Now I feel really shit about myself and I don't know what to do.

I keep being dormant in these situations, not wanting other girls, but at this point not even wanting her. On the point of being depressed. I don't know what to do, I don't know how I can conquer this. 

All I want is my sanity and my (honour) back so to speak.

11,"Hey guys, 

My two friends were planning a road trip and invited me. I originally said maybe since I wasn’t sure if I could get work off. Turns out I could get work off so I agreed. This road trip was going to be from california to Texas, so I thought it was going to be a straight shot. Once I see the itinerary I was in shock. They planned on driving to Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas in about a week. This sounds insane to me but they assured me we could go with the flow and change our route if need be.  

Problem is, we booked all hotels so we can’t really “go with the flow.” We’re on a schedule and it’s pretty tight. Only spending virtually one night in each state leaves so little time for sightseeing. I feel like a majority of the trip is gonna be spent in the car, and that gets old real quick.

Another thing is, when i was talking to my parents about it, they warned against us going through Wyoming and Montana, as it’s winter in these places. I think my friends being from Cali don’t realize the cold winters they get up north. I’d hate to get stuck by road closures or have to sleep in the car. 

When I brought this up to them last night, my one friend who is pretty anal about planning shot down my concerns, saying we would just go with the flow. Not sure why she’s so adamant about going to Wyoming but I can ask. 

At this point, makes me want to pull out of the trip, cause when I voice my concerns, I’m not being heard. 

Advice please?",15Oct2020,1

13,"I used to be so incredible! I got on honor roll in high school and lost weight. Due to being on meds I became extremely lazy! I'd lay in bed all day(still do), stare at my phone screen for hours (also still do) and ask questions for every single problem I had on the internet (Lol I'm doing that right now!!! Huge facepalm!).

I used to use my brain, but as soon as I graduated from school, I had no drive because of that med. Now I've been off of it for a few weeks, but I still struggle with these bad habits. The screen time is making my eyes drier and drier and I need to break this addiction somehow.

I constantly look up self help videos, but they never work because I am so lazy! Mentally and physically!

14,"I'm a 24 yo male and I went to the gym with a couple buddies. The entire time I was benching (10 minutes or so) there was this guy that was creepily staring at me (looked in his 40s).

He left a couple minutes later. I told my friends about it and they said I was being paranoid ( I wasn't) and if that ever happens just say ""can I help you?"" I don't think that is keen advice because that seems too confrontational for me at a 24hr gym late at night despite the fact my friends were with me ( they were on different machines in the gym away from where it happened) my question to you guys is what happens if I see this guy doing this again?

17,"Even tho my original post had little to no attention I've decided to update anyway, because as a long time redditor I sometimes get hooked up to a story with very little attention and I always hate when they left me with a cliffhanger, so here it goes:  


So, I've decided to talk with Aria and tell her everything about what was happening with Tanya, but in a funny turn of events she was the one who contacted me first and she wanted me to meet her to have a serious talk.  
Turns out that Tanya was talking with her about me saying things like ""He hides a lot of things"" ""Are you sure you wanna be official with him? I'm just worried about you because I know OP for about XX years"" basically she was trying to make me look like some kind of cheater or something...

Aria wanted me to tell her the whole truth so I finally did, I told her about my fetish, how Tanya was extorting me with telling everyone about it, I showed her the messages and I also reassured her that I wasn't any cheater or abuser and I can call my ex if she wanted (I'm not friends with my ex but we have a pretty cordial relationship). I was shacking the whole time while I was telling her all this and in the verge of crying, Aria just kissed me and hugged me and basically she apologized, told me that she doesn't care about my kinks and that she even might give it a try and overral she was relieved that I wasn't hiding something bad.  
So, that was the good part, but not everything was good.  


THE BAD PART:  
After that we talked a bit more and she started to get angry with Tanya and started texting her, I of course was watching the entire conversation and basically the short version is that Aria at first was asking Tanya why she was doing all of this, but Tanya just kept deflecting and saying that ""you understood it that way"", Aria was fucking livid and started to call her a recentful bitch and all sorts of names.  
At that point I just hugged her and told her to leave her, that she wasn't worth it and all that matters is that we sorted things out.

This is when the bad part starts. A few hours after my phone was overflowned with texts bullying and threatening me, Aria's phone was also being bombed with messages to a thread that Tanya made and people was telling her to leave me.  
Turns out Tanya posted on twitter some of my messages talking about my fetish and one fake message of me trying to convince her to do dirty stuffs with her hair while she called me a weirdo and a stalker.  
Aria and I went to the thread and we spend a lot of time arguing with people, and posting screenshots of Tanya extorting me and at one point a lot of people started to insult Tanya.  
The thread was such a shit show that Tanya ended up deleting the post.

THE AFTERMATH:

I ended up losing friends (1 of them was a close friend), Aria too, my family ended up knowing about my kink (my cousins were there) and our personal circle now is awkard as fuck.  
But I ended up with the most beautiful and tough woman I ever met in my entire life, and if I had to go through this shit show again to get this result, I'll do it a million times again without hesitation.

Moral of the story, don't you EVER TELL ANYONE your secrets unless you have more than a decade of trust with one person.  
This was definitely the most embarrasing moment of my life, but it got me the best GIRLFRIEND I could ever ask for (yeah, we thought since we basically fought our entire circle of friends, we might make it official right now XD).",15Oct2020,1
18,"well I originally tried to post this on another sub Reddit forum. But apparently I didn’t qualify so I’m coming here…

I was seeking drugs earlier and this guy I know offered to help me out and he said it would be for free. I went against my own gut instinct and went over there to get smoked up.

it’s really hard for me to tell the story because I’m not wanting to type it so I’m doing speak to text. And I already told his story and I got denied so... 

but long story short I was sexually assaulted I think? He did things to me when I told him no repeatedly and made up excuses for why I didn’t want to do anything with him. But he ignored the rejection and told me he knew this is what I wanted and he wasn’t going to listen Because he knows that I like to be dominated. I made up every excuse in the book for why I didn’t want him. but apparently he didn’t understand the meaning of now. 

So the whole time he was doing those things to me I basically wasn’t in my body. I put my mind elsewhere and was thinking this is going to be over soon and I’ll be out of here and I’ll never talk to him again. I finally got out of there after being there for 2 1/2 hours. But I Still feel like I’m Depersonalizing. 

I drove to the gas station afterwards and got alcohol because I wanted to get fucked up and not feel anything even more. And then I could smell his nasty sent all over me and I threw up. 

But I’ve never felt out of body this much. It’s kind of scary actually and I don’t know what to do with myself. 

I’m sad about what happened but I also think it’s my fault because I put myself in that situation and I Could’ve tried a lot harder to say no but I didn’t.

19,"So I'm on Reddit because I cannot ask for the advice of people I actually know because they are involved. I agreed pre pandemic to help with a family members wedding. You would assume or I did it would be canceled due to the world collapsing but no.  I am currently having a mini meltdown about going and do not know if I should cancel. I would cancel no problem if I hadn't promised my services. First, I didn't invite my husband because I thought he was going to have to watch the kids since it's out of state. Now come to find out grandparents would watch them so now I look like an asshole. Second, my family is full of shitards. Like I would walk right past these people if I wasn't related to them. Normally I would take it all in stride and laugh to get through it but this pandemic has fucked.me.up .....I have no more filters and cannot handle the slightest bit of bullshit. Can't and won't. So the idea of driving 6 fucking hours to a wedding full of Limp Bizkit fans spouting conspiracy theories is my idea of hell all while defending my use of a fucking mask to a Kid Rock look alike. If I cancel they will ""never"" forgive and I always try to do what I promise to anyone. The last little piece of fuckery is that they are already married repeat already married legally this is just for show. What do I do?",15Oct2020,1
20,"I'm going through a bad breakup with someone I really wanted to keep in my life. Lasted 4 years and now I'm stuck in the house with a bunch of memories. Long story short, I never purposely tried to hurt her but I've been so depressed that I'm just not myself anymore in any way shape or form and I made her not love me anymore. If I dont fix this, i wont be able to keep anyone in my life. I have no close or real friends and I really dislike my family. So I dont have anyone that can be there for me whenever I'd need it. 

I hate literally everything about my life. My house, my room, my situation, how I feel about myself, my job, how I need more money, i hate that i dont have friends, i hate that no one wants to be around me, i hate that I'm just not who i want to be or where i want to be. I'm 23 and I've thought of a few options as where to start as far as career goes, but that's only one thing. If I start making a lot of money and have no one in my life to share who I am with it will make no difference. The biggest problem I have with meeting people in person or online is that I'm extremely closed off to strangers. I think that I make it seem like they're annoying or that I'm not interested in talking. When I get comfortable with people I'm relatively normal and that goes away. It's just starting out is hard.

The breakup is rough. I've gone through a bad one before but this is worse. I've lost over 5lbs in less than a week (my weight is very hard to change), I basically have slept an hour or less every night. Every day, when I'm at my lowest, I genuinely dont know how I can get through another day of this. The pain is so immense that idk what to do. 

So in this situation do any of you think seeing a therapist or psychologist would be of any help? I'm just scared of getting sent to a mental hospital.",15Oct2020,1

22,"I (17F) have always had a dream of becoming an actress, ever since I was little and watching disney movies, I knew that that’s what I wanted to do. I know the likelihood of me being as successful as someone like scarjo or jennifer lawrence, but I still want to try. And, to be honest, I’m pretty good at acting.

I have a little bit of rhotacism (or at least that’s what my therapist has told me), which means I basically have a lot of trouble pronouncing “r”. Words like “reason”, “really”, “agree”, “break”, etc are near impossible for me to say. Those are only 4 words for examples, but I made a list of over 100 words that sound weird when I say them. I took speech therapy for a little bit last year, but that therapist moved away so I haven’t been to one since. They told me that I probably have this problem because I was never properly taught as a kid.

This is the #1 thing that’s standing in my way, and the biggest cause for my anxiety. I hate talking, I hate talking to strangers, ordering food at restaurants, I even get insecure talking to my own family. I also take singing lessons, and even though my singing teacher says that I do remarkably well, I’m too self conscious of my voice to ever perform in front of anyone but her.

I don’t really know what to do or how to solve this. Being an actress is hard enough when you’re good, it’ll be downright impossible with a limitation like this. I hate hearing myself talk in recordings, I don’t anyone  would pay to hear me.

My biggest fear is that I’ll have to give up and just get a normal 9-5 job. My entire life I’ve been preparing and had my heart set on doing something in the arts. I’m not the kind of person to work in an office or something doing the same boring thing everyday (no offence to those who do do that, it’s just not for me).

I don’t know how to fix this. My family isn’t helping much by teasing me for it. Does anyone, maybe even someone who’s been through something similar to this, have any advice??",15Oct2020,1

25,"I'm no Mother Theresa, but I enjoy doing small nice things for neighbors, family and friends when I can afford the time and / or costs. I've done things like make goodie baskets at holidays, hosted tie dye days or movie nights in the backyard. I've watched/ babysat a few kids during parents' ""emergency situations"". 

I don't expect anything in return for those things, but I keep getting met with adults who take that as an invitation to ask for more. I keep finding myself in situations where I have to be ""mean"" to people who just keep on pushing me further and further past my comfort zone, stop doing little nice things that I enjoy or cut people out of my life entirely. At first, I thought I was just dealing with a few jerks, but I've felt like I was being walked on by a few new friends and half of my neighbors in the last year. Either what I'm putting out there is way off, or I'm being over sensitive. How do I find balance in making nice with the neighbors or doing nice things for friends without them trying to turn me into their doormat? 

FWIW - I've become more sensitive to this recently because I'm seeing the doormat treatment rub off on my 6 year old.

26,"I'm 22 and my mom (not biological) told me to leave the house by the end of this year. Our relationship has always been rocky, she raised me from when I was 10 and when I was 19 she and my father divorced. I had a pretty rough early childhood so she decided to let me stay with her because at that point I was already her daughter. Post divorce with my father was also really hard on us.

When I turned 20 and got a new part-time job (minimum wage but I worked alot of hours) she started to charge me rent, I did not fight her and have been paying her 800 dollars a month for almost two years. These past couple of months due to the pandemic the malls were all closed in Ontario and I was only getting money from CERB (Canadian Emergency Response Benefit). However because of the pandemic my moms income was also cut down to 40%, during this time she asked me to give her pretty much extra money throughout all the payments I was getting from the government. This was excluding the monthly rent I was still giving her with the money I had saved up from working these past 3 years.

So in total I've given her about $6700 in the span of 4 months. This doesn't include the money given to help with food and household items (and the last two months of rent for Sept and Oct = $1600), I've done all the chores in the house since I was in High School and have taken on more household responsibilities since the divorce because we became a two person family. 

During this time I've put my student loans on hold and have pushed them back as far as I could, I will have to start paying this month. 

I understand from alot of perspectives that she had no obligation to take care of me once she got the divorce and I've always been thankful that she's gone above and beyond for me. She's the only parent I have in my life but she does not see the amount of care and love I put into our family and what I do to make sure she's happy and supported (hence why I never fought on giving her more money because she's the sole income for our household) 

But we had a fight (shouting match and all) and she's concluded that I've been too comfortable and I dont respect her. Saying it's time for me to leave. It was a very painful fight and the fact that she is just telling me to leave after giving me no possible way to save up before moving out is what I find the most jarring. After taking pretty much every penny I own she's telling me to leave. I'm trying to make a plan right now but it's just frustrating that this is the conclusion she's drawn from our daughter mother relationship after over 10 years. 

We by no means are the best example of a Child - Parent relationship but the fact that she doesn't see the love I have for her hurts the most, actions speak louder than words and I won't say I'm a perfect person but I would like to think I've done enough for her not to treat me like this. No one is entitled to anything but I thought she would at least understand me for once, but I guess she doesn't 

What tips do you guys have on what I should do? I don't think she's going to change her mind this time so I need some help on how I should proceed with finding shelter and such.

Thanks.",15Oct2020,1
27,"I can't even play video games anymore. I'm so damn tired. I just want to sleep, but I'm going to fail this year if I do. I don't have any free time anymore. With school, and stuff I gotta do after school, I get home around 8PM. And then homework, which I admittedly don't do. I can't focus. I can't even read anymore. I just forget everything I read, and have to reread over and over. I'm not learning anything. The only class I can retain information from is geometry, which I'm fucking horrible at. Fuck it's such a step down from algebra. I was passing algebra with a grade over 100, and now I'm stuck at a 76. I keep getting C's on tests. The one subject I'm good at, and I'm not even good at it anymore. I fucking hate everything about my life. What am I gonna do when I'm older? Get a job? Work until I fucking die? No. That's stupid. I'm not going to enjoy everything. My whole day is forced on me. I have no choice when it comes to anything at all. I hate this fucking world and how we're expected to live our lives. I'm stupid, so I'm absolutely doomed now. That's unfair as hell. I can't help that, but now I'm failing half of my classes and have a GPA that will qualify me to redo elementary school. Goddammit I hate this. I could just go on and on. I hate where I live, I hate my school, I hate my family, I hate my personality, I hate the way I look, I hate my neighborhood, I hate my school. 0/10 experience. Nobody listens to me, either. I just want a break for fucks sake. Just let me stay home from school for ONE DAY. One fucking day. But nooo, that'll make my grades bad. Bitch they're already bad. You can't get lower than an F. My only hope is midterms, honestly. Maybe I'll pass with a D. The only reason why I haven't failed the past few years of school is tests, which are beyond easy. Just memorize information. That's another thing that I hate. I'm not *learning*. I'm just memorizing. I don't actually understand why this does this, or why if you put this with this, you get that. That's why I was good at algebra, cause it was all formulas that explained themselves. But with geometry, it's all classifying and naming things. Basically English, which is my worst subject. Critical thinking is fine, I guess. Easy. Gotta read, which is hard, but I can bullshit my way through assignments. Biology is hell. I can't memorize any of the words. What the hell is a fucking organelle? Cell organ? Why does that matter. Like why do I need to know that. Creative writing is fucking ms,#,$&amp;÷*÷,. Too hard. I can't write. Well, I can write, but I can't write when I have to. I just wanna stay home and teach myself. I did that for last year, 8th grade, and guess what? I passed with all A's. I know how I learn best, but nobody seems to get that. I'm not doing this anymore. Fuck this. This is stupid. Name one reason why I should continue all of this? I'm fine with doing absolutely nothing. I'm not even planning on killing myself or anything yet, I just want to do absolutely nothing. I just want to be able to think to myself. This is all pointless and it won't matter in a few years when I inevitably end up not getting a job and dying homeless. My brain is small. It's smooth. It can't focus on anything.

30,"Sorry if the title is weird, but I wanted some advice if I should take any actions or if there is someone I should contact. I’ll try to keep the story short. 

So, I work at a small family-owner pet store. We sell mainly dog and cat supplies, but also bird, farm, and wild life products. Anyway, one of our newer items we started carrying are these treats which are advertised as human-grade as no animal meat is present in them and only a handful of ingredients. They’ve been a big seller and I’ve personally tried one not long after they came in. The reason I point this out is because we’ve have customers in the past come in and split them between their pet and themselves or their kids. 

Recently, we had a major moth issue in the store due to soaring temperatures drawing them inside. Unfortunately, the case we keep the donuts in has large gaps that the moths could easily get into and we later discovered that they had laid eggs IN the treats, most of which had already hatched into larvae. When we discovered this, it was rather late in the evening and the store manager had already gone for the day. Perhaps it was my own mistake for thinking this, but I decided to try and throw these treats away as no one would want to give their pet or possibly their kid a bug-infested treat. I say TRY because after I had done so and informed my manager WITH photos of the infestation, the store owner found out and ordered we pull them out of the trash and put them back.

This happened about two weeks ago, and only just today did my manager inform me that the owner had her write me up for the incident. Those treats are STILL in the case and for sale, and you can clearly see the eggs when you split the donut. 

I’m wondering if I need to report this to someone if it’s a health issue, as I’m unsure due to them being dog treats and not necessarily advertised as something humans can or cannot eat. I’m also concerned for my job as the owner has been going after me lately, nitpicking every tiny thing in an effort to try and rile me up and make me quit. It just seems strange so much time passed before they made an issue about the incident. Any advice?",15Oct2020,1

37,"Before I start, my family isn’t normally like this... 

So to begin, my brother (30 y/o) is still living at home and he’s been rude to/bullying my girlfriend (19 y/o). He’s been parking one inch away from her car for no reason, kicking her shoes across the living room when she’s at my house, and slamming stuff around the house when he doesn’t get his way. It makes me extremely angry to the point where I (20 y/o) have not been living at home like I use to, so of course, I left to live at my girlfriend house and haven’t been back permanently since. It’s been like a few weeks btw.

So I told my mom and she “tried talking to him” but of course, it didn’t work because he ignored her and does the same stuff. I keep telling her “you know you can’t let your own son treat house guest like that. Especially when she’s like 11 years younger” and want him out of the house if he acts like this. The best answer she could give is “if you don’t like it, you can leave”.

Blah blah blah... I leave for a bit and haven’t brought it up since. 

Today, I got extremely upset whenever I’m around him and finally snapped at the fact my family doesn’t care enough to handle the situation with me. I started slamming stuff around my room because it’s my property and this action never leaves my room.

Then I got into an argument with my mom and pretty much said:

“You let your old ass son treat house guest like shit and you have no problem with it. I get angry once and all of a sudden I’m the bad guy. I keep to myself in the household and don’t say sh** other than to say hi. I walk by you everyday and you don’t even realize I’ve been trying to hang myself. You don’t care about me and I’ve unhappy with my life” 

Then she told me “good. Hang yourself” and the obvious “everyone’s got problem” bit. 

What do I do? Where do I go from here? What do I say to my own mom who told me to hang myself?

I can’t move out because I’m in the Bay Area and I can’t exactly move out due to the rent price and my girlfriends family isn’t doing too good either. This is all I can write right now because my mind is still foggy from the argument.

38,"Hello..

I met through my aunt on one of my yearly trips back in 2016 to Havana at the time he was a student and I was into my 7th year of my career. Everything was well prior to getting married. It seemed as if suddenly everything went downhill after that and some of his true colors started to show.

In Cuba, as I'm sure most people know is the economy there is absolutely horrendous. However, for me, it didn't make a difference as I come from humble beginnings as well. It took me a while to get to where I am today making $85,000. Shortly after the wedding, my husband was asking of all kinds of things, a new iPhone 7 (refurbished), an iPad, a HP 17"" laptop, and as of December of last year, I paid outright for a new iPhone 11 Pro Max and a new Apple iWatch which between at least 3 trips a year, new clothes &amp; shoes for him, AirBNB rentals, and new technology, amongst other things, I've spent close to maybe $10k.

The latest iPhone 11 and the watch was the last straw. I still have my iPhone 7 and refuse to get a new phone until this one clocks out. He literally called me and called me and video chatted with me and made sure I left my job and got to 'pick' out his new gold phone. For me, it felt like he just wanted to show off to everyone around him and he knew that I have other bills here like my student loans, my mortgage, etc. that I'm trying to manage.

I've told him over the countless emails and video chats that I'm not his caretaker or his one-way ticket. I literally go to work, and come home outside of that I visit my cousins (who are like my siblings) and my sister who lives about 10 min. from me roughly every two weeks. He would constantly tell me knowing I was in the middle of an event that I needed to go home in order to talk to him for 3 hours. He doesn't work, he sits at home all day and goes to the gym.

I found out a year into our marriage that he lied as if he was in fact going to school and he kept that lie up for over a year and here I was thinking he was getting a notch under his belt as far as being able to transfer some sort of 'credits' here. It's as if he stopped going to school because he was on his way to the 'land of opportunity'. The phone system there is different so every two weeks I would reload his account with about $75 and typically that would last for two weeks but there were plenty of times where it lasted only 3 days and I would ask him what happened to the latest recharge and it typically wasn't a straight answer. 

I always told him well in advance if I was going to for instance a birthday party for my one-year-old niece (god-daughter), hiking with my sister, getting my hair done and it was always an argument and I would end up leaving every event due to him having a temper tantrum. There was one time he called non-stop and I had to place my phone on airplane mode at my cousin's wife's baby shower that I was hosting, of which he knew about this well in advance. When I told him he was being unreasonable he would blame it on the fact that ""I love you"". When I would mention to him that ""I'm not his mother and that he needs to get some sort of job"" there was always a reason as to why he couldn't. If he wanted to get a new tattoo or get his hair dyed I'd have to foot the bill and send anywhere between $50 to $200 when he wanted me to.

Outside of that, he's said terrible things about my father and a few other family members... unforgivable things that I just can't seem to shake and it made me question myself ""who did I marry?""

Originally the visa interview was scheduled for April 1 (prior to knowing when COVID was rampant) and the USCIS shut down for two weeks so we have yet to have the interview. The goal was for him to come here and get a decent job while he went to school.

However, back in February, I had a moment where I was fed-up with bending over backward, leaving events earlier than I wanted to, spending my hard-earned money, and it wasn't appreciated at the very least, I never got a thank you out of anything I've ever given it was almost like I was supposed to do so.

I recently told him I needed some space and some time to think. He keeps messaging my siblings, calling my work friends, and sending me emails asking me to talk to him. He told me he's given me enough time to think about my decision and as of Sept. 28, I asked him for a divorce of which he doesn't agree with. He feels that love outweighs everything but for me, there's a lot more to it.. respect, trust, financial stability, etc. 

I've heard that his brother plans to leave his fiance once he reaches soil (not sure if that is still valid) but I am also worried that he may try to do the same to me. Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated.

In the morning, I went to check the money in the handbag because I wanted to give some to my aunt whose I have been staying with when I went back there. She has a kid and husband who is my uncle. Now, I never brought the handbag into the house other and just left it in the car other than the time when I went to the market to buy groceries. The other time, it just stayed in the car. To my surprise an envelope of money went missing and what left was small value of money (like 1usd or 5usd, but in my case it is in my countrys currency which is Malaysia so its in myr) All big notes went missing. If it was only the envelope then perhaps I would say that it was my mistake for being careless and dropped it somewhere else but even the envelope itself was inside another pocket in the handbag. For the other notes, if they were dropped then I would have realised since there wasn't one of them but a lot more. So it was strange as to how all of them went missing. 

I then tried to remember what I was doing and the day before I actually went out with her kid in the evening to buy some chicken. When we arrived at the market I left her inside the car since she didn't want to go with me. My handbag was at the back seat but it was still approachable. I paid it no attention. It never crossed my mind that she would do such a thing because I trusted her and believed that shes a good kid. When we returned back, I never checked my handbag and just let it be. Luckily for me that I had some money hidden away from emergency's. It was however, barely enough for my gas and toll. It got me thinking and I was really disappointed with her. The kid is only 12 y/o and the money missing was close to 400myr. That is a big amount of money for me since I am just selling ice cream and snacks at home. I have been thinking all night and this morning I was thinking about calling her mother and tell her about it. She wouldn't believe me but I'm thinking of saying that ""it's possibly"" instead of straight away accusing her. But then again it might be a bad idea since it might affect our relationships. So... Here am I... Should I or should I not?

TL;DR: Kid stole money almost 400myr and thinking of calling her mother to tell her about it. She might not believe me which is a 50/50 and it will affect our relationships. So, should I call her or should I just keep quiet about it?",15Oct2020,1

And it made me mad because she would want me to pick her up at Night to literally  do nothing so the fact that she asked that to me just made me mad . So I just muted her on my phone  ( started playing her game )  but I’m a grown enough dude so I unmuted and just decided I’m going to move forward then once agin she came back I told myself she’s toxic don’t do it but I keep finding myself doing it agin and agin 


She seen me last week and apologized to me about the things she said and i apologized to and then she said could she tell me something and I said yes ( assuming it was going to be her liking me more then she expected) but no she said she wanted to kill herself and she has been this way for ever and me myself having delt with mild depression took this seriously and I feel like I feel into a trap I was pretty much her crying shoulder I tried lifting her up and telling her she’s worth it and she’s beautiful and all that good stuff and I meant it I don’t know why but I think I’ve been overly nice to her and she doesn’t like it because I’ve in my mind have “ kissed her ass “ for the past 2 weeks to keep her happy because she said she wanted to kill herself and all my friends as saying she’s playing “ sad girl game “ don’t let her fool you but at the same time I like her and it’s hard to get her out of my head .  So anyway she only talks to me once a day and then now it’s no times a day and she post on her social media’s and she doesn’t even text me I’m just really mad because of the time and the effort and the money I put into her to keep her happy and satisfied but I ended up blocking her on everything and I’m telling myself and promising myself I will not unblock her till I’m over her .

49,"Hi guys, need some advice, or to vent idk. 

So for context, I have always drank too much but never enough that its been a health worry. Back about 3 or 4 years ago I drank and smoked a lot more than I do now and ended up quitting smoking about a year and a half ago with the help of my amazingly supportive girlfriend. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. Due to lockdown I  have put on a lot of weight due to being stuck at home, drinking more and our eating habits slipping from a lack of motivation. I ended up with gastritis due to all of the above combined with a small relapse where I had a cigarette on two weekend occasions with friends before lockdown measures tightened again. 

Since then I hadn't smoked or eaten as much unhealthy food, but my drinking has increased a bit and I feel like I have hit another depressive episode. Tonight I had a huge panic attack at like 1am after finishing a few beers while my gf was asleep. I decided there and then that I need to stop drinking but I needed something to cling onto. I went out for a walk and ended up buying a pouch of tobacco and some skins, before rolling and smoking one. 

I feel awful and I am terrified of my girlfriend losing respect for me as my only motivation for quitting last time was that I wanted my word to matter to her. I am now clearly trying to bargain with myself and justify that if i quit drinking and stay off the junk food, but have a smoke every now and then, that this would somehow be better than if I kept up my previous habits. 

Am I just trying to weasel out of having self control or does this actually seem like something that might be a way out? 

Sorry for the long post. TL;DR is switching excessive drinking for light smoking the better of two evils?",15Oct2020,1

62,"Hi all, 

I feel crushed. I took photos when I was younger, and those photos got leaked about 4 years ago. The site it was on got taken down, and everyone forgot about the photos and the fiasco. 

TODAY, i get a message from a random ig account that told me that someone has my photos, and sent them to me. She additionally said that the person has her nude photos as well, and will send them to her 13 year old son if she doesn't obey his orders. She provided me with his KIK Name, and told me to contact him. I reached out and the person is demanding additional racy photos and in exchange he'll stop sharing my photos to everyone. (I believe that this is a fake profile, it only has 3 posts, 4 followers, and 600+ that theyre following)  \*\* THE PHOTOS HE HAS ARE ALL 10 YEARS OLD\*\*

I told him that i would not be sending anything to him, but he said ""let the games begin!"" and proceeded to send the photos to my cousins,  friends... acquaintances. 

How do i make this stop? I cant eat, i cant rest... my mind's in shambles. 

I've gone to the police but they cant do anything without this person's actual name, and I've contacted the FBI but it's iffy that they'll even look at my case. 

I'm at a loss. I feel helpless because of something i did at 17 that was stupid &amp; naive.

This morning I (40f) woke up to my boyfriend (36m) ejaculating on my face which I was slightly irritated by.  It’s come up in conversation before and I said it probably wouldn’t bother me. Anyway I had over slept and I guess he had tried to wake me up unsuccessfully in some other way and ended up deciding to try again by to taking that route. Eww but whatever...

I didn’t think it was worth an argument so I ended up just getting up and taking a shower even though I was slightly annoyed. When I was in the shower I had soap on my face so my eyes were closed and shampoo in my hair and my back was to the bathroom door so I couldn’t see him enter the bathroom. He reached over the shower and dumped a large pitcher (3.5 liters) of cold water that had come from the a/c condenser all over me.  He was laughing hysterically and I was very upset at this point. I yelled at him and asked him to leave.

He refuses to apologize because it is a “funny prank” and I’m being “sensitive.” I’m really bothered by this and feel like he is being malicious and now that I called him out on being a jerk (I said mean spirited) he seems to be trying on purpose to push my buttons. He thinks it’s funny, I don’t think it is at all, I was literally in tears over the cold water. I felt really violated at one of my most vulnerable times.

We’ve been dating for 5 months and he has pretty much tried to move in and take over my apartment in the past few weeks like hiding things like remote controls from me, rearranging my cabinets and belongings, going through personal items and asking me questions about them, moving my furniture around with out permissions, etc. anytime I say something he gets really nasty and somehow turns the conversation around in a way to blame me for what ever he moved, his, etc.

* In a stretch of land governed by indigenous (*Native American, Indigena*), several people own and farm their respective section, but the decision making process and hierarchy is communal and worked over in local councils; it's what is known in Mexico as ""*Ejidos, Tierra ejidal*"". Newcomers are not integrated into the environment, it'd be a tough process. Plus there's religious sectarianism, it's more apparent on the older generation, very Catholic.  
* **Background** \- I have this guy who is a newcomer and works the land formerly owned by his grandparents. People make about $5 to $10 dollars a day, 5 working days, not year round, crop price varies depending wholesale market. Minimal services, in some points communal bathrooms and washrooms. 
* **Problem** \- Actors: grandparent, son, nephew. The grandparent migrated, had children, and then died of old age. His son tries to re-build the farm and hires his nephew. The nephew is better paid than the average, given access to a vehicle and allowed residence in the place, a higher wage secure year round (*Still not great for the average nation wide, remarkable locally though*). The scorn against the nephew comes from people that could take his job. The nephew has chosen to remain civil since over time it can degenerate and accrue against him in community council given their confirmation bias against him, which could lead to less water rights for the crops. Moreover, while the grandparent was a great part of the community his wife and therefore the children were not since they were evangelists, they recount stories where they had continuously been called heathens. 

So what to do? How to counsel, what to advice? Personal sovereignty is necessary but we're talking of a conclave, more or less, who are in for the long haul. Forgot to mention, the nephew has a middle school achievement, this is a job as good as he can get, 3 children, wife.",15Oct2020,1

87,"I live in student housing while I’m attending university and chose to have random roommates (they are matched based off the questionnaire the leasing office provides). I’ve been living with 3 other girls in a 4 bedroom apartment (4 bed/ 4 bath) for the past 3 months. 

So far it’s been okay. I’m really good friends with one of my roommates but the other two tend to be somewhat uptight and extend their expectations of the apartment onto others. I haven’t been the biggest fan of them, but I have always stuck my kindness foot forward in effort to make things work. 

Today I was in my private bed room and overheard (they were speaking loudly and the walls are thin) those two discussing that both of them have resigned their lease to spend 2021/2022 in this apartment. My other roommate has re signed as well- I’m the only one that has not yet, there is still plenty of time to decide though. One girl said “did you see x resigned the lease, she’s hardly here.” And the other said “yeah but I just really don’t want (my name) to resign”.

I understand not everybody is best of friends but I have been kind since the start and was heavily considering re signing. This incident tells me this isn’t the first time they have talked about my back and it makes me feel really hurt. What should I do, if anything? Should I bother trying to talk to them? Should I not resign?",15Oct2020,1

90,"So I currently go to liberty university, (it's a long story how I ended up here) I'm studying engineering, and I think it may be better for my education to transfer out to a respected engineering school, since a lot of employers don't acknowledge liberty degrees as legitimate. I also might find it more suited to me because, unlike when I started here, I consider myself an agnostic.
however, the problem is that i'm already so deeply rooted here. I have an apartment off campus, and am part of a team. Most importantly, friends are very, very hard for me to come by and I'm lucky I have one or two. However, if I transfer out I will be living alone and have to start all over again with my social life. It's going to be a LOT of work both literally, mentally, and emotionally just transferring out.

93,"My father has been a drug addict my (29F) entire life. The majority of this has been meth and pills, but he is not very picky. When I was in high school in Washington state he got very sick and never stopped “partying,” to the point where he had several strokes. I was 16 and at home with him when this happened, I drove him to the hospital and on the way his heart stopped, when we arrived at the hospital they resuscitated him. He ended up making a full recovery, but this was the start of the next 13 years of strokes and heart failure and a plethora of other health issues and continued drug use. 

After this initial incident my dad and I moved in with my grandmother in Oregon and she began to take care of my dad and completely enabled him to continue his drug use. I moved out as soon as I graduated high school, moved to the city and got my BS, met my husband and moved out to New England to be closer to his family where we have been for almost 5 years.

During the last 13 years my dads health has deteriorated to the point where he has lost the use of his left foot -it’s in a support brace- and uses a walker to walk, he has minimal use of his left hand, he has diabetes, he is just cognitively not “all there”, plus whatever health issues I don’t know about as I have completely stayed out of it. He collects social security and disability and government medical insurance where he goes to physical therapy and doctor appointments multiple times a week. My 90 year old grandmother gives him his pills throughout the day, makes him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, helps bath him, and takes him to all appointments. All while he still invites drug addicts to her house where they do drugs in his bedroom and steal whatever they can.

It turns out my grandmother has been battling severe medical issues herself this year and I was completely unaware until today when she went into the emergency room, where things do not look good. I spoke to my aunt, my fathers sister, who loves my grandmother and is very close with her, but understandably hates my father, and she told me what was going on with my grandmother. She told me today that in July my grandmother signed over power of attorney to her and she wrote a will. My aunt told me she will plan to sell the house right away to pay off any medical/other debt if my grandmother does not make it out of the hospital.

This leaves my physically disabled, completely care dependent, drug addict father with no where to go. 

What am I supposed to do here? I honestly do not care for him at all, the only reason I have been in contact with him at all the last 10 years is because I love my grandmother and had a good relationship with her.

I am 7 months pregnant right now and my brain can’t comprehend what I am supposed to do with him. I do have a younger sister, both parents the same, but she stayed with my mother when I went to live with my dad, she hasn’t lived with him since she was ~11. She also lives on the east coast with her husband and has zero ideas on what we will do with him if my grandmother passes. Living with either of us is absolutely not an option.

Any advice appreciated.",15Oct2020,1

I've been extremely stressed out lately having to take care of all my siblings AND grandmother and still be expected to do dinner and chores while having SCHOOL and a husky who needs lots of exorcise. 

I brought this up to my parents a while ago, explaining to them that i was already 2 weeks behind in some classes for never being able to do the work. My dad who i knew was clearly stressed said the solution should be selling my dog to pay for a babysitter. 

This of course made me freak out, because i ASKED for the responsibility of a dog. I DIDN'T ask for more siblings. I love them so much and im so grateful for the experience with raising them but i shouldn't have to give up my childhood AND graded for them. Its unfair and im at my wits end.

Like I said I’m worried I’m falling down the incel rabbit hole. Firstly no I haven’t viewed any incel forums or celebrated Elliot Rodgers massacre or anything like that. The reason why is I’ve noticed now I’ve became really angry frustrated and bitter at women when it comes to romance. I just don’t understand what women say sometimes. The one time a girl liked me was someone I thought didn’t like me at all. Some will say they want this type of guy but then date the polar opposite. And secondly for the past year and half I worked on improving myself such as bettering my social skills , going to more social events like football games no pua crap but regardless I’ve got nothing to show for it and I’m going to be 18 soon.

106,"I’ll try to explain this as best as possible but I apologize if it seems all over the place, I hate talking about this subject which makes this difficult for me. My paternal grandfather sexually abused me for a number of years until I was able to live back with my mother. I never mentioned being sexually abused because during this time I was constantly threatened and I became terrified of what would happen. I hate to say it but he “brainwashed” me into thinking this. Currently, I’m honestly embarrassed and about having been abused. I hate thinking about it, so the last thing I want to do is physically discuss it. However, my father passed away several years ago. My mom feels sorry for my grandfather even though her and my father were separated for a long time before he died. She wants me to have a relationship with my grandfather because  she thinks he’s lonely and needs someone to talk to, and that it’s my responsibility because I’m his only grandchild. The good news is I’m originally from a different country which is where my grandfather is located. However, he still tries to contact me and once in a awhile I have awkward phone calls with him to appease my mother. I’m not sure what to do about this. I hate him, I’m disgusted by him, but I really don’t want my mother to find out. She’s “accused” and “interrogated” me about having been sexually abused in the past. The reason I use these words is because she went about it in a way where she was screaming and yelling at me, ordering me to tell her who’s “hurt” me in a very aggressive way.

108,"So about a couple months ago I met this girl on a dating app and we ended up getting real close over the course of a month, spending a lot of time with each other and doing a lot of things together. Unfortunately, not very long after we initially met, she was told that she was going to have to move back to another state, 1,000+ miles away. I was deeply saddened that this was going to happen and that she really didn't have much of a choice. We never officially became a ""thing"", due to her having to move back after such a short time of knowing each other. And although I deeply wanted to be in a relationship with her, which at times I still kinda do, it didn't feel like the right thing to do at the time to try and ask her out right before she was going to leave.

Prior to her moving, she admitted that she was a fairly bad texter, and that it's difficult for her to keep up with the amount of people she carries conversations with over text. On top of that, due to the various mental illnesses she suffers from, this also makes it difficult for her to feel motivated enough to answer as many texts as she possibly can on a daily basis. Interestingly enough, we never even exchanged phone numbers due to the fact that where she lived at the time when we met, her phone wasn't able to get reception, so our main avenue for conversation has only been through instagram.

While she was still here, when we weren't spending time with each other, she would text me daily. Now, over a month and half since she's been gone, I haven't spoken to her in about 2 weeks. I've made several attempts to have a conversation with her, always making sure she's doing alright and that things are going well. When she does eventually get around to my texts, typically several days after I've sent them, she'll respond to my wellfare checks and mention some things going on in her life in very short detail, but in a seemingly casual and friendly way, but beyond that, that's it. Oddly enough, at times she's even told me she misses me, and has even suggested that I would like it out there where she lives, which I find to be both good and somehwat strange. She doesn't engage in conversations with me and tends to only answer certain parts of my texts while leaving other parts out or ignoring them outright. We went from being incredibly close —spending so much time with each other, and giving each other so much attention and intimacy while she was still here — to now being so distant and incredibly hard to reach.

About a week ago, I sent her a snap with my phone number attached on it, asking her if she could talk sometime so that I could express some things to her that have really been weighing down on my mind. She took a screenshot of the snap, but never replied. This only confused me and made me feel even more depressed, because at this point I just feel like I was just some kind of convenience for her while she was here, and now that we can't physically be in each others lives, I don't matter as much as I used to for her. But I really don't know what's really going on.

I'm not one to make meaningful connections with other people very often, so the few that I do I have, I try my utmost best to maintain them and try to be there for those people because they mean so much to me. I gave her so much of myself while she was here, and now it kind of feels like she's gotten her use out me and she's moved on. I miss her like crazy everyday and I want to keep trying to reach out to her, but I've been refraining from doing so because I feel like I don't matter to her as much anymore as she still matters to me.

Should I even bother trying to talk with her at this point? Or should I give her the benefit of the doubt? and try to understand that she may be going through a lot at the moment and so its been difficult for her to text me back in a proper capacity? I just don't know what approach should I take and I don't know if I'm just going overboard on this. But how can someone get so close to another person and then just casually become distant over time and hard to reach without expressing or showing any type of remorse? oof.",15Oct2020,1
109,"I don't know what to do and my spirit is just broken. Is it bad to have goals and dreams event though I'm a Mother. 

My mom just called me selfish for still wanting to pursue my career and land my dream job, is it wrong to want to pursue my career and aim for my dream job while providing for my child? She also told me she doesn't trust me at all. 

When I told her I withdrew from it, she instantly went on defense mode and told me that that's on me and her saying that she's afraid of my child's welfare is not wrong and that she supports me, then it came out that she doesn't trust me and that she thinks I'm so selfish for still wanting to reach this goal of mine. 

The job is in the TV industry as a producer.

Here's a background on what happened:

I applied for my dream job and at first she was so supportive then when I got serious about it she started saying negative things and accusing me of things like my real intentions in applying for the job, when all I want is to still reach my goals even if I'm 27 already...

I was so hurt that Ive barely been talking to her but she keeps trying to talk to me like nothing is wrong.

She's forcing me to give up my dreams but at the start she was so supportive and even told me to go for it and would even ask me my plans and stuff and saying she was so sure I would get the job. 

I'm so upset that she did this to me but is turning the tables and making me feel bad for being upset.

I have a son and am a single mom, all I want is to give my child a better life but she thinks I'm doing it for a different reason. The job won't even take my time away much cause I can work remotely if I wanted and I only need to travel when needed which is only 5% of the time. 

At the beginning she was pushing me to go for it, telling me she will definitely help me with my son, but suddenly she's all about my child's welfare as if I'm just gonna head away and forget about him when I'm doing this mostly to try and provide a better life for him while still pursuing my career",15Oct2020,1

(F,18)

Hello, I’m an 18 year old girl and I’ve come across a problem that I feel will really mess up my life further on. I am actually a pretty busy person, at least currently. I do have a lot of projects and responsibilities and I do try new things, but I still get the feeling of being bored all the time, 

I don’t even know if I would call it being bored, just unsatisfied. I know people are always looking for something more but in my case I am worried about this. Even if I have 935 things to do like responsibilities I have a constant feeling that I need something interesting to happen, like I’m addicted to it or something. Whether it be a new relationship or some sort of new drama I always need something to happen, even if I don’t have time for it! 

I’m worried about this because I feel like in a few years I’ll probably be doing uni, have a job and a stable relationship but I’ll still feel BORED, like I need something new to happen when there is nothing left to happen. Is this a symptom of ADHD? Getting bored quickly of everything? (I have all the symptoms of ADHD but haven’t been able to go to a doctor for a diagnosis, I’m just wondering if I am just an unhappy person or if this is also a symptom of ADHD) 

TLDR; constantly unsatisfied and quickly bored of everything, possible symptom of ADHD? Or just pessimistic?",15Oct2020,1
115,"so first off, my grammar sucks and I don't know how to properly format. The last two paragraphs have the actual incident the rest is a rant.

Every day I(14f)used to have a routine, come home from school and tell my parents everything that happened down to the tiniest detail, they are always in so much control, they follow me on my Facebook, I am not allowed Instagram ticktock or Snapchat, they need to know the parents of my friends, their last names, phone numbers, home addresses, I don't choose my activities, I had to do wrestling despite the horrific back problems I had from diving and trampoline. I had my internet access controlled until high school, now there is no homework on weekends because work ends on weekdays, I didn't even really decide what clothes were in my closet, my mom would come into my room and take any that were on the floor away.

last year my younger sister changed, as did my younger cousin Y. they started bullying me at get-togethers and excluding me. this is in addition to the adults excluding me and the other family friend (V) and my other younger cousin P. I was alone and my parents didn't like that so they took away my phone and said to go play, I try to avoid get-togethers now. my sister has become the clear golden child, she is good at the sports my parents sign her up for, she is good at math, all her problems are overshadowed and forgotten because my parents still remember when I fvcked up years ago. I am scared of being home alone with her because she will turn black into white and paint me as a cruel monster. for instance, we might play tag and she might trip, suddenly I am a monster who was chasing her trying to hit her and pull her hair. I have a lot of trouble remembering what I said in a conversation and due to that my parents believe her. I have trouble remembering any past conversations in general, I need to write something down multiple times for it to try and stay in my head. I have simply stopped talking to her as much and I try to ignore her. My mom is generally pissed at me telling me to be the bigger person because she wants a perfect family instead of two siblings who keep fighting.

My dad is quite a piece of work. He has his own business doing quite well for himself and he loves what he does, so everyone else has to do the same. I want to be a teacher or a pilot, my dad is already threatening not to pay for my tuition if I don't do what he wants, I don't get to choose my optional courses either. If I need help with homework I don't ask him because I am scared. The last time I asked him for help he first berated me for not knowing the subject, got angry at the school system and took it out on me saying how stupid the country is and how when he was my age....he surprisingly isn't a boomer and he is only in his early forties. while I did wrestling my dad picked up a new ""quirk"" he started berating me for how much I weigh. I didn't fit into my weight category by 2 kg on a normal day and I had to cut 2kg each week before a competition. Now before I didn't think I was fat, all I do are competitive sports at high levels. I ride 150km at 27km/h no problem. I try to stay fit but he keeps it up. I weigh 54kg at 164cm

since this new school year, the schedule has changed drastically. I have precalc 11 in 10 weeks while also doing PE and gr10 french in the french immersion program (guess the country). My grades have gone down from As to high Bs and in math all the way down to a C. My parents have started to treat me very differently. I am not allowed to do any hobbies and all time must be math time. because of that my french grade has gone down because I am simply not allowed to give any thought about it. My parents have started really lecturing me when I get home and they start loudly, angrily telling me about how much I need to study more. then they lecture me on not focusing on my studies, then they lecture me about my grade in french. any conversation I have with my parents goes down that path, whether it is about cycling, fishing, or school. I have since tried to shut down most conversations.

anyway, the whole point of the post: today I flat out said nothing happened at school that I wanted to talk about. my dad got really angry, tried to make me get out of the car (we were at a stoplight) and took away my phone for being rude. now my dad says he is done supporting me and that is what I get for not appreciating his help and that I should get a job and out of the house. what should I do now?",15Oct2020,1

I need advice on how to form bonds, connections, and relationships with women, something that I seem to struggle with. I'm not looking for a relationship just for the sake of it nor any twisted, unselfish reason, I'm hoping to have a mutual relationship with someone who I can share my experiences, love for adventure, etc. with, if that makes sense. But I'm not sure how to make this happen, how to find someone who I can love and who can love me back.",15Oct2020,1
118,"I work as an overnight remodeler at Walmart, the job is boring, there are so many restrictions and occasional shit storm days, but I like it... Except one key issue. I HATE working overnights, I have issues sleeping comfortably during the day, it can take hours for me to fall asleep, I've gotten black out curtains, face masks, but the light that manages to get in is enough to make sleep borderline impossible if I'm not already tired.

I only took the job because it was the only one I  had at the time, but I will not take another overnight position, I just can't handle it.

But I also hate working with the public, which is most day time jobs, I don't do well under pressure, if the computer/register has an issue, or someone asks me to do something/help them with something, and I don't know what to do, I basically self destruct on the inside, I'd need constant supervision because I'm scared of making a wrong move and getting scolded for it. Even basic shit becomes the fuckin Vonyich Manuscript when my mind is forced to think quickly, I just lock up inside.

I don't even know *what* advice I'm asking for, I have a month left on this job and I know I can't conquer my issue of sleep in that time, nor can I deal with my anxiety for working with the public.

I genuinely just don't want to be here, I hate it and I don't feel like any job in this economy is right for me.

Is there *any* help or advice to be had?",15Oct2020,1

121,"While browsing reddit I came across a site that allows you to freely look up identifying information about people by entering a name, address, or other basic information (fastpeoplesearch.com).  To test it out, I entered my own name and the state I live in. It found my full name, the city I live in, my age, some past addresses, my cell phone number and the names of most of my close relatives. Kinda cool, kinda scary.

However, under the first, fairly accurate entry were 2 more entries with my name and ""goes by"" a totally different name. These entrees listed my state as Texas, had totally different phone numbers and a list of relatives with the same last name as the goes by name. The past addresses, however, were a mix of Texas addresses and my old addresses, including my current address. I thought this was extra strange as I moved about 6 months ago and the accurate entry on the site doesn't even have my new address, but these suspicious entries do.

I checked my credit score and bank accounts and everything looked fine, so it does not seem like there has been any fraudulent financial activity in my name. I checked a few other names of friends and relatives to check if this was a common occurrence, but no one else had that issue that I could find.

The website of course does not reveal where it pulls it's information from, but I'm assuming a lot of it comes from public records of some sort which has me a little worried since it seems like there might be a record somewhere of me going by a different name in a different state. Additionally the name sounded vaguely familiar; I think I my have received a few pieces of junk mail over the past couple years addressed to this person but I just assumed it was someone who had lived in my house long ago. I tried calling the numbers associated with the other 2 records and got an automated voice mailbox.

My question is: what should I do about this, if anything? My credit report shows no evidence of identity theft and I'm not even sure what record leads this site to believe I'm going by another name. I'm worried because these suspicious records have even more up-to-date address information for me than the seemingly correct one, and I don't want something illegal this person might do to be connected to my name. Can I find out where this info is being pulled from? Is there a less nefarious explanation for this?",15Oct2020,1
122,"I am currently in a weird state where my entire family is pretty much working class/poor. I’ve always been the outlier in my family as well. I’m creative, Ive traveled a bit, and have done a lot of different things but at the end of the day I’m still poor. I save my money, I haven’t bought new clothes or shoes since I was 18 and I am 25 now (thanks metabolism). I still don’t have any more than 1,200 at a time, and whenever I do have more than that I have to help a family member or something comes up.

Having people look over my resume and even paying for that service and not getting jobs even then. at this point I don’t even care what I do, I just have to get out of this cycle of poverty. It’s getting harder and harder to live and I feel like I’m slipping away and becoming less excited about the future and more depressed because I’ll only get older and I can’t even see one thing that’s good there. I feel like this makes me less productive too, just sitting around thinking about how bad things are and i maladaptive daydream a lot even to the point where I am for three hours at a time multiple times a day, yeah I spend most of my day daydreaming no matter what I’m doing because real life is so bad.

123,"Hello. I'm 23 years old. I don't post often. Feeling kinda down and out. I really felt like I needed to reach out and talk to some people. I don't have many people in my life to ask for advice and I'm not very comfortable with asking people for things. I'm pretty uncomfortable posting this at all. Anyway not really that good of a writer.

**Brass tax: I am considering a career in the Navy or in the medical field (nursing or physician.)**

**Medical field:** I would really like to go to medical school and become a doctor. I would love to work in pediatrics hospital and maybe even specialize in cardiology. And I really do think that I have what it would take for medical school. I'm not very brainy or intelligent but I can work very hard and I enjoy learning. But ultimately I worry about medical school being unrealistic because I didn't preform well in high school. I graduated with a 3.7 but I personally believe that is more due to easy classes and helpful counselors paving the way for me. But I can't stress enough how easy these classes were. I am currently in college pretty comfortably maintaining a 4.0... but it's also just a junior college. So I'm not trying to knock anyone who is doing well in college, but I also live in California and feel like the educational bar here is set pretty low anyway. So I am trying to remain realistic is about what is possible for my future.

**Navy:** I was getting some lunch and I ended up running into a Navy recruiter. And we started talking just shooting the shit about trucks and some other bullshit. Then he asked me what I thought of the Navy and what my interests were. And I told him that I didn't know anything about the Navy. The military has never really interested me. So we end up talking for awhile longer and the next day I come to his office with a few hours to spare and take an ASVAB. I had never taken ASVAB or an SAT or anything like that in high school so I didn't know what to expect. But anyway, he tells me that I got the highest score he's ever tested and I qualify for ""nuke school."" He's telling me about nuclear power and all the benefits of joining as a nuke and all the prestige and saying it looks like I'm good at math. I think he's a nice guy and all but I feel like my bullshit detectors are going off because the math was like pre-algebra stuff and it's multiple-choice to top it all off and tests have never made me nervous. So I don't know. I'm just trying to remain realistic about what is said and what I encounter. I really like science and I have been mildly interested in nuclear power, but never really gave it too much thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Largest factors influencing my feelings about these options:

1.  I feel strongly that if I were to go to medical school I would be able to pull myself through.
2. Nuke school is intimidating because I am not at all gifted in math. After I took the test I really struggled to see someone being able to make the leap from high school algebra to nuke school where they are probably dealing with some crazy physics I have never even thought about touching.
3. School loans for medical school is also intimidating. And being offered to get put through a program that would give me a degree and work experience while the Navy picks up the tab is attractive.
4. **The biggest thing that is influencing my decision is I am a family person**. My parents got divorced right when I was moving out on my own. But I have 3 younger sisters who had to go through all the ugliness of divorce. So since the divorce I have stuck around my family trying to offer what little support I can to my sisters when things get tough and they don't feel like they are all alone. Anyway. My dad suffers from schizophrenia and my mother is a recovering meth addict. So shit can still get wild but my sisters are the best kids that you would ever meet and I love them to death and I worry about leaving them for the Navy. I would miss them dearly.

This post turned out to be longer that I thought that is was going to be. I hope that it doesn't get removed by a mod for violating something.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** What is more realistic; Nuke school through the navy, or medical school.

It was in a small adidas sports bag in the corner of my room. It was well hidden in plain sight. Surprise, my parents decided to do a deep clean of my room while I was out at school! So they found it and tried to talk to me about it.

I have already told my therapist about my drinking. I told my parents I'm ""holding it for a friend"" and was very vague with my answers.

126,"I'm an adult child of a parent who is a local elected official in the U.S. and my parent recently took a higher office that has meant more recognition not only in our hometown, but also on a state/national level. It's always been difficult to cope with this - they began running for office when I was young, and I've often had to answer for them among people I grew up with. I'm no longer living there but my parent's higher profile now means that I can't escape commentary about them whether I'm on social media (which I need to be on for work), talking to friends/coworkers, or of course being with family. I took a job that's somewhat political because I needed to, but this has made working there very difficult.

The pandemic and unrest around violent racism has hit my hometown hard, and I understand the need to criticize if leaders aren't doing enough to confront these issues - but the inability to escape &amp; the personal insults/threats I see against my parent/our family are becoming really hard to cope with. It's hard to confide in friends because I know they/their families need to be vocal about their views and I don't want to make them feel like they shouldn't. It's been isolating in a time when the pandemic has me feeling more isolated than ever.

I'm having a tough time finding support from anyone who can really understand this position. I've talked to my family but we're all going through it. I know that being in a ""political family"" has real privilege, and I want to acknowledge that.

129,"I currently live on a top floor unit that is connected to 3 other adjacent units. Almost everyone in these adjacent units watches TV / listen to music super loud and past 1 am nightly. This started about 2 years ago when different people moved into my adjacent units. Talked to management and they would quite down but the next day it continues. Thing is, I think on top of the TV situation the issue is the walls are just shit for sound isolation. And so I'm considering moving.

I have found another top floor unit nearby my area and submitted my application. My building manager who got a called about me from the new apartment manager (for background check purposes?) told me that are sorry to see me go after having been in my current apartment for almost 9 years, and asked if the noise is really that bad, I told her the situation is getting out of hand as I'm in graduate school and so my apartment is basically my work place + resting place, and not being able to work or sleep in quite even at night is quite a nuisance. 

Then she told me the following:

She personally heard stories about the manager who contacted her at the new apartment, and said that ""he's a really rude and obnoxious person"". I asked her what she means and she said she talked to a guy who worked with her and he ""never complains about anyone' except for the manager at the new place.

130,"I'm using the term crazy loosely, I think she's just not mentally stable enough to handle the constant housing and food stamps paperwork. We just received a letter saying our Section 8 housing is being terminated because we violated some rules in the agreement, but they didn't elaborate what we did. My brother and I suspect that it's because she never bothered to update them on information regarding my employment (again). She wants to write a letter to them about it, but I can't imagine what she's going to write about, since we don't actually KNOW what we did wrong. 
I've suspected she has some sort of bipolar disorder because she'll be high energy for a few weeks and relentlessly clean her room and pick up a million projects and then randomly just stop doing everything and lay in bed playing on her phone and watching TV for a few weeks. She is the heaviest procrastinator and puts off important things like the housing and food stamp paperwork and occasionally forgets them after the deadline. For a while she brought in random strangers to stay the night in her room with her for some reason until she became infatuated with one. She's lately had an obsession with God and Christianity, and she's always been a Christian, but now it's borderline unhealthy and she thinks her shitty ex is a literal demon and she just tries to inject her religious rhetoric into every conversation with us despite me and my brother both being agonistic atheists.
And I'm pregnant, the father is in the picture, he has a job, but the state I live in is kind of expensive and we're struggling to find a place that won't have us wondering if we need to make extreme budget cuts. We're looking at all the assistant programs we can find. But we weren't expecting that we might need to move so soon.
I was wondering if I should call the Housing program and Government assistant programs to let them know I don't think my mom is in a stable enough mental state to keep up with all the paperwork and responsibilities needed to keep her benefits. Ideally, they could be transferred to me or my brother because we can both get important things done easier and we actually understand the importance of communicating with the assistance programs.

We tried so hard to make it work but I messed up and thought it would be best for us to break up, then immediately afterwards I regretted it completely, it was too late and I made an absolute idiot and manipulative narcissist out of myself.

135,"Hello everyone I want to get your opinion on something, I really do not know what to make of this situation. About two weeks ago I invited a friend to my house, let's call her Megan. I know Megan for a long time, approximately ten years, and I always had feelings for her. About 5 years ago she had a baby with another guy and after that we drifted apart and I gave up any possibility of letting her know how I feel about her. About two years ago I decided to send her a text through facebook,  just to see how she was doing. I honestly wasn't sure if she was going to respond, but she did. We reconnected right away and I decided to invite her to a restaurant, not really with the intention of it being a date, but mostly just as two friends getting together. At this point I was not sure if she still was with the guy who she had the baby with and I was afraid to ask because there were no pictures of them together on facebook or any status to display. When I went to pick her up, there she was, looking as pretty as ever, waiting outside for me. And also those feelings that I had for her came back all of the sudden. Outside was also the guy in question, who she had the baby with, he was just arriving in his car as well. He casually said hi to me and I also said hi to him.I picked up Megan and we went to the restaurant, everything went well. Obviously the idea of letting her know I still had feelings for her was out of the picture now. We simply had dinner and talked about our lives. The dinner ended, I took her home and at that point I knew there was probably not going to be anything between us. But we continue to talk on facebook, it wasn't anything too special and we could easily go for periods of about three months without talking. But still, we went out to a couple more dates in a period of about a year. On the third date, she told me she was no longer living with the guy who she had the baby with, they decided to split. I saw this as an opportunity to finally let her know about the feelings I had for her, but since I waited so long, I wanted it to be something more special. So I decided to take her horse riding. I knew she really like this and I seemed like the perfect opportunity to let her know about my feelings (these was before the pandemic) I was really excited about this and I also wanted everything to go well so I made sure to make a reservation two weeks in advance and made sure it was on a day with good weather. A week before the actual date I send her a message but there was no reply from her, and it went on like this up until a couple of days when we were supposed to go. Since I had no reply from her I decided to invite somebody else because I did not want to lose the reservation or let all the preparation go to waste. And then a day and half before I received a message from Megan letting me know she was still up to go horse riding. In retrospect I believe she did not confirm because she could not find a sitter for his son. After she told me this I let her know I invited somebody else already and I will have to cancel the other person. Megan said to me that I did not have to do that because she could also invite this other guy that she was seeing. When she said this to me I felt completely shattered so I decided to cancel Megan and simply go with the other person. She was not happy, but she kind of understood. We stopped talking for about  6 months after this, and then one day I saw Megan at the gym, we started talking again and she told me she was single now. I saw again my elusive opportunity to let her know about my feelings for her, but again I wanted it to be special. I decided to invite her to my home this time to see a movie. She was ok with this and we set up the date. When we were watching the movie, the best way I decided to let her know about my feelings was to ask her to sit right next to me, then I proceeded to hug her and after a few more minutes I picked her up and sat her on my lap. Then I kissed her, she corresponded with my kiss and it lasted for about a minute. After that she just stopped kissing me and told me she couldn't do it, because she just ended a relationship with someone. I told her I understood and that I also did not want this kiss to ruin our friendship. She said I had nothing to worry about. We decided to finish the movie and also ordered something to eat, during this time she did not seem to be angry, but she was distant. She also noticed I have a security camera in my home and I let her know our kiss was recorded in that camera. Is not that we did anything really inappropriate but i wanted her to know that. At the end of the evening I simply took her home, she gave me a hug and I left with the idea that things were not bad, until the next day. I sent her a message to see how she was doing, and I noticed she blocked me on facebook. This really came as a surprise to me because I never felt like she was angry after the kiss at least not to the point of blocking me. I keep wondering what was it that upset her? Was the recording of the kiss maybe? And also ask you guys if you believe I still have an opportunity to get her back? I honestly can't stop thinking about her, mostly because of how much history I have with her. What should I do? Should I look for her again even if this means getting his number from somebody else (I know, I never got around to asking for his number, we only talked through facebook) or sending her a message from another facebook account?  i'm not too happy with either of these options. Or should I just let her go?",15Oct2020,1
136,"This is a bizarre post. Several years ago I was hanging out with someone who I recently met. We were in a very public place and some people he knew physically attacked me. (They never tried to steal anything, maybe it was a gang related but I think it's their personality). I reported it to the police and they weren't able to catch them and the person I knew refused to tell their names. (About a month after the incident I ran into one on the street who basically jeers at me and I walked away not no what to do). Just last week I saw one at the beach. I'm 95% sure it was him. Also I asked the person I was hanging out with again what their names was and this time he told me. But years has passed since the initial incident and he clearly doesn't want to talk to police.

Any advice? Where I live has extremely low violent crime and I think at least trying to talk to cops again would make me feel better. Also any ideas why they attacked a random person in public?

My family is a mess, to put it delicately. My parents have been alcoholics for years, they’re emotionally abusive, and they generally neglect the house they live in. 

I (20f) moved out of their house in February after a massive blowout with my father involving my boyfriend (19m), and moved in with my grandparents for about a month before my boyfriend and I moved in together. (We’ve been together for a little bit less than a year.)

To keep this short, I’ll skip to present day. My sister came over tonight and told me how bad things have gotten in my absence. My mother has been drunk driving WITH my sisters in the car, and on several occasions my sister has been afraid of my mother doing something to hurt herself. (My mother has a history of BPD, currently untreated, and suicide attempts.)

I know how bad it was when I lived there and my parents were doing better so I can’t imagine how awful it so for my sisters right now. 

My boyfriend and I are looking into emancipating my youngest sister, who will be 15 in February, since she suffers the most and my other sister, 17, gets on well with my parents and will be 18 in June. We do plan on keeping my other sister in the loop so she doesn’t feel betrayed, as well as my aunt and grandparents who know about the situation but haven’t been able to do anything for fear of getting CPS involved. 

I’m looking for advice on how to proceed; financially, legally, emotionally. I’m not taking any of this lightly, I don’t expect any of it to be easy in any way, and I’m trying to prepare myself for the reality of putting mine and my boyfriend’s lives on hold to make sure my sisters are taken care of.

The people I live with said it didn’t smell too bad, they said it smelled like maple syrup or an IHOP. But it smells rancid to me. Does anyone know what the cause is? Ever experienced a smell like this before? Why it’s permanently on everything it touches? How to get rid of it?

I know I’ve smelled it before at my school, on certain people, backpacks, and sometimes my hands without an explanation. Though it always washed off. (no, I am not sniffing people or their backpacks. It’s a very strong smell.)

Anyways, please help. I don’t want to live the rest of my life with this smell. I can’t find proper answers on google either, I don’t know where to search.",15Oct2020,1

Can you please suggest a setup for the midi output at a keyboard to the lightning connection on an iPad?

144,"So hey, I'm just a dude wondering what types of stuff I could learn to be a ""modern renaissance"" man. 

I recently graduated from college and well, I have an urge to learn again. I have a bunch of time on my hands as I'm currently working part time and just studying for the MCAT, which I will be presenting sometime in February, 2021.

I'd like to learn stuff that can help me connect with people or to just get to know myself. 

Right now, I've embarked in expanding the languages I know as that's literally the best way to connect with people. 

I live in a multicultural area that includes mostly White, Latino, and Asian cultures.

I'm currently learning Japanese as well... I consume a lot of their media (anime and video games). And I heard it's a great avenue for learning Korean and Chinese.

I'm a total infant in the language but in the past three days I've managed to learn Hiragana through Anki. Tomorrow I'll start working on Katakana so I can finally learn the grammar and Kanji.

I've also been continuing to play the guitar and have been writing my own songs. I downloaded FL studio and have been fiddling with ghost notes to make melodies but the actual sound design stuff is HARD. I'm actually scared to pursue that.

I do have access to SkillShare but there's just so much content.... it's paralyzing at times.

I bought a Piano I haven't that I haven't been using frequently :P... that's super hard but will be great for diving into music theory.

So yeah... I'm just learning more guitar, studying for the MCAT, and divining into Japanese.

What else should I be learning or is this a good avenue?

146,"I’m a 20yo female who had many acquaintances during high school but lost touch after high school. Basically i was friends with them bc i saw them every day. also i didn’t have the best reputation in high school— i was very studious and uptight because of it and no one saw me as friendly and nice, but instead cold and rude. 

I left high school with a few friends, but had to cut off a few of them— they were extremely gossipy, toxic, talked badly about me behind my back and were extremely childish in behaviour which basically all of my peers agreed on— they warned me about these girls repeatedly so i know that these girls were the problem and not me. 

right now i’m left with my boyfriend, two friends and one acquaintance who don’t really get along well with each other (they’re civil but have nothing in common) one of the girls who i’ll call Kate is my closest one, she only has me, we have so much in common and get along like sisters. The other one i’ll call Rachel changed a lot after quarantine. She went from being outgoing, crass in the best way and unfiltered which i loved, to a kardashian plastic wannabe who is selfish and only thinks about herself— we got into constant arguments about me not wanting to party during a pandemic. Besides that, us both being single and having hookups and partying was all we had in common. Now, we don’t have that in common and struggle to find things to talk about. All she talks about is the kardashians, hailey bieber, her ex, or it’s awkward silence. I’m not putting myself above her, we just have nothing in common. i’m interested in books, film, conspiracy theories etc. she’s not at all. The acquaintance is good friends with rachel and me and rachel wouldn’t hang out without her, it would be a bit awkward. 

I’m sending a big drift between me and Rachel. I don’t want to be left with just Kate if my boyfriend and i break up god forbid. I have no clue what to do. I have a good friend from childhood/beginning of high school who wants to reconnect and i can see myself getting along with her friends— but she has disregarded covid and has been partying and going out. My family struggles with health so i don’t want to take that risk. 

I know this is a difficult time for everyone, but i have no clue what’s going to happen after this pandemic. I joined two clubs in my college but in one of them everyone’s older than me and has no interest in friendship especially during covid. the second one i joined this year and there’s no in person aspect anyway, it’s an online student magazine. 

I’m really relying on after this pandemic and travelling in travel groups, joining yoga which i love , working with children and meeting people from there. But who knows when this will end. I don’t know how to deal with the feeling like i’m spending my 20s with very few friends, in a house during a pandemic.",15Oct2020,1
147,"I’m a bit in shock I currently reside in Illinois and my family are in Puerto Rico. My aunt who lives on the side of my mom became the “cat lady” every one has told her hey she needs to stop and take the cats to rescue.

Long story short my brother raised one of the kittens and we all loved the cat...How ever as you probably know having excessive amount of cats brings trouble with neighbors.

The front neighbor killed the cat we don’t have proof per se but she hinted she did police was called no evidence so they left.

Now it comes the point no one has told my brother about the cat passing is there any proper way to mention it? 

My stupid sister just flat out told me  I’m pissed she mention it  a few minutes ago in the most selfish way I overwork each day and I wasn’t prepared for that. I told her like why she would say something like that so casual and that my world right now is falling (mentally I’m unstable) she said well “my world broke so yours have to also” I’m pissed at her and shouted at her.

She’s acting like nothing mean while my food is burning I feel like a huge void in my chest and I don’t even wanna move from the sofa.

Now I’m worried that when my brother learns about this it will create a void in his world he’s successful in his work field and like me he just works,works,works.

But I’m afraid that my family won’t know how to properly mention to him with out him reacting in a bad way.

But because I was depressed for a while and don't have many friends. I try to express myself to them but they are either jealous or just completely stubborn about the whole thing. 

I like to get the opinions of other people in my life to feel like I'm doing the right thing. But they say and do things that make me being to slip back into my depression. I counteract this by not talking to them for a little while till I know I have sorted my feelings out again. 

I have a family that is supportive of my dreams and what me to be successful know matter what I do. 

My friends are happy working their Boring 9-5 jobs and getting together on weekends to get drunk. But I am completely the opposite to that.

149,"  As the title states, I need to help a friend. **An online one specifically.** I'll be referring to them as *'friend'.*

**Here's the jist:** They're suffering from depression, difficulty sleeping, and all the great shit that comes along with that. This is causing them to fail in school, and they've mostly given up hope. I've tried to help them and encourage them as much as I can, but I can only do so much. 

They're a minor, so they rely on their parents to get help, but they have a really shitty relationship with their mom (doesn't live with their dad, but their relationship is just as bad). They tell me she never listens, and if she does, she doesn't follow through. She's very dismissive and often raises her voice, thinks she can't do anything wrong, and blabs to her friends about what friend is apparently doing so wrong (also sharing personal information that friend never said was all right to share). She cares about friend, but isn't very good at it, and might even be neglectful emotionally. They're also LGBTQ+ and their mom has expressed her dislike towards the community. 

They've talked to me about running away (seriously considering it) and often talk about how they wish they were dead, and contemplate the ways to end their life. They have gone to therapy before, but they have a hard time opening up, and a lot of their therapists haven't been a good match. This has led them to give up on trying. Their sleep issues are also an extremely vicious cycle. 

Need to do school &gt; can't focus, tired &gt; bad grades &gt; can't sleep because stressed and homework &gt; repeat. They literally get 1-4 hours of sleep at night. 

I just have no idea what to do. They have no one to turn to, and it's not like their mom is bad enough that they can contact some sort of authorities and get help. I feel like if this goes on they're going to have a really bad life, and I don't want that. 

How can I help them or what could they do to alleviate some of their issues?",15Oct2020,1

Problems: She constantly argues with her 14-year-old brother about snacks, dishes, and who is going to use the basement to play games/study/class. She has quit college for a year and lied about it (postponing our move). She has quit her job and has been unemployed from 6-12 months at a time.

152,"I'm 30F this was my first job out of school. I'm an engineer and the coworker in question is a graphic designer. My skill sets are different than his so I've been pulled into different projects. Projects he wanted. I've been able to perform well and worked on process improvement projects. My coworker is critical of my communication and performance. He is also the type to watch what time I'm leaving each day. He works ""long hours"" and comments on me leaving at 6pm (mind you I come in at 7a and take lunch for 1.5 hours and work weekends to stay ahead). I've seldomly missed deadlines and he has many times. Example, he had 3 years to complete a project and didnt. It was handed to me and I did it in 3 months without complaint.

He said ""I walk around like a peacock as if my shit doesn't stink"" I'm super offended because I've never considered myself perfect or better than. I own up to my mistakes and work towards a resolve. I made sure to buy and circulate birthday cards for all my coworkers and my manager. 

My manager has an open door policy. I've used it liberally. I'll admit Ive always been a bit if a brown noser by trying to anticipate what my manager needs before he even asks for it and doing it beforehand, and I talk to him a great deal because I don't have anyone else to bounce ideas off of. My manager has always been ok with this. And in times past when I tried pitching ideas in team meetings, my coworker would shoot them down and complain about them rather than help flesh them out. 

I think he will go to hr, and I've never really worked with hr before. I want to get ahead of this and prepare and I'm not sure how to or what to do.

Also, I do feel like he is giving extra grief because I'm a female. He has made comments like, ""I can tell from her body language that she didnt want to deal with it, so I have to.."" and that (this is early on of me working there ""that I have an in with [my manager]"" and ""that he will listen to me.""

154,"My sister's friend, let's call her Amy, got kicked out of her home near the begging of the pandemic and has been living with us since. I've gotten to get chummy with her and it turns out we ended up falling for each other, with the caveat being we can't let anyone in the house find out else risk her getting kicked out. We've been pretty slick about everything, only hanging out when pushed to (ex. me getting asked to pick her up from work), when we find activities only wed wanna do (ex. go bike ridding) or at night when everyone is asleep and she can come over to my room. Now the problem starts when after 3 months of doing the secret stuff we get a little too comfortable and have been way less secret about our PDA. With way more hugging and sex eyes in common spaces when no one is around (at least we think no one is). Today we were very not slick and my sister walked in on us hugging and me about to give her a kiss on the cheek. This has lead to her being... let's say less than happy as we claim plausible deniability that it was only a hug cause she wasn't feeling well. She's really upset about it since she somehow adopted the oldest fashion world view on relationships. Now normally I wouldn't give a lick of care what she thinks, the only issue is if she tells my mother who would not be happy with the idea of 2 college-age people getting frisky in her home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm freaking out as I don't want to risk her getting kicked out since I don't know where she'd go and she's freaking out about the idea of us having to break up to keep everything on the down-low before out plausible deniability argument doesn't hold up.

155,"I'm turning 16 really soon, and I've had a job for a few months now. I'm not really experienced in spending and saving.

I only really spend 10-25% of my money, and end up saving 75-90% of it. My ""expenses"" are almost nothing. I pay for Netflix for my family and when my Xbox game-pass free trial runs out, I'm thinking about keeping it. Any money other then that is spent on the odd coffee/food when hanging out with friends, or very very occasionally when I buy a game.

My parents are lovely people but they're not perfect. They're strict and don't listen very well (it's the I'm older and more experienced than you so stfu type of thing). It's so hard to talk to them about what's going on in my head. I feel like every time I shed tears in front of them (which is very rare, I would be super upset to do so), it feels like I'm at fault and weak. I'm the 'secretary' daughter so ""I should be more responsible, take care of the finances and the house and teach my sister who is only a year-and-half younger than I am"". Cool, I've been doing that all my life and forever will be doing that. However, the blunt favoritism between siblings still hurts. Sure, I got used to it. I barely bat an eyelash at my sister's new stuff or extra money in her bank account. I'm happy with what I got but they don't even try to hide it anymore. ""You should be teaching her! Why is it so hard to teach her? You have to guide her. You have to do this for her, do that for her."" My sister is 19 and I love her. I'm not blaming her for anything. But God knows, the internal screams inside me just gets louder and louder. 

Nonetheless, I'm grateful for their hard work. They remind me of their sacrifices every so often. I just don't understand how hard is it to understand that despite being online, college is mentally and emotionally exhausting. Engineering is tough. Just because I don't look like it, doesn't mean I'm not having a hard time. I try hard and fear failing. I need mental health breaks. I need friends to connect with. I just can't cancel on them so often because my parents are unhappy about me hanging out with them (my friends don't drink nor smoke, we're literally grandmas chilling in someone's backyard). I can't just stay at home. I can't teach my sister everything about life when I'm just as lost. I want to go on dates (I'm not allowed to), fall in love, get my heartbroken, and learn. I just want to live, make mistakes, and grow. Is it hard to do that? Oddly enough, they've done these things I'm wishing for when they were younger. So why?

I have a friend who told me she studies in a boarding school, but since I don't know about boarding schools the things they do sound suspicious. Like for example she said they hand over their phones. And since all are on quarantine, classes have to occur online and at home, however she mentioned that when they take rests, they have to be in meetings and teachers keep an eye on what they do, which sounds a bit shady to me.

&gt;I find it suspicious that one time the registration opens, they get like a few people, then after the registration period all traces of the school existing goes off the internet?  
From the outside it just looks like your average school

this statement got me to think that surely boarding schools don't do that.

and when I asked for the name of the school..

But no one knows  
Not even the teachers  
Not even the parents

171,"Okay so honestly even sharing this anonymously gives me anxiety, just putting it out in the universe really. But it’s something I’ve struggled with all my life and would love to hear other peoples opinions on how they deal with putting themselves out there in terms of intimate relationships. First off I know that I shouldn’t compare myself to others and all will come/happen in it’s own time but being realistic comparison to others within our society is sometimes inevitable. 
Growing up I’ve always been surrounded by peers who are always in relationships or they get out and then back in and I just don’t understand how others do it so freely. I know on the other side of the spectrum, always needing someone isn’t healthy either and I see it so often. But even though they aren’t necessarily doing it for the right reasons either, I sometimes envy them for their lack of inhibition in terms of letting people in. 
When I was younger, my selection of potential partners were not the best for geographical reasons plus I was also a bit of a pariah in some ways. I didn’t fit in and I also was not willing to compromise my standards of needing trust and communication, despite my loneliness. Now some may say that my standards could be too high, but the things I value you most is obviously first and foremost attraction and connection but then all I truly wanted and still do want is someone who is interested in getting to know me and willing to take things at my pace and not just trying to fuck. So I don’t think I’m asking for a ridiculous amount. 
I know that part of the reason of my lack of potential partners is my fault. It’s my fault in terms of the amount I put myself out there and socialize, which is little and also the type I tend to gravitate towards which is emotionally unavailable. But I’ve just felt like I’m such at a stand still and I don’t know where to turn. It’s like in my head, I wish nothing more than to be able to share myself and experience other people but at the same time I have this insurmountable fear of exposing myself to someone else on such a level. To give them parts of me that I can never get back. I’m not just talking about sexual things but just bearing my soul to them. Sharing my thoughts and feelings, the people in my life. How I like my food cooked, phrases I say, secrets, desires, dreams, insecurities. I fear this because I know it is inevitable that everything comes to an end. And it’s not so much the end that scares me but just what will live on from it. The idea that they will always know those things and can do whatever they will with it and I can never take it back. 
So I was trying to copy all of this in case some reason it didn’t post because that happened to me today already but unfortunately I accidentally cut the ending off so if it feels abrupt that’s why. It’s always the worst when you accidentally delete something, at least for me, because the second time around it will never sound as good. But anyways, I want to clarify again that the idea of the ending isn’t what bothers me the most in fact I hope to have lots of endings and beginnings as I want to learn and experience as many different types of people as I can, it’s just the first leap that’s the problem. It’s this constant battle inside of wanting to talk and learn about others and offer my thoughts and feelings fighting against this fear of being known and vulnerable. So if anyone has any wise words or would be willing to share their experiences/thoughts it would be much appreciated. 
Thanks :)",15Oct2020,1
172,"I’m 18, I have my own big place, I go to school for an emergency first responders course where we can get our certificates and volunteer with emergency services, I have many friends too. I like to believe I have my sh*t together and I can handle myself and my problems, however I’m at a loss on how to handle this.

I had been dating a guy for a little over a year and a half. He cheated on me early in the relationship for 3 months. We kept it going though and it was truly a great relationship, I recall it as one of the best I’ve ever had. We grew a lot together and experienced a lot, I’d see him every free day I had, slept over at his place or mine every weekend or day off, called all night on the nights we couldn’t be together and we talked all the time about pretty much everything. He was my best friend and boyfriend.

We planned to move in together in September but my mom unexpectedly f*cked it over for us because she didn’t approve of him, forcing him to move provinces to his parents house as he had nowhere else to stay. We tried to make it work long distance, planning for him to move back in 6 months when I resign my lease but about a month in we both began to argue a lot, our schedules and time differences (although only 1 hour apart) made things hard, our lives were going different ways and he shared that he felt unhappy. I tried to rekindle the relationship but nothing really worked and both of us became depressed. I wanted to make it last to a visit for thanksgiving so we could at least say goodbye and break it off in person. We knew the relationship was going to end. He didn’t want to fix it and I was tired of trying to fix something that I felt was impossible to fix. Around this time I began talking with a schoolmate, not anything huge, just slight flirting and chatting, he was aware I was in a failing relationship. I admitted this to my now ex and hoped we could remain friends. He accused me of having sex with the schoolmate and blocked me on everything. 

I am well aware there’s no rekindling the relationship now and I can’t speak to him anymore. Nothing really went past flirting with the schoolmate and the flirting only lasted about a week total, we decided the friendship between us was great though. I’ve never properly moved on from relationships, I always have a hard time pulling myself together after. I find myself still thinking about my ex and remembering the relationship a lot. I get deeply depressed and often end up crying really hard. I want to move on because I can’t go back but I don’t know how. I deleted all our photos, put his hoodies and the gift he gave me for my 18th into a box in my spare room closet, I’ve tried relaxing showers, partying HARD with friends, drowning it out with school, talking to my therapist, deleting social media for a few days, really everything people usually suggest to do, I even tried tinder but couldn’t bring myself to go past causal talk, it just felt too wrong and I only got more depressed. Nothings works and every time I try something new I end up in the same depression I was in or worse. I end up looking down on everything in my life and wishing things were different. I knew for a while the relationship was failing and I had time to accept it but I never did and still can’t. I still feel a boulder in my chest and I still feel deeply heartbroken and alone. What’s the best thing for me to do now? I feel like I’ve tried everything. I really hope there’s something that works.",15Oct2020,1

174,"hi. i am a f(16) and am looking for some support. my entire short life has been pretty okay. i have very supportive parents who push me everyday and am an only child. 

although this is an ideal life for the average teenager, this is just what happens on the outside. on the inside, i have severe anxiety and constantly think about what my future consists of. i am a junior in high school and this year is very important, not just for grades but for college. i am blessed to be able to get a diploma to go to any college for free in my state after i complete these specific classes. 

this is where i feel like i have been struggling. for as long as i could remember, i have wanted to move to new york city. it has been my absolute dream and i cannot get over it every single time i go there. people call me crazy, but i would drop everything right now just to live in a shoe box apartment in manhattan. i already don’t even have a small choice of going to school there, since i can just get free college here and not have to pay. but even after that, i am slowly losing hope. like i said, my parents have been supportive of me my entire life and have shown me love like no other, but every time i bring up new york, i can see the pain in their eyes. they’re both from there, and if they had the choice to never go back they would take it. i just can’t stay here and they don’t understand that. i have hated where i have lived my entire life. it is depressing, lonely, terrible environment and not somewhere i want to continue life in after college. 

i can’t imagine what the day will look like when i tell them i am leaving. they always say wherever i go they will follow me but this is just not the same. they aren’t going to follow me there and i don’t know how me, let alone them will feel. i love them so much and feel like i owe them the entire world, but does that mean i have to sacrifice my happiness?

basically what i am getting at is, is it selfish of me wanting to live my life the way i finally want to and be happy with myself, after years of struggling with figuring out who i actually want to be, over staying here and close to my parents, who have given me my entire life on a platter and deserve more than imaginable. you may think i am too young to be worried about this, but time is flying by and this is an issue that is going to come up sooner than later. 


thank you.",15Oct2020,1
176,"Is my feeling right or wrong?

A lot of times I get the feeling that the world is a very competitive dog eat dog place and a lot of people are jealous of others. For example when I am somewhat successful in something I get the feeling that some people might be jealous that I’m doing good or not want me to be successful.

177,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on my phone. 
I (16F) went to my boyfriends house after school today, who lives 30 minutes away from me. My mother was meeting with her old college roommate who was back in town tonight and going to dinner. I was told to be home at 9, and was planning to leave around 8:30 to make my curfew time. I have a test tomorrow morning in first period and with the first quarter ending and my grade sitting at a borderline 87.8, have been studying nonstop for the test and was planning to head to bed early to get enough sleep. 
As I was leaving my boyfriends house, my mother called me and told me she was a bit tipsy and asked for a ride home. She was 30 minutes away from me but I agreed because I didn’t want her driving. I got to the restaurant at 9 and wanted to pick her up and get straight home so I could head to sleep. When I got there, my mom and her friend encouraged me to sit down. A boy from my school who graduated last year was working (I always thought he was soooo cute but was too scared to talk to him before I met my bf) and my mom noticed. She yelled his name and yelled “DO YOU REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER? MY MORTIFIED DAUGHTER? HOWS COLLEGE? MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO SAY HI!” I was pretty mortified, but ignored it because she was tipsy. I asked how many drinks she had and she said she had two glasses of wine. I had to move her car to a street with non tow away parking about three blocks away and had to walk back, so I was pretty irritated and tired. Around 9:45, after constantly bugging her to leave, we got in the car and started driving. Halfway through the drive, she started vomiting. Everywhere. All over my backpack, my seat, and then got out of the car, vomited all over the side of my car, my windows, even the slit where the windows slide down into. I asked how much she had to drink again, and she admitted she had THREE bottles of wine and didn’t eat dinner. 
At this point I’m very upset. She’s refusing to hold a bag in case she vomited again. I had an appointment with my therapist earlier and wanted to talk to her about an issue privately (it was about changing medications) and my mom started bugging me about it, saying I was hiding things and being suspicious and that she had reason to believe I was hiding something. During the drive, she started slurring her words and I laughed, which made her very upset as she called me a bitch and said why is this funny? I said it’s just humorous when people are drunk and she asked who I’ve seen drunk and accused me of drinking (which I have not been doing). 
We got home and my cat was sitting outside (we let him out as he likes to lay in the bushes in front of my house) and she threw the bucket I gave her to throw up in and it hit him smack dab in the face. I yelled and she said to calm down and that he was fine. I then had to wash my car, leave my windows down and put three air fresheners in to get the smell out. My dad and I spent about 20 minutes cleaning everything up. I did not get to bed until about 11:30. 
It’s 11:45 and I’m fuming. Do I have a right to be upset with her? I understand as she’s my mother and I’m glad she called me instead of driving home, however I’m upset it is a Wednesday night and I told her I had a test tomorrow morning at 8. Her behavior was just unacceptable though. Please, anyone, give me some advice. I love my mother and I want to talk this out with her (however she’s very stubborn and does not like to be in the wrong). I really don’t know what to do. Anything helps.

179,"Ever since i was young i always told off about money, never to spend, always save. I didnt ask for new clothes or pocket money, i didnt eat breakfast or lunch from the age of 12-18 (year 7 to sixth form) to save money. 

I had no idea my parents had as much money as they do (its not a crazy amount but definitely well off). Now my fathers passed away and im basically the man of the house,all i think about everyday is how i can save money and make money. I feel bad to eat (at aged 23) and i have bad memories whenever i think about anything i bought. Even using my laptop to play games i feel like im wasting electricity.

In front of other ppl ive been forcing myself to act normal but deep down i have this prime directive to never increase the financial burden on my house. 

I need help, i cant enjoy anything that costs money. Even using my car i feel like im burning fuel unncessarily. I feel like im becoming my parents/brother who always scolded tf out of me whenever id innocently ask for something. If you imagine a dog who innocently chewed a pillow and their owners (metaphorically) beat the shit out of it, now it wont go anywhere near a pillow, thats how i feel right now. What do i do? I cant enjoy anything i sleep 12 hours a day to avoid waking up and eating. I dont know why im like this, i could write an essay on how fickle the concept of money is and what it means to people (when it shouldnt) but i cant stop feeling this way.

What do i do? I am unemployed (recent graduate) but have secured a job starting next year. Even still i feel so guilty not contributing any money to the house.

184,"tl;dr at the bottom 

I'm 23 (turning 24 next week) and a single mom. I've struggled with depression/PTSD/anxiety since elementary school and while I finally have a therapist that is able to really help me, I feel trapped by my circumstances. 
Last year I had my son, left my increasingly abusive now ex husband, and my bio father died. I moved back to the city my family lives in to get back on my feet, but being in the same home where a lot of my trauma happened is making it hard to do much of anything. Every yell and scream has me in a near constant state of panic. 

Last fall I started to go back to college but my financial aid fell through this summer. I started a new job and had a small savings account for the first time, but had to quit due to covid and my savings is now depleted. My unemployment benefits have been denied with no explanation since April and no one will get back to me, I've reached out to the ESD, DSHS and my district representative with no answers. I drive for ubereats and take my kiddo when I am able to use a car my parents(mother and stepfather) own. I'm hopefully starting a nannying job next week, but the pay is 20/day and adds up to 200/month. I'm thankful for the opportunity, but when rentals in my area are 800 for a studio/1100 for a 1 bedroom/1400 for a 2bedroom, it feels like I'll never be able to make my life better. 

I don't know what to do with my life, I know technically there are jobs I qualify for but my lack of childcare makes most of them impossible (how can I justify working a $14/hr job when my childcare would eat up at least $9/hr?)
I would love to work from home but am at a loss to what I could do that would actually make me enough money and provide me security. Remote call center jobs need a quiet space which I can't provide with a toddler. 

The social services and rental assistance resources in my area are completely tapped out and unable to help other than being able to pay a portion of a deposit to get into a rental. 

I see people struggling in similar ways that open gofundme's and things like that, but I feel like my situation doesn't compare and other people need that support more. 


tl;dr I feel like I will never be able to make my life better, lack of money/resources/support and emotional abuse/trauma triggers are making every day a living nightmare. All I want is to make a better life for myself and my son. 

Is there something I'm missing? How can I get through another day like this?",15Oct2020,1

186,"So I'm a sophomore in college. I've liked this girl who lived on my hall last year for a while now. We're best friends and I absolutely love spending time with her. I had a girlfriend back home when I came here last year and she broke up with me when I came home for Christmas. I felt like I was finally free from what was holding me back in my hometown and she was a tad bit controlling and made me feel bad about myself by accusing me of cheating on her because ""I was gonna tun out like my dad"" and said I wasn't doing enough for the relationship.

We have so much in common like our tastes in music, favorite movies, sense of humor and she loves college football, granted our teams are rivals. Our friends on our floor always called us the boy-girl versions of each other. We've always been there for each other so much in many different ways. She had a boyfriend at a different school last semester and she knew I liked her because I'd told her, but for the longest time we were just friends. He cheated on her and we got together right after that because she had said she felt something between us too. We dated for a week before they sent us home because of the pandemic. For a couple of months we made it work really well and she even invited me to come up and meet her parents. But so much happened in our lives and she felt like it was better if we weren't in a relationship. 

I kept wondering what I could've done better the entire summer and, not proud to admit it, I had a one night stand with a high school friend a couple of weeks after she broke up with me. We kept being friends but were a bit distant. She started dating another guy about a couple of months after she broke up with me. He broke up with her about a week. I still had very strong feelings for her and when I moved back in I went to see her and gave her a note basically saying how I still loved her and I really just wanted to know where I went wrong. She got mad at me for it and we didn't talk for a little over a month, and I found out during that time she showed it to a lot of our friends from the previous year that lived with me. 

I contracted the virus and quarantined at my friend's apartment when one day out of nowhere about 3 or 4 weeks ago she apologized for how she'd been and wanted to be friends. After I had finished isolation we started hanging out again like we did before, making random store trips and watching movies and youtube videos at each other's places. She asked if I saw anything toxic in her, which I didn't and I asked her if she could tell me a reason for what happened, which was I was a little overwhelming but she thought I was a great guy, I just as she said ""put all my eggs in one basket."" We've been hanging out a lot lately and I've forgiven her for being cold towards me because I know she's been through a lot and felt like she unfairly took out the anger on me when she said I didn't deserve it. Out of respect for her I won't say what any of that is. I know girls that want to date me but I just can't because she's just a once in a lifetime person and I know it feels right. 

This past weekend she stayed in my dorm room on Saturday because we were both drunk so we couldn't get her to her place across town. We stayed up until like 4 watching videos and laughing at each other's jokes. She wore my clothes because we both got soaked in the rain and she stayed here until about 5 the next day sleeping in and hanging out. I just remember watching the Falcons game, sitting in my bed with her cuddled up to my pillow beside me and realizing that's exactly what I want. Our friends kept spreading rumors we had sex even though we didn't but it just shows that we know what happened and don't care what everyone thinks.

Being with her makes everything feel like it'll be ok and I bring her some sort of comfort and relief when she needs it most. She can read me like a book and we both know each other so well. Hell just last night she came with me and my old teammate from highschool to the karaoke bar and when I brought my friend back, I took her to her place on the other campus and we just sat there listening to music and she could tell I had something on my mind and she finally got it out of me that I'd been depressed for the past few months because of home issues and I thought I'd lost my best friend in her for a while. She truly cares about me and I could tell because of what she told me that night from her own experiences.

 I felt like I was dating my best friend when we were dating and I want this to work, I just don't ever want to lose her in any way. She's the most incredible person I've ever met and our bond is one that we both feel is very strong. She cares about me and I care about her too. I know I have to work on myself and since then I have a lot. I want to be that same guy that's goofy and trying to make her laugh while being a ear to listen and someone to hug when she needs it most. I've never felt this close to anybody or had this strong of a feeling towards anyone. It feels so right but I know she has to be happy too and that's what I really want.",15Oct2020,1

190,"I suffer from depression and bipolar II disorder. I am currently studying music in college, and I love it. The problem is that my depression gets in the way with my success, and my family life is feeding this depression.

My mom has an extremely short temper. Anything that makes her even a little upset will send her on a swearing spree. She will complain about anything from the laundry not being done to someone giving her attitude. And my dad shares this short temper, but is also close-minded. He tells me constantly that what music I listen to is “not real music” and that I should not be watching the stuff I watch on YouTube. Whenever my mom starts yelling and complaining about something, my dad will almost always tell her to stop yelling and listen to him, but he is yelling himself. Worst of all, my grandma lives next door (has been my entire life) and is very controlling. She tends to feel like everything is about her, and it has only gotten worse with her old age and deteriorating health. She causes a lot of drama between her and my parents to the point that my mom and her got into a huge argument where they called each other huge bitches (my grandma refuses to talk to her to this day), with me literally standing in the middle of it.

This constant battle between my grandmother and my parents (as well as my dad’s stressful work situations that is a completely different story) shortens their tempers even more. I hate hearing these arguments because they make me uncomfortable and depressed, and I recharge by just being alone doing my own thing. However, because I spend a lot of time in my room, my dad forces me to stay in the living room to “spend time with the family”, even when arguments break out. If I even try to retreat to my room at any point, they will demand that I come back. Sometimes, I’ll walk into my room briefly to take my medication, and my dad will ask where I’m going and declare my room as “off limits”.

With all this stress, all I want to do when it’s over for the day is to be completely alone and not be bothered by anyone. I sleep way too often, been cutting off communication, and have been slacking off in school, causing my GPA to go down. This also ticks off my parents. They have accused me of wasting my time and their money by going to school and not passing. They ask why I’m doing so poorly. And when I say that I’m depressed and having trouble concentrating, they tell me basically to stop thinking that way and “get over it”. I know they are trying to support me, but they just do not understand what is going on in my head. And if I even dare mention something that they are doing is causing it, they get extremely defensive and justify what they do or brush off my feelings entirely as a phase.

I hate living here. I’ve considered multiple times to drop out of college because I feel that I can’t pass when I’m this stressed, but I want to finish and get my degree. I am also trying to get a job, but because I am still in school and have little to no experience with anything (even retail), every place I’ve applied to has rejected me (and I have been looking on and off for 4 years). I have no money to move out into my own place. I can’t live with my sister in her trailer because I want to bring my dog with me, and her trailer is too small for her and us to live together (I may be a bit claustrophobic as well \[also, her neighborhood is sketchy\]). I can’t move in with my boyfriend because he also lives with his parents and has not found a job yet (he just finished school). I’m desperate to either find any job and make enough money to get out of here or to find a place to go and get out of here now.

There is so much more to unpack, but I’ll stop here. My depression is only getting worse, and my parents are getting more and more frustrated at my constant lack of interest in everything. I’m trying to pick myself up and stay motivated, but it’s hard when I live in this kind of environment. I’m glad I have my sister and my boyfriend to help me through this, but I do not see them regularly as they live far away. I don’t know what to do anymore.

192,"I’ll never forget the day I told her how I felt. I knew my answer was gonna be no but I took a leap of faith. I’m currently 18 years old and turning 19 in a week. To give you context I started talking to a good friend of my mine in quarantine. The relationship took off. We always talked together. We even hung out a few times with all of our friends together.

It seemed all the signs were put in place. We had been good friends staying up for hours to talk. I gained my feelings for her. I told her how I felt one day in the summer. Like I said earlier I felt everything was right. But boy can I be so wrong. 

I read the dreaded message... she said I’m not ready for a relationship and she loved our friendship too much to squander it. She also had told me that we’d revisit this at a later time. I felt horrible that day. I didn’t even want to leave my bed cause of how upset I was. I went to my friends house and I just sat for 2 to 3 hours and didn’t say a word. All I kept thinking about was the dreadful message.

However she did promise me that our friendship wouldn’t change. She kept her word we hung out at parties together, saw and rooted for each other in our first semester of college. Deep down no matter how much I try to say I forgot about it and moved on.

I even go back to the dreaded message and I felt like it hurt her. She sounded upset letting me down. She apologized to me so many times in those messages. But I can’t get past it.

I want to know what can I do not only for myself to feel better? But also be a good friend to her as she still has been with me? It never feels right to me. It’s almost like she forgot about that conversation. I’m seeking to move forward when my mind is so far behind.",15Oct2020,1

196,"Hi Everyone--

I've been doing a lot of research but haven't found the perfect solution yet. I am a caregiver for my grandmother, she is in her mid 80s and has mild dementia. She lives alone (with almost daily visits from either me or my mother) and has some vision issues. Today she told me she's stopped reading her novels because it hurts her eyes. She LOVES reading, so obviously this bothers me considerably. She did express interest in audiobooks, but doesn't really know how they work. 

I am looking for an audiobook player that is extremely easy to use. Ideally, it would meet the following criteria: 

* Not use screens (not a tablet, kindle, ereader) 
* Does not use headphones 
* Not require frequent charging (either uses regular batteries or only needs charging like 1x a week) 
* Has large, simple buttons 
* Is very affordable ($75 or less) 
* If it uses MP3s, it would need an accompanying app so I can manage audiobooks remotely. 

My thought is a CD player (I've seen the specialty CD player for seniors but it's extremely expensive) but I'm worried she would struggle with the CDs themselves. I was hoping to find maybe a player designed for young children but I've only seen the Yoto that is very expensive and it looks like it only plays the included children's stories. 

I feel like I'm running around in circles, and there must be a simple answer to this problem.

 Any ideas?",15Oct2020,1

198,"My sister [22F] was proposed to by her boyfriend [26M] a few months ago and they finally set a date! They will be married on September 3rd, 2021. 

Our families are a little extra, loud and obnoxious if I’m being completely honest. We’re Italian and they’re all Puerto Rican. Our families, especially our parents take an obnoxious amount of photos regardless of whatever we’re doing to the point where it’s like... the only thing we’ve done is take photos. For example, if we go the beach for 4 hours, our mom will post a photo album of like 300 photos for the one day....... that isn’t an exaggeration. And if their family goes out to eat for example, it’s the same thing... tons of photos. Now here’s where it gets weird. Our mom was abusive to us growing up and sort of does the whole... picture thing for show. There isn’t much sentimentality behind it. She exaggerates online pretty much all the time. And my sister’s husband to be’s family, they’re all really sweet except his PARENTS. His dad is very controlling and obsessive over him and tries to basically have the upper hand and he does not accept boundaries at all and his mother is the same way and she hates my sister so much because she kinda pointed out that some of her fiancé’s parents’ behaviors aren’t okay... like the control and manipulation and all that.

Basically, my sister really wants a traditional, typical wedding in a church... where people are just living in the present and the photographer is the only one taking photos during the service.

Since a date has been picked, while we were out to dinner trying to celebrate their engagement (we didn’t when they first got engaged) my sister made a comment like, “I wanna do a no phone policy.” Her fiancé’s mother instantly snapped and said, “excuse me if I want to take photos of my son getting married, I can.” And her son said, “Mom, we’re hiring a photographer.” And his mother said, “you can tell others to keep their phones away but not me, I’m the mom.” And my sister said something like, “I would rather everyone watch the wedding and be present and I don’t want anyone getting in the way of the photographer.”

Basically his mother freaked out and caused a lot of drama and said that they didn’t need a wedding photographer and that she could take better photos with her phone than a photographer could anyway. I have a feeling she is only behaving this way to annoy my sister. All the normal people in our families are okay with a no phone ceremony and think it’s lovely but the family members with histories of being abusive and controlling are putting a lot of pressure on them when they’re just trying to enjoy themselves and have the wedding they both way.

My sister, her fiancé and I attended another wedding in her fiancé’s family for his sister their mom yelled, “hold it” after they did the, “you may kiss the bride” thing and her own daughter was upset about it because they have a videographer too and it’s in the video unfortunately. Their mother was also running around the lawn during their wedding which was outside trying to take photos during the ceremony and instead of letting her daughter share professional photos, she posted a few hundred photos and tagged like, EVERYONE against her own daughter’s wishes...

My sister doesn’t want anyone who isn’t attending to even see personal photos of the wedding until the professional photos are purchased and posted...

What advice can I give to my sister and my future brother-in-law? Is it too much to request a phoneless ceremony?

TL;DR — My sister and future brother-in-law want a phone free wedding ceremony and our mother is making a big deal about it but his mother is making an even bigger deal about it. They just want to present their wedding to people who don’t attended by showing professional photos, not the day of or even soon after the wedding happens. Our families have a habit of taking way too many photos and really bad photos and posting them and tagging a bunch of people who aren’t even family. What advice can I give my sister? Is it too much to request a phoneless ceremony?",15Oct2020,1
199,"So I moved out my toxic house hold at 19 and I can’t stop crying. 1.) because I never wanted this and 2.) I feel bad. My mom is so caught up in what she thinks love is and it hurts. She deserves so much mire even if she did hurt me. She was my best friend and I don’t hate her. I hate what she’s going though. 

I look at pictures of my siblings and I for awhile just crying. I won’t see them everyday. Wake up to them. Be there for them when they have their night terrors or need help with school work.

200,"So I've been playing with my current DnD group for about a year now, and it's all people I went to school with, but the problem is that four of the players are the kind of people who think the campaign revolves around them and won't let anyone else have a moment. 

For instance, my character finally had a chance to engage with some of her backstory and she didn't get to because the others kept interrupting her or steering the focus back to them instead of just letting me have my one moment. When confronted about it, they say that it's not just for me, but they have had many moments where it's highlighted them and I just wanted *one* for my character. Is that too much to ask? 

My DM said there's not much he can do like fix that because the other players are having fun and that maybe I should just assert myself more. But I'm the only girl in the party and I have called them out on it before, but it isn't working and I'm no longer having any fun because they won't even let me have my turn for downtime or anything. 

I don't necessarily want to leave the group because it's my only campaign and it's people I've known for years, but it's just not fun anymore to just show up and listen not be heard.",15Oct2020,1
201,"I’ve been wanting to shave my head for the past six years now. I’ve been depressed, anxiety ridden, I wanted a way to reclaim myself. Everyday I would wash my hair and throw it into a wet bun. I never wanted to do my hair or makeup or dress up. I jokingly had asked my coworkers yesterday if I should shave my head, and the love and support from all of them and my boss was so overwhelming  I got home and shaved it off and recorded myself doing it, and everyone who has watched the video says they can see when that weight is lifted off my shoulders. 

I feel like me again. I haven’t felt this way in so, so long. My mother and I have an amazing relationship. She has always been very supportive of me. I sent a photo of my accomplishment to our family group chat last night. Now, my mother is not talking to me. She is turning it on herself, saying if I was happier I wouldn’t have done it and I would have been happier if she was a better mother and that I would have (quote) gone down a better path if she has been (unquote). I don’t know what a “better path” to her means. I’m an independent 23 year old woman, who has a degree, just finished designing a successful music education series, lives on her own.... I don’t know what better path there could have been. My mother has never been cruel, sometimes selfish her in her thinking, but never cruel. She was the best mother and role model anyone could have ever had. 

I am furious with her for not giving me support at this huge confidence booster and just honestly life changing moment I’m having. I’m heartbroken that she can’t see how much I needed this, and even if she doesn’t like how it looks, she can’t get past that and just be happy that I am happy. I’m furious she’s turning it into something about her, saying her family will judge her and call her a bad mother, but those people she was worried about all messaged me throughout the day saying they were proud of me, inspired, happy for me. And I’m heartbroken that I don’t have the support of the one person I have always looked up to. This may sound selfish since I have so much other support, I’m trying to work through that. 

I’m just upset, but at the same time, I’ve received so much love and support from everyone else that I don’t want to let her upset me. I’m just...heartbroken and furious. I don’t really know how to get past this.",15Oct2020,1

For a while I would check my email everyday, but everyday I saw the same spam and eventually figured no one would look at my tiny cards anyway, so I stop checking. Just a few hours ago, I decided to check for shits and giggles and found that a woman who is an employee of a sailing company near me saying one of her customers needed their boat cleaned exactly how I was advertising. This email was sent 2 months ago. I, in a state of shock, panic, and regret, sent her a reply email (keep in mind 2 MONTHS after she sent me hers) saying, “Hi! Terribly sorry, I know this is extremely delayed but if you are still in need of detailing I am more than happy to offer my services! You can call me at any time, my number is ###-###-####. Again, sorry for my unprofessional response time, but I am looking forward to hear back from you!” Grammar aside, I realized seconds after sending it that it was awful, and made me look even more unprofessional. While missing out on a customer is okay, I’d rather not have my reputation ruined before I even get my first customer. She also said that the marina she got my contact info from “highly recommended” me. How do I salvage this, or if not make the best of it?

206,"So I recently noticed I had a bump on my arm, it doesn’t hurt at all but sometimes it aches, like I need to lay my arm down and let it rest. (it’s around 2-3cm above my elbow crease on my arm), I told my parents and they think that I need to go to a doctor to get it checked out. I personally think it’s a muscle, when I flex my arm it gets tense and I have a lot of strength in my right arm.. (I only have the bump on my right arm, not left) my parents thought it might be a muscle too but they said it couldn’t be as I don’t do any type of exercise.. I have bad social anxiety and haven’t left my house properly for around 3 years now.  I am extremely overweight aswell.. (although I lost 2 stone from my diet I started a few months ago, but I’m still overweight) The only thing I do is game, I game on my PC so I use keyboard and mouse and I play everyday for 4 hours minimum, I was thinking I gained the muscle from gaming as I move my arm a lot when using my mouse. I went to google and didn’t find anything similar to what my bump looks like. I really don’t want to go to the doctors because of my social anxiety and I don’t like leaving the house, of course if it was an emergency I would..

This seriously pisses me off. I just want to live my life. It’s so embarrassing to have to tell my friends “no I can’t play that with you, my mom doesn’t allow me to download games” or “no I can’t go with you my mom doesn’t want me going out”.

We broke up a few times and every time he would say the same things to me, ""you're toxic"" ""you don't know any better"" ""you're immature"" ""this isn't a matter of want anymore but a need"" and when he did finally end it, end it. It took everything in me not to end my life and it got to the point where I had to be put into the hospital and a week after I got out, he said he needed to block me and didn't because ""you were suicidal"" and blamed it all on me. I was without any contact from him for two whole months, it felt like hell, and then he found one of my other accounts and said he was sorry for blocking me and wanted to be friends. He now said that he reflected on everything and realized that he gave me what he thought was love, which wasn't at all. He made me lose myself when he left me because i told him exactly what i needed from him, before we dated, during our relationship, and again after our relationship. I don't know if i should be his friend because he said he wants to understand now but i don't know if he's being serious or if he's going to hurt me all over again, because I really love and care for him than most other people in my life.

I feel differently about him than any other guy I've been out with... in a good way. I went home for Thanksgiving, and he came up in conversation to my parents. 

I should preface this by saying that I and my family and the guy in question are Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) so getting married quickly is part of the culture. I intend to marry quickly, because I believe that when you know you know. If you have a problem with my religion, please keep it to yourself.

Suddenly with my parents thinking about it too, and fueling my imagination, I found myself daydreaming a little too much, and projecting the traits of the perfect man onto this guy that I really don't know that well.

Angela texted me the other day saying we should prank Jason and I happily agreed without saying anything else.

Mine is kinda selfharm. more specifically it's like those articles trying to comfort people who's Family/friends selfharm, people talking about how others sh effected them or when people ask me if I sh.

They don't know about my past with selfharm and I would like to keep it that way. I don't want to say I'm triggered by sh in general, Bc I'm not. I know some of them have and maybe still do sh so I really need them to be able to talk to me about it if they need someone.

Yself or share any details of my life around her so im always anxious and cautious. I've tried to distance myself with the last distance being april to october. I had a 5 min conversation with her about how im doing well...getting my toes done...and about to be debt free. She works with my friend and went to my friend and other coworkers to talk shit about me. It sounds like she was flailing  hateful emotions because it started with her stating that I cannot afford to get my toes done and escalated so that at one point during the shit talking she downgraded and disregarded my childhood trauma.. for which she wasnt in the home for a huge chunk of.. she was merely calling me a liar and stating that her trauma was far worse. Ive had over 10 years of therapy to deal with my ptsd ocd and anxiety.I have not shared much of this trauma info with my sister because again... shes toxic and not a good person.

I’m F14 and that isn’t really crucial to the story other than I’m a minor and I am not allowed to get a job because I’m not old enough.

However, I have been wanting to go to Vidcon for a while. However, I feel bad since I already drag my parents to one convention every year since 2018. (Anime expo). Vidcon is in the same building, just a month sooner, and really expensive!! 
I feel bad not only dragging my parents to an event that they won’t find any enjoyment in because I’m a nerd- but also because it is a whole lot of money.

I’ve been thinking about it realistically and created a whole plan for money wise.

Basically, I would like to meet Thomas Sanders and give him a project I’ve had in the works since last year of November.
I’m making tarot cards. Since COVID pushed the con back I have had time to really think about my ideas and put them like so:

Thomas Sanders has gotten pretty popular recently so I am pretty confident I will probably be kicked out of line with all of the fans coming to meet him and there being a capacity and yada yada.
I would prepare about 50 to 100 for the meet because I know it costs money to take pictures with someone. However, if we get kicked out of line I will have to wait until the next bit of meet and greets which would be tomorrow, meaning I would have to rent a room in the hotel across the street. Nights there usually go for 350 or so but since it is con season I think it will be up in 400-600 dollars for a one night stay. 
Then to take in food: probably safe to say 200 dollars.
Food probably isn’t going to cost that much and neither is taking a photo so whatever I have left I can spend on the con floor or to get into a panel.

So with all of that, it is estimated it would be 1000 dollars or so.
Holy shit.

It would be a lot easier for me if I had a job. If I was working minimum wage (it’s 15 dollars here in California) and worked a certain amount of time each week I would meet the goal pretty quickly if I saved up.
But- I’m a minor and can’t get a job. By the time I’m allowed to, I’ll be 16 or so.  I don’t want to use my parent’s money because, like I said, I feel bad dragging them to conventions so I figured it would be smart for me to do it. And to be nice :)

I do art but I’m not nearly confident in my abilities to open up commissions (maybe in the future if I get better). I have a Redbubble but haven’t sold much.
But I will probably get some money for my birthday and Christmas so maybe that will help me out a little?

I don’t know. I hope so. Does anyone have any ideas? I sound like a spoiled brat- I’m really sorry.
It’s been my goal to meet Thomas for a while now and I’m just hoping that it will make me feel a bit better knowing that /I/ took care of the expenses this trip and that I actually accomplished something cool.",15Oct2020,1
227,"Hi all, I am a female that works in dairy at my local supermarket. Today I was stocking eggs, there were none on the shelf and I just put them on the shelf without hesitation. My department manager comes and sees me stocking and looks at the eggs and clenched his jaw and made two fists and seriously was cursing to himself. And then raged at me saying I didn’t check the dates meanwhile all the eggs had the same expiration date as they all came from the same boxes and there were no other eggs prior to me stocking them.. I am scared to even go to work tomorrow knowing that he will be there. The entire store knows he has crazy anger issues. I’m OCD when it comes to the cooler being neat and organized and I understand his frustration when people don’t clean up after themselves such as not throwing away their cardboard and leaving it in the cooler but he seriously gets angry and rages constantly even over the smallest inconvenience and wonders why he gets no help and he has to do most of the work when there’s literally only me and one other person besides him. The store managers don’t do anything because he’s a control freak to the point that he will not let me just do my job without interfering and then says “you know what let me just do it” and then runs to a store manager saying I don’t do anything and says I’m screwing around and that I make a mess.

235,"In a love triangle(Ish) not sure how to handle this? (26M)(26F)(26M)

In a love triangle(ish) not sure how to handle it?

So I want to keep this brief so I will skip a lot of the details. Basically I have a friend (Allie) we’ve known each other for awhile but weren’t very close. I’ve got a crush on her and have been trying to get to know her better the last few months. We have a mutual friend (Alex) that also has a crush on her! Recently the three of us have been spending a lot of time together almost every weekend the last 2 months. 

But I’m starting to feel weird because everyone of our friends and family, even Alex,  believes that Allie has a crush on me too. Nobody actually knows that I like her back (I am an emotionally dense guy🤦🏾‍♂️). Alex admitted to her that he likes and asked her out and she told him “I have to get to know you better first”. But this entire situation makes me feel awkward hanging out with them even though we have fun.

What I want to do is just clear the air with Allie and FaceTime her tomorrow and tell her how I’m feeling and see what she says. I kind of feel bad for putting her on the spot though. But I think it’s the only way I can feel normal about. If she reciprocates I can talk to Alex and he’ll be okay, if no then I can get over it and move on. Anybody have a more mature option? Haha

246,"Not actually sure if this is considered drama or whatever, but at my old school from about two years ago I made this one friend. He was like slightly my friend, but we didn’t talk or hang out often. It felt like every time I would finally make an actual good friend, he would automatically think they were his friend too which always bothered me but I would never really show it. At first I had this one friend, Sofia, who was my best friend but our friendship only lasted about a year until she decided we both should find new friends. He thought he was her friend about two weeks after we became friends. I thought it was probably coincidence until the moment he said he wasn’t her friend anymore soon after I wasn’t. About three months after me being alone I found a new friend who is still currently my best friend, Saniyya. After I became her friend this same boy became her friend. It bothered me knowing that he was just stealing all my friends I went through a lot of pain and effort to make. I kept in the pain and just smiled. They slowly began to bond and it was beginning to feel more and more like I was being left out. Half the time I would find my self constantly repeating myself for my voice to even be noticed. I recently moved to the other side of the country from them and me and the boy are FaceTiming all the time. Even more recently I’ve been feeling almost like the third wheel. They’ll talk about stuff I don’t really know about in our group calls and often forget I’m there. Every time the boy leaves, Saniyya instantly privately calls him to see what the matter is, every time I leave, they never care or acknowledge it. I’ve tried talking to them about how I feel before and they just deny it. I made a private Minecraft world with Saniyya as a way to spend some time with just her which she recently added the boy to. The game Minecraft world I was doing with just the boy, he added Saniyya to. They seem to bond pretty well but I feel like the boy is the main problem. They’re basically my only friends and I think they’re both amazing so I don’t wanna just unfriend them, but I feel like I can’t keep being in a friendship like this. Even the birthday gift I got Saniyya the boy keeps insisting I say is from him too because he helped me find out what she wanted although I was already planning on getting it for her.

248,"Hello,

My mom, a 55 year old woman who smokes and performs next to no physical activity has been complaining of tiredness and difficulty breathing. 

I took her to the GP, who referred her to a cardiologist and she went to those appointments with my dad. She failed her Cardiac stress test and her doctor doubled the dosage on her heart medication. My dad began inquiring about getting stents placed in her, and the doctor said she would need to do an angiography before they can determine how many stents she would need. 

The problem is, her insurance isn't covering her angiograph tests and because of that we can't proceed any further. My dad is in a tight situation moneywise, and my mom doesn't want to burden him with that. The reason it's like this is because they were on the verge of a divorce in July but got back together because she couldn't go through with it. 

Anyways, we can't afford the angiography right now, and I keep telling her to find another insurance or find someone who can fund her angiography but she refuses to do so. 

We live in Dubai in case it helps. I'm very new to insurance and how it works and I need some advice on what to do. I'm lowkey panicking because a friend of mine lost their parent to a heart attack recently.",15Oct2020,1

250,"context: im a teenage girl (17) and I have an immigrant family

first thing, im very bad at showing affection, its just i was raised. i cant go up to her and tell her i love u and stuff because i just feel so uncomfrotable, but idk other ways to show.

so basically we keep on getting into fights over small things which usually lead up to the notion that i am rude and disrespectful to her (my moms view) and that she doesnt try to understand how i feel or ever understand her mistakes (my view)

an exmaple of a fight that happened today:

I have a lot of homework to do and an app i need to complete for a competition. my mom was telling me to sit with our family but im telling her I dont have time right now. shes like ok, just show us ur project. so I show them the app im developing which ive put a lot of work into. it just irritates me because as soon as I show it my mom criticizes the colors, how it looks, she says she cant read anything because its too small, she says she doesnt understand the purpose of my app, etc. like im used to this bc she usually doesn't compliment me until after I receive an award for it or smth, but idk if im asking for a lot but I just wish she could be more positive. then she rudely (in my opinion) told me something about my project, I got mad. basically I mimicked her gestures and her tone to show her what it felt like. then she got SO MAD, she stormed out and went to her room. I followed her bc I want her to understand my perspective which she doesnt listen to. then she starts yelling at the top of her voice (shes has a temper so I get it but she was being extremely loud and it scared me) and saying that shes the worst mother that everyone in our family hates her, she wants to leave us and go, no one appreciates her, no one sees what all shes done for us, I am narrow minded and always have a negative opinion of her, etc. then basically an argument ensues. im trying to explain to her that I want her to just be a little bit nicer to me, compliment me first before giving feedback, I dont like how she always criticizes me. (dont get me wrong she encourages me a lot to pursue my passions and stuff its just when I show her stuff, bring up my political views (shes conservative), tell her about my opinions on life, she just treats me like im an immature idiot). she just doesnt udnetsand and she keeps on going on about how she has sacrificed so much for me, she encourages me so much, and then every argument she goes on to list the sacrifices she has made for me since I was like 5. like, I feel like this is guilt tripping me?? like I just want her to be considerate of my feelings but she makes it seem like im accusing her of being the worst mom ever despite everything she has done for me. and then she slaps me and flicks me on the head and shit which makes me rly mad bc it just feels so shitty. shes like do u want me to be all ""honey honey"" with u in a mocking tone. im just like u dont have to sugar coat things but she can give me a balance of both and acknowledge my efforts at least. she just doesnt get it though and I honestly dont know whos in the wrong because she tells me that im ungrateful and im disrespectful (I do admit I kinda am when we're arguing, I treat her more as a debate opponent then my mom). what rly hurt me today was that she said ""ur only personality trait is hating ur mom and kissing up to ur friends"". like....first she knows nothing about my personality bc Im never myself around her bc I know she will say something mean to me that will bring down my confidence. (like when I told her im rly passionate about climate change she tells me that I need to sit down and focus on getting into college because im not some great person thats going to make a difference) I honestly feel like shes the narrow minded one because she keeps on talking about how I take every chance I get to hate on her and be rude to her when I dont rly...and yk we argued for an hour until my dad separated us and the thing I hate the most is when my mom goes on rants after an argument and says everything she thinks out loud on purpose.

\- she goes on about how everyone in this family hates her

\- she literally makes up scenarios (out loud) where I do something bad to her and then she victimizes herself like??? if this is what she thinks of no wonder she always sees me as hating her and being rude

\- shes like ""god kill me, I hope I die, take me away my kids will be very happy,"" yk that stuff

\- calls me weak for crying easily and says stuff about how my friends dont even like me I just chase around after them

\- then she like starts hitting herself??like idk what to do she just keeps slamming her head with her hand loudly

I really dont know what to think bc on one hand she says she is suicidal and nearing on the edge and it makes me cry sm but then I feel like shes saying that to guilt trip me or smth but I feel like if I think that im a shitty person. I feel like she makes herself the victim a lot but I dont know honestly I dont know if im a horrible person for thinking shes victimizing herself and that im actually a terrible daughter or in reality my feelings are valid 

and she rly is an amazing mom bc she cares about me a lot and takes interest in what im doing and in my future which a lot of my friends' moms dont. shes very overprotective too but I guess thats a good thing

this was rly long but it kinda helped writing it all out lmao but if someone could pls give advice

254,"Story #1: I just moved to a new city and things were going really well for a while. I met a guy I really liked and we went on a few dates. We got to a point where we were comfortable with each other, both had established that we liked each other, wanted to keep seeing each other, etc. Then one week leading up to a date he stops responding to me, just leaving all my messages on read. Finally he responds to confirm our date. However, he doesn’t show up, and when I message him asking what happened, he reads the message but doesn’t respond. I message him saying I was really hurt that he stood me up and asking why he isn’t responding to me. Again he reads it and doesn’t respond. A few days later he blocks me. I get no closure and no explanation. 


Story #2: I was hired for a job last week and had my first day this week on Monday. The people loved me in the interview, and I was exited to have a job in my new city. It seemed to be going well, there were no obvious issues, no complaints or warnings from the people training me. About three hours into my shift, I forgot one of my papers in the car over to the job site. My boss told me it was no big deal, but that I since needed my sheet to do the job, I wouldn’t be able to work today and should go home early and come back for my shift tomorrow to complete training. I felt weird about this so made sure to confirm multiple times that I wasn’t in trouble and it was no big deal, and they reaffirmed with me that it was totally fine and to come back tomorrow ready to go. Today, an hour before my shift, I got a call saying not to come in, that I have been let go and that they’ve decided I’m not a good fit for the job. When I asked for a reason they refused to give one, other than that I’m “not a good fit”. After pushing a little, they brought up that I’d forgotten my paper in the car. When I reminded them that I’d been told it wasn’t a problem, they said “well, there’s other reasons too,” but when I asked what those reasons were they refused to answer. Everything was vague and the answers given kept changing, and then they hastily and angrily hung up on me, saying they were busy, couldn’t talk, and that I should call HR if I had anymore questions. I I thought seemed fishy for them to deem me “unfit” after only a few hours of working and then refuse to give a concrete reason why. I have a disability but it doesn’t impair my ability to do the job in question. I called and emailed HR asking for an explanation—no response. It seems highly unusual to dismiss someone from a job during the first shift, not tell them that they’ve been dismissed until the next day an hour before their shift, and fail to provide any documented reason behind the termination. 

I have no explanation and no closure on why either of these two things happened. This has destroyed me to my core because I’ve just moved out on my own and away from my parents. I am on my own in a new city with no friends or family. I had two things I was clinging to that gave me hope for my new chapter: the guy I was seeing and the job I got hired for. Then, all at once, it is pulled away without warning or reason. 

I feel like I am being tricked or the world is playing mind games with me. Something happens that seems to be good, and then it turns out everything was an illusion or a trick and it gets erased without any explanation why. As if it never happened in the first place. I am feeling extremely depressed. I don’t know what I can trust anymore. I don’t think I can feel safe getting happy or excited about something, because the last few times I did, the thing making me happy randomly and confusingly ended up being a lie or a figment of my imagination. It is disorienting and makes me feel like I’m going crazy, like anything good in my life could be taken away with no reasoning or explanation, without me understanding what happened, without a logical reason “why.” 

Imagine you woke up one morning and the sky was suddenly orange for no reason. And then anytime you walked up to someone to ask “why is the sky orange?” they just pretended like they didn’t hear you.  That’s how I’m feeling right now, and it is so lonely and confusing.",15Oct2020,1

I don’t feel that fire since he broke up with me the first time. I really can’t help it though. I’ve also lost a lot of weight and get lots of attention from men now. I know I can get whoever I want, but I also know I’m drawn to assholes who don’t treat me well because I find comfort in chaos and he is very sweet.

258,"Hey guys, it's my first time posting here, so please excuse me if it's irrelevant.

So I am an 18yr old Male and I have a 16yr old sister. So my sister has always hated me since childhood, she never shared stuff with me and always shunned me out of her topics and life. However since the last year, she has started sharing more abt her life, like her boyfriend, breakups and etc.

Now I am happy that she has started, but recently she has been doing alot of stuff that even I havent done, like sneaking out at nights and meeting a friend(who she says that isnt her boyfriend). I was fine with the meeting stuff, but today morning I saw a hickey on her neck and I asked her abt it and she surprisingly told me that it was from the same guy she used to meet. And from snapstreaks I have got to know that she has gone with him to small hillstations 30 minutes away from the place we live.

Now I am confused, as an elder brother I am scared of her doing something stupid with that guy, I dont want her life to be spoiled, but at the same time I dont want to rat her out as she has recently started trusting and me and atleast tells me stuff. She says that shenundertand boundaries and would never do something stupid, but I am still unsure as she has moved onto hickeys from meeting really soon.

So please tell me, shall I talk to our parents about it or what?.

Please excuse my typing and grammatical errors as I am a bit shaken up .",15Oct2020,1
259,"I'm in my 30s, for crying out loud - this is pathetic. I know. I'm looking for a way out of it, please help.

Trying to keep this short. I had friends in highschool but did get bullied for a bit (for my appearance, my boys) and never managed to 'get a boyfriend' during my teens (I tried - the ones I liked never liked me - that aside, though). I've always just accepted that I'm average at best and that that's okay. All-round average. Average-looking; smart but not outstandingly, nice company but nothing special. That was always okay with me. Never had an issue with it. Am happily married, have had amazing experiences in my life so far, and have a good life. 

I work in a corporate job. A couple of years ago someone there saw something in me (in terms of potential) and started training me up for a leadership role. A year ago I got that role and it pushed me out of my shell. When you're in charge of a team, you can't afford to wither in a corner in your own little world. You have to interact with everyone. Everyone's perception of you matters (whether it's a true or fair perception - regardless). I found myself suddenly having to interact with everyone and constantly take on challenges. I was sure I was going to be horrible at it, but figured why not try. 

It's been a little bit of a ride in the best way. With of course always exceptions - but not common ones - management praises me into the high heavens for the work I do as a leader for the team, and the team seems to really, really like me - they trust me, they come to me with anything, they go out of their way for me (as I do for them). It's boosted my ego a little. Maybe I am a little special. Just a little. Increased interactions have also come with the occasional compliment towards my presentation/appearance. I've started to believe maybe I'm a solid-average, not ""at best"" average. 

Now I hate to admit this, because it's *shameful*. If you had told me 5 years ago I would have these thoughts, I would scowl at myself. But I'm not me-5-years-ago, I'm me-now. And I'm being brutally honest because I want to stop these reflexes before they become second nature. 

I find myself feeling extremely threatened by other women in the workplace that I haven't ""worked out"" (i.e. I don't know if they're going to compete with me yet). We're currently going through the process of hiring new staff - they are female, and I am absolutely shitting myself. What if they are smarter than me. What if they are nicer than me. What if people like them better. What if they show up at the interview and I realize they're 1000x prettier than me and I'll go back to feeling ""at best average"". I can *see* the connection (I used to have nothing to lose, ego-wise, now I do and I need to build self-esteem beyond this achievement - but how??) but I just can't click it into a place where I don't feel hostile towards other women coming into the workplace. I should be guiding them, training them, building them up... not sizing them up. Anyone have any insight? Please be kind... this has been hard to admit and I want to be better.",15Oct2020,1
260,"I sublease from a couple with 2 others. The couple however is an abusive relationship. The male who I will call sam is mentally abusing the female who i will call meg.

Both of them have been really kind to me and have helped me in a great time of need. I feel indebted to both of them. Sam however controls meg. He makes her do whatever he says. If she tries to say no he will yell at her, if that doesn't work hell threaten to commit suicide. He will do anything to get his way.

I'm mostly concerned because meg comes to me often to vent and says things like, ""I feel like I'm being abused but I'm not sure"" ""he's been controlling me"". Shes been telling me that she wants couples therapy but sam claims that therapist are hacks.

Just now she was trying to help him with something but she was taking awhile so he starts trying to rush her and snap fingers at her like of she was a dog. She told him to stop doing that then he threatened suicide because she wanted space. She then made a straight line to me sitting in my truck, where he followed her and yelled til meg yielded.  During the fight meg asked me to chime in a few times. I've witnessed a bunch of incidents like this and years stories of more from meg.

261,"My fiancé and I have been dating for a while now, and the main issue is how much time he spends gaming. He usually spends 4-5 hours gaming a day with his buddies and hardly spends any quality time with me. We live together and the only time we spend together is after we wake up and have breakfast together. He’s currently unemployed (have been for the past couple months) so I go to work and during that time and after he will be sat at his desk playing his games for another 2-3 hours before settling for bed. He usually has his “days off” from his games 2 times a week.

I’ve tried talking to him before about how I feel unappreciated, unloved, and get no attention when he plays his games. I’m trying to be vulnerable to him when we have conversations that revolve around his game usage, but it usually doesn’t end well. I told him one that his overusage of video games might end up being a deal-breaker for me and he said it might end up being a deal-breaker for him too (if i didn’t comply with his addiction?). We have several arguments a month about it and I always try to tell him how I feel but nothing seems to get through to him.

What can I do to have him tone down his usage? I’m not trying to restrict or conform him to what I want him to do, but I just want him to understand how I feel. What should I do?",15Oct2020,1
262,"I can’t post in relationship advice because I know that I will get judged. Please give me the benefit of the doubt and don’t just say I’m a shitty person. 

Okay so I(19F) have never had any romantic interaction whatsoever. I’m really shy and I’ve always stayed away from anything romance/sex to focus on school. Well, now we’re locked in at home and ever since then, I’ve been going crazy. I got horny as hell and when I posted in a forum, I got a message from an older married man on reddit. Against my better judgement, I replied. We went back and forth and had really Nsfw conversations. I felt guilty and he confined he really was married and it wasn’t a kink and his wife didn’t know what he’s up to. I ended it because it was the right thing to do and blocked him then deleted my account. 

Well, today, I caved into my desires and messaged this guy again using a new account. I know how bad I am and I only did this because we also talked about other things than sex and he felt nice to me. Hes the only person that i’m comfortable talking about sex with. We chatted for hours and he said that he was hurt that I blocked and deleted my account and at one point in our convo, said that he loved me. I’m shook because we’ve been talking for 3-4 days tops. I don’t love him and we also have very different politics. He started talking about sending pics and stuff and I got a bit freaked out. We again sent nsfw texts for the night and then he left for bed. After this, I know I made the wrong decision by texting him up again. I don’t feel sexy chatting him anymore and I want to stop for real now but now I’m scared. 

I’m scared that I’m gonna really hurt him and I’m also scared that he might find out who I am and hurt me (reddit chat is fully anonymous right). I didn’t give him any personally identifying info besides how I looked (height, weight, body type, ethnicity, hair color). But so many other girls have the same of this right? 

I know I made a mistake but I’m young and inexperienced and I don’t have anyone to advice me or show me the way. How do I end this? Is it just safe to block him and delete my account? Should I send him a parting message?",15Oct2020,1

Here's the problem though. Since I still live in the same crappy town that I was born in, it's extremely likely I'll be recognized by at least some of the people who I went to school with. I'm terrified of this because I had a few traumatic and embarrassing things happen to me while I was in high school and I just want to be forgotten about, but if I run to people, they'll notice me and remember me for that shit. I'm also afraid that seeing those people again will take me back to that awful time in my life and ""reopen old wounds"" so to speak.

267,"I am 25 years old software engineer. Recently I realized that I have no hobby except my job. I spend my free time playing videogames or drinking alcohol with my friends (all of them are working at tech as well). For the last couple of months I've been thinking a lot about what am I doing with my life. So I made a conclusion that I need something meaningful to do instead of spending my life on games and alcohol.

There is only one thing that I like except tech stuff. And that is drawing, but unlike programming, I'm zero skilled on that. So I made a little research, found some tutorials on udemy and decided which graphic tablet to buy. I'm eager to spend time and money if there is a chance to become a decent artist.

But the point is that I don't want to just learn drawing, I want to become very good at that. And that is where my concern comes from. I'm already 25, not 10, not even 15. Do I still have a chance to become a decent artist or is it too late at my age?

And also do you need a talent to become very good at that or is it just a skill? For instance programming is just a skill, everyone can become good at that if given enough time and effort. Drawing is a different story in my opinion, but I may and want to be wrong.

270,"I'm 25, male, living on my own in a room.

Five years ago, when I was 20, I stopped working full-time in order to go back to school. I loved working full-time, even brutal labor in 100 degree heat for 45 hours per week. But I cut my hours and re-enrolled because of pressure from my mom.

It's been a real struggle. I have an IQ of &gt;130 and am very passionate about engineering, but at my university, I've failed just as many classes as I've passed, even taking only 2-3 per semester. Since then I've also been fired from both a job and an engineering internship due to what I think is depression.

Whenever I am in school, I feel ""chained"" to it 24/7. I think about everything else I do (work, playing guitar, etc.) based on whether I've done enough studying to engage in it.

This semester, I've struggled to get out of bed by 9 to log into my physics class. Most of my schoolwork consists of me frantically attempting to do every assignment at the last minute and falling flat on my face. I planned to only work on weekends (I can work whenever I want and can control my own schedule) so that I'd have more time for school.

But a few days ago, I was having a rough time. I was so fidgety and agitated by just BEING in class and I needed to get out. I couldn't stand it another second. After my last class got out at 4:20, I didn't attempt to study as usual. I just said ""fuck it"" and decided to work for the rest of the day instead, and I made $100 in a very short amount of time.

I have probably studied for only an hour since then. Aside from sparsely attending class, I have been working every day, making a TON of money, and it feels amazing to be so productive. It's like an angel came down and just breathed life into me. I feel so free now, even though I'm working a lot more lol.

My dream of getting a used Lexus actually seems like a reality now. I can now work on my YouTube channel whenever I'm not working, and play video games guilt-free in my downtime. But it's coming at the expense of my school career rotting away right before my eyes. My mom is going to be absolutely FURIOUS when she finds out about this, and my dad will feel the same way.

Before you tell me to quit school, I want to say that I do want to become an engineer if possible, and I have invested a lot in it. But I don't know. Maybe I'm just venting.",15Oct2020,1
271,"Let me start off by saying I don't think the flair is correct, never thought I would come here for anything. Also, Important details:

Myself: A 18 year old male.

T/My Brother: A 21 year old male.

I originally posted something on Ifunny as I was waiting outside of my house and down the street but now that I am back at my house I wanted to ask reddit since there are more people here, so story time.

I was woken up around 7:00 PM Arizona time by my older brother, let's call him T. So T wakes me up and tells me to go downstairs to decide on dinner, we both go down there and I sit down on the couch and T starts screaming at my mother (who recently broke her tibia or fibula/ankle) about how the house is a mess (It's not, we just have lots of plates in the sink) and screams at us.

This goes on for about 35 minutes before he turns to me and cusses at me. I in response say back ""Fuck you"" and he promptly storms over screaming ""what the fuck did you say?"" and throws a punch, landing right above my ear on my left side. I grab his collar and put my foot on his chest to keep him at bay as he tried to throw another punch but missed and pulls back, ripping his own collar. T then rips off his own shirt and stances up to me and I in return, now on my feet as I was sitting down, have my arms up in self defense.

My mother is screaming at him to stop and he back up after trying to get me to swing at him so he can hit me back, I don't swing at him. He then starts to walk towards my mother in the kitchen and grabs a hydro flask and pretends to throw it at me, I naturally lift my arms and legs to protect my head, neck, chest, etc and he then calls me a ""little bitch."" T then says to my mother, ""I'm going to beat him if he doesn't pay for my shirt.""

Now before I go on I should mention that this has happened before, he has assaulted me once, my mother once, and my father once. He punched my father to the ground and punched my mother hard enough on her arm that it left a 3 by 4 in bruise. These events happened on different days but he has punched holes into the wall, kicked holes into the wall and recently was drunk driving but didn't get caught. Now back to the story.

I am cool headed even after getting hit decently hard and I calm down a little more and say, ""You just assaulted me."" T says back, ""You shouldn't be talking shit."" I respond with, ""says you, you've been cussing at us for the last 35 minutes."" Now by this point my mother is crying as T continues to cuss at us saying things along the lines of, ""You have no friends, no life"" Trying his hardest to upset us which doesn't get to me but gets to my mother. A few more minutes go by and it's now mostly a back and forth of, ""You assaulted me, I can call the police."" and ""So what, you talked shit."" Now this is where things start to heat up.

After the fourth or fifth time I say ""I can call the police."" he says and I quote, ""Then I'll kill you. You call the police and I kill you."" Now my mother is screaming at him to stop and shut up and I was a little shocked for the moment, we've had our tough times but not to the point of saying he'll kill me, but wait it's not over yet.

Now I fucked up on this next part, I wanted to try to get him on camera (audio mostly) of him saying he was going to kill me, but in the process of trying to turn my sound off (so I can press record without the sound notification) I accidently took a picture and this triggered his fight or flight response, naturally as throughout this night, he decided to fight. He storms over to me and demands I show him the picture I took, it was only of the ground so I did, well, he then tried to grab my phone, even with only one hand on my phone and he had two on it he didn't have a good hold of it, so I asked him over and over, still in a calm voice, ""let go of my phone, let go of my phone please."" until he stopped because he couldn't get it out of my hand. He was about 6 inches to a foot away from me.

However, my mother, during this whole thing, moved over closer to us and was now about 5-8 feet to my left. (I was basically stuck in a corner between two couches) T, after failing to disarm me of my phone, walks over to my mom and before anything happens I say, ""you touch her and I'm calling the police."" So now instead of being in front of my mother he is an inch away from my face screaming over and over, ""Call the fucking police, do it. Call the police.""

Now by this point my legs are fucking shaking like crazy but I am trying my best not to me intimidated by him but like, my legs were shaking so fucking much. I then, through his spewing of, ""Do it pussy, no balls."" ask him, ""why? Do you really want to throw away your life by going to jail."" (A little back story before this next part, he is currently a med student, and to get into any hospitals or clinics near us you CAN NOT have a police report against you. Like at all.) So I then say, ""Even if you don't go to jail after (after the 24 hour mandatory lock up for any domestic assaults) you'll never find work, do you really want that?"" T then starts to screaming, ""Don't fucking threaten me!""

Now this is where another assault comes in, at least I think it is. He is still complaining about his shirt which isn't even the bad, he walks over to the coffee table which he put it on and holds it up to my mom. ""He's paying for this or I'll fucking kill him. You know what?"" [He then stomps over to me and grabs my collar ripping my shirt right down the middle, about 9-12 inches](https://imgur.com/QyHC8PB) and for some reason, even though my legs were shaking, I didn't blink, I didn't flinch, just stared at him, fisted clenching and unclenching of course.

Now my mother is screaming even louder, ""Get the fuck out of my house! Get out!"" He walks over to her and is screaming again and within the 2 seconds it took for him to walk over there I already wiped out my phone and dialed 91 into it, hovering over the 1. ""Don't you fucking touch her."" T backs up, behind the coffee table as I am staring at him with my phone at the ready. He continues to urge me on, ""Do it, call the police."" and this is where it gets even worse. I respond, ""it takes 3 minutes for the firemen and police to respond."" He then says, ""You'll be dead by then."" I wanting to get a little more out of him ask, ""With what? Your hands."" and of course he responded, ""I'll beat you to death before they get here.""

Holy fuck, was the only thing going through my mind. I responded back, ""I can fight you off for 3 minutes, and they'll be 3 outcomes of it. You kill me and then get shot yourself, you don't kill me and are arrested or shot, or you don't do anything and wait until the police arrive. What will it be?"" Now after saying this I was fully prepared to fight my own brother to death but he is, at his core, a big fucking baby. He got up in my face again, less than an inch now as we are staring each other down and he continues to say, ""call them and you'll be dead.""

He sees I don't flinch or back off so he backs off after I continue to ask, ""is this really what you want?"" and he doesn't answer me and starts to scream at my mom. Now this is what sucks the most out of everything so far, he says and again, I quote, ""I'm going to kill him in his sleep.""

""Bruh, what the fuck."" was the only thing I said to him and he responds, ""I will, I'll kill you in your sleep."" Now my mother this entire time has been screaming at him to back away from me and leave me alone during this whole thing as he swung and assaulted me first, but at the best? possible timing my dad calls me mom and she tells him what's going on, leaving out the parts where he said he was going to kill me and how he assaulted me again.

She then hands the phone to T and my dad talks with him. Didn't make things better but he basically lied and said I kicked him in his face while grabbing his collar while standing up which, uhh, doesn't make sense you idiot. He could've came up with anything else but decided to tell the least believable story ever. Now this is where even more bullshit happens. My brother hands the phone back to my mom and continues to glare into my soul and get a load of this bullshit, my dad tells my mom to tell me to get out of the house for the timing being.

WHAT THE FUCK was the only thing running through my mind. Literally the worst decision ever in that situation. So my brother backs up even more and I finally get out of the corner and over to my mom, I ask her, ""are you sure about this?"" while eyeing my brother who is still staring at me. She says, ""yeah it's fine, go change shirts and head up to where dad is."" (My dad and little sister were at a soccer practice.) So I rush upstairs grab a shirt, lock my door, and rush back downstairs, luckily nothing happened.

While putting on my shoes, still ready for another assault by T, I grab my car keys and ask again to my mother, ""are you SURE about this?"" She again says ""yes"" and I go outside, but slowly to see if anything happens right away. Nothing did. However, I get in my car and drive down the street and shut off my car and walk back to the door to be sure nothing happens. About 20 minutes go by and nothing happens, I have a perfect view of my mother sitting in her chair but I can't see T which I was a bit worried about. After a few more minutes my dad calls me and asks what's going on and get even more of this bullshit, he asks if I PROVOKED HIM OR HIT FIRST. Clearly he believed what my brother said on the phone. Insane I know, even after my dad learned T said he was going to kill me.

So I get my dad to call me mom again and I decide to move my car from near our house to down to the west side all the way at the end of the cul-de-sac, I shut off my car and have a perfect view of the front yard and of T's car, my dad said he'll tell my mom to make him go somewhere else, this never happened. So I am sitting out in the heat, it's still like 75-80 degrees outside, (didn't want him to see my headlights or inside lights) and I am posting live updates on my Ifunny. However, I get a call from my dad and he accuses me of starting the fight and to NOT get the police involved as it would cause a and I quote, ""world of shit, not only for you but more everyone."" Glad to see he cares that I was assaulted and threated to me bludgeoned to death.

After a few more minutes of waiting outside I see my dads car pull in and he calls me, telling me to, ""come back to the house."" I start up my car and my brother is STILL IN THE HOUSE. I had a clear view of the house but it was still dark as fuck and couldn't see all that well.

So I park the car in the garage and walk inside, I slowly check around the corners to make sure I don't get fucking jumped and my brother is not downstairs from what I can see. My little sister is already talking to my mother and my dad shuts and locks the door behind us. Now time for some even more bullshit. My brother is not only still allowed to stay in the house tonight but got off the hook, at least with my parents, scot-free. My dad doesn't even asks my side of the story and my mother doesn't want to talk about either.

So here we are, the whole story. But here's the thing. He is still here and just a few feet away (about 40-50 feet) across the hall. He literally said he is going to kill me in my sleep and if I call the police he will try to kill me as well. My parents (my dad mostly) will not do anything and my mother can't do anything as she is torn between \*This is still my kid and \*This is also still my kid.

What the fuck do I even do in this situation? I have a single screwdriver as a defense weapon which I used to unlock my door.

Edit 1: He apparently, as I was writing this, was picked up by a friend and is NOT staying here tonight. That's a semi-relief.",15Oct2020,1

275,"I’m an 18 year old girl in the US. (I don’t have my own car yet so my mom lets me use hers sometimes.) I was just in my first car accident earlier and it was pretty bad. It was dark out and I had to make a left turn from a two lane road. I didn’t have a stop sign, but the road I was turning on did. The man coming from the opposite side of the road didn’t have head lights on, I don’t think, and I didn’t see him at all. As I was turning he rammed into the side of my car pretty hard. This pushed us onto the car that was waiting at the stop sign. My airbag went off and I wasn’t hurt at all. The man who hit me hurt his knee but all and all was okay. Anyway it gets worse as his car becomes on fire and slowly spreads to our cars. All three of our cars are on fire while police and fire trucks come to help. The police help us out and the man who hit his knee was taken to the hospital. All three cars were totaled. It was the most terrifying experience I’ve ever been in.

276,"Im not broke or anything but im a teen and cant get a job yet. Im also dont want to tell my parents about my problems as i dont want them to be worried cause they alrdy have alot on their plate. But i do wanna see a therapist cause i want to know if i really do have anxiety or if im just really introveted or smth. 

Basically because most of the time i feel like no one around me actually likes me, and as a result i've begun to distant myself from people who were my friends. Im scared im gonna end up with absolutely no one around me and no friends when im older and worst part is im self aware of everything im doing all the time and practically watching me slowly implode.

I also have a really hard time opening up to people or telling people about what im feeling and for a long time have bottled up what i was feeling and i really dont wanna just blow up one day. There have been multiple times where people have asked me if i was ok and as much as i wanted to tell them i end up saying yeah im ok.

I wanted to check up with a professional cause i've looked these syptoms up and it comes back as either anxiety or depression but again i have no money to pay for it so i just wanna know what i can do for myself but alone i guess?",15Oct2020,1

280,"I'm a few years from 30 and I have been hanging with the same friend group since I was 14. We're all pretty much a group of underachievering stoners but as of the last year I've went through a lot of trauma, fuck ups, and self growth. I want some stability in my life, I want to truly be able to enjoy life for once without any chemicals. Within the last year I've given up so many bad habits in the end putting all the drugs down and pursuing my passion. I feel like a new person. My friends want to hang out but honestly I just don't want to.

I still will talk and chat online but I don't want to be around the bud smoke and risk relapsing... 

As of right now I literally don't hang out with anyone I come home from work and go straight into honing this passion that i'm chasing (I say passion because it's something I truly love i'm not even sure that this is what I need to be doing but I just have to have something to cling to during this time and it's keeping me out of trouble.) 

Throughout the years me and this group have had hundreds of ideas for business opportunities that we should pursue, this scenario would only end in a group chat being created and a day worth of messaging back and forth before it ran dry. Im not sure if it's just the weed or procrastination but literally nothing would ever make it to see reality. 

Anyway, I stopped talking as much and i've been making moves and planting seeds this whole last year. I'm pursuing my current goal but I still feel as though if I had a team of like minded people that were willing to take action on some short/long term investments things would be that much better for me. Maybe i'm too late and this post is just a shot in the dark and me getting this off my chest but if anyone has any ideas or similar experiences please share, thank you.",15Oct2020,1

I lost my job so I'm basically stuck in the flat all the time and feeling really low. In my flat it's just me and my 2 friends who are a couple. They spend a lot of time together so most of the time I'm on my own. 

I don't know a lot of people where I live but recently some people I used to work with started inviting me to go indoor bouldering. It was really good to get out and see other people whilst doing something fun and I felt much better for it, but now one of my flatmates is saying she's anxious about me going as she's worried I'll catch covid. If I went now, I would only be meeting one other person but she is still not happy about it. I don't think she wants me going to cafes either. I honestly feel so trapped and lonely but maybe she's right to be this cautious?

Both her parents are working (not from home) and she has to manage connecting to her class by herself (her grandparents are home but they are not very tech savvy) A few months ago the internet connection was so poor and she used to keep getting disconnected and that used to make her really anxious, so her dad changed the internet connection to a new and stable one. But the little one is still nervous that something will go wrong and that she will get disconnected to the internet. Her teachers have no problem with students getting disconnected and they simple encourage them to try again. She gets so worried that she pukes out her breakfast every morning and sits for class (9 am) and the next meal she has is only at 11 am or 12pm. 

Her mom (who used to have a similar problem when she was a teenager) is really worried and asked me if I could talk to her because she tried but it didn’t help. My niece even goes for a little run in the morning with her dad to help her feel relaxed but that doesn’t help either.

So i’ve been with my boyfriend a little over a year and we have a 2 month old together. It was not planned but i love her and wouldn’t change a thing. Before i got pregnant i did have a drinking problem so obviously i never saw any of the issues he has as well. Now that i’m sober i’m starting to see things more clearly and i don’t know what to do. He doesn’t get drunk everyday but he does drink a couple beers everyday. When he does get drunk he’s an angry drunk and he’s impossible to be around. Today he came home from work and i could tell he’s been drinking but he’s lying about it and won’t ever admit he has a problem. I just wish he would stop for me and my daughter but he refuses too and just gets angry every time any one tries to talk to him about it.

The two kids that were about the same age as me always ride their minibikes and atvs down the dirt road kicking dust into the air (i assume to flex on us or something) and this is definitely annoying since my mom has asthma. Lately they been taking a path from the side of one of our poultry houses to always bother me and my little sister making fun of us and yelling racial slurs. Then this one time they really did cross the line. They turn the lights off in one of the poultry houses while my mom was still in there, and when she came out they bolted down the path they came from. My mom wasn't mad either she was concern, since the path they go into usually have some snakes in there. She told them to watch where they step and to where boots in order not to get bitten or anything. They just stopped and yelled out to speak English, even though she was with an accent. This really firetrucking infuriates me, because my mom wasn't even mad. I just want to straight up beat them up, even if they're younger than me, they should know better. I just want to straight up get into a brawl with them taking both of then on at the same time. I don't wish death upon them, I just want revenge for my mom.

I moved out of my apartment early (lease ended in July, I left in April) because quarantining there was not healthy for me mentally and I moved back in with my parent. I had set up  USPS mail forwarding to my new address but a third party medical claims department still sent medical bills to my old address. I must have been receiving them for quite some time, because in late September my ex-roommate messages me telling me she opened my medical bills, and to pay the claim department $xx.xx amount. I honestly was so flabbergasted that she had the audacity to open my mail that I could not respond. I didn't want to get into an argument with her, so I just ignored her and called the claim department directly to clear up the address issue.

295," I'm hoping you can help me out with these covid related risk assessments... my partner asked at his doctor's appointment this week about risk taking and was told by his m.d. that he doesn't go the gym right now &amp; wouldn't go to the gym as it's in an enclosed space with a group of people who are doing activity where they are expelling more respiratory fluids without wearing masks. The m.d. said it's much safer to fly in planes than go to the gym as masking is universally required the entire flight and due to the way air recirculation is done on planes.

I want to go to the gym 5days per week to weight train primarily and secondarily  make new friends. Ive been isolated during this pandemic. Will you please help me understand levels of risk and figure how to get what i want while doing what's necessary to keep risks low for me and my nesting partner.

The gym I belong to is a smaller independently owned gym with a smaller clientele than the typical commercial gym/fitness center. Everyone  is required to get their temperature taken (when there is staffing) and wear masks in the gym unless they are exercising so we all are wearing masks between exercises. Most  people wear a mask at all times. When the gym is not staffed masking is still encouraged but can't be enforced and temperatures are not taken. 

There are typically 20 people in the entire gym space at it's busiest which is probably 5000sq ft . I typically go at night after dark while staffed as it tends to be slow. Most nights there are between 2-5 people in the entire gym working out. There are several fans circulating air and windows opened but there is no air recirculation system with uvc. 

I've been going to the gym 5-6 days per week for the past few months.

My county has a population of 280,000 and is 774 sq miles. there were 121 cases as of 10 5 20.

Risk assessment:

I understand that to determine risk level you must account for the number of covid cases for the area you are in, the number of people in that environment (group size), whether it's an open or closed space, whether masking is required or not. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the riskiest how much of a risk would you give considering this information for ...

1. which number on the 1 to 10 scale should we as middle aged people aspire to for our own safety and for the safety of everyone we come i contact with ? ie: should we gravitate towards choosing situations with risk on average of 3or less?
2. considering our county is having 120 new cases weekly, what risk number would correlate with the risk level for an area with this sized population density? would ours be a 1?
3. what risk number would be assigned to a hotspot? how many new cases per week would make for too high of a risk number to go out in public much
4. what risk number would this gym environment be ascribed?
5. how much would wearing n95 facemasks at all times at the gym reduce the risk level vs wearing a disposable face mask? (along the lines of wearing condoms reducing hiv risks)
6. If I wore an n-95 mask at all times while at this described environment, how much of a risk would there be compared to wearing a regular face mask?
7. which other options exist to mitigate risks to get down to the recommended level of risk taking
8. when screening new people for hookups, what questions would you ask without seeming too invasive to minimize risks?",15Oct2020,1

I don’t really know how to feel right now- I kind of assumed that one day, me and her would just start talking again once she was ready.

So on this journey of mine I got kicked out of a house, moved cities, got a gf, had a lot of good peolle turn their back on me, got kicked out of the house I was in up there and now im back in my old city dealing with what happened up there and dealing with the break up of the first girl I fell in love with. 
Ive struggled with anxiety and insomnia as the main culprit and a bit depression from the break up.

Ive noticed I get really overloaded from general loud noises and the only friend I have has a baby to raise on her own and I get stressed if her baby or her flat mates dog stares at me. Without being around her I spiral out from loneliness and my symptoms get worse from being back at home in a city I hate. 

I don't know what to do with myself I feel so broken from everything that has happened and losing my best friend (my ex) 
I quit smoking weed and so far the only coping mechanisms I have is being around people (which is really hard for me to do as I've been getting ignored or people just don't care to see me, apart from my current friend with the baby but you know how stressful that can get being around one of those nuclear bombs 24/7) and journaling.

I can't exercise much because my bodies muscles are cramping up on me and stretching has a near nil effect. Im trying to keep myself busy which can be challenging with depression.

For context, this is NOT about my own experience, but the experience of 2 close friends, for whom I will keep anonymous.

In January 2020 two friends of mine had hooked up, just for one night. It didn’t amass to anything other than that, and my friend A, was really heartbroken about it for a long while. Whereas my other friend, R, had been the one to call it quits after the one night stand. 

In the last month, A has stated that R had sexually assaulted them that night, meaning that A had not given consent. As A has come forward with this new information, it contradicts statements A made previous, stating that A had given consent. At this point, I’m not sure what that means, or why this narrative has changed. 

I offered to assist A in creating a police report due to my previous experience with a women’s support organization, but A stated they are not looking to press charges against R. 

I am unsure how to go about this situation, given I feel very much stuck between the two people, as well as unsure how to help A, or to reach out to R. For all intents and purposes I believe A and what they have told me, but I am also left confused and worried as to why this has happened. 

Should I seek help through police reporting? What are my options as a friend to both of these people?",15Oct2020,1
317,I had my first ever shift and I was kinda left on my own. The lady told me how to use the till a couple times and expected me to know what to do but it has soooo many buttons I have no idea and feel like I’ll never learn. People say anyone can work at maccas but I don’t think I can there’s too much to learn and no ones teaching me. Any maccas workers/ex workers who could help!!!! Please message I need help,15Oct2020,1
318,"Lately things have not been so great with my gf. First when i met her she was atleast half sweet and never snappy.

Anyhow now we live together. 
If you’ve read my previous posts you can kind of get what ive been going thru. All around i think shes a toxic person .

I dont mean to put her down cause i do care for her. But lately ive been playing video games (warzone with my friends) 

All my friends girlfriends dont mind that they play . But my gf snapps out. One nite she broke the tv

Another nite she put wholes in the door of my room.
This is all recently . I cant play the game literally for more than an hour without her going batshit crazy. I work hard . I pay my bills. Including internet. And she changes the password and kicks me off. 

She has gotten out of control. Many times when she gets crazy then calms down she says she will change or get help for the way she acts but it doesnt change.


 I waited till she fell asleep tn to play with my boys , and she woke up now at 3 am and is snapping , kicked me out of her room (i dont mind) and i am pretty certain shes cheating on me🤣 shes cheatted on her ex bf. 

So much more bad things that i havent put but shes very abusive. I want to leave but i care about her but besides being pretty she really is not the best person. Or atleast not like how she was before. 

Im very confused in this situation cause somedays i think its love. And other days its the worst. 

(Btw i can see how the game gets annoying i played for 3 hrs tonight with my little brother and a friend) but i see it as an innocent hobby yet i feel i get punished for it

Why cant she see it as that ?
I tell her i love her and the game is just where me and my friends hangout and just because i play does not mean i dont love you. 

But she snaps when i play. Shes been acting so different.

Any professional advice",15Oct2020,1
319,"Hello, I am a us citizen, who recently graduated in engineering and have been working as a sales engineer, however I would not be able to travel as an expat with my company for many years.

I’m willing to learn any skills to build my resume and learn any language to make myself desirable.

320," It's a rhetorical question and the answer is probably no but it's an interesting dilemma. My cousin told me she was staying at a friends house in Ireland for two weeks before she went back to the States last Friday. She had withdrawn €500 last week (all in €100 bills) and wanted to spend it on a new camera.  


Well to her surprise, she went to an electronics store and when she tried to buy a camera, the cashier told her it was all fake. They called the police and they took her to the station and cautioned her but didn't charge her while still investigating.  


She went to the bank and they said 100%, they would never let fake money slip by. She got the money from the ATM. They said that cashiers are trained to spot fake money physically as well as test it with a UV light. They also said that even if fake money was not spotted, the ATM wouldn't dispense it as the machine can recognize counterfeit bills.  


So, one bill may slip but not x5, €100 bills. So the police said that someone must have conned her and switched her money. Only problem is, she never asked for change. Does this mean a roommate did it?  


I should mention that her roommate is a sketchy person involved in excessive drug use. Not saying all drug users are bad, but she's a stressed out med student who is known to do coke, weed, and ecstasy to the max. Could she have bought fake money and then when my cousin was sleeping, switched them so she wouldn't recognize it until she tried to use the fake money?",15Oct2020,1
321,"Hey, 

So about a year and a half ago me and my mom started home schooling. It was fine at first but about half a year into it we started to argue more often, be less respectful to eachother and she became more demanding. At some points she became abusive to the point i threatened to call the cops on her. Now these arguments would happen if i didn't know an answer to a single question or i forgot something. This could just be me I'm a 13 year old dude,
 Spolied, im a first child and I'm lazy. I just started home schooling and we've already had our fair share of arguments. During one of these arguments I barely said anything bc my mom would use that against me. I remember one time she told me not to say anything to her, but when i tried talking to her when trying to apologize she said ""I don't care."" each time with a louder tone. Im just worried another big argument will occur and It'll be worse than all the other ones.",15Oct2020,1
322,"I’m in a family of hunters, I have killed many animals, Elk, Deer, Oryx, various big cats, one of every North American Bear save for endangered species, you name it, I’ve killed it...

But my cousins and uncles relentlessly mock and pick on every single one of my flaws, I am the punching bag of everyone.

I’m not a pussy either, it’s legitimately horrendous, here are some examples of the shit I endure: 

15 years ago I said that a pair of elk testicles were a blown apart ground squirrel, to this day they fucking say that to me constantly, relentlessly, and not funny like a joking story, they’re cruel about it, I was 5.

I was 11 years old and I said I grazed an elk, embellishing a 60 yard miss. 

I am MENSA certified with a relatively high IQ, but I do and have said some goofy word-vomity shit, and they use it against me. EVERY HUNT.

Well:

Recently somebody used my Instagram photos to catfish gay men, I live in a tiny town, and the word has spread so far and so fast, that everyone I know has asked me today if I am homosexual, and I am not. I have no hate in my heart for the LGBTQ community, but my family is ultra-mega-super-duper Christian conservative, they believe Christ will come back any moment. 

Well, all of them know about it and I have no proof that I don’t fuck dudes other than I have a girlfriend that I’ve been with for a year next month. 

But this week I spend alone with all of them alone in the woods with no escape. I legitimately hate myself and my life, it just feels like I have this doomed fate to have the shittiest experiences at camp and then kill, and get no praise.

My father helps me none, I don’t think he’s ever once helped me out, said one word in defense of me to the others. 

I’m just ready to kill myself, genuinely, the one thing I love to do is also the one thing I can’t do with anyone I know or “love” because nobody gives half a fuck about me, except for my girlfriend, whom my mother hates.",15Oct2020,1

325,"For as long as I can remember, I've always been treated as though I was a mentally deficient person. Even in preschool, teachers and classmates thought that I was such an idiot. I was breaking toys and CDs in preschool. From elementary school to high school, everyone still thought that I was mentally deficient even after I was ranked in the top five in my high school class. My graduation speech wasn't that great, so that didn't make their perception of me any more positive. Now, I withdrew from college as a freshman to take a fucking break from all of the shit people have been giving me. I really do not understand why so many people have been treating me like I'm a fucking criminal.

People tell me to do things that I don't want to do, and they get upvotes. Whenever I do the same to others, I get downvoted. It seems that I'm just hated. My father is hated as well. My mother and father recently went through a divorce. My father can't get along with anyone, and is seen as an autistic loser. Am I the same?

328,"My entire adult life has pretty much been a disaster. I've struggled badly with anxiety and depression since I was 14 and I've just about had enough. My fear of engaging the world has caused me to miss out on many good opportunities that were basically presented to me on a silver platter, which I now deeply regret and I've pushed away many (but not all thankfully) friends and loved ones. Sometimes I'd rather feel physical pain than the anguish of the past 12 years, I just feel so trapped in this. 

My prospects for employment are extremely grim, I've got the CV of a fresh highschool graduate at 26 years old and I possess no marketable skills. The pandemic has been quite eye opening for me as it has had next to no impact on my life because I have refused to engage with the outside world for over a decade. I have attempted many times over the years to break out of this but I always seem to go back into ""auto-pilot"" and resume the same self-destructive behaviours and then hate myself more for it. I am just so sick of all this. I crave friendship and social interaction which I'm actually fairly good given my lack of experience in the world, but I also deeply fear these things and so I avoid them. 

I have thought many times about going back to college but I am easily disuaded by naysayers, ""waste of time and money"",""you'd be much better learning that yourself etc"",""degrees are worthless"". I see and hear this sort of shit everywhere and it causes a lot of doubt which I really don't need, I doubt myself enough as it is. 

Currently I am planning out my days and breaking them down into small goals and checking them off as the are completed, getting back into exercising too which does help a lot but I have very long way to go.  I constantly feel like I can relapse at any moment and let yet another year slip down into the sewer and I dread the amount of work I need to do to fix myself. It really does seem impossible for me to achieve anything because all I know is failure and disappointment. 

I guess what I'm asking is, is there anyone here who has been in similar circumstance and could offer some tips/advice about how they fixed themselves?

some background info

so i guess my recent issue is my father. because of corona i haven't seen him in around 6 months, he lives about 500 miles away from me, and had surgery earlier this year that used up all of his days off. my mom refuses to let me get on a plane to see him, but wants him to drive down instead. this won't work because a) he doesn't have the time, b) he would have to pay for a place for us to stay, and c) it could only be for 2 days because i have school. she thinks a plane is too dangerous for me right now, but sees no problem if he were to take a plane down? doesn't make any sense, if one of us were to get the virus, the other one would too. i told her if it's too much of a risk to visit my own father, then i won't be going surfing, to soccer, or out at all, frankly. i told her she must do the same. she said, and i quote, ""because the pros outweigh the cons"". i didn't think much of it but then i realized- she thinks me hanging out with friends is more important than seeing my father whom i haven't seen in half a year. also, earlier today i was super proud of myself because i managed to partially learn the japanese alphabet. i was excited to show her when she came down from work (she works upstairs), but when she came down she snapped at me to do the dishes, and it kind of just ruined my sense of self-accomplishment for the time being. i am an only child, and my mom is single, so i'm the only one she can take her anger out on:( i know most people might say, ""oh just try talking to her!"" well, of course i've tried that. she just says ""i'm sorry you feel that way"" and she never reflects on her own actions. i know this post is literally tripping over itself but i hope you can comprehend some of it lol. i just wanna ask- what are my options? do i have any what do i do?

333,"I am working from 11am-8pm these days and at the end of my shifts I'm well beyond knackered.

She's having a few days off of work nad decided to meet an old friend if hers. They knew each other for over seven years but hardly ever talked in the last five years, only online now and then. 

She asked me whether I would like to come along but me being quite exhausted I chose to go home to get some sleep.

She came home at 2am, drunk, sad.

I'd add that she is a bit alcohol intolerant so one beer makes her tipsy. Well she had three. 

She was so out of it that she told me she had thrown up five times at the pub. 

The guy however wasn't drunk at all according to her.

He made a move and leaned in to kiss her on her lips and start to make out with her while she had leaned against him to have a quick nap to ease the dizziness. 

She pulled away, the guy pulled in once again she however told me she hadn't kissed him back and I believe her as she had never done anything sketchy like that in our relationship nor did she ever really met with other guys on her own.

I am quite mad now though. She knows how she cannot handle any kind of booze and she never even drinks. She hasn't had a single drink in about two years. Why now? 

I know that she is a very friendly person and that they are friends but ffs if you're drunk and your friend has had a few drinks too, you don't lean at them and expect them not to take it the wrong way.

She asked him to call an Uber and she came home, and the guy has rode home too. 

Now in the morning the guy has written her how much he enjoyed seeing her, what a great night he had and that they should soon meet again for another night out. He obviously doesn't realise what he did was wrong and that she's not interested.

Do I have the right to be angry? Am I overreacting? I got a bit angry at her for getting drunk while she swears she hates alcohol and always refuses to grab a drink when the two of us are out together on a date or whatnot and that she basically called for it with the way she acted.

I'm just so mad at the whole situation, especially at the guy who knew she was in a relationship for the last four years and that we moved countries together, were living together, etc...

Such a slithering jerk he is.....

TL;DR

She went out with a guy two of them only because I was too tired to join them and the guy tried to make out with her while she got drunk (which she never does). I got angry at the situation, him and a bit at her. 

How do I react right?

She is definitely even more shook by it and feels awful because of all that happened and now she is really upset and miserable about the whole night.

340,"Long story short I have a history w eating disorders. I have been feeling rather mentally unwell since I changed profession, got fired bcause of covid then went back to my old job... It has greatly impacted my mental health. I contacted the psychologist who worked w me before but she no longer practices. 

Now, my country has a horrible healthcare system, and its impossible to get treatment without paying. (no, you cannot choose insurance, if I could, I would). All my calls to doctors and hospitals ended up with them saying; if I need help, I need to be hospitalized. That is very unsafe w the pandemic, besides I don't think I need to be hospitalized, I need therapy, once or twice a week. 

So I told my sister, who (trying to help me) told my mom. My mother has a somehow old dated view on mental health... yet she found a 'kinesiologist'. I had a video session w said kinesiologist and I am p sure she is fake and does not actually has a degree in psychology. She told me such things that my metal allergy and wearing silver instead of gold is 'feminine energy' and so is liking cats... But nothing about the course of therapy. 

I told my mom about my doubts and she flipped off on me. I do feel very ungrateful, but I just dont know how to articulate her that its not me or her who is at fault... She told me nothing ever is good enough for me, she is paying for this so I should go with it. Truce is that I cannot afford a full session by a private psychologist( a real one) atm without also starving myself. ED is a bitch...

Couple questions I have are carbs bad? Are fats bad?
I've seen in recent popularity oil free cooking and low carb diets, are they good for you? Should I avoid fats and carbs or keep them low?
In terms of keeping carbs low how do I do that? Again, being vegitarian I notice staple foods like beans, lentils, rice, chickpeas, and even veggies are pretty high in carbs.

How much protein do I actually need? Many people say I need 60 ish while some say over 100. I'm 5'11 and 220 pounds.

Main staples in my diet are rice, beans, chickpeas, lentils, broccoli, spinach, garlic, onion, bell peppers, zucchini, tofu, Tvp, and eggs.

Typical meaI I eat are bowls, burrito bowls, &amp; ""asian"" bowls and sandwiches with sliced baked tofu for protein",15Oct2020,1
343,"Alright buckle up, friends, I’ve got myself a bit of an issue and I’m hoping you guys might be able to help. 

So, my friend (19F) comes from an extremely broken home. Drug addict mother, absent father, DCF cases, PTSD, the whole damn thing. Despite her difficult upbringing, she’s managed to be the first of her bloodline to make it into college. I (22M) have known her for a little over a year and we have become very good friends in that time. My issue lies in the fact that I’m her only support. I encourage her to seek therapy, counseling, etc for her mental struggles, but even trained counselors have said her case is too complex for them. 

She has recently come upon financial trouble that has made it damn near impossible for her to pay for school, and the possibility of having to move back in with her shitshow of a family is destroying her mental health. In turn, she’s destroying mine with near constant crying, FaceTiming me at work/after I finish 13 hour shifts and want nothing more than to sleep. I try to be a good friend and offer suggestions for ways to make money or people to talk to and every suggestion I make is met with a reason it’s not viable. Counselors aren’t good, jobs aren’t hiring, she’s too depressed. I’m not equipped to deal with this and her insurance isn’t accepted by “any therapists worth a damn” (her words, not mine). 

Does anyone have advice on how I can help her widen her support network?",15Oct2020,1
344,"I'm not really a germaphobe, but when it come to food, so many things make me sick and lose my appetite. Thinking about things like what I've been touching, or even seeing something small on my plate, even thinking about the sponge used to wash my dishes. I have a very hairy dog, so seeing dog hair on my plate or bowl before I use it doesn't bother me. But if I pull out a plate and I see the tiniest little mark so that its not completely spotless, it makes me sick and I won't eat at all, not even if I use another dish. If I haven't changed my sponge in over a week and I see it with food bits on it, I'll refuse to use any of the dishes cleaned with it. If I sit at my table and see crumbs or something sticky like soda or syrup, I won't eat, even at a different place. I also have to wash my hands before I grab any food, and then once more before I start eating. I can't have my food touching either. If I go to a pizza place where they don't wash the pizza cutter before cutting another pizza, I can't eat the pizza because I know it's touched all the other pizzas and the other pizzas probably had things like sausage or mushrooms on them (im not allergic to anything) 

I love food, and im constantly snacking (which has caused me to gain a lot of weight over the years) however, eating has become so anxiety inducing that I just don't want to eat anymore.

She didn't tell me what happened and only me bits and pieces of the story but they went for a walk and send me photos. She became more affectionate towards me and we would do it on the phone still. 

Anyways, we talked about his guy friend and she said like how this guy only loved one certain person and she was in a relationship with someone abroad that was only a fling when I brought up her guy friend about being manipulative she was quick to jump on her defence when I told her that he was being manipulative towards the girl that she had a fling with, she also said that she doubts she a girlfriend anymore. It was like she was really interested with his story and all that.


I have a history of jealousy in her part but right now, I just want to clear things up and I don't know I don't want to accuse her that every guy she is with has feelings for her but I don't know. How should I ask her this without accusing her?

I have a disability and for that reason I’ve been on social security for over 20 years!  I also have been getting food stamps as well. Anyway, I moved to a new apartment because my mom who I was living with to help with her cancer diagnosis had a psychotic breakdown and threw me to the streets during the pandemic after she finished her cancer treatments and she recovered!! When she no longer needed my help she got rid of me! 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠..as you may have guessed she is an extreme narcissist and abused me my whole life!! 😠😠😠 Anyway she is now no longer a part of my life and I have since found  a new apartment and I tried to contact Social security to let them know I moved BUT  due to the whole pandemic thing I could not reach anybody and when I finally did the person told me that someone would call me back in about a week and they never did. Anyway, eventually after playing more phone tag with social security I reached a person who seemed to update my records at the national headquarters but I was informed to contact my local office to update them too. When I did so I was told that a local case worker was trying to reach me to interview me and get more information on my current situation but she said she needed to schedule a phone interview with me in order to do so. ..so she set up a phone interview with me for a few days later. She was to call me. That day I sat and waited with no phone call so after about 45 minutes of waiting I called her and she apologized and said she was sidetracked with another client and wanted to reschedule me for the following week, which was yesterday. However, once again she called me and said she overbooked her schedule again. She apologized again and has now rescheduled me for tomorrow.😒😒😒😒. ...in the meantime I just checked the mail and I received a letter from social security to let me know they are cutting me off and I won’t receive my monthly benefits for November! !! 😳😳😒😒😒😒😒They said that the reason why is because they don’t have my updated information! But this lady keeps rescheduling on me so why am I being penalized for this???😠😠😠😠. 

The letter went on to say that I need to appeal this in writing within 10 days of the date on my letter if I want any chance of keeping my benefits untouched for November! That would make it October 18th...in a few days! Anyway, I know there’s a chance that this might just be a form letter AND I’m supposed to have this “ supposed” interview with the social security rep on the phone tomorrow...but that’s of course only if she does not once again have something else come up that she finds more important than doing her job and interviewing me!!! 😠😠😠😠

Oh and in addition to having to deal with this I was also cut off of my Food stamps for the same reason..they said that they needed my updated information! I’m currently working on that too! 😠😠Anyway, Thankfully I have a roommate who will hopefully be able to pay my share of the rent for me for November! But I’m so aggravated that I even have to go through this worry now!! If that case worker interviewed me like she should have originally I would probably not be in this mess right now! 😠😠😠😠 I do have a part time work at home job that I do to supplement my benefits but it’s not enough for me to live off of! I need my benefits due to my disability! !! As I said, I know there’s a possibility that this is just a form letter that I received...social security has sent me similar form letters in that past and apologized to me for doing so afterwards...so I know that this could be one of those situations too but at the same time with the kind of horrible year I’ve had with the pandemic and my psycho mom throwing me out during that time and all the stresses that have accompanied that...I guess it feels like this is turning into a year from hell in a lot of ways for me so it almost feels like being cut off from social security would be in line with this hellish year for me! 😠😠😠😒😒😠😠😠😠😠

Anyway..I know that there is probably not much anybody can say at the moment. I’ll just have to figure it out tomorrow and if this case worker tries to reschedule again I guess I will need to speak to her supervisor!! 😠😠...it does help to have typed this out though. The funny thing is that I was going to work tonight but after getting this letter I felt too upset to concentrate. However...working might really be my best bet right now since I really need the money so maybe since I vented a bit on here I will feel well enough to work. Thanks for listening! I just really hope this dark cloud would quit following me everywhere! I could use a break from all this upset in my life! 😒😒😒. Anyway, thanks for letting me vent!!!👍👍👍",15Oct2020,1

356,"tw // grooming, csa, mentions of rape/incest roleplay, cheating

when I was in my mid-teens I was active on a social media site and was basically groomed by some men who serially targeted mentally ill minors with low self-esteem. 

The first guy was a popular and well-known user on the site in his mid 20s, and I though it was cool to have a (relatively) famous and funny friend, and it was flattering when he started flirting with me. Because I was a kid and pretty naïve I didn't really realise anything was wrong with it, but it resulted in a lot of manipulation and boundary-pushing that I'm realising lately has left me with a lot of issues. a lot of things were normalised to me that shouldn't have been (sexual advances, etc.) which left me open to being, I guess, re-targeted by another guy (in his late 20s now). 

both these guys deleted their accounts after it came out they were serially targeting minors. the first guy (who afaik was doing this from 2012-2015) would get minors to engage in DD/lg roleplay and pretend to be his /explicitly biological/ daughter, send nudes, video chat, voice call etc. he also had a long-term girlfriend (now wife) who he cheated on repeatedly (a number of people messaged her with proof of what he was doing, and she married him anyway).

the second (who appears to have done this routinely from 2013-2018) got many girls as young as 14 to send him nudes, video chat with him, engage in rapeplay etc.. He also tried to get a 15 year old to meet him for sex, and was effectively cheating on his girlfriend (he would send money for nudes so it wasn't ""technically"" cheating, and then would use the fact that he was paying to be more manipulative/push boundaries). (these are only the ones we know about, given the large time frame I feel it's likely there are more stories from people who have left the platform)

I'm coping with the effects this has had on me on my own and I'm in therapy, but I just keep thinking about how these guys were involved with so many minors and how they probably haven't stopped given how many girls came forward after each of them and I can't stop wondering how many more there might have been that we just don't know about (I didn't realise there were other minors involved with the first guy until 2 years after he deleted his account). I'm also angry that they get to live their lives without any repercussions at all, besides deleting or privating their accounts. I'm so afraid of what might happen if the first guy, who got married to the girlfriend he cheated on a thousand times, has a baby girl (I think he had a son a few years ago, and I was so relieved it wasn't a girl that I cried).

I want to report them but I don't know how to do it or whether anything would even come from it. I'm afraid that, if I do, I'll get in trouble myself for sending things while I was a minor. Because it was so long ago, I've lost a lot (but not all) of the proof that I had, and I have access to the posts and evidence that other people posted, but I don't know if they would want their stuff being involved in a report and I can't contact many of them.

only one of them lives in the country I'm from, and they both targeted girls from around the world so I wouldn't even know where to start. I know both of their full names and their personal social media - the first guy's is completely public, and I keep wanting to post something there with proof of what he's done but I don't know if it would be rational or healthy or believed and I also would feel like I'm destroying something because his Facebook at least gives the appearance of a happy marriage. I don't want to hurt his wife or their son, but I can't believe he's changed as a person (he was cheating on his wife less than a year before they married).both of them, especially the second guy, did it for so long and at such a large scale that I truly believe they're still doing the same shit. 

the recent stuff with people from achievement hunter has made me think about it even more, and it's to the point that i constantly feel this kind of sinking in my stomach. I'm feel like if I do nothing I'm complicit in them abusing more girls, but I don't even know what I could do formally and I don't know whether letting people in their life know would be worth it especially given it's been a few years and I don't know i don't know what to do",15Oct2020,1

366,"I'm currently living with what can easily be described as the worst neighbors ever. They're noisy, they throw things out at the back and leave it there where it can attract rats, not to mention just make it look bad. They make this place look like the slums.

Once they set fire to a bin right behind our house, for I don't know what reason? It would have set their house on fire too because the houses are attached. It was near some vines as well which lead to our house. They scared our dogs with music that they played at the back (Our dogs are also sensitive to noise and get nervous around people, they're rescues). 

I'm suffering with anxiety. I have sensory issues (Probably linked to my autism) and I cannot stand the consistently loud noises or music. This has been happening again recently after it not happening for a while. I have 'carers' I'll say, so I'm not someone who's in charge of this house, but the carers have said ""We'll work on it, we'll report it."" they said this lats year and so far they haven't done anything. They're affected by this too, I don't understand why it's taking so long. When there is music next door, they're either asleep or at work. 

It's even worse when you can factor in that other neighbors have heard these noisy neighbors. This woman living next door (The noisy neighbor), who seems to be making this noise, also has a child abuser and domestic abuser boyfriend. Just the other night, her boyfriend came round to the front of the house, where my bedroom unfortunately is. This was at 23:00, and he was knocking on the door shouting ""Let me in."" And knocked loudly occasionally. Everyone could hear this. The woman was shouting back saying ""Fuck off"". After forty minutes, she let him in, and I could just about hear an argument taking place after that. This was at 23:45 at this point. I aim to get to sleep at around 23:00. This kept me up for a while. I could hear it through ear defenders, which yes, I was using beforehand. 

Then there's this music. For some reason, I live in a generation of morons. They play their music really loud, through speakers, at high volumes, with bass boosting, and absolutely no self-awareness at all. Which is exactly what this neighbor is doing. It plays at random times through the day, because I am stuck at home all day, I hear it all. It's often percussion or bass that I hear, very rarely I can actually hear the song. The worst time for it to come on is when I'm concentrating on something, whether it's reading or playing a game, or listening to music through my headphones (Because I'm sensible).  

I'm not really sure what to do. I can't knock on the door because I'm scared. I don't have any external tools that I can use to make them shut up (Ie, 'remote control device'). I'm losing it. I feel uncomfortable and disturbed when the music comes on. Because it's consistent, and it goes on for hours. I don't know why my mind focuses on it, it just does. It's not something I can change.  And yet, it's really unnecessary. Bluetooth headphones nower days are cheap. There's no good reason to have music on that loud anymore.",15Oct2020,1

I don’t want to pressure him to talk to me if he doesn’t want to so i just left it alone, but i really am worried for him. I don’t know what to do.

I always talk to him about how i’m feeling but i feel like he never shares anything hes feeling with me.

376,"(Back story so bare with me) Ok so I've been having medical issues since August. Mainly respiratory pain on and off. But it went away for a bit and came back last week this time with nausea. When I went into the hospital they told me I checked out and seemed healthy, even tested negative for covid, which all the symptoms and everything went away after a week and I was fine. 

After that, I went to a checkup where they told me I may have Gerd (a reflux disease) which I haven't felt symptoms up until l now with my throat feeling clogged and on and off nausea. I missed work back then because of those appointments including the Covid test when I had to wait for the results to come back. 

(Present) Now, I am expirencing Gerd symptoms that are si.ilar to covid, when I called the triage line they told me I needed to get tested and referred me to a test site. - however, earlier in the day I was told harshly by my manager that when the schedule is posted it is hard to find someone to cover my shift and will basically have to plan out appointments better (go in the morning or something) - but after the Covid thing came back to light im unsure of how to tell mt work as im afraid they will think im trying to skip out or get me in some disaplinary trouble, I have been battling this unknown medical issue that has ended me up in the emergency room twice now, the second time I told my boss I was in the ER but proceeded to go to work the next day anyway. 

I am unsure what to do or how to go about this. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could proceed in communication with work and to better work on my health.

then because I was trying to catch up I neglected current work

383,"I graduated college in 2011 with a degree that was the culmination of a little over ten years of a hobby, so when a couple of teachers kept insisting that do attend college I did, except at that time I had no interest in anything but that hobby, and no one really told me what the consequences of attending college without a plan would be. After graduating, I lost interest in this hobby and spent the last ten years at four different jobs, none of which are interesting or have provided enough to buy a house (with or without debt) and/or create and provide for a family. I simply had the jobs to pay off my debt. That goal has been accomplished, and now I don't know what I should focus on.

Five years ago, I had a notion to become a writer (sitcom, plays, etc.). I spent a lot of time reading blogs, listening to podcasts, and watching videos about writing, but I never got unblocked. (In high school and college I struggled writing the ""choose your own topic"" essays, or doing presentations and projects where the topic was of my choosing. I failed a couple of classes because of it. Brainstorming was never a strong suit of mine.)

A few months ago I called a popular career radio program to get some guidance from the host. I thought I wanted to write, but as the host pointed out, I wasn't really sure about that and didn't really have a ""passion"" for it. He told me ""start writing."" I basically got the sense from him that if I actually wanted to do it, I would actually be doing it. So for all intents and purposes, the thought of writing has been put on the back burner.

I can tolerate my job in manufacturing for the time being, so I have no immediate plan to leave until I can formulate some sort of plan for a better life. (It pays the bills at least.)

How do I begin to break through these psychological blocks of not knowing what I am really interested in or passionate about? I have tried some of the traditional ""trades"" and found no interest or pleasure in those types of work. (I was helping out my family with various home improvement type projects, landscaping, auto repair, etc.)

What do I like doing that I actually do? Watching TV. That's how I got the idea to write in the first place. My day is usually wake up at 3:30. Go to work at 4. Get home at 2:45. Watch TV, eat, get ready for bed no later than 8. Repeat.",15Oct2020,1

389,"for context: I'm 23m living with my parents *(chill yalls i live in Singapore. it's normal to be living with your parents, its an Asian thing and plus housing here is just too damn expensive. look it up)*. i got siblings so like 4 of us, two sisters that are married and live separately and then i live with my parents and my brother. my family was not so well to do and always had to rely on bursaries and financial assistance for my family to survive but recently we are getting better. and also im the first in my family to get a degree so theres that pressure of doing well. (asians can relate lol)

I'm 3 months in my first job after graduating from school, ive made a plan to pay off my tuition loans with a good portion of my pay. considering the job is a 2-year contract, ive planned it in such a way that i dedicate the pay of certain months for different purposes (home office stuff/loans/postgrad fund). (not sure if this is the best plan but it is one i went with). i planned my first 3 months for just getting my home office setup in my room cuz covid and my office is non-existent basically. and also  and all other personal stuff that i have always wanted before but dont actually have the funds to buy them.

thing is idk about the other Singaporeans/Asians out there, we have this culture of giving your first paycheck to your parents as a token of appreciation. tbh i legit considered the stuff that i paid for like groceries for the past few months as that token. and really this token thing is an unspoken thing so i legit forgot about it until now.

i really hate being all showy and like 'thank you for this and this, heres my paycheck'. like to me words means so little compared to your actions. i know i sound hypocritical and im like preaching 'actions speak louder than words' but my actions are shit.

and today i came back and my mom was asking if i had gotten my pay yet, i said yes and for a few months now and she asked that i should give some to my dad as a token. and idk maybe it was the way she said it that made me think that its all reverse psychology shit. but she legit look disappointed that i didnt give them my first paycheck and i know she means well and its my dumb ass forgetting. **tldr for this para: i forgot to do something important, i am the shit and i deserve it.**

i love my parents so much and it is definitely my fault for not realising sooner and that i should have given my first paycheck to them. but today when my mom tells me that i should do something for them, it feels like shit cuz

1. i know its my fault and im the ass here
2. but I hate the reverse psychology shit and like i want to give them out of my own free will and not to be guilt-tripped into giving my paycheck to them cuz if i were to give them just because they asked then it defeats the whole sincere thing (idk if that made sense). and the whole act is meaningless. so i plan to give them my entire paycheck the next month.

another thing is that I know that my parents probably feel like shit cuz ""here's my son we've raised him but maybe he isn't appreciating us as much. "".

but thing is if i were to give some cash now after this very encounter, then theyll think that ah only after guilt tripping will he 'give' us some money. and i hate every bit of the very possibility of that thought. i want it to be sincere and without them asking.

**tldr: im supposed to give first paycheck to my parents but i didnt. so i think my parents are lowkey disappointed in me and i feel like shit for being a shit for forgetting such an important gesture.**

**so the I'm asking the people of Reddit**

* should I just shut my ass up, carry on with my plan and then next month's pay ill do what I should have done with my first paycheck and give them out of my own sincerity which is quite a lump sum and at least ill know itll be sincere.
* or should I just give them all the extra cash I have now which is not going to be much but itll probably put me in a bad light cuz its like guilt-trip money (idk how to phrase it better,sorry)?

392,"I joined an NGO a few months ago, looking to add something to my very calm routine. All it took was about 10 office hours per week. We were trying to approach potential partners in order to help us start volunteer programs about the 17 sustainable development goals (by the UN). Most volunteers and partners who decide to host a program were left exremely pleased by the whole experience. Since I am a person who really likes making others happy (unless it costs me my happiness and well being of course), I was pretty into it at first.  


I was never comfortable being there, but that is the whole reason why I joined in the first place. I always hated the shy, awkward and antisocial person I was, and I thought my experience there as a salesman would make me into a confident and social person. Even though I didn't manage to find a single interested partner in my time in the organization, I kept showing up. I used my huge ego and my disgust for quitters in order to keep showing up and not just block everyone on social media and disappear. 

  
However, the negatives always outweighed the positives. I was always anxious all day long about my office work. Constant rejections from partners made me extremely stressful and shot my confidence down (more than ever really). That stress reduced the amount of sleep I was able to get (on average I spend 2 hours less asleep every night), made me devote less time into my hobbies and made me less productive in my studies, even though the total amount of time spent was the same. Essentially, it tremendously reduced the quality of my work everywhere else and made me miserable. I was hoping stuff would change just by exposure and following the advice of my other members, but it still remains the same.

&amp;#x200B;

This semester, I got accepted to work in a lab at my university, and it is getting the best of me in terms of time and work. I have been able to salvage it for the most part, but I am sacrificing lab and study hours just to get my office work done. I texted my team leader to tell him that I want to quit, I feel very overwhelmed with my participation in the organism and my full time lab and studies, he told me to re-evaluate and try to find a solution alongside him until next Tuesday, so I don't have to quit altogether. 

  
What should I do? I don't want to just block everyone on social media and simply dissapear off the face of the earth. My mates there want me to find a way to balance everything, they believe it can be done. I want to focus on my studies and my lab,.and feel like a dick and a quitter if I leave them right now. I am literally never going to negociate the importance of my time in studies compared to my participation to the organism. They seem to understand that university is the most important aspect of my life, but they still want me to find a way to do both, even though I simply don't find a reason to sacrifice anything in order to stay there. How can I nicely tell them that ""I don't allign well enough with your values in order to sacrifice part of my well being and comfort in order to just not quit"".

393,"I live in a small 2 bedroom apartment with my mom. She is 51, and I am 22. I pay half the rent which is 300$ plus out r car insurance, and have basically paid for half of her car that she bought from my boyfriend's dad. I'm the time she's been trying to pay off her car, I've paid for mine, and am working on buying another and selling mine. I also pay for my own food, gas, and am expected to share everything. Even though I'm vegetarian and she is not. 

Even though I am 22, she expects me to call when I won't be home for the night. She said if I was just a normal roommate, that's what i should do, let her know I'll be staying elsewhere for the night. She also begs me to go everywhere with her. Which she's my mother, I of course want to help her, but it becomes hard when if I don't do something for her, she instantly becomes cold and rude, or teary eyed. 

I keep my room clean, and clean up my messes, and take out all of the trash. She does her own dishes and that's about it, even though she nags me to do things she never does. She also can't be productive if I'm not. If I want a lazy day, but she was planning to clean, then I have to clean too so she is motivated. A lot of the time I tell her no, that I don't need to, and she won't do her cleaning. If I wont leave the house to run her errands, she won't. 

When our family dog passed away, who we had since I was 12, I told her I'd move with her one more time so she could get into a house which she can't do without me. But that I would move out after a 6 month lease and it would be up to her and whatever roommates she found by then. But I'm considering moving out on my own without her because of the way she treats me. 

She makes me feel like I'm rude, and lazy, like I don't care and she tries to make me feel guilty I think unintentionally. Everytime I've talked to her about this, and bring up things my therapist said, she goes crazy, crying, saying mean things and I can't even finish what I was saying because she's losing her shit while I'm talking calmly. 

When I was 18 I moved out on my own without notice. She begged me to come back, cussed me out, a whole slew of things. But while I was away, she became so much more responsible. She paid all of her bills, she cleaned the house, she was a normal person and we had a better relationship. I think I'm going to do it again. I plan on saving up my tax return and some of my own money and just dipping to my own place in the middle of the night and leaving her a note about all of it.

395,"Ever since I started secondary school I wanted to go out with my friends after school, and on the weekend. Y'know, like any other normal kid. What has made this unbelievably difficult is my overprotective mother, who cannot listen to reason. 

I, as well as all of my other family members including my dad, have tried to talk to her about the way she shelters me and my siblings (13 and 14), but everytime it's brought up she shrugs it off, refuses to listen, and gives some bullshit reason like ""because I said so"". The fuck?? She won't even let me walk home from school, a school that's 15 minutes away fron my house.

Some progress was made a short while ago during the time I was off school. She allowed me to go out with my friends twice, but not before knowing all of the details and having to consider it a million times over. My dad even encouraged me to lie about how I'd get there (she wanted me to walk to the meeting point with someone). Oh, and I had to be home at 3. Baby steps, I guess.

What's made matters 10 times worse now is there's this girl, I like her and it's quite obvious she likes me. She doesn't attend the same school I do, but it's fairly close by. I'm trying to stall so hard in progressing to the next step with her because I know now that I'm back in school I won't be able to do anything with her. This is tearing me apart so much because I finally have a shot at being with someone I really like, and it's going to be ruined by my controlling mum.

Any ideas? Because right now flatout rebelling seems like the only option left. I just don't want to miss out on an opportunity with this girl.

396,"     Hey, guys! I'm in a kind of crazy situation, but honestly I'm sure it's not unique. I will try to be as concise as possible, but also want to provide all the context needed to understand this. So here goes: I (30F) work nightshift, and originally when I started this job there was only one other person who worked with me(52?F). After working together for about 6-7 months for 40  hours a week, we became friends and even went to the gym together every morning after work. Around this time, the company decides to add another person to the shift. Sweet. Easier work load. 
     So the person who ends up applying for and being hired for this shift is my current boyfriend. We have been together for a while and though we keep everything on the DL, the company knows and they have zero issues with this. When we clock in, it's all business, folks. Anywho, all of a sudden after boyfriend starts the shift, other co-worker freaks the fuck out. At first she is just not speaking to or looking at either of us, and initially I'm thinking that she must be going through something outside of work. Me, concerned friend, confronts her about the behavior. She blows up on me and tells me that I ruined everything by ""bringing my boyfriend onto this shift"" and that that's why she refused to speak to us. Well first, the company hired him, not me. I am NOT management. When I tried to tell her that I was concerned and didn't understand what was happening as she had never voiced an opinion against him working with us, she put her hand up in my damn face and walked off. I cried. Me sensitive. I'm also mad that's she's treating boyfriend this way when he doesn't deserve it. This continues for some weeks, and we are nothing but uncomfortable at our jobs. We say we'll get through it together. 
    This whole situation took about 4-5 months to chill TF out, and we have all been getting along relatively well. My friendship with older co-worker was never the same, but I hate holding grudges and wanted to move past it. So I thought that's what we were doing. Then last week I was off (studying for a huge certification test) and boyfriend and other co-worker are the only two people there. Boyfriend told me that he felt a little odd and under the weather, but he tossed it up to not getting much sleep, and general nightshift plights. Monday comes around, we leave work in the morning, we go to sleep. Boyfriend wakes up with a hella fever, and he's like, oh shit. He calls out and starts doing everything he can to get better. 
    I come to work tonight, and then co-worker comes in two hours after me. I'm in the nearby restroom flossing jerky out of me teeth. Unnecessary detail, but realism. *Shrug* I come out and I hear co-worker being loud with the other people who are about to leave due to shift change. I say, ""Hold on, what happened?"" I just want to be in the know, you know? She then proceeds to tell me that she is FURIOUS with boyfriend because he didn't tell her he was feeling under the weather while he was at work. (I also want to mention that we wear masks at all time at work, as I'm sure many of us do these days.) I can maybe understand that? But then she says to all the other people, including me, ""You know, I like him, but I thought he was a better person than that. I cannot believe how dishonest he was and he needs to grow up and get a reality check. You can definitely believe I'm fucking saying something the next time I see him"". And then she starts yelling at me about work that needs to be done, and she directly attacks me about boyfriend again. I told her that I could not change anything that happened when I wasn't around. I get scared and I'm shaking. I don't do well with fights due to trauma in my past, but that's neither here nor there. She ended up later apologizing for attacking me but she is still attacking him. WHILE HE'S AT HOME SICK IN BED. Not even to his face. 
     I personally feel like this is a gross overreaction to this situation, especially as boyfriend didn't even know he was sick. And then when he did, he called out. I especially hate that she called his character into question over this in front of other people. I also am worried about how things will be from here on out, and I also feel like a complete asshole for not standing up for him like I feel I should have. I did tell her that I thought he did nothing maliciously, as he didn't know. I am mad and have been seething inside all night. I'm about to go home. What the hell should I do? I feel like she is intermittently harassing him. HELP. 

Thanks, guys.

397,"When me and my husband met he was a surgical resident in a hospital, when we moved together in a flat he did not earn much and I had to take care of most of the finances. However we both knew he'll start earning a lot once he becomes a surgeon, and he used to get sent to different places for conferences and most of the times he was able to have me go with him as well.

When he became a surgical fellow his pay increased by a lot, like about 200 K a year as he started private practice. We were able to buy a house, a car and pay off many of our loans. We also started saving money as well. He often suggested that I wouldn't need to work once he starts earning more. 

Now there was a position empty in some hospital in another city and we decided to move there, he has started to earn a lot, like 500K a year and it's likely that his earning will increase. However I've tried finding a job again but can't seem to find any due to lock down. He has been suggesting to me to look for hobbies or take commissions online or something but that I don't need to work anymore.

He recites that god created a Woman and a Man for a reason, I tell him that love is love no matter what. 

After hearing a few things from him on his drunken rant and him actively apologizing to me before he made some statements. The last straw came when he said that because he is white &amp; Asian (he looks like a white man with a tan) and has a “brown color” he knows what it feels like to be profiled and the racism behind it. That he knows the Hispanic/ Latino immigration and profiling difficulties because his Parents are also immigrants and while I do acknowledge that and see that they’ve gone through many things , it’s not the same as actually being black or Hispanic/ Latino. 

I am a fPOC so I was very offended and started to raise my voice a little and asked him if we could just drop the subject because I didn’t want to argue or debate or even hear anything about how people DONT deserve basic human rights. This is when E mutters,” I hate women”. 

That’s an insult to me and I reply immediately that that’s sexist &amp; that he’s a misogynist racist MF and I Am done talking about this.

400,"I'm 17(M). In a southeast Asian country. My parents are divorced. My biological father has joint custody but due to lockdown, I haven't seen him in a while. My mother remarried and I have 2 stepbrothers. My stepfather is a great person but he's outside the country due to covid. I never had the best relationship with my mother. She liked to insult me, beat me, you know, the whole mile.

Recently, since my final exams are coming up, I needed to study, since I'm still under lockdown, I've been attending online classes. My mom accuses me of playing computer games and other things. She said I'm not studying for the exam so I'm useless and a disappointment to her. So, she's threatening to give my biological father full custody or just leave me at a hotel for a week and I won't be considered her child anymore. 

My best option here would be to go to my father's place but he lives quite far away and I would have to switch schools. Unfortunately, the schools in his area are mostly Chinese schools and I dropped Mandarin during my first year of high school.

I want to get into a course in uni which is very hard and requires a lot of time, so I feel a bit burdened with her issues because I don't know what I can do and I don't like seeing her like this.

403,"First of all, I'd like to say I'm sorry if some people get bad feelings about this.

Idk how to start (or if this goes here), I feel like a piece of shit and lost all motivation in life.

I (m22) met a girl (20) last year. We got along really good. However, I did an exchange year after that but we kept contact. She liked me and I found her attractive, but nothing more.

About two months ago I came back and met some old friends and got tipsy. I came back home around 1 AM and then the girl called me telling me if she and her friends could stay at my place cause their place was far away, to which I kindly accepted without any intention. They brought alcohol (I asked her if she could bring) but I only drank (they were sober).

After that, she and I started to make out, and even more, but in my eyes everything was consensual. It was interesting cause it was the first sexual interaction that I had with someone, cause I'm really shy about that topic and don't usually talk much about it (sex) with girls alone (I was virgin at the time, but I'm not really sure if we had sex).

But I was really drunk and I had a blackout.

Around 5:30 AM I, still drunk but not blackout, wake up and see the girl all sad and the friends angry at me, telling me they are going to the police and I'm a horrible human being. I was so confused and feel like shit since that moment.

The next day a friend of mine told me the girl called her, telling her that I assaulted her (but wasn't specific how) and went to the police, but didn't press charges cause she didn't want to f my life and she just never wanted to see me again. I wrote her a letter (which my friend was gonna try to give her) telling her that is not her fault, she shouldn't feel like that and that I would like to do everything possible to help her, but I don't think it would work.

The next week the police called me telling me that she went, told that everything started consensual but after it wasn't, but they wouldn't investigate cause she didn't press charges, just told me that I shouldn't do that again.

Til this day I don't really know what happened but some people have been questioning me about the incident and what followed, to which I just tell the truth (or say I can't remember cause I really can't). And since that day I feel like shit. I've always considered myself as a good nature man, cause is not in my been to hurt someone, I feel really bad when I do it, but rn I don't know who I am.

I've always defended my friends about that kind of scenarios, I've had friends that have been victims and I've always told my male friends that NO IS NO, that THE VICTIM IS NEVER AT FAULT and of course flirting with someone doesn't mean you'll get sex, or that a person is obliged to have sex with you because for example you buy someone a drink. And now that I'm in this situation I just lost all motivation in life.

I'm in no way trying to victimize myself here, I just feel horrible and guilty knowing someone is suffering bc of me. I'm really anxious and nervous, even get nervous when I receive a WhatsApp message thinking I'll get more details about the night. I've lost a lot of friends (specially cause now is a gossip), some have told me that I did wrong but stayed cause they know I'm not like that but I don't really know. I've been going to a psychologist, I cry sometimes and change my habits, but honestly this has changed my life forever. I don't know what to do now.

TLDR: I got blackout drunk and assaulted a friend but don't know how. She didn't press charges but I feel like shit.",15Oct2020,1
404,"Me (22m) and my girlfriend (21f) have been together for only about 6 months, at the beginning of the relationship I genuinely thought I loved this girl, she was goofy and weird but the good kind of weird, we loved the same stuff and yeah she a cutie.

She suffers from a few mental illness and physical ones she told me a month or so after we met (neither bother me what so ever and I only ever wanted to help her with) mainly caused by a piece of shit that shouldn’t have the title of a mother and a ex-boyfriend that cheated, manipulated and forced her to do things she didn’t want to do (not r@pe but other things at the time she was not ready for).

In those almost 6 months we have been dating basically everyone except her mum and dad know because she’s scared of her mother (who also has mental illness’s and is also an abusive and manipulative c*** imo) is going to kick her out of the house for dating a non-Christian guy aka me.

I genuinely thought I could look past these and help here become her real self all the time like when she says she is around me, She even says that I am the only thing that makes her happy and shows her love, but after almost 6 months... idk if I mentally can take it anymore but I’m scared to call things off because I’m worried she may try to kill herself (she’s tried before this what cause her mum to kick her out of home before)

I did love this girl when we first met but now idk, it makes me both sad (mostly) and glad to think about leaving her. she always felt afraid to make decisions, tell me the truth of how she feels about stuff or how she really is even now after we have talked about and how it make both me and her feel, she still does it but she has also come a long way since we first met (thanks to me according to her).

Basically Should I break up with my girlfriend or try to work things out? Any advice at all please",15Oct2020,1
405,"it's a weird title but read, so in the past months of lockdown my mother started to listen to music more often than ever, actually before she rarely listened to anything ever, now she listens maybe... 6 hours a day minimum, not only that she do have her headphones and Bluetooth speaker so she can listen in her preferred area buy instead she likes to uses the tv because we have big speakers so it's almost a very loud party annoying to us and the neighbors i assume everyday. she listens before sleep when she wakes up , heck EVEN AT THE SHOWER.!

also i must add that it's not that sad depression kind of music she just listens to just stupid country music all day and one or two other preferred songs.

it's become really annoying to me ,my sisters doesn't care ,my father is not home most of the day so i have to listen to it since my room is right next to living room.

414,"So I'm a pretty shy person who has a very close circle of friends that are all girls. I've never really had a guy friend before, only guys I'd chat with during class (I'm in high school) but not outside of class. But recently, I've become pretty close friends with this one guy from an old friend group. 

To be very clear, we really are just friends and would never get into a romantic relationship. This is because he's very devoutly Christian, and I'm not religious at all. We've discussed our different perspectives before and disagree on basically everything. He's also just not my type in terms of personality or physical attraction if I'm being real.

I thought he was a nice guy at first, just a little different. Like he only hangs out with girls at school, or his own separate church friends outside of school. To be honest, my friends and I assumed he was gay at first because we ONLY saw him with girls. 

But once I talked to him a lot more it became kind of evident that he wasn't gay. Which is where my question about boundaries comes in, because I've never had a guy friend before and don't know if this is normal. Is it appropriate for guy friends to talk about being horny to girl friends? Like multiple times a day? 

He's very Christian and honestly I think that's why he's a bit sexually repressed. He keeps telling me that he wants sex (with other girls not me) ""physically"" but doesn't want to ""emotionally"". He's explained this to me multiple times already to the point where I just straight up told him to go jerk off or something because I don't know how to help him. He gets really guilty whenever he talks about sex-related things but can't seem to stop talking about them. We're usually just chatting about life and then out of the blue he turns the topic to the ""distracting thoughts"" he keeps having. 

I joke about it with him because I feel sorry that he's so uncomfortable around sex, but also, he talks about this multiple times a day and I'm not a sex therapist. Or maybe I'm just unfamiliar with how guys talk and this is what they talk about? Sex?

I don't know. My girl friends don't like him at all from what I've told them, but he's a good friend most of the time. I mean, sure, my girl friends and I talk about boys but not about feeling turned on all the time. I feel like that's something to keep entirely to yourself. 

So is this normal? Should I draw some boundaries, or do guy friends just talk like this?",15Oct2020,1
416,"So I've just got a new job - woo exciting and a massive relief considering covid etc. I got the job through an agency who are great and I've been with them for years now. 

The job is supposed to be working from home 4 days a week, 1 day a week in the office. We were supposed to do 3 days training from last Wednesday-Friday and be working from home since this past Monday. In order to work from home though, they are providing a laptop loaded with relevant software. The company has not sorted this out and theres a whole team of 4 if us waiting for this to happen. Apparently it's about getting things signed off and approved etc before we can get the stuff we need. In the meantime they've given us very minimal training, mostly just reading their website for an hour each day and sitting doing nothing the rest of the days. This is really getting annoying, I don't see why we can stay at home and do the training if our gear isn't ready yet? 

What should I do here? Yes I'm getting paid to do nothing all day, but also I'm being forced to come into an office that I'm not supposed to see apart from one day a week. Also the city I live in is very high risk for covid and part of the reason I went for this job was to avoid it as much as possible. 

This has been going on for almost a week and a half, just sitting here... waiting. They keep saying tomorrow, tomorrow and the whole team is getting annoyed honestly. Not sure what to do... do I speak to my agent or to the boss of the department here? 

Speaking of which the boss here hasn't said a word to us all day, he hasn't set us any tasks or training to do. He's in the back. Hasn't said a single word. 

I've got a pretty tight budget to stick to and it's getting to the point where I can't afford to keep coming in. The budget is tight coz I'm saving to make a big purchase at the end of my contract, and this is really eating into money that I wasn't even planning to spend. I understand that isn't anyone issue other than mine, but that is the practical implication of what's going on. 

So...any advice?",15Oct2020,1

We are also still very busy, even with Covid happening, which is unusually for this time of year.  We are also quite short staffed, so all managers have to put in extra work to pick up the slack.  I can barely get one full day off a week.

I talked to my boss about getting burned out.  He suggested some changeups to my schedule so I don't have to close as much, but there is only so much I can do.  I have to work around the other managers' schedules who are in college classes.  I'm the only one with full time availability.  As it is right now, I can't get away from closing at least twice a week, and working 12 hour shifts.

I feel as if I have no time to do anything else in my life, like to better myself.  I want to work on my diet and exercise, but I am so exhausted physically and mentally every day.  I've actually contemplated calling in to say I have Covid symptoms, just to maybe get a few days off.  If I try to schedule myself less hours, he will just add more on later.

Other than just trying to call off, I thought about just trying to decrease my work performance.  I'm having a hard enough time as is just getting everything done already.  But maybe just slacking on some of my other duties would help get his attention that I'm overworked.  It's obviously not ideal, but I can't really afford to get another job right now.

424,"So when I was 12 and I first hit puberty, my sex drive went through the roof and I had no concept of what was right or wrong sexually. My sister was 11 at the time. 

I used to play these “games” with her which would involve inappropriate touching or grinding and I’m sure she was uncomfortable with it even if she never said so, because she is the kind of person that never really spoke up. 

At the time I didn’t see anything wrong with it, idk if I was too blinded by hormones or if I was just a complete fucking idiot but now that I’ve gotten older I realize how terrible it was. I feel horrible for what I did and it keeps me awake at night thinking about what kind of emotional damage I might have caused her. Obviously we’ve long since moved past that and we get along great (supposedly) but I can’t help but wonder if she’s suppressing any trauma caused by me or faking a smile every time I see her. I’m worried I may have given her anxiety or depression or PTSD or god knows what else. I don’t know what I can do to make up for it or if there’s any way to truly move past it. 

It’s been 10 years since all of that happened and I really don’t know what I can do or how I can make up for it, or if there’s any way to check if I did any long term damage. Ive already apologized before but she would quickly say “oh no no it’s okay we were just kids” and immediately change the subject which makes me think she’s suppressing it. How can I apologize in a way that seems truly sincere and maybe can help her with any emotional damage it might have done? Or should I even do anything?

426,"So, I've had to leave my old industry to join the world of retail because of 'rona. I've never worked retail before and am now working in a jewellery shop. I'm not stupid, I've had jobs with crazy levels of responsibility before, and I've never had trouble learning my job, but until now, Ive always been given a CHANCE to learn. 

It's the end of week 1 for me, I've been there for about 30 hours all up. there's a manager and an assistant manager, who between them, have 50 years of experience working in jewellery. They have never changed industries, and obviously don't remember what it's like to have to learn. 

I think they might both be bullies, but I don't know if this is just what it's like working retail. 

I was writing up some paperwork for a customer today and the manager came over and slapped my hands away and went 'NO. We don't do it like that!' even though that's what the other manager had told me to do. Three times in about 5 mins she slapped my hands away, took the pen herself and went 'NO.' then she apologised to the customer on my behalf saying 'sorry, she's so slow, she's learning and it's just...' then she made this really loud put-upon sigh like there's something wrong with me for not just 'knowing' this stuff the customer looked really embarrassed for me... I was embarrassed for me... 

This shit happens constantly. In front of customers 'NO! We don't do it like that' 'NO, Press that button, what are you DOING?' 

Another customer was buying a deeply sentimental gift for a friend who has recently lost a child. I told the manager this and said as it was such a special gift, I wanted to give her a nicer box to store it in. The manager's response when I told her that the friend's child had died? 'That's life.' I got literal chills from such a callous answer... 

like... is this normal behaviour? 

I know beggars can't be choosers, but OMG. I've been there for a week and I already feel sick about the thought of going back in.

429,"I work in Manhattan (well, from my home in Brooklyn now) for a fairly sizable tech company that is a household name in the US. I like my job. I’m challenged; I’m still learning new things; I get along with my coworkers; and the benefits are really nice. I also have my firstborn due in about 6 weeks. And I’ll get 12 weeks of paid paternity leave. 

Recently, the CEO of a former company I worked for started a new company, and reached out to me to take on a major position there. The salary will be possibly as much as 35% more than I’m currently earning, I’ll probably get a great deal of equity, and the position will be hugely influential in the company. They recently landed a sizable round of funding and have their engineering team built out, and are likely going to land another round of funding soon. I don’t think it is at risk of failing within the next few years, so relatively stable. And they may have a shot. 

I feel like making that jump is a) risky, and b) will be hugely challenging in a lot of ways. I don’t like the idea of starting a new job as my son is born (and losing out on that paternity leave), but it is a rare opportunity and fell at my feet. If the company is successful, I’ll have leapfrogged my way to the top from my current role. If the company sells to a bigger company a few years down the road, I’ll probably get a nice little retirement cushion.

My course was meant to be 3 months and because the pandemic started a few weeks after it ended up going for 8 months. I applied for multiple jobs in this new field and they wanted people with qualifications so I took super out to help with rent and got a Roommate. (Not meant to sublease) but it was only for a few months. 

I have started a new job and will be down on funds for a couple of weeks as Centrelink payment will stop and the Roommate has up and left me with no notice.

I applied for hardship with the real estate and they sent me a Covid hardship application form and asked for bank statements. Although I can’t send bank statements because it has evidence I’ve been renting my spare room out.

I was dating this girl for about a year. Our relationship wasn't perfect by any means. I was going through a lot of stuff at the time and often let out my depressing emotions around her. She wasn't perfect either but we got along for the most part.

 Anyway, we broke up a few months after the pandemic started. One of my friends, I'll call him Jake, told me that the girl was giving him weird vibes. When I asked what he meant he elaborated by saying that he feels like she is trying to flirt or tease him (sexually). Neither he nor she had proof but after talking to the girl about it we decided to break up. That was not the only reason we broke up but it was a big factor. We are still friends though and she likes to call and talk to me every so often. 

Anyway the other day, another one of my friends told me that Jake got head from my now Ex. (I know that she was likely the aggressor because.... let's say she enjoys sex a lot). This information bothered me a lot because of what Jake told me before I decided to break up with her. I feel pretty hurt and a little betrayed. Now, whenever I talk to her I wanna bring it up to her but what am I gonna say, ""you sucked another guy's dick when you are single and I am also single!"" 

It feels like I should just get it off my chest and at least tell her how I feel. Or should I just not say anything? Or should I do something completely different?

436,"I know I'm not the first person making this kind of post but I am honestly at my wit's end and desperately need advice. It's baffling to me that I have to seek advice on getting someone to do something that should not even be up for discussion. 

My brother never washes his hands after he uses the bathroom, or when he gets home. It honestly disgusts me. Whenever I ask him to stop (or rather, to start) and I start explaining to him the rational and factual reasons why you *should* wash your hands after you use the bathroom or after you have been outside, he just laughs in my face. To him, this is just one of my many clean-freak delusions. 

Sometimes I insist and he simply turns the water on and pretends to wash them, or at best he rinses them for like 0.2 seconds. I don't understand why he is so against something that takes a minute? 

I admit that in some cases I can be a bit extra when it comes to hygiene, but washing your hands after you touch your own excrements or after you go outside, especially during a fucking pandemic (which of course he doesn't believe in) seems pretty legitimate to me.

It makes me want to cry, both because it seriously grosses me out since he lives in the same house as me, and because I hate being completely dismissed and ignored. How can I get him to change his mind?  The only thing I can think of is the silent treatment because logic doesn't seem to get through his disgusting skull.

For the record, he is 18 and I'm 21, so I've given up on the hopes that he'd grow out of it. Moving out is not an option in the near future thanks to coronavirus.",15Oct2020,1

438,"Throwaway because I'm mortified to even type this. 

I'm a mid 20s gay woman, and for the past 5 years I've been obsessed with the idea of being someone else, to the point of constant self criticism. 

Bit of background

I didn't even know gay women existed as a kid, but I knew I had feelings for girls by the age of 6 or so. When I was a child I constantly looked up to men and had male role models, mainly soccer stars, because nothing about women or famous women/typical role models seemed to resonate with me. The person I want to be like is a (semi) famous female athlete, and is exactly the type of woman who, if I'd known women like this existed, I would've loved as a kid. It's almost like I've got a childlike wanting-to-be syndrome but as an adult. 

The athlete (let's call her KT), is everything I would like to be... she has managed to find a balance between her faith and sexuality (something I struggled with for 15 years, and have managed to find peace with, in part, because of her approach to faith), she is openly gay without being loud and proud (appeals to me as I am also an introvert), and is very good looking, an awesome athlete, physically extremely fit and confident. I am physically fairly in shape (obviously not a professional athlete), and I'm not bad looking and have had decent success getting girlfriends and having girls interested in me, despite growing up in a small town. 

I have found myself adopting a lot of different negative habits since I discovered KT, which are super unhealthy and I don't know what to do. I am now extremely critical of my body and my face, to the point of extreme dysmorphia. I had a tooth removed as a kid and some bad dental work, so my lower jaw is quite asymmetrical, but it isn't that noticeable to strangers (so I'm told), but KT has a great face and a perfect lower jaw, and I compare myself constantly. KT is a professional athlete, so has a fantastic physique with a lot more muscle mass and a lot lower bodyfat than me (I'm not effeminate so this is very appealing). KT is an inch and a half taller, and clothes seem to fit her better. Etc etc.

This has made me really struggle to be in photographs, particularly in the last 2 years or so. I struggle looking at my face in the mirror, and feel a lot of dysmorphia about my body. I love the team that she plays on and am a big fan of her as an athlete, so I feel like it would be negative to cut exposure to her out of my life. I don't know what to do, every time I seek Google advice it's just things like ""learn that people come in all shapes and sizes"" and I don't find that particularly helpful. I have no idea how to like myself, particularly physically, it is quite hard too because I don't crave being 'skinny' or looking like a model or being effeminate or any of those things, and all the advice geared towards women and getting over body dysmorphia seems quite centred around those things. 

I feel super creepy and quite lame too that I am in my mid 20s and I feel this way towards another human I've never met who doesn't know I exist. I was never like this as a teenager or anything, so I don't know where it has come from, I just know it is starting to really rule my self image! Apart from very poor self image, I actually have great mental health, I don't have depression or anxiety or any of those types of issues, I sleep well and I take great care of myself physically. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever experienced the same and what I could do?",15Oct2020,1

440,"Hi, redditors. As the title says, I just want to know why I am self destructive regarding my study and my career. I know pretty well that if I study and work on myself now, then my life will be different forever. I have a great opportunity now to be special, and what confuses me is that I am not moving towards this opportunity. I have the resources. There is no circumstances holding me back or anything. Everything is just perfect for me to work, but I am not working, and I just don't know why. 

There is something wrong with me that I don't know. I find myself spending time reading books about psychology in order to find out my problem and try to solve it, but this never ends. I never discover the problem. I am just avoiding studying or doing any productive thing. I can keep browsing music for hours, or watching movies or playing classic old games that reminds me of my childhood. Can do anything other than studying. 

This is not the only problem I have. I have another problem, that I feel really guilty, not because of wasting the opportunity on myself, but because I am failing people who trust me. What do you think I should do in order to be productive and successful on the long run? I am avoiding studying by creating any excuse. I got really really good at making excuses for almost anything. specially studying. It sounds like there is no way out except for forcing myself to work. I have tried that and it back fired. I stay for longer periods without studying after I force myself for a week. Maybe I stay a month without studying after that week. 

Need your advice please?

Thanks in advance and have a good day.

I’ve never really known what I want to do. I knew I wanted to help people or the environment, and work largely outside of an office, but what I didn’t know!

A few months ago, I met an amazing man. We dated for a while but he decided he wasn’t ready to commit. I was completely okay about it because I knew deep down that I needed to sort out what I was doing with my life before I could commit to somebody either.

The thing is, his career sparked something inside of me. It’s something I could see myself doing, it’s something I know I would love and meets most of my tick boxes. I’ve done the research, and it’s something I could do if I get the degree (which I have the entry requirements for).

I suppose the only thing holding me back is whether this is weird. Imagine if he encounters me in 10 years time only to discover I have copied his career. I fear this will make me appear crazy!

453,"I (19F) broke up with my girlfriend recently because I know we aren't compatible for the future. I had been fighting the feeling but I finally knew I needed to tell her. It's been very hard and we are living together so we're trying to navigate that and there have been good and bad times. 

The thing thats hard is that I'm in another state away from my family, I don't really have anyone here. I have some co-workers I'm friends with but there's no one I can really go see. Now my girlfriend's family, who has always disliked me for some reason, is manipulating her into telling me to leave, which is what neither of us want to do. We can totally see ourselves transitioning into friends, even if it's hard. But her family is being very mean and telling her to go hang out with new people and leave me alone and of course I want her to be busy and meet people, but the way they're talking to her about me just adds on to the massive guilt I already feel. To be quite honest it makes me angry. Her family (specifically mom and sister) has been nothing but mean to me. The rest of her family likes me but I just know her mom and sister love to talk s*** about people and I know some of the things they are saying.

It's hard because when me and my girlfriend talk, we have productive conversations and genuinely work through things. We both don't want to be out of eachother's lives, and we had had an amazing friendship before we started dating and definitely want to rekindle that. We're almost about to start therapy to help us heal from this. But then she has her manipulative family talking s*** about me and it's obviously getting on her head. 

I am trying so hard not to hold resentment, but it's difficult knowing they're telling her lies and speaking on the situation that they seriously don't know anything about.

460,"Sorry for formatting I’m on my phone. I (15M) am in my sophomore year at a public American high school. Back in March, our entire school closed so we can quarantine in our homes, and we basically had no way of missing out on our grades (a new temporary policy was that no matter what we did, there was no way for us to lower our grades). I won’t lie, I did slack off a little, but I ended the year with a solid GPA and felt pretty accomplished with my academics, and didn’t miss school at all. Now fast forward to today, October, my school has had optional re openings. I originally decided to stay at home because I didn’t want to put my family at risk (which was probably a smart decision: two students tested positive but were removed from campus quick enough for it not to be spread). Now, around 4/5 of the students have decided to go in person. While I do feel like I would benefit from in person school, my county has the most cases in my state, and my state has some of the highest cases in the country. Another factor to consider is that I had originally gone to a different high school, and when I transferred here I had only spent around a month here before quarantine began. I only made a handful of friends in the time, and while I do have extremely close friends I see every weekend I still get uncomfortable not knowing everyone in the room, especially when they all know each other.

477,"Alright, this is going to be a long one. So, to start off, my mother and I constantly fight. I am almost 17 and I live with her. My dad lives with his new wife in a few cities away, and I don't like him either.

For months now, I've been telling my therapist about the crazy shit my mom does and I ask her to bring it up with my mother. I know my therapist is talking to her about it but my mom says that she IS listening to her when clearly she isn't. She claims to my therapist that I have a hormone imbalance and that I have anger issues. Just an FYI, I'm on meds for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. My mom is only on anxiety meds that were NOT prescribed to her by a psychiatrist, our family doctor put her on those. Considering how that doctor prescribed me the wrong meds for my mental problems, I have a feeling that my mother's meds aren't right as well.

Anyway, this is mainly about schoolwork. My mom does this thing where she assumes she knows what she's talking about with everything about me (my emotions, mentality, my ""laziness"", etc). I have trouble concentrating, hence why I'm on Adderall for concentration and/ or ADHD. Since I can barely concentrate, I have piles of missing work that I CANNOT complete because my brain is stopping me from doing it. I explain it to my mother, who has no idea how hard it is and what I'm feeling, and she tells my therapist and psychiatrist that I'm being lazy.

What made me finally seek Reddit for help was what happened this morning. The other day, I was cleaning out my Google Drive and I must have not been careful because I somehow deleted attached files from my teachers in Google Classroom. What this means is that the file no longer exists and I dumbed it down to my mom by just saying the files got corrupted. Makes sense, right? Not to her. She asks me why I can't open the files. I repeat myself again, saying the files got corrupted. She's still not getting it so I dumb it down even more, and she accuses me of talking to her in a way that makes it seem like she's an idiot. It's not the first time she's said that to me, AND she talks to me like that also, so I was livid. I was defending myself in a harsh tone because that's how I talk, in a defensive manner. Well, she says that I'm yelling at her and she actually YELLS in my ear right next to me and gets up all in my space when I have told her repeatedly to get out of my space because it stresses me out. After that happens, she threatens to take away my computer, the computer I spent my own hard-working part-time job money on, AND my phone, which I'm paying off monthly to my Nana, who isn't my mom.

My point is, I'm so fed up with her threats and accusations and her refusal to listen. Also after we've fought, she starts talking to me like nothing happened. I do not know what I can do.",15Oct2020,1
478,My mom knows I have adhd and I quite possibly have bipolar disorder but I hope it's not. Im also handicap and losing my ability to walk. My sister has college online so shes been staying home and I have frequent energy bursts at night where I feel like a rockstar and because im retarded I forget sister has school even though she sometimes is loud on the phone with her boyfriend at night. But that's the difference between me and my sister I've always been the trouble maker and she's always the one who is under a lot of stress so she doesn't need to apologize. So last night I was loud and just today my mom said I need to find a new place to stay if I have one more episode. I want to move out but I dont have a driver's license and where I'm from that means no job and me being crippled also limits that. I just need help I dont know what to do anymore,15Oct2020,1
479,"I am 20(F) and i have no dating experience whatsoever which is why i am asking perhaps a bit generic question.
So i recently met this guy (ive seen him before and was briefly attracted to him) through a mutual friend. We did not hang out much (for about 15 min for a cigaratte break while he was at work) but i really liked him he was cute sweet smart etcetc. 
I am not sure how to approach him,i do not feel comfortable asking the mutual friend since we are  ot on that level of friendship right now, or even if i should approach him at all. I followed him on instagram but he has not followed me back (which likely means he forgot he even met me since he follows a lot of people back) so i cant start a conversation there (not that i would know how to necessarly) but i was thinkinkig of just casually walking by the shops he works at (its on a popular street so it wouldnt be too weird) bc i know he gets bored at work a lot and talks to ppl on the street quite often so maybe i could start a conversation in that way? Or would that be weird? (I have a bit of social anxiety and i do not know how ppl usually approach this things/ how would he percieve that).

In addition at first i thought he was also attracted to me as there were some signs (he looked at me a lot throughot the convo and filled me in on the gaps in his stories, in general he engaged quite a lot with me even tho i was just randomly there besides his good friend) but looking back at it he is probably just a very nice and outgoing person?

Idk i just want to know what people of this subreddit think about this situation and how would you persue anything if at all).",15Oct2020,1
480,"So kind readers of this sub, please help me with the following situation if you are free.   


I have been talking to this girl since September, we started talking to each other purely based on being Internet friends but then we started to discover so many similarities between each other. Those similarities are not common ones, they are weird ones. We live on 2 different continents, to put it simply we live 8k miles apart from each other. There is a 99.9% chance of us never meeting ever or getting together.   


The first month of our talking, I was casual, I was seeing her as a friend. I was exploring similarities and differences between each other's cultures and lifestyles. It was like friends talk to each other in the initial phases. I was totally fine as I have been my whole life, never had a strong crush or was in a relationship, or felt anything for anyone ever this powerful. It is also not as I haven't or don't talk to girls other than her. I have been doing it for years in real life and on the internet(different platforms) but never felt this powerful ever.   


One month went by and I have started to feel different for her, she is now on my mind almost all the times, I wake up at night and feel as she is calling my soul even when I am avoiding her social media, she recently told that she is diagnosed with a sickness of some sort and I feel as someone has torn my interior apart. I wish that it was rather me than her in this situation.   


I wish that I could just near her, see her happy, make her happy, see her all the time, and even pray for her to get a suitable partner in the future who cares for her. It is that her recent sadness has made me so sad, I have never left so many emotions for someone this way and with this much power. She probably sees me as a curious friend from far away and that is it.   


I have contemplated ways of how we can be together but if all fails and all is very much impossible. I am feeling a weird sensation in my stomach. The prospect of me never meeting her has made me most sad and pissed, I have been my whole life. Her revelation of her illness has torn me apart.   


I plan to bury my emotions and not tell her all this because I don't want to risk our friendship in any case scenario. I have avoided her social media for it to get better but it gets worse. Also, should I convey this to her and discuss this with her?   


So, am I in love, or is it just a young adult feeling infatuation for someone for the first time?",15Oct2020,1
481,"I usually avoid asking random strangers on the internet questions, but I’m completely lost on what to do, so here I am. 

I recently emailed my singing teacher, asking if we could work on a song called Little Miss Perfect. If you’ve heard the song, you know what it’s about. If not, a short summary is it’s about a girl who’s lesbian but tries to deny it because she has to be perfect. I really relate to it so I wanted to get to know the song better. 

I was nervous to ask her because she is very conservative (I know because she wears a pro life pin EVERY lesson), but I eventually worked up the nerve to ask.  She responded to the email with “Well, I’m not really comfortable with the lyrics. Is there anything else you like?” To which I replied “Nope, that’s all for now!”

I immediately assumed it was because of the obvious gay topic, but I suppose there could be other reasons. There’s a very brief mention of drinking, and I suppose just kissing could be uncomfortable for some people.

Now, I’m the type of person to respect other people’s opinions, even if the opinion is trash, and just agree to disagree. But if it has to do with whether or not my sexuality is valid I struggle to do so. 

Now, here’s my question: do I ask what about the lyrics made her uncomfortable and if so, how? And if it is because the gay theme of the song, would it be wrong of me to find a new instructor? My parents are giving me differing opinions, so I’m lost on what to do.",15Oct2020,1

483,"I'm 20F, a senior in college. I transferred into my current university with a lot of business credits, but I ultimately decided to study international relations.

I realized that if I stay for an extra year studying part-time, I could graduate with two degrees: a bachelor of science in business with a concentration in economics, and a bachelor of arts in IR and global politics.

I'm feeling a little tired and I'm not sure if the extra year of tuition is worth it, though I'll have plenty of time to work part-time too. Picking up the extra degree is also partially a procrastination method so that I can work, save up some money, and try to plan my next steps and legal situation (I'm an American studying in Europe. Me and my boyfriend (German) are planning on getting married but need to straighten out our finances to be in line with our respective embassies.

I'm also a little bit scared. Going back to the United States isn't really an option because my life is here, but if I can't find a job to sponsor my visa or magically come up with the finances to get married now, I won't really have a choice. The pandemic has changed a lot of stuff, so I especially feel like I'll have to bite the dust if I graduate right now. 

If I drop the business degree, I'll still graduate in IR with a minor in Economic Development; the minor has already been completed at this point. I'm willing to put in the work for the business degree... But I'm so ready to be done with my undergrad. 

I know what I want to study for my master's degree (Agricultural economics and urban development), but I'm not entirely sure if the politics degree will be enough.",15Oct2020,1
484,"So what did I post that was so offensive?? I constructed a ‘festive’ bubble wrap vest (complete with Christmas wrapping paper and a ‘FRAGILE’ sticker) with the following copy:

“For the very special snowflake in your life! Handmade on B\*\*\*n, sourced with artisanal, second-hand foraged materials for a reduced impact. Rejoice as all the triggers of the generic holiday season bounce right off your chest like gumdrops bouncing off a gender-neutral ginger being. Effectively blocks any mention of Santa, elves, baby Jesus, dreidels, Kwanza, Christmas party invitations, and holiday cheer. Priced at $5000 per adult, $2000 per child. All proceeds to B\*\*\*n Island Montessori School”

Why did I post this? Well… in our small community of 3500 we had a hardcore atheist family sue the local preschool through the Human Rights Tribunal… and they won (each parent was awarded $5000 and the child received $2000)!!! This family is notoriously insufferable, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that they followed through (at great personal expense) with suing a preschool over the presence of Christmas related curriculum in the classroom. Even worse is that there seems to be some support for this family for their commitment to ‘social justice’ - this is not social justice and it makes a complete mockery of the human rights tribunal, in my opinion!

Almost immediately after posting my ‘ad’ I found myself blocked from the buy/sell page… when I tried to appeal with the main admin for the page I came to realize that I was facing an absolute cow of a woman. No rules were broken and I still feel like deleting my post would have been sufficient. Do you think I crossed any lines with what I posted?

I also cross-posted this very same ‘ad’ to the community discussion Facebook page… where it remains to this day! A year ago I finally met the admin for the community Facebook page in person and introduced myself as ‘the bubblewrap vest guy’ - to which she burst out laughing, and proceeded to tell me about all the messages she received DEMANDING that my post be pulled, haha!

I should point out that I do not condone bullying and I believe that social justice/equality is of great importance. I would also like to point out that I have faced a great deal of bullying growing up, from which I learned to be resilient and look out for others who are at a disadvantage. 

As I discover more about the woman who is the main admin for the buy/sell page (let’s call her Karen) I find myself increasingly frustrated by the stories my neighbours share about her being a bully. Karen teaches at the local Elementary school and is a really polarizing figure… to her the world is Black &amp; White and she can NEVER be wrong. One of her colleagues told me a story of how Karen spent an entire Professional Development Day making fun of a local family’s drug problems, real professional! My main issue with Karen is that she is a power-tripper and her role as admin enables her nastiness. (I have more stories, but I think you get the point!)

I just want to be allowed back on so I can (respectfully) engage in my local buy/sell page... how should I proceed, kind folks of Reddit?",15Oct2020,1

486,"I'm a senior in high school rn. I'm currently running a club with another kid, and I'm also working with him in Physics. I won't get into much detail, but in the past this kid embarrassed me roughly a year ago. I confronted him about it over the summer, when I had more time to think about things, and we had a long talk about it. He said that he was sorry and wasn't trying to hurt me, and simply wanted to see something funny.

Looking back, I can also name numerous instances of him saying mean stuff to me, which also happened roughly a year ago. Stuff like ""You're a school shooter"" and ""The whole school saw the pic"" and ""You won't ever get a wife"". For some reason I never really took into thought his comments towards me in the moment they happened o any time before quarantine really. However, as I was dwelling on the pic he took of me, I started dwelling on the additional comments he said as well.

And so I confronted him about those comments. 

He said that the pic spread to the whole school because I wouldn't stop bugging him and asking him how many people saw the pic. He would give a reasonable answer, like a few people, and then I would ask again. So apparently he figured that telling me the whole school saw it would shut me up. Whatever.

For the other comments, he either says that it was a joke or that he doesn't remember saying them. I kept hammering him with questions until he decided to block me until yesterday. Yesterday he unblocked me, because like I said, both him and I are co-leaders of the same club, and we work together in Physics, and therefore we have to have some communication in order to keep the club moving smoothly. However, I'm itching to get more answers from him, but I know it's pointless because he'll deny it.

I'm not even scared of this kid. He's about half my size and looks and sounds like a toddler.

I have this revenge plot in mind, but I don't know if carrying it out would make me feel better.

To get retribution, I'm thinking about making a false Reddit account under his name, and wrote some nasty Reddit posts as well pretending to be him. I then logged out, snapshotted the account and its posts, and then sent them to 5 people in an attempt to get them to spread without everyone knowing that it was me who ""found"" the account. Therefore, everyone will hate him and he can get in trouble and at the same time I myself wouldn't have to get in trouble because I still want to go to college and build a future for myself.

He has reddit and so I chose this subreddit because I’m pretty sure he does not follow it but I will delete this. When we first started texting he would send me random texts, pictures of pets, and memes. Always at 3am he’d send me a slightly edgy depression joke and I did not really take it seriously. Recently he’s been cutting and talking about feeling hopeless about the future. I cut as well but more for fun so I understand the appeal and try to understand why he does it. He sent me a photo of blood stained onto a piece of tissue. His parents found out through his therapist and hid the knives, he found one and hides it.  He’s talking about killing himself, I take it with a grain of salt, but I want to help in case the danger is real for him. I told him that he’s young and life gets better, he’s so young but so hopeless. He told me he thought about slitting his throat, I didn’t know how to respond. Death was something I planned around 35 for myself and so I feel like a hypocrite texting him about stopping. Everything feels wrong, he wants to kill himself and I feel helpless. I want him to understand he shouldn’t be alone, he shouldn’t be thinking by himself, he needs to focus on the bright side. Being alone just brings those thoughts of emptiness which drive you insane.

I dropped out of college 2 years ago and still owe some school loans, but I just need someone to show me the light out of this dark tunnel if there is even a light out of this. but here goes... I am bored of life, I remember during my schooling years, I was so bored, I hate going to the same place everyday to sit in a class room, and I can't imagine being happy having a job working at the same place everyday, office politics and all that. That's why i dropped out, I find my Asperger's really in the way of me being able to fit in and liked by people, and if I do get a job, it would be the same. That's why when I dropped out, I was thinking of committing suicide shortly after because I thought maybe this world isn't for me, nobody likes me, I'm sorta dumb or society makes me feel that way, I do things in way I find efficient in a proper manner and it somehow triggers other people. I'm still alive now 2 years later and never worked before.

494,"I'm struggling to decide whether I should choose French or Japanese as my major/minor in university. I would be really grateful if you'd be able to give some advice!

&amp;#x200B;

**FRENCH:**

***Benefits:***

* I studied it in high school for around 4 years, so I have a foundation. I also think it's a beautiful language.
* French is used in many countries (e.g. France, Switzerland, parts of Africa), and could potentially help my future career &amp; when I travel.
* The number of people who speak French is expected to rise significantly by 2050.
* As a native English speaker, it would be much, much easier for me to learn French than Japanese.

***Drawbacks:***

* When I was studying French in high school, I found grammar to be a pain in the ass, not to mention pronunciation.
* It's unlikely I'll travel to France/countries which speak French.
* It's unlikely I'll use French after uni.

**JAPANESE:**

***Benefits:***

* I'm interested in Japanese culture and I've always wanted to learn the language.
* I'm planning on moving to Singapore/Asia in the future, so it might help me.
* I'm more likely to visit Japan than France.

***Drawbacks:***

* Japanese is notoriously difficult to learn. 2200 hours are needed for a person to become fluent in Japanese, while French only requires 600 hours.
* It's unlikely I'll use Japanese after uni (except for going to Japan on holiday).
* Japanese is mostly only spoken in Japan.

500,"I’m a 16 year old girl from the Philippines. I’d like to think that I had a relatively normal childhood, despite the stress that festered as a result of academic pressure weighing down on me. As a child, my parents always  made sure that I got high grades, sometimes even beating me or threatening to kick me out of the house for low marks. I remember once, vividly, how my mother threw my Chinese workbook at my face when I couldn’t quite grasp the concept as quickly as she wanted it to. I know this type of treatment isn’t necessarily unheard of, especially when it comes to POC households, and it may even be considered shallow because other people have significantly got it worse. I was quite a gifted kid back in the day. I spoke English really well, could breeze through adult level books in the third grade like it was nothing, I got awards for being a top student, I was adored by my parents.

But as I grew older, I started slipping. It started in my first year of high school, where I’d gotten my first failing grade, ever. It was’t even a line of 7, but a 65. In my entire life, I had never gotten such horrendous results. As someone who relied on their grades to have a good connection with their family, I was visibly distraught and had multiple breakdowns in school upon hearing this news. (TW // self harm) I even tried to cut my wrists when I came home that night because I was more keen on meeting death than hearing my parents’ screaming match, telling me why I couldn't be as good as I was before. Asking me what happened, what I had become.

I don’t remember much after that. The rest of my Junior High School years passed by in a blur of memories locked too far away for me to tamper with.

Now, I’m in 11th grade. I get sudden bouts of anger, and they take days before the burning feeling fades out. This gets triggered by almost anything. I’ve looked up sources online and it points to depression and anxiety, which I’m not sure I have, as well as alcoholism, which I’m definitely sure I don’t have, since I’ve only had alcohol on very rare occasions. After the anger, I just feel empty. I come crawling back to my shell where I stay desolate and listless until something pulls me out of it. Then there’s the intrusive thoughts and bouts of recklessness. The moods change over notable time periods, but they feel frequent? I can’t quite describe it. I feel like I should be doing everything, but knowing that I won’t be able to bring out the best keeps me from trying. My thoughts race through my head at thousands of miles an hour, and there’s so much of everything that it hurts my head.

503,"I am an NCAA college track athlete in my 5th year of running at my university. My girlfriend of 2 years is also on the team. Last year we got a new coach, we’ll call him coach Floyd. Coach Floyd and I have a great relationship and I ran my fastest times with him last year before the shut down. I even spent last thanksgiving with coach Floyd and his family since I couldn't see my own because I had to train.

My parents and I planned to spend Thanksgiving with my sister and grandparents. They planned a trip for all of us to take my grandfather to the beach in Corpus Christi. My sister just recently recovered from a tough bout with breast cancer and my grandpa has multiple myeloma. With the way things are going my family says this is the most likely the last thanksgiving we'll have with my grandpa because his cancer is getting worse. With all that being said, it is very important for me to spend time with my family.

On Monday, my gf and I approached Coach Floyd after practice to tell him that we’ll miss two days of practice on November 23rd and 24th since we’ll be leaving for the trip on that Saturday.

Coach Floyd- “you are on scholarship so I expect both of you to be here.“

Me- “coach, I’m sorry but this is something i cannot compromise on, this is my family I’m talking about here”

CF- ”You cannot be missing practice, \*stands up and points finger at me\* THAT IS NOT OKAY”

Me- “Like i said coach this is my family I cannot miss out on spending time with them on thanksgiving”

CF- “Okay so if you're not going to be here then you don't mind me cutting your scholarship then right?”

Me- “Do whatever you need to do, my family is important to me.”

CF- “Go ahead and tell the head coach that your scholarship is cut, or better yet - tell him you're off the team ”

Me- “This is fucking ridiculous.”

CF-” Don't you ever cuss at me again treat me with respect.”

Me- ”you need to treat you athletes with more respect.”

CF- “GET OUT, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN!”

Tuesday came and at practice my coach didn't say a word to me or my gf the entire practice. After I called and texted both the head coach and coach Floyd to set up a meeting. They both screened my call and didn't text me back. On Wednesday I came and coach Floyd ignored and and my gf all practice again. To make matters worse, he set up a meeting with the team captains at the start of practice and purposely excluded me out even though I am a 4 year team captain. At practice today he was going above and beyond for all of my teammates and giving all this encouragement and advice to everyone except me and my gf, he acted like we weren't there.

I’ve been doing everything I can to resolve the situation, but my coach has just ignored me. It feels unprofessional, and unethical. What should I do next?",15Oct2020,1

507,"I'll make it as short as possible

So I enrolled in a pretty okay, little hard University in mechanical engineering after flunking 4 subjects out of 7 on the first semester. I knew this wasn't the major for me. My mom however refused to have me switch my major and since I was a wuss back then. I didn't have nerve to talk back so I quietly followed her wishes. So it's been 7 years now and I still haven't graduated because I've been dragging my feet for the past years and just not caring enough and for that I keep failing subjects.

To be honest I have very few subjects left approximately 1 year left..so just keep going right? Well since covid happened and my internet keeps cutting on me. I've missed a lot of exams so I have a very good feeling I'm going to tank these subjects. The profs are not very considerate. 

No big deal right? Well yeah I could just finish my other subjects and then wait till the other subjects are available again..but my university is undergoing curriculum change which means a lot of the subjects I have won't be present anymore therefore if I fail I can't retake them cause they are entirely new subject codes. Which means...I'm fucked. I can either change my curriculum and then take 2 MORE years or I can just quit and do something id rather be doing.

But if I quit now Id be disappointing everyone even myself. But what the hell can I do anymore? People say that you survived so many years you Can do more right? Yeah but this car(me) is out of fuel and don't wanna do this anymore.

508,"From what I've gathered, from my female friends, a lot of them held the impression that I was a 'fuckboy', or the kind of guy you'd have a casual fling with but wouldn't trust enough to date, based on my actions.  
A few common points brought up were:  

That I take good care of my appearance (clothes, hair, body and fitness)  
That I have a social media where I post photos of myself that are very 'showy' (as they describe)  
That I (used to, when classes were running) nude model for a figure drawing class, and am somewhat casual about my body showing   
That most my friends were female  

Thing is I've *never* had a casual sex, I prefer to do it only in a relationship. Yet my ex broke up with me because she never felt secure in us, and my friends tell me that's the idea people have of me and see it as reasonable/believable...

Retire1 = former teacher now retired 
Teach1 = former principle turned teacher after being fired-not-fired 
Teach2 = older teacher able to retire 
Teach3 = younger teacher about 10 years left til retire 
BigBoss1 = current principle at high school 
Wife = my wife 
Me = me

6 years ago, my wife worked for a school district in smalltown, Missouri, USA. She worked under Boss1 and an alternative high school away from the high school proper. Boss1 likes to make jokes if someone is eating say a banana or nuts etc, in typical 14 year old fashion. Generally doesn't care about the job and rarely does actual responsibilities of the position and relies on Teach2 and Teach3 to run the school. Boss1 actually made a now retired teacher cry and leave the room from some of the comments. Boss1(married, 2 kids) is rumored to be in a relationship with Teach1 who is at this time the principle at the high school proper. Teach2, Teach3, and Wife didn't feel comfortable going to Teach1 to make a formal complaint for fear of retaliation and fear of what smalltown gossip would do to their careers. Wife left the job to take care of kids until they where school age.

Now, present time, Wife took the job again with the exact same people, except Teach1 is now ""demoted"" to Teach1 instead of principle and working in the same building as everyone else. New principle at the high school proper this year, BigBoss1. So wife starts and the same behavior by Boss1 is being displayed. My wife, being very anti-metoo stuff, just wants to work and go home tries to ignore and be cordial to Boss1. Lunches are awkward and Teach2,Teach3,Wife all don't want to bring in certain food items or bring up certain topics because Boss1 will twist it to be something sexual. One day he was making the same jokes and Teach3 and Wife just switched the subject to movies as fast as they could. He asked my wife directly if she had every seen Rollerbabies and said she should check it out. Wife put the movie on our download list and thats when it came across my desk, so to speak. When asked about who requested this movie, she said it was her boss and i explained to her what the movie was (its a cheesy 1976 porno). When confronted about it, Boss1 says he was thinking about Rollerball movie and then later said he was thinking about Solarbabies and it was an accident etc etc. Well Wife had enough and started to file a formal complaint against Boss1, just as he was being put on quarantine for CV. So he has currently been out and they made a whole Title IX committee and took statements from her, Teach2, Teach3. She has a union lawyer present at all these meetings and is generally wreaking havoc on everything in her work life and by-proxy all life since it is still Smalltown, Missouri, USA. Now we are in the waiting phase as the investigator is done and we are waiting for the other guy to give us the packet of paperwork including both parties statements. Teach2 and Teach3 has also file grievances against Boss1 at the same time, maybe a day or two behind Wife.

My question is -- does this actually represent sexual harassment and will it be likely if it is that Boss1 would keep his job? There are some other factors and long-term complaints and grievances from him not doing his actual real job but since he is tenured they can't do anything about it, similar to Teach1 situation.

515,"I think I may be struggling with some sort of undiagnosed mental disorder, but I have really strict parents so I can’t go see a doctor.

I’m a 16 year old girl from the Philippines. I’d like to think that I had a relatively normal childhood, despite the stress that festered as a result of academic pressure weighing down on me. As a child, my parents always  made sure that I got high grades, sometimes even beating me or threatening to kick me out of the house for low marks. I remember once, vividly, how my mother threw my Chinese workbook at my face when I couldn’t quite grasp the concept as quickly as she wanted it to. I know this type of treatment isn’t necessarily unheard of, especially when it comes to POC households, and it may even be considered shallow because other people have significantly got it worse. I was quite a gifted kid back in the day. I spoke English really well, could breeze through adult level books in the third grade like it was nothing, I got awards for being a top student, I was adored by my parents.

But as I grew older, I started slipping. It started in my first year of high school, where I’d gotten my first failing grade, ever. It was’t even a line of 7, but a 65. In my entire life, I had never gotten such horrendous results. As someone who relied on their grades to have a good connection with their family, I was visibly distraught and had multiple breakdowns in school upon hearing this news. (TW // self harm) I even tried to cut my wrists when I came home that night because I was more keen on meeting death than hearing my parents’ screaming match, telling me why I couldn't be as good as I was before. Asking me what happened, what I had become.

I don’t remember much after that. The rest of my Junior High School years passed by in a blur of memories locked too far away for me to tamper with.

Now, I’m in 11th grade. I get sudden bouts of anger, and they take days before the burning feeling fades out. This gets triggered by almost anything. I’ve looked up sources online and it points to depression and anxiety, which I’m not sure I have, as well as alcoholism, which I’m definitely sure I don’t have, since I’ve only had alcohol on very rare occasions. After the anger, I just feel empty. I come crawling back to my shell where I stay desolate and listless until something pulls me out of it. Then there’s the intrusive thoughts and bouts of recklessness. The moods change over notable time periods, but they feel frequent? I can’t quite describe it. I feel like I should be doing everything, but knowing that I won’t be able to bring out the best keeps me from trying. My thoughts race through my head at thousands of miles an hour, and there’s so much of everything that it hurts my head.

Maybe I’m just being overly dramatic? My parents and multiple elders around me don’t believe in depression or anxiety. They think this shift in personality is caused by the media or by my friends. I don’t know what to think.",15Oct2020,1
516,"Hellooo. 

So let me try to this as easy to read as possible. I don't really love who I am. I can't say I love myself and I think part of that is because I am not sure who I am and why Im here. I don't know how to approach loving myself and knowing who I am. 

I lack the confidence in myself that I should have. Yes, I have some confidence, but not enough. I don't always stand up straight. I don't always have the courage to say what I want to say and sometimes I feel like I'm just not good enough. 

I overthink things. I overthink most when I'm with someone that I love and care for. If I don't get a response, think I said something bad or just feel like I should blame myself, I start to apologise too much, I start to think I did something wrong and say sorry before I know the answer. I worry about why people don't answer etc. 

I tend to have some self pity and manipulative habits. I feel bad and then I say things that make others feel bad or make them feel manipulated. Whether, I want it or not, it happens. 

I struggle to stay positive and see everything in a good light. I've been told to say good for everything that happens that is seen as bad usually, but I forget to do that when I'm in the spot. I need to shift my thoughts and I don't know how. 

Lastly, usually I am fine alone, but I often feel sad for being single and I guess there is a sense of desperation. I don't know how to always be happy with myself and by myself. I long for relationships, when Im not really ready. 

There are somethings I'm not sure of, like why people ignore me or why people ghost me or why people don't seem to be attracted to me or like me, especially on online dating sites. In person it's different I think.

How do I fix this? I don't know where to start, and those affirmations never seemed to fully work for me. I get depressed because of social situations, because of this and because I cant seem to let go, not give a fuck and just learn to live in the present. I used to be spontaneous and I love it when I am, but I've lost that ability because I think too much and other opinions etc hold me back from doing stuff I want to do. It stops me saying what I want to say and being who I want to be. I can't be my best self in this way.

Any help or friends that want to help will be greatly appreciated.

518,"Throwaway.

Hi, guys. It might be long, so I'll add TLDR at the end.

My sister (29) and I (34) are going through a very hard phase with our mother. Ever since she divorced our father, 4 years ago, she is spiralling out of control, and she's a control freak, which adds so much to our stress and relationship with her. I am married to a man she didn't like in the beginning and tried her best to pull us apart. Thankfully, my father could step in and told her to back off. The wedding was blah, her side of the family didn't attend and she was very happy for it. It boggles my mind, but it's been years since then so I'm okay with it now. Maybe not, but whatever, can't change anything. I love my husband to death and I'd still marry him, no matter what she said. I live in a different country, so I physically removed myself from that situation. My sister is in a serious relationship with her boyfriend. They're together for 6 months and recently moved in together. He is such a sweetheart. He pushed her to finally quit her job where she was misused and abused and helped her find an amazing job she now loves. Helped her get her mental health in order because she has emotional outburst because of the emotional abuse we went through as children. We were not taught how to handle out feelings, but he is there to hug her and calm her down. I admit, it took me ages to get myself in order too, so I know how it is. He's an atheist, my mom is very religious. She became religious after her divorce. None of us ever practiced it. My mother hates him and their relationship. Hate is even an understatement. She calls him the wrong name on purpose, mocks him, rolls her eyes when she mentions him. But then it looked like she started to backtrack. It seemed like she could actually be decent about it. It definitely fooled me. My sister went out to visit her, everything seemed ok. She was asking about him, how their lives are now that they're living together, what the future plans are, to turn around one day and use everything my sister said against her. How she is crooked if she thinks she can just up and bring him to her house, as long as she is breathing he won't step foot in this house, how disgusting my sister is for thinking she could go behind her back and dare to plan a guest bedroom for the two of them. As long as she is with him, she will not enter with him. It was a clusterfuck. She didn't let her use me and my husband as an example because it works against her. I stand behind my sister 100%. I will support her no matter what. But, her boyfriend asked her to marry him yesterday. My sister said yes and I am over the moon happy for her. I processed it and I told her there is no way in hell our mom will attend her wedding. Never. If she marries him, that will be it, all ties with our mom will be cut. She has no problem being NC with her family for years and just recently she made some small step towards reconciliation. After 10 years mind you. There is nothing I can say or do to make our mom change her mind. I have tried soooo many times and every time it ended as a screaming match. I went NC for weeks on end because of it. My sister can't be happy and I know for a fact she won't be when her own mother is working against her. How do we deal with this? What the right course of action? I would move heaven and earth to make her happy, and I know my mom will go up against me too because I support her. Any advice is welcome.

TL;DR Sister got engaged to her bf. Our mother hates it. Threatens NC if she marries him.",15Oct2020,1

526,"I have a 12 year old Boston Terrier, Bailey, who was still very active the past few month  running around and playing. I took her to the vet in august for a checkup and bloodwork because she was losing hair, teeth and nails. They said she was perfectly healthy and was still as energetic as a puppy. They said if she became sluggish or tired to bring her back in. Since then she has been very energetic. We also have a 5 year old French Bulldog and the two had no problem playing together, running around the yard and playing tug-a-war. 

This past Friday I noticed she was breathing a little quicker. She was still acting energetic and would jump and run.  I just thought she was cold because she does this sometimes when she’s cold. Plus with flat faced dogs sometimes they just breath a little weird for a bit then go back to normal. I put her jacket on her and she was ok. I noticed On Sunday night that she was breathing weird again but I also noticed her belly was swollen. She also had a hard time going up and down the stairs to pee. It was such a drastic change that came out of nowhere. I called the vet the next day for a checkup and they directed me to the pet emergency hospital. My dog was still moving around more than a sick dog would. She jumped on me, begged for food, and was able to go up the stairs that morning. I thought maybe she just needed I dietetic to poop.

At the vet they told me she heart, chest, and stomach were full of fluid. They managed to remove some of the fluid from her chest which was causing her to have difficulty breathing but they couldn’t get all of it. They found a large mass in her heart which they said caused the fluid build up and it was only a matter of time before it filled up again. At that point we could try and drain the fluid again or let her go. 

She was in the hospital for 9 hours and I was in the parking lot the whole time and when she came out she looked upset. She hates going to the vet, and because of COVID I couldn’t go in with her. She was too afraid to go in without me so I was allowed to walk her to the door. 

I decided I am going to put her down, I don’t want to stress her out having to drive her to the vet to drain the fluid if her hearts already having a hard time. She was suffering and I don’t want that to happen again. She hates the car and she hates going to the vet so I wanted to use an at home euthanizing service. My only question now is when do I do it? The vet said with the fluid drained she should be breathing better but her breathing is the same. I was told to look for the signs she had before to know if the fluid built up again and it could take days or even a month. But she looks the same as when I took her in!!! I don’t know how to tell if the fluid is building up worse! 

My Bailey has some bursts of energy now where she can walk or even stand. But nothing compared to before and she does back to being tired pretty fast. Her breathing is still very fast averaging between 44-60 breaths a minute!Called the vet and made the first available appointment this Sunday with the option to reschedule if I think Bailey is doing well enough for more time. Baileys condition isn’t great but she does have some good moments. If we do it this Sunday, the whole family can be there but we aren’t sure if it’s too soon. I can’t decide if putting her down now would be letting her go before she suffers too much or cutting her life down too soon when she could still have some happy moments.

I talked to my family and we are all spilt. I work from home and I moved my work to be able to sit with her all day so I am able to see how she is doing. I see she has some times of being happy (especially when I feed her) but also a lot of time feeling tired and breathing heavily. Even when she plays with the toys she can only chew for a little bit before getting tired. When my family comes home she gets a bit more energetic because she’s happy to see them. At the end of the day everyone said it’s my call what we do because I see her the most but I am conflicted.

If I put her down this Sunday is it too soon? Will I feel guilty like I was just “getting it over with”? Is it better to wait even if I’m not sure of the signs?",15Oct2020,1

I am currently attending college in my home state. To put it bluntly, I haven't been doing my classwork. My college is doing a hybrid model when it comes to classes. I am having trouble with doing online work because I got a laptop after classes started. I haven't had the chance to tinker with my laptop. My professors emailing me about work. Meanwhile, I am lying to my parents about performance(i live with them). I need advice about what to do next. Do I withdraw and explain my situation to them or do I just keep on lying to them?",15Oct2020,1
528,"Yesterday night I decided to go out with some friends of mine. (Where I'm from quarantine has been lifted). We met at a bar and off the bat, one of the guys who I'm not as close to made a few derogatory comments towards me. He was already pretty intoxicated and he has a nature to be a reckless talker and get into fights so I ignored it and chatted with him for a bit. I thought I did a good job clearing the air and continued to hangout as if everything was normal. An hour or two into the night, we were all pretty drunk. I was at the bar ordering a drink with my friend. Due to me being intoxicated and also the crowded environment that we were in, I reached for my friends drink instead of mine. As soon as I looked at the contents of the drink I realized that it wasn't mine and put it down. The same guy that was giving me problems earlier approached us and started hurling insults at me. Saying not to reach for 'his f\*cking drink' and 'i don't hang out with them enough' and calling me a 'p\*ssy'. I just told him to relax, I'm drunk and thought it was my drink. No hard feelings. He continued with the insults and, I guess because I was drunk, honestly thought he kidding or something. I didn't expect this type of erratic behavior towards me of all people because I considered us to be friends, or at the least friendly. So, I raised my fist and fake punched him as a joke to get him to flinch. Big mistake. Buddy freaked out and started saying he wasn't the one and that he would love to beat my ass right now, and that everyone knows that he would beat my ass. I was honestly pretty stunned and just told him to shut the f\*ck up and chill. I'm still not sure what to make of this situation and given that I will probably see him again tonight, should I just bite the bullet and take him outside and fight? I know that's not the right or mature thing to do but I don't feel like being heckled and having my night ruined because of this prick.",15Oct2020,1
529,"Hey! How are you all doing?

So like most of us, I'm on instagram! I like to share photos and see what friends and other people are up too, but I'm really think some posts are unnecessary. Being more specific, I'm talking about photos to show off our big muscle bodies! Everyone is free to post whatever they want, I just don't see myself posting that kind of photos. Like ""Look at my body, I'm so hot! I took this photo on the beach, but remember, the background is blurred so look at my abs..."" That kind of stuff. I like my body, it's not super fit... But honestly I prefer having some nice shades than having all that muscular body. Anyway, I'm diversing... I could share that type of photos, but I prefer don't do it, cause I don't like to show off and almost everybody does that so, I like to be different. I'm not a big fan of this ""culture of the image/body"" thing. However I'm single now and I have some girls that follow me on instagram and I would like to show them that I'm not bad at that department too. I need to restrain myself. Does anybody gets me?

531,"Throwaway as I'm pretty well known on my other account.

I also want to say that I know this year has been exceptionally hard on most; I know how lucky I am to have options when it comes to jobs.

My fiance and I live in Houston, TX; we've lived here 5 years due to my job as I am the primary breadwinner. I've worked in oil and gas and truly love my company but really haven't loved living in Houston. Earlier this year, before covid, my fiance and I made a 5 year plan that we'd save up and get out of Houston and start new on the east coast, or west coast, either way it wouldn't be Texas.... but then covid hit and the rumblings of yet another O&amp;G downturn were making the rounds so plans those plans were up in the air. 

In an effort to be proactive, I started applying to other jobs in case I lost mine. We also packed up the dogs and drove around the country to see where we'd actually like to live (safely, by RV, no contact with anyone etc). While we LOVED the west coast, we decided the east coast was probably where we wanted live so I shifted gears to only apply to the east coast.

Well, I got a job offer, and in the layoff process at my current company I still have to wait 2 more weeks to find out if I ""landed"" a job.

In an effort to make this a novel, I'll get to the pros and cons.

**Pros of staying in Houston at current company:**

1. Money, as much as I hate to admit it this is the main reason for staying. I make close to $200/year, and have bonuses each year with a chance to continue to rise up in the company.
2. Extreme job flexibility and benefits. I have a pension, 401k, paid medical, I get every other Friday off. When we worked in the office I could make my own hours to avoid traffic or work from home if needed. 
3. Our home. I love our home; we've put so much of us into it and have only lived there 2 years. I'm not sure we'd make any money on the move right now and as weird as it sounds we are really attached to this home.
4. While Houston is stifling hot, it's also sunny most of the year. This is something that's really important to me as someone who is affected by seasonal depression disorder
5. It's a fun job, lots of diversity with a chance to move up in the company

**Cons of staying in Houston at current company:**

1. The stifling humidity and heat that lasts for \~7-8 months of the year. Sure winters are lovely but gosh it can get so hot you can't go outside or exercise the dogs during the summer
2. Flooding...always worried about flooding and not just due to hurricanes or tropical storms, a little storm can cause major localized damage
3. My industry is fickle, I could be laid off at any time. There's not much security
4. Traveling is hard unless it's by plane. Which means no pups involved unless we take 8+ hour car rides.
5. Traffic.... holy smokes the traffic. Our lives are built around traffic. If I leave work even 5 mins later than normal my 30 mins commute can be an hour+. 

**Pros of new company and living in either MA, southern CT, or NY:**

1. Less pay but still more than I thought I'd make if I left O&amp;G. (It's about a $70k/yr paycut)
2. All 4 seasons. I've really missed fall or even just a change in weather
3. Closer to a lot of hiking and fun places that we could easily do by car on the weekend with the dogs and still close to a major airport if we want to go overseas (when we're allowed again...)
4. Job seems interesting and challenging
5. Seems like a truly genuine and wonderful company. I get a really good feelings from them.

**Cons of new company and living in either MA, southern CT, or NY:**

1. Long winters. I don't mind the snow, in fact, I love it! But the gray winter days wear on my mental health a bit
2. Taxes. I am all for paying taxes but I'm getting paid less to live in a more expensive area with higher taxes. 
3. Less job flexibility. I'd be managing lots of projects all over the east coast and potentially all over the country. There'd be a lot less job flexibility there. 
4. I'd be commuting no matter where we chose to live
5. Wouldn't be able to buy a house right away and would go back to apartment or home rental
6. Probably wouldn't be able to rise up in the company much, if at all. I'd be starting as a project manager and there's no where else to rise to.

532,"Hey this is my first post on Reddit so apologies if my formatting is shit, I also am terrible at writing but I really just need to get this out. I guess I’ll give some background info on my situation first and then I’ll get to recent events.

Ok so when I was around 10ish (probably younger) my mother had a mental breakdown which led to her being diagnosed with Paranoid Personality Disorder and ever since the break down, her mental state has gone downhill. When it first started, she just thought that people were following her and would be mean to me and my older sisters but soon she started seeing people in our fireplace/chimney and taking me and my siblings on long car rides in the middle of the night to get away. (She has done a lot more shit but it isn’t crucial to the story) I am the youngest  out of 3 so I was more use to her antics and everything and eventually both of my sisters moved out so they don’t have to deal with her but they still have bad trauma and we all go to therapy. My dad has been my rock through all of this and he has done the best he can to deal with it, where we live it is very hard to get a divorce especially because my mom doesn’t want one and she can’t hold down a job so my dad would still have to pay for her. (A looong time ago they tried to get one but they made up ig) Right now I still live at home because I’m still in high school (senior and I’m about to turn 18) and I recently switched to online school because  I learn better that way. At first, it wasn’t too bad being at home with my mother because I would just avoid her and I would go on trips and stay with my sisters and stuff, I also have a job tho so I can’t leave for too long. I’m making wayyyy better grades now so I really don’t have an option to go back to regular school and I honestly don’t want to. 

Ok I’m pretty sure this is enough background for now but if you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer. Now getting back to recent events.

So in the past month or so (probably longer, I just have a bad memory) I’ve noticed that my mom was taking things from my room when I would leave, she has always taken things but it was usually stuff that I didn’t need so I didn’t really care. But now it’s gotten to the point where she will literally go into my car and take stuff like my CDs and other things I keep in it, she even will go deep into my closet and steal personal things like journals from years ago and things that I bought with my own money. (Her usual excuse is that she bought it for me so she can take it back, including clothes that I still wear) I’ve honestly had enough of it so when she’s gone, I’ll go into her room and closet and take back what is mine. I’m not trying to upset her or anything but I just want my fucking stuff back. My main problem is that she keeps most of her stuff inside her car, and drives around all day so I can’t ever get it. I haven’t even looked inside her car until I recently saw how much stuff of mine that I thought I had lost was in there,(it’s a Ford Explorer btw) I’ve only went in it once while she was watching tv at night and I got a lot of stuff off of the top layer back but that wasn’t even half of it, but before I could finish she came outside and started screaming at me that it was her stuff so I had to literally hold up each item in the dark and explain why it was mine and that I bought it myself. My dad ended up coming out and deescalated the fight, so I ended up keeping everything, after this things started getting very bad. When my dad would leave for work I would ask for my stuff back and she would either ignore me completely and just drive off or she would yell at me and literally try to curse me sometimes and it has really gotten to me, I wish my mom was normal or maybe just loved me a little bit but it is what it is. My mental state has really declined and every day I feel more and more depressed. Well this morning I woke up pretty early and was awake before my mom left the house so I was looking for something that I knew she took and as soon as she saw me she started yelling at me to get out (she usually will talk to me first) so I fired back that I want my fucking stuff and she called me crazy, (a lot more was said but I really don’t feel like getting into it) I ended up finding a lot of my shit but the thing I was looking for wasn’t in there so I literally just walked up to her sacred fucking car because the door was wide open and I didn’t even touch anything, I was just looking when she started screaming in my driveway that I was a fucking bitch and other things, then she started to pull me away from the door and I didn’t budge (which was stupid on my part) and then she tired to slam the door on me. I left when that started happening and she got inside her car so I assumed that she was leaving so I got up and locked all of the doors in the house. (I know that was completely childish of me but she has a key to the house) She ended up calling my dad so I opened the door and I could hear her telling him that I got all up in her face and pushed her, (which I fucking didn’t) so he called me and we talked about it, and hopefully soon something will happen so i don’t have to stay with her but I don’t really think it’s gonna happen for a while. But yeah that’s mainly it and I’ve just been crying and trying to figure out what to do about my situation. If anyone has some advice that would be really nice or if anyone has gone through something similar and can relate to this can feel free to talk. 

If you read through this then fucking congrats haha sorry about the rambling, there’s just a lot to the story and I don’t really know how to tell it. Also if this is the wrong sub then please let me know and I’ll move it. Thanks for listening to me tho, I really appreciate it. :-)",15Oct2020,1
533,"About a year ago my parents got divorced and I had to move homes, to a small apartment block... this meant that I had to give away my three dogs because we couldn’t bring them with us... we found them a loving home, however the terms of the deal of re-homing them means that I can’t go visit them because it will affect the emotional state of the dogs mentally...

I cry about 4 times a week because I miss them so so much, even though it’s been a year...

536,"TLDR: Commissioned some portraits a month plus ago, was promised a month deadline. Haven't received sketches, artist set new deadline as 20th Oct, how often should I ask about my commission update?

So the story is that I commissioned a couple of portraits a month back, and the artist put their deadline as a month, saying they would send sketches soon. Ye I have no problem with waiting, so I waited. I dropped a enquiry about the sketches for my commission about 10 days ish ago, and the artists said they were hospitalised for a health check, and would be sending the sketches in two days. Again, I was cool with that, so I said sure.  Then 2 days ago, I asked again about the sketches, and if they weren't ready at the moment, no problem, but what would be a date that the artist would be comfortable sending them by. The artists replied that they would send along the sketches by the same day or the next, and that the commission would be done by the 20th.

I was wondering if it would be bothersome to ask or remind again about the sketches? Or should I wait till the 20th to ask about my commissions again. I rather not be that Karen, but it is kinda over the timeline the artists promised at the start. Thanks in advance!",15Oct2020,1

538,"Okayy sooo where do I start -

So basically (just a quick summary of my life) my mom + dad are divorced, fighting over custody in court, I'm living with my mom + stepdad, and things are not perfect like they make things look

My mom + stepdad yell at me a lot, my stepdad hurt me twice (one of them is dragging me by my hair to my room because I asked people to play with me, I was 7), and my mother has done lots off stuff (one of them is throwing my school lunch on the floor \[no bad, no anything, and it was on purpose too\] and making me eat it for lunch), my mom kicked me out for a month, I lived with my dad then, but then this judge (who actually got a boy killed by making him live with his father) made me go back to my mom. I've started to have suicidal thoughts, and am forcing myself to act as perfect and happy as my family is seen to be. My mom lies to doctors and other people involved in the case, trying to make me seem like I am crazy, tries to get doctors to make me take pills, and tries to make others think that my father is manipulating me into hating her.

542,"Hi. My parents are splitting up but it’s all happening very very slowly. I have bad mental health because of trauma from a few years ago and so when my dad vents to me about his issues (usually about our family) it makes it even worse.

I understand that he doesn’t have anyone else to talk to (I’m the “one one” who will listen) but he has more than enough money to pay for a counsellor instead of venting to me all the time.  He always talks about how bad our family is in terms of each other (mistrust, miscommunication, suspicion, etc) and that is very true. I can agree that my sister (19F) is very selfish and refuses to see his side of things but he can’t just keep venting to me about it when I’m bad enough as it is! He complains about how much responsibility he has because of how selfish everyone else is, about my sister and my mum (56F) and how they have the audacity to call him lazy after everything he does.

Part of the problem is how he nitpicks about tiny little things that wouldn’t usually irritate anyone else. I won’t get into it but everyone who has talked to him has noticed his “oddities” at some point. They say,
“I would ask him about something but the problem is he’ll tell me!” meaning that he goes on past anything you need to know. On occasion I have asked him for help with setting up a music program for school and he’s come back with folders and books on MIDI and that kind of thing. He got me a book on the science of music for my birthday last year.

Anyway, what I’m asking is if there’s any suggestions on what I could do to help him talk to someone else. Should we look into getting him tested for Autism/Aspergers Syndrome? Should we help him with finding a counsellor? What should we/I do?",15Oct2020,1
543,"I loved my job at the daycare so much. I thought I hated kids to be honest, but I've come to the conclusion that I adore them, even the annoying ones. I worked at two daycares, and at K the 'adults' are lovely, but at H (the one I just quit) they were all more or less horrible. There was one super nice older lady at H and it's her who I ended up confessing I wanted to quit to today. It sucked because I had JUST gotten the hang of everything but she was so understanding and sweet. I was very vague about the whole situation but told her I felt the tone was very condescending and just felt awful about going to work in the mornings. She said ''I hope B and I have been alright!'' and I said very specifically ''YOU have been lovely.'' I'm pretty sure she got the hint, because B is in fact the worst one. She made me cry this morning after 30 minutes. It was the first time I broke down but no one saw me or anything.

I asked how I should quit and she basically explained to me how it all worked and I ended up quitting over text on my way home. I didn't give my boss any details or anything, just that I wouldn't be coming in tomorrow but hoped they could find someone else to take my spot before tomorrow.

I suspect the very nice lady will inform my coworkers that I quit, and perhaps mention it may have something to do with B. My question is: if my boss asks for a reason, should I be honest and tell her how horrible B was? I know I haven't given any examples because the post would just end up too long. Basically it was super hard for me to even tell if she was speaking to ME or the KIDS because she spoke to me as if I was unintelligent, yet gave me so unclear instructions that I had to ask her several times about one task. Another opportunity for her to yell at me and degrade me some more. 

I want to be mature about it. I want to be professional. I am just so pissed off and sad that these horrible old karens (B literally has the karen cut) could ruin such a wonderful job for me. The kids LOVED me by the way.

547,"My fiancé has some health conditions, which make it very difficult for him to work and there’s not a lot a doctor can do. Everyone I know is pressuring him to get a job when he tries to explain that although his condition may seem simple, it really isn’t and it makes his life very difficult even when he isn’t working. I don’t earn much, but I do earn enough to be able to financially support both of us. We’re living with family right now but in the area that we live, the rent is quite cheap. I don’t drive so I don’t need to pay for that too, only buses. I’m also starting a business on the side to make some extra money. There won’t be a lot to spend on extra things like games, clothes etc whatever we want but hopefully that’s where the money from my business will come in to help.

I want to tell him that it’s okay, I can provide for us both but he gets really upset over money because he really wants to work but his health issues are stopping him and he feels like as the man, he should be providing for his family. I’m not sure how to tell him without upsetting him. There’s not really any other option at this point than for me to provide for both of us, which is okay. I really don’t mind. I just want to make him comfortable and I know it’s not his fault and he’s not being lazy. As long as he does some of the housework in the day and helps me with other tasks like picking up groceries or sending out orders for my business, things that he can manage to help me out too whilst I work. 

I feel like everyone is looking down at us, they’re being really judgemental about it. If this was the other way round and he was offering to provide for me, there would be less of an issue with it because he is the man. Although they (both our families and friends) say that it’s because he needs to have a job and work too (ignoring his health condition, as much as he tries to explain how difficult it is they don’t listen). I don’t care what they all say but he does.

I am planning to continue my education after undergrad so grades are important to me and “Cs get degrees” is not really any consolation. 
Right now I am taking organic chem 2. Test grades have just been posted and I am terrified of checking mine, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Last test I thought I did well, but then I got a 56 (first test I well and truly failed) and significantly below the average.

The rest of the debate is him calling me an idiot etc etc and then asked me not to be a snowflake and called me a clown because I’m into politics and then he tells me I’m unhealthy because I have a sweet tooth and calls me unhealthy (even tho I’m in better shape than he is) and the debate comes to an end with the finnishing line “I have better things to do.”

Hi everyone,

My sister (28yo) started showing psychosis symptoms a couple of months ago. At first we thought she was telling the truth but now it doesn't make sense and the symptoms are getting more serious. So I'd appreciate any advice on what to do next. Thank you.

Her symptoms: a few months ago she started telling my family that she's being spied on. She said that she had to stop using her phone, laptop, email... because ""THEY"" can hear and know everything (I will address these people she claimed spying on her using quotation marks). She told my mom that ""THEY"" were spying on all my family members, that ""THEY"" can listen as my mom talks at home even when the phone is on lockscreen.

One time I called an electrician in for an issue, he showed up 30min earlier than scheduled. My sister said that he was told to come early by ""THEM"".

Recently, she's been talking to the air a lot in English. I don't live with my family and my parents can't understand English so they couldn't know what she was saying. But she just keeps talking to nobody, no phone in front of her. Sometimes she cries for no reason, while having dinner, while driving, at 3AM. Last night my mom said something (probably trying to convince her to seek professional help) and my sister started screaming.

What we have tried: my dad tried to gradually talk to her, she wouldn't tell him anything. He's been very patient, he said something along the line of ""tell me what happened and who they are, I will do anything to protect you"". She wouldn't let him finish his thoughts so he decided to write a note to her. Then when she saw that she started screaming also.

So right now we don't really know what to do. We can't talk to her much. She's not even eating much. She refused to see a doctor so I want to know what we can do right now

THANK YOU",15Oct2020,1

556,"I just want to start off saying that I hate talking about how I feel because its never actually done anything for me and I feel like its just a waste of time. 

I've been in higher education for 4 years now... 

I'm Irish and came to the UK when I was 17 due to a scholarship to study law. it was a 3-year course and I got the highest degree. I was happy but I was severely depressed for the last 2 years of it due to being broke.... not a lot of friends around me and just being stuck inside due to studying. Most of all the uni tried to f\*ck me over multiple times.. 

now I got the degree. I had to do my masters and the BPTC (Barrister training course). At my new uni, they have a 2 in one course so I'm doing the masters and bar at the same time in the space of 9 months. 

i never came to uni after college... I came after highschool... I knew nothing about the law and I struggled while everyone around me studied a bit of it in college. 

I came onto this course thinking it will be okay but its the opposite... the work is almost impossible... its almost so impossible that apparently QCs and barristers are petitioning to have the BPTC removed altogether because it's actually designed to make the students fail. it is not a reflection of the practice at all. 

now... I have a bf and he's so sweet and I love him more than anything. he has done nothing but try to take care of me. but he's not very good at comforting ME... tbh he's just another person who doesn't understand me... I told him how I'm feeling and he basically just told me to study more... like I'm not trying my best already... I just told him I didn't want to talk about it anymore and he asked why i always do that. I didn't tell him but its because I just don't feel comforted by his words... I feel like it's my parents talking... telling me off almost... 

i have very high expectations of myself and i compare myself to other peoples abilities to do things and i know its not right but that my mindset.. 'if she can do it i can do it too' 

its gotten to a point now that I've just accepted that I've most likely failed... like the pain im feeling is so much that I just feel numb and it breaks me more that there no one that I can talk to that can actually help me emotionally. My parents aren't much help... they are old school Nigerian and my fellow Africans and most likely many other ethnicities would know what I mean.

I have no money for a therapist and I honestly don't trust them... the last one i went to was only two meetings in and she was pushing me to drop out... and not in a kind way... if I listened to her i wouldn't have my degree and id be 27k in debt for nothing. 

I guess I don't even know what I'm writing anymore... I don't know what advice i could get... but if anyone has done their masters... or the BAR... please just tell me i can make it... please. 

sorry for any mistakes... in the middle of a lecture rn... 

TL;DR - i dont think im smart enough to pass my LLM (BAR) course",15Oct2020,1
557,"hey guys! I’m honestly super confused about this ... and really don’t have anyone to talk to about it, so I hope you can help me out.

My bf (M20) and I (F18) have been dating for about 4 and a half months now. Before he was dating me, he dated a girl (F18) for close to year and they were engaged. (I know it seems a little young but that’s that small town life I guess).

Anyways, the wedding was called off earlier this year , in January because she was cheating on him. I honestly didn’t know my current BF all that good at this time, he was kind of a friend of a friend. But a few of us friends decided to go on a trip in March for a week and I really got to know him there. 

I ended up having a huge crush on him, but because he just got out of an engagement I wanted to give him his time and space, so I didn’t do anything about it. 

Then in April our mutual friend ended up figuring it out and telling him. My then-not-bf decided to talk to me about it and I was honestly super embarrassed, I thought he was going to reject me. But he said he thought I was a really awesome person, that he would want to date me but to give it another month because he didn’t want me to feel like he just hopped from one relationship to another. And I was cool with this. So after a month we started dating. 

And it’s honestly been really nice. He’s seriously the sweetest person I could have ever asked for. But of course, there’s always going to be bumps in the road. We always talked about them and figured it out together. Until the day before yesterday.

Long story short, I ended up hanging out with some friends and the topic of my BF and his ex came up. His ex’s best friend during the engagement and breakup was with us and I guess we wanted to hear his Ex’s side of the story. So the best friend tells us how she saw the whole thing. Some things were right and some things were wrong. But we finally get to a point where she says “yeah, his ex and I thought it was crazy that he was with you just a month after they were trying to figure things out” and I’m thinking.. wtf. But he told me they stopped talking in January when the wedding was off? 

No.. apparently early April they were seriously talking about getting together again. And they were sleeping together... again. I understand that it’s not a big deal for some people but it is for me.. 

I know that after they called it off she was trying to get ahold of him for months after but he told me he never talked to her.. so idk. So they were trying to figure it out for a week, he decided it was a bad idea and cut her off, and the within a few days he found out I liked him and started talking to me. So idk what the heck. 

I talked to him about it yesterday and he confirmed what I heard. I told him that I thought things had ended with her back in January, (because that IS what he told me!) and if he only gave himself a month of time to get over her that it clearly wasn’t enough.. and that had I know that, I wouldn’t have dated him. Wtf. Since again, I thought things had ended months ago. 

And that’s it. He said if I wanted to break up with him he’d understand. I told him it was beyond disappointing to hear that because I actually wanted to work it out some how.. and now he’s calling me nonstop to see how he can make it right again.. but I don’t know how. This is my first real relationship so I don’t know what the heck. 

I can’t easily forgive him but some part of me still wants to make it work. Am I stupid? What should I do? Any advice?",15Oct2020,1

I’ll be 20 next year. I don’t know whether I have an extreme case of anxiety but I’m really (scared?) for my future. 

I’m studying IT in Uni (and Lord knows they aren’t teaching us anything worthwhile). So I’ve started studying Java online by myself, so that at least when I finish school, I might be skilled enough to work for someone...

But I feel like I’ve fucking wasted my life, and that I’m late and it REALLY stresses me out. I haven’t been able to be calm or (happy?) for a while. 

People my age, do you feel the same? and The adults, do you think it’s a serious problem? Because I have no skills, really. I used to write stories, but where’s that going to take me, so I stopped, and I do a little bit of music, (again, where?)

I am crying everyday but I genuinely cannot leave I have to graduate I only have a year left and I’m trying to go on autopilot and try to shut off my brain to get through this. It was difficult before but even more so now because of lockdown and everything is online and I can’t make any friends or interact with anyone I’m so isolated and alone. I’ve already signed a lease so I can’t move. I’ve been in deep bouts of depression while I’m here and I know it’s a privilege to be able to live here and have a roof over my head and everything but it’s just really hard and I need advice on how I can get through this.,15Oct2020,1
561,"Sounds strange, I know. I have been going back and forth with myself all day. 

So basically, I work in a grocery store. I was to be moved up in position, but they put me in another dept because the manager left the store. I am not getting paid anything extra. 

Today is my first day in the dept, and I kid you not I got abosultely zero training for the dept. Not a single bit. 

Now I am sitting here stressing about leaving or not. They derailed my path to a higher position, without even consulting me, and now I am stuck in a dept with zero exp. No one is training me in it, either. 

I can adapt to situations no problem. Hell, if I do something wrong, it's on management. 

The issue is, my heart is genuinely telling me to walk away. The manager of the store is absolutely terrible as a boss, so it's not like I'd feel bad about leaving them. Hell, it's what they are doing to me currently. It's an easy dept, but I am literally just here as a body because it was easier for them. 

They say walking about without another job lined up is dumb, and I get that. But I ended up having to move back in with family after I lost my other job due to Covid. I have some money saved up, so I can still pay my bills for a little while.

I love her so much, and she loves me, but I feel the connection between us, but I just don't want to be in a relationship anymore. I want to be free to myself and not think about ""Shit how long ago did she text me"". I want to be able to go about my day and just do my thing with having to worry about talking to anyone, and I want to be free to do whatever, whenever, without potentially upsetting her. She has mentioned before that it is hard for her to not cut (thankfully she hasnt ever) but it is often on her mind, and I'm scared if I break up with her she will start. I know she wouldn't start because I left but more so because I wouldn't be there to tell her I love her and don't want her to, and I wouldn't be there texting her all day to keep her occupied.

We have a strong emotional connection, but our interests aren't the same at all. We have tried to get into what each other likes such as video games and tv shows, but it never worked. I can't get into her shows, she never tries to get into mine but she says ""I will check it out"" which in other words is her saying ""Not interested"". I've tried to teach her handy things like fixing stuff on vehicles or around the house and she never picks up. A future with her would be impossible for me; she doesn't know how to cook anything other than frozen meals, she can't change a tire or do basic maintance on a vehicle, she doesn't have her license yet and neither does anyone in her family but her grandparents.

568,"TW: RAPE, SEXUAL ASSAULT

Throwaway account because this is the biggest secret I’ve ever kept. Nobody knows that it’s me who did this. I also tried to post this on r/amitheasshole but it understandingly got blocked. 

This past summer I (16F) ran an Instagram account at my high school for my classmates to submit stories about sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination. People would fill out an anonymous Google Form and I didn’t know who submitted what. I would post the content from the Google Form on the account. The account received ~800 submissions, ranging from people making sexist comments in class to detailed rape stories. 

Most people didn’t submit their abuser’s names, but I received about 2 dozen names of alleged abusers. Some of those names came in more than once. I redacted the names of the alleged abusers when I posted the stories (ex. “[redacted] groped me at a party”). I did not know what to do with the names. I had abuser’s names but no victim’s names. 

What I decided to do was submit the abuser’s names to my principal. I submitted the unredacted accusations to them (ex. “John Doe groped me at a party”). The school submitted the accusations to the police. I’m pretty sure the police talked to the abuser, as they’ve said they did when I asked the school about it. 

I did not make it clear on the account that I was going to submit the abuser’s names before I submitted them. After someone asked what happened to the named accusations, I told people on the account that I had submitted the unredacted ones to the school. 

People said that they weren’t wild about that. They said that some victims understandingly don’t want to get the police involved. After people made that clear to me I put a notice that said I would submit named accusations to the school. After that, some people did submit named accusations and I reported them. 

I feel bad because I don’t want to potentially retraumatize these people. In the moment I felt that submitting the abuser’s names was the right thing to do. Now I feel like I did something bad.",15Oct2020,1

This is why i did the degree in coastal/ marine science. I did the second degree because at the moment the job prospect isnt in high demand and so i wanted a backup.
At the moment I thoroughly enjoy studying the marine science degree but i feel as if the business degree is hindering me from learning everything i can and need to know (i have reduced units for the marine degree because 6 years of study has been combined into 4).
I dont dislike the business degree, i just dont enjoy it, its more of a chore.
I really feel like dropping business degree because currently i feel as if i need to be studying the marine degree more thoroughly. I also have very little time with my family which i am disappointed in myself for.
Ill admit i could study harder and that is another of my downfalls.

What should I do?
Do i drop the marine degree in hope for a good paying buisness job which I am more guaranteed to get?
Do i drop the buisness degree and enjoy university, and hope i am able to get the job i want?

I'm aware that what she did and does to me is not serious as other's people abuse is, so I'm sorry if I offend anyone...the thing is, she has been controlling my choices in life and my daily activities and has taken a lot of freedom from me. Since she gets so obsessive and possessive of stuff, she doesn't share anything with me and I can't like anything she likes. There are things which are hers, and I can never get into, Japanese culture for example. I'm not allowed to watch anime or read manga, to talk about something related to it without feeling obliged to be humble and affirm her authority on it. We are not Japanese, we don't have any heritage from that culture. To give a stupid example, I bought a Nintendo Switch after months of wanting it, and when I finally had it I had to give it to her because she was upset about it. The same goes for Universities degrees which I can't contemplate studying because they are connected to her hobbies and passions. I am going crazy. I know there are a million of other things I can appreciate in life, but I always feel like I have to search for something she doesn't like and adapt to it, even if it's not in my interests. I feel trapped. She's almost 30 and this is quite frankly insane.

I just wish to have my freedom. I'm in my mid 20 and I wish this could stop. Is this fair? I know I can't talk to her about this because she gets very angry and she would not talk to me for days, possibly weeks, and then hold a grudge forever, I would feel guilty and horrible...I can't do nothing but let her do her own things.

anytime im around people, it’s all eyes on me. it’s like emulate a certain light but i can feel there dimness. It messes with my mind sometimes because i can sense 
negative energy before something is about to pop off.

everytime i make progress in this area, another test of faith shows up and i feel like i end up failing. i know with time, anything can be mastered but what advice can be given.",15Oct2020,1
579,"I have a friend (A) I have been best friends with for about 12 years now. I met my husband 6 years ago and we started dating pretty soon after meeting. We got married two years ago. My husband (27m) treats me well and is very supportive and happy. My friend (26f) always seemed happy for me be with him and never told me she didn’t like him. Recently a friend (B) started working with A. She told me that A is telling everyone at work my business and has been for quite some time. My husband and I only recently got a place together because we wanted to pay off debts before paying for a place. I recently found out I was pregnant and A seemed happy about it. I am not working much because of the virus but it’s okay cause my husband makes good money at work so we are living comfortably. A told B that she can’t be happy for my pregnancy cause she does not like my husband. B asked her why she doesn’t like him and she said she didn’t like his way of budgeting money. She has never once told me she had an issue with my husband and always seemed happy if he hung out with us and seemed excited about the pregnancy. And the budget comment confused me cause if I was hungry he always Apple Pay’s me money for food or if I go out with my friends he will Apple Pay me money if I want to buy something or go get my nails done without me asking him to. So I don’t see why his budget would bother her if he doesn’t hold money back from me. Now my problem is I don’t know how to go about uninviting her from my baby shower (small family and close friends gathering with masks and social distancing) without causing trouble between A and B at work. I just feel pretty hurt cause I thought A was happy for my relationship and pregnancy and it hurts that she’s not only talking bad about my husband, but telling her coworkers all of my personal business I’ve talked to her about.",15Oct2020,1
580,"So this all started when I discovered “Flowers in The Attic” by VC Andrews... I stumbled across a video edit of the lifetime movie adaptation of it on youtube about a year ago and decided to read the books. As I read the book I discovered that the relationship between the 2 siblings excited me and I wanted them to be together ( I never really had any feelings about incest before this because it wasn’t something I ever thought about) I kind of felt disgusted that I liked it and I was just thinking wtf is wrong with me. 

After I finished those books I tried to look for other incest books to read and ended up finding another one called “Forbidden”.  Then after that I kept trying to look for more and eventually I began to search up incestual confessions/stories people posted on reddit and just in the internet in general, I also began reading incest erotica and watching incest porn... I’m not really a fan of porn and I haven’t even watched any in a while because I’m trying to go as long as I can without masturbating (its been a little over a month since I have) I just feel more productive and think less about sex when I don’t masturbate. 

Anyways idk why incest excites me that much and why I feel the urge to look for these stories and read about them... I’m not sure how to put it but I think my fixation and attraction to the idea of incest is probably due to the fact that siblings are usually very close, they grow up together, know each-other very well, they care for and love each other a-lot already without having any romantic feelings but then If they do develop romantic feelings its such an passionate, conflicting and intimate thing and the fact that you are not supposed to do it and its wrong makes it all the more intense... god I’m disgusting. (Btw idk if this makes any difference but the only kind of incest that actually excites me a-lot is brother/sister, cousin incest is also exciting to me I guess but definitely not as much as the former. When it comes to mother/son or father/daughter its honestly a huge turn off for me, I’m not into it at all.) 

But yeah I just want to know if theres something seriously wrong with me because of this... I’ve never been abused or anything, I’ve had a good childhood and I have a half-brother who is 9 years younger than me, I would never actually try to be incestual in real life. I guess I’ve pictured myself in imaginary scenarios with an imaginary big brother before but usually I just like thinking of other people and not myself. Should I get help? I’m not obsessed with it to the point that my life is significantly affected by it or anything but I just feel disgusted at myself sometimes for fantasying and getting turned on by this.",15Oct2020,1

586,"So before me and my girlfriend started talking she had been talking with this other guy to my understanding about a month or two. It wasnt a long time and she doesn't like recalling that time so its hard to get a specific window but the important part is it wasn't long. But in that short time this guy caused a lot of damage. He hit her a few times and the one time they did have sex she consented to the sex but he finished inside her and she didn't tell him he could do that and she still feels uncomfortable about it almost 10 months later. She was on birth control when it happened but she still went and got a morning after pill. And she still says even though shes gotten her period multiple times following that event she still feels uncomfortable and gross. So she blocked him on all social media but he keeps trying to contact her and he keeps serving as a living reminder of the shit he's done. Ive tried to get him to back off, threatened him a few times against my better judgement but he some how manages to always creep back in some how. 

I've always done what I can to be there for her and help her with problems when she has them but idk how to help with this. I dont have the answer to this problem as much as I'd like too. I also dont know if finishing inside without the consent to do so is considered assualt or not, I know that its really fucked up but she consented to the act and im not super knowledgeable on the subject but I feel like it could be.

 I just dont even know where to begin with all of this. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",15Oct2020,1
587,"My mom thinks she is owned my fasa money. She claims I owe it to her. She thinks it should go to her. She its owed to her because I was in an accident in her vehicle doing what she wanted over 2 years ago. Now for you car people. I told her she needed to the avs fixed which means the breaks don't really work. The truck is worth $1000-$1500 on a good day even without the dent. I wasn't driving around doing what I wanted with her vehicle. I was doing a chore for her that she told me to do. Accident could have been completely and in tirely avoid had she taken care of her car. She thinks because my college is paid for by grandma that she should just get it. I've gotten a car from my grandma has well. She thinks she's owed all of the money.Now it would be okay with me, but my grandma only pays for insurance. I have to come up with gas money on my own. My mom said I shouldn't even get a job and just focus on school. I realize now she only wanted a slave to do everything for her. I seriously can't even study. I have to walk to the fridge every 20 minutes because her arm hurts to get her a pop. It's really screwing me over. She told me not to get a job before school started. I wanted one so I could get away from her and have an apartment during school because knew she would pull something like this. I was applying to jobs everywhere.  I was even promised a job, but she wouldn't let me use one of 2 vehicles at all for it so I pay her off to get her to stfu about her truck and I could move out. She wanted me to bother my grandma for a car. I did. Here's another kicker she gets child support from my dad still since I'm in college and my ss money. You'd think she would count that being paid off the $750 that it would cost to get fixed. I'm seriously stuck here because of her controlling bs. I tried telling her look I need to study I might have to drop a class. I was asking for help when she was making fun of me for struggling. She's I'm hard to live with because I won't drop everything for her. Its not like I'm hanging out with friends she wouldn't allow it. She constantly reminds me I'm a screw up and my sister worked 3 jobs when she was in college. I think she forgets she wasn't controlling with her and she never had adhd making it harder to study.

588,"So I kinda need advice on something that's going on

Around 2 weeks ago, my friends and I  were playing soccer. There was also a little kid who kept playing, and it's not like we could have kicked him out. 

While we were playing, 1 person was kicking the ball very hard (Note: the field we're playing on was small. If someone were to kick it hard there will be no option to block it). I told him like 5 times to stop doing it since someone might get hurt. The whole damn time, that kid (who was around 9 months younger than me, (a foot shorter than me)), just kept saying ""no, no, no"". At that point, I was super pissed cause he never listened and made the game unfair and dangerous to the little kid who was playing there.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to show him what exactly he was doing and kicked it hard (but not too hard) when the little kid was out of the way. The annoying ignorant kid gets in the  goddamn way and the soccer ball hits him in the (you know what...). I apologized and told him this was exactly what could have happened if you kept hitting it hard.  

&amp;#x200B;

He kept saying ""How am I supposed to know you were going to kick it hard"", even though I made a placating gesture, by moving back and t showing time going to punt it (as regular soccer players would. Mind you! I didn't kick it that hard), ... yet he kept repeating that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After two damn weeks, his mom comes to confront me. I tried to tell her what happened (even though it was hard because she kept interrupting every 10 seconds). She literally leaves

Then, after a few days, his dad comes to me and literally yells at me and everyone was looking at the situation like *What the hell* was going. He threatens to report to the school, and when I tell him what happened (he also kept interrupting), he said that ""If he wasn't following the rules, come to us). I don't know how the hell that is reasonable because if I were to snitch on every one bad thing that kid does I would be going to their houses like every 3 hours. Nonetheless, in this generation, it is kind of unreasonable that we were to go confront the kid's parents for random things. 

I tell his dad that ""Since your thinking that I am the one to blame,  l will tell the school"" His dad just dips and leaves right there and then.

&amp;#x200B;

What is going to happen is that kid is going to be annoying and start spreading rumors to everyone. I am not a man of drama and don't want to play that card he just did, so what would I do? Consult my school?",15Oct2020,1
589,"My gf and I knew each other for about 4 months before we started dating (currently been 1 month since today) and things were going well, but... there were definitely 2 things that bothered me getting into the relationship. While I liked her, the things that bothered me were:

1. Her background: she comes from a very poor background and I come from a fairly wealthy background. Issue is, we didn't see things eye to eye on many things because she was always counting pennies, while having a nice meal at a Michelin rated restaurant for me was totally fine. So we'd have fights about ME spending my own money...
2. Her job: her job is super lax. She can sleep at work, and basically work 1 hour a day and still be fine. I work as an software engineer at a startup, so I'm constantly working. She just doesn't understand why my job is crazy busy and why I can't instantly reply some times or even why I can't call her. This got progressively worse as of late, where I have been stuck with working on 3 projects and working with the team in another country. So I'm working 8am - 2am some days...  It's giving me unnecessary stress/pressure
3. After we started dating, I think the second week, she told me that while she had 3 guys, she had slept around after her last BF since he treated her like garbage. I didn't care if it was one guy, but it turned out to be 7 guys. I didn't judge her, but it's been lingering in the back of my mind.

I feel like I got into the wrong relationship and have been thinking about breaking up with her. The additional stress is just too much for me. Since I am already thinking this way 1 month in, I feel like I should just end it so I'm not wasting both of our times. Am I wrong to think this way?

Also, I don't have experience breaking up with someone... How would I approach this?",15Oct2020,1

I don't mind if this anxiety and stress stops after I get bald but this not the case, recently I had a negative thought regarding something bad would happen to my eyes in future which scared the shit out of me. Whenever I think of something totally different my headache starts(migraine). The negative thoughts won't stop. My parents told me to read positive books, exercise regularly, pray to god have faith etc etc. I don't know it's not working for me. Motivational videos are not working for me. I don't have money for therapy. I don't know what to do. I don't want to have this headache everyday.

My question is, Is it necessary to go bald or wait to get bald in order to get that relief ? And I know people would say there are a lot of treatments for baldness but I am having it because of my negative thoughts not because of nutrition, lack of exercise, bad shampoo etc would I be able to get my hair back if this stress remains ?

I could say, that I am moderatly popular. No fuckboy, but some think I am smart, while I maintain the cool status. There have been woman approaching me, and I am always very polite and carring, but ultimately I feel nothing. Yet, 2 weeks back I met this foreign student, she is from Netherlands. I started talking to her, but not for long. At that point I thought nothing, and acted my usual myself, althrought my friend told me she is checking me out long after. I acted dismissively. Yet, when we reached our studying room something clicked. I somehow started to feel something. After the bridge was a bus stop, and I waited for my bus. She was walking with her girlfriend right behind my back, as I waited she went right past me, she looked in my eyes, and froze my look as if looking past her. I ignored her. I hopped on a bus and she looked at me even thou I was riding away. I had fucked up massively. She litteraly gave me chance and I fucked up. I had a difficult problem to solve as I was running late to a work, so that could explain that. But later that day, I thought a lot about her, and in the next week too.

There was once more time I walked right past her. I had recited to my friend some physiology stuff and she went right past me, and I ignored her once more, as I was a lame duck. Now that day I was real angry about myself, because never had I such problems, but then never again have I cared. Now that was the last time I will make a mistake I promised myself. I called in some favors as I have a lot of friends from univeristy, and one of them slipped me in her years facebook group, which I was rejected from as I am one year older, not her year. I found her on facebook, and started to write her, but she is not responding openly, like its always very short answers, when I asked her out she  I plan on buying roses and saying I am sorry that I ignored that way. That would be a pretty big gamble, considering she might deny everything I might look weird spoiling my chances forever. The thing I think care too much, to let her go.

606,"Hi everyone, I’ve (25F) been with my bf (27M) for 2 months when this happened. We got together too quickly, and our relationship needs, expectations, personalities were super different. We liked hanging out with each other in real life, but covid and quarantine happened. We didn’t understand each other well (and this was made worse by the fact that we were so different), so there was a lot of miscomm, we argued frequently, and my bf often felt like I viewed him negatively. I’d be triggered by the things he says sometimes and he’d say I’m picking a fight. To me, it felt like he didn’t acknowledge how busy my work was and needed way too much attention, and didn’t seem to acknowledge my emotions, he’d say things like, doing this was unattractive, say I was going crazy, etc. We both tried our best to make it work, we’d argue and patch up, then argue again. In the process, we both did things that may have wronged each other.

Bf: my bf had doubts about our compatibility a month into quarantine. He was very peace loving and had never really argued in his previous r/s, so he saw me as quarrelsome. I’ve no idea why but some of the things he said would tick me off. He had a rather big ego then, which I suppose I didn’t like. He craved for attention, to be understood, but I can be quite passive in general and made my bf feel unloved, and that his emotional needs weren’t met, or being considered. My bf reconnected with another girl, and they were more similar. The girl was interested in my bf and flirted heavily with him. As he was used to flirting with her in the past (while being single), my bf didn’t think much about it and flirted back. This went on for a few weeks. According to my bf, he didn’t like her, in a sense that he wouldn’t care if she stopped replying, he didn’t actually miss or think of her. He said i had always been on his mind, and he’d be very affected if we fought. My bf often ghosted the girl when things were okay between us; and would approach her again when we argued. Im generally okay with my bf talking to girls, but he says if I had stopped him from talking to her, he definitely would have. He told her we were in a r/s and tell her that we were watching certain shows together, etc, but would also mention we argued a lot. That they were more similar, but he wanted to give me a chance. My bf was attracted in a sense that he liked how much she just understood him like that, while I misunderstood and often hurt him as a result. He liked the attention he received, liked the way she made him feel desired. He didn’t know her well actually, they’re pretty awkward in person but she was just extremely flirtatious and friendly over text. A few weeks later we broke up, and my bf asked her to meet up, and watch movies together immediately. He’d tell her he was sad about the breakup, and was considering if he should call me back to get back together. We eventually did, and when we did, he ghosted the girl and deleted their chat as a commitment to me. He’d reply to her insta stories sometimes though. 

Me: During the relationship, I was also kind of frustrated with the way my bf was needy, didn’t seem to care that my work was busy, felt like he downplayed my emotions a lot, etc. He’d constantly kick a fuss about how I didn’t say i love you back, ask about his day, etc, and it was kinda annoying to me. I tried to affirm him more but I’m quite passive in nature; and it’s quite unintuitive. I had a friend of the opposite gender that my bf was uncomfortable with and asked me to stop texting. My friend liked me but I’ve made it clear that I had no feelings for him. I promised my bf, but I forgot about it and even video called this friend even though my bf had clearly said he wouldn’t allow me to video call any other guy except for him. I texted this male friend of mine the whole way too. I did so because I just didn’t feel like anyone should stop me from texting a friend. This male friend of mine would tell me at times to consider him, that he’d be waiting for me etc, and I suppose I did like the feeling of being desired, even though I’d tell him flat out that he wasn’t my type. When we argued, i’d turn to this friend to vent about my bf as well, spilling some things that were often very private and should have been kept private in a relationship. I sometimes felt my bf’s needs were ridiculous and i felt vindicated when my friend agreed with my pov, and I suppose sometimes we’d laugh at how stupid he was being. I’ve also texted my ex at times during my relationship due to the way we ended, we loved each other deeply but it just didn’t work out. I was concerned if he was coping okay, and would double text him if he didn’t reply. When I saw videos that reminded me of our past, I’d send him these videos as well. I liked when my male friends double text me as well, though I had not flirted with anyone. I also said things like, “you can go and find someone else if you’re so unhappy” to my bf in the past out of anger. I was heartbroken after the breakup and didn’t have the capacity to talk to other people of the opposite gender in the 2 days before my bf called. 

We got back together and worked things out. 4 months had passed, and we communicated healthily, we were happy, we compromised, etc etc. We fixed issues that had previously existed. I just found out about this flirtatious relationship he had with this girl, and I’m not sure how to feel. It feels like my world had crashed, to be honest. Things were going so well, and I didn’t think knowledge of smth in the past could affect me so profoundly. My bf said it was really because he felt so unloved and needed relief, he was confused, he didn’t think much about anything, he loved me and didn’t like her. But I felt betrayed, it feels like he emotionally cheated, being attracted to her and flirting with her. 

In the aftermath of this incident I had hurled insults and accused my bf for a week. They were mean and harsh and I shouldn’t have, saying things like he was trash, that he shouldn’t be born, playing into his insecurities and making him feel small. I was hurt, and wanted him to be hurt as well, so I was trying to hurt him as much as I could. I said I’d slowly destroy him and make his life a living hell, said I’d gang up with people he didn’t like to torture him. He eventually said he couldn’t take the hurt, and now gets mad when I ask questions about the incident, says I did things that were even worse and yet he forgave me. He doesn’t care if I cry and would say he’s tired of this “negative shit”, that I’m addicted to feeling depressed and he doesn’t and I’m an emotional burden. He used to be sure of himself, but currently feels unsure of himself, feels lousy. He looks at me and is sometimes afraid that I’d want to destroy him. But in spite of the nasty things I say to him he tries to hold on to us, and I’m not sure- does this make him a keeper since I had been emotionally abusive in my hurt? I’m not sure what to do, I blame myself for saying the things I’ve said, but I’ve my hurt to deal with at the same time - what do y’all think? Were his actions, his justification worth forgiving? Was I the worse one?",15Oct2020,1
607,"This is extremely disgusting so I apologize but...
I am a teenager, and was only recently able to pull back my foreskin, and when I did so, I found this disgusting white stuff on it that later revealed to be smegma. Anyway, after some research, I found out what it was and successfully cleaned it away. The only problem is, the really disgusting smell that was there is still very prevalent everytime I pull back my foreskin. Is there any easy way I can get rid of it or do I need professional help?",15Oct2020,1
608,"Hi 

I(20M) am a tertiary schooling student, in a chemistry based Higher Professional Education. 

I have not had much will to live for my entire life (going through memories or stories from when I was a kid already shows clearly to me symptoms of the issue I am now trying to solve). I am an only child, with divorced parents, my dad is one who also has little will to live and we can be extremely alike at times, though my mom does have an overly strong will to live at times (she never stopped working. She wanted to keep going on and it eventually broke her body). 

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing so many people set a proper example of having a will to live and showing the fruits it bore, it truly convinced me to pull out of the slumber, swamp, maze, heavy load-bearing semi-depressive state of unmotivation. I have set the first steps and I am truly proud of myself. I have learned to cook properly, with a few lavish and plenty of simple dishes under my belt, I have started cleaning the extremely dirty excuse of a house I live in and am like 30% done (which is a lot of work - its just that dirty) (I am forced to live with my dad due to circumstance though he has agreed to support me leaving the house for me to get my life on track. He has no will to live and one other big negative but really he's a good guy).

&amp;#x200B;

However the mess of my previous years still chase me in my mind. When some fight breaks out or some shit happens, then my somewhat fragile mental stability takes a toll on me. (I experience the societal constraints of this year pretty harshly for a number of reasons and I feel it contributes to the fragility of my mental stability). I just don't do anything except the bare minimum like I used to when it happens for a day or two. I am also just disorganized and will do math homework the next and then reply to e-mails from a teacher from another subject and then this that this that you know how it is 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;2 Questions here&lt;&lt;

I think this is sufficient context. What I would like to know is, how can I limit the size of the backlash I experience from my mental instability? (I can't expect from myself that I can keep it all together all the time and I don't) 

How can I keep organized? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of what I am doing right now: 

\- homework

\- housework (cleaning mostly)

\- desperately try to catch any and all social events that are responsible rn

\- free time is watching YT and gaming (I really want to cut this down by a lot. YT/Gaming to 6 hours a week would be amazing, as they are the main source of forbidden apples so to say) 

\- Maintain my car (though it is well-maintained. Not much to do really)

Here is a list of things I would like to add into my roster in no particular order. I can't add everything and will make my choice depending on when I decide to add something. 

\- Expand my studies further. The current level of education is easier than I could achieve given good discipline and motivation, where only the latter is starting to get up there

\- basic sport (to keep up body health)

\- working out properly (I would like some muscle. I am 1.95m and not even 80 KG)

\- keep up with my hobby of amateur mechanic (I have an old moped broken up into its components I should get down to fixing. I will finish this within a year at most)

\- pick up another hobby related to music. Dancing, singing (people have said that proper practice would lead to a decent vocal performance though no opera lol), playing an instrument (I like saxophone and piano. Expensive though :L). People who dance / make real good music are just so beautiful and I want in on that action

&amp;#x200B;

612,"this feels almost stupid to complain about considering it’s not that big of a deal but it’s bothering me and I have no one to talk bout it to that will tell me if I’m being crazy😀 

so one of my best friends has invited me on various road trips over the past few months, and being a full time student (which she is not) I often have prior commitments as school comes first. we’re both 21F, and the past few excursions I’ve been invited on, I’ve said yes I’d really like to go, but to keep me posted on details and if it’s really happening (she’s flaky and changes plans often) because I will need to figure out school/work arrangements beforehand. 

multiple times now, after saying I want to go and making adjustments in my schedule to make it possible so that I can also have these experiences, she ends up not saying anything else besides that she’s still figuring out if she’s going. and the next day she’s just....on the trip..with the other person/people that were invited. 

I don’t have many close friends, and i don’t mind that, but it bothers me n hurts that I’m missing out on these experiences. Does she just really not want me to go? Or is worrying about my schedule too much effort that she doesn’t want to think about (even tho it doesn’t really affect her)?? Or is she just not thinking about it and I’m being dramatic idkjsjjfkwjdjekn...There’s obviously more detail to the specific situations but I hope some of this makes sense while keeping it relatively short.

613,"I have been trying to be more mature recently and I see this huge dilemma that I am constantly trying to change. I am 22 and know what I want in life and have been on and off talking to this guy for a year and a half, sometimes being friends with benefits. It always means more to me and he knows that. I confessed to him that I was in love with him one night and he continued to always want to hangout. 

I'm sure he has some underlying feelings for me somewhere deep down but at this point I'm accepting it will never go anywhere and even if it could I am in no position to wait years for a possibility. I want to be able to move on and give other people genuine chances without having this person in the back of my head in order to achieve what I really want in life.

 I really care about him and I want to get all of my belongings back, but I don't want it to be a petty thing, I just genuinely want no ties any longer. I really do care about this person and I want him to know if he ever needed me I'm there, but not in this way any longer. I don't want to be doing this to get a reaction out of him in any way, and I am not really sure what to say because we have been through a lot.

I want to quit so I can focus on school more, but I also cannot quit because I won't be able to pay off my tuition if I do.

615,"So about a week ago while I was asleep I let my cat out of my room after he was in it all day, and he was running around downstairs. My friend that I live with always sits in the middle of the living room floor on his gf's laptop all day watching YouTube, and my cat runs past knocking over his cup of tea onto the laptop so it doesn't work anymore. 

They want me to front $900 for a new laptop when it's almost a four year old machine and was not worth $900 at the time of it being broken (it was already falling apart). I cannot afford that much and to pay the rest of the rent and bills (I pay for half of everything) and to feed myself for the rest of the month. 

My friend's gf needs the laptop for school asap I understand but they want a new one now and I can't do it, we came to an agreement that it'd buy an Amazon renewed one for $550 over the course of the next two weeks. After my friend was trying to tell me what I can and cannot afford to do, and did not believe my weekly paycheck. 

Fast forward a couple days later to yesterday and I was coming home from a therapist appointment and I open the door to my friend seething in anger about to cry and he told me I am going to pay $900 for this laptop, pay my bills on time, he doesn't want to hear excuses, and doesn't care about financial excuses. Saying I can afford to do this and pay rent and everything. I just said ok and turned around and left and went to my girlfriend's. 

No he doesn't have a job. Nor does she, but she's in school and she has a side hustle and her parents pay her shit. I'm incredibly mad there is no empathy here whatsoever, all of the patience and empathy I have for my friend and his issues and his gf. I am in a tight spot financially after spending a lot on my girlfriend's birthday, and money I owe her and now this.

618,"So long story short around this time last year me and my other cousin were asked to be a part of our other cousins wedding. His fiancé wanted both of us to be in the wedding because she thought it would be a good idea for some of his family to be a part of the bridal party. At first I was hesitant because I’m not that close to His fiancé and I really did not want to deal with a bridezilla. She was usually pretty nice but I could tell during the first bridal party meeting that she was going to end up being a bridezilla. 
When we first met up my cousin‘s fiancé (we’ll call her Ashley) she had told us exactly how she wanted our hair for the wedding. She wanted everyone to get a certain hairstyle and because of this my cousin had to pay someone to get a wig made. No problem. This was in November when she told us what the hairstyle would be, well in april she turns around and tells everyone that she’s changing the hairstyle. In the group message my cousin simply asked Question her about it, stating that she had already paid a deposit for someone to make her a wig. Ashley then starts bitching at my cousin and telling her that she Can change the hairstyles as many times as she wants. Which we thought this was unfair, because My cousin had already paid someone to start making her wig. They had a long drawn out argument in the group message and Ashley’s sisters were there to defend her. They told my other cousin that she could drop out if it was an issue.
So after this situation cooled down, a few weeks later.. Ashley tells us that we have to purchase our dresses. Which were $200. My issue with this was that the country had just shut down before hand due to coronavirus and she was hell-bent on making sure everyone paid for their dress before the deadline. At the time, we didn’t even know what the future would look like or if the wedding would even take place because of the pandemic. She made NO effort in trying to get the payment date pushed back. Her response was “well COVID or not..y’all still need to get your dresses.”  I was annoyed by this but decided to move forward in purchasing the dress. 
A few weeks after this, we get a message from the bride saying how we are all the worst bridesmaids ever and how she hasn’t heard much from us (lie) since she moved across the country (they moved in the middle of the pandemic). After this, I saw her make several posts on social media about people being jealous and envious of other peoples accomplishments, “even family.” After this incident, She became very passive aggressive with everyone. Every time we ask her a simple question she would snap at us or make a passive aggressive comment. It pissed me off because I didn’t have to be in the wedding and I really didn’t do anything wrong for her to try and attack everyone. 

Long story short, My cousin and her end up getting into it and she kicks my cousin out of the wedding. I decide to drop out of the wedding myself because I really had no desire to be in it any more after this situation. She offers to give my cousin her money back for the dress And promise to give it to her within a week. Two weeks have passed and Ashley sent nothing. My cousin had to reach out to her on several occasions to send the money and she eventually did after three weeks. Ashley also told me that while my dress could not be refunded, she would ask her niece (who everyone bought shoes from) To refund me the money for the shoes that I purchased. For starters, I never received a tracking number for the shoes that were purchased through PayPal. I reached out to Ashley two weeks after she promised that I get my money back and she said that Her niece has not received the shoes and when she does she will refund the money. I believe that I’ve asked her maybe three more times since then and each time she tells me she hasn’t heard anything. This was two months ago and I NEVER received a tracking number. I wrote her about the shoes yesterday, questioning why I never received a tracking #, and still have not received a response. The wedding is in three days so I’m sure that her sister has Received the shoes by now.
I’ve been trying not to hound her about the money but at this point I believe that she is purposely avoiding me so that I can’t get the money back for the shoes. I’ll plan to ask her about it at the wedding this weekend if I do not receive a response from her today. WIBTA for confronting her about this after the wedding?",15Oct2020,1
619,"High school relationships can be wack, and often result in two immature adolescents searching for the true meaning of “Love”

I met my boyfriend about a year and a half ago at my work.  Didn’t see him very much in the beginning because he was going back and forth to Florida.  We became friends and talked regularly for about a year before dating.   I had a huge crush on him, he’s a dirt bike, truck fixin, farm boy, a recipe for trouble huh...

We started dating in June of this year.  My Mom and sister are very protective over me, and they are both fond of him.  Him and my sister are actually decent friends now, which means a lot, I take my families opinion to heart.  He met my Dad, who also approves.  He’s introduced me to almost all of his family, they all seem cool with me as well.  It all seems right on paper... 

He’s emotionally absent, he cant take me seriously when I try and confide in him about crucial things and I feel like I’m always defending myself and the validity of my emotions.  Whenever I go to his house and we’re alone it’s almost always about sex, even though I’m religious and have told him what my boundaries are.  I’ve gone home crying because he choked me sexually to the point where I felt like my head was going to explode, and gave me several hickeys that I did not consent to.  I’m a very small girl, he’s a tall strong guy, so this freaked me out a lot, but I went along with it because I dont like confrontation and I dont want him to think I’m crazy, and maybe I provoked it.

He doesn’t want to spend any money taking me out.  Doesn’t make plans but if I pick a place he complains about the food.  He just wants me to come over to his house most times.  Sometimes I feel so amazing when I’m around him, so I excuse the bad things he does.  He tells me he loves me and that he wants to be with me forever, so I try and forget about the times he’s disrespected me... because he didnt mean it... right? 

Maybe I expect too much.  I just feel like I give him the world, physically and emotionally.  I’ve pushed my boundaries for him, I stay up late making him cookies, I’ve snuck out to see him several times.  He does do nice things for me he got me chocolate one time when we started dating, he took me out once and payed for it, even though he complained about the food it was still fun.  He gives me rides to his house too and gets me red bulls sometimes which is nice.  He calls me almost every night, even if the conversation is about him.  

Maybe I expect too much, I try so hard not to complain... he does say he loves me... 

I dont know if any of this made sense, thanks for reading if you got to this point

620,"“Do you even know how to use a tape measure?” He asked and ripped it out of my hand not even giving me 2 seconds to open it...

When something goes wrong it’s always my fault according to him, when really it is just very minor things that just happen and can be fixed in a second. Yet he acts pissed like it’s the end of the world and blames it on me.

Whenever I get my clamps ready he’s always like “hurry up lift the table” literally as soon as he gets the clamp on his side - both clamps take maybe 2 seconds max and it’s not even that fast paced of a job.

I don’t wanna talk back since I’m still learning things, I don’t want to screw things up talking about things I’m not completely sure about.

The thing is he is new also and has been working in that department less than I have and I’m supposed to be showing him what I learned but when I’m not sure about something he makes a big deal about it. He literally said “You didn’t know that?!” in a dick way clearly trying to bring me down. Another time I told him I’m not 100% on something and he says “of course not” (literally the second time I didn’t know an answer to his question)

626,"So, let’s start this off with I am far from attractive. This mostly has to do with my weight, yeah, I’m aware it is a problem. 186 pounds, 5’2, and a 16 year old female. It’s fine to judge lmao, everyone does. The weight is mostly in my shoulders and back. For the most part I have skinny legs, so I basically look like an upside down, overweight triangle. Yeah, not attractive. This has been a struggle for a while. It’s due to many causes along with, I have to admit, laziness. When I was younger I had a very low pain tolerance, and whenever I worked out I got terrible chest pains. Of course stopping exercise was no help, but I didn’t want to feel pain so I stopped. Now that pain in my chest is horrible when I try to exercise, and that’s probably because I stopped working out altogether when I was young. I started getting bullied at a very young age, I don’t know why. People just genuinely hated me, but when I started to gain some more pounds (mind you, I wasn’t even considered overweight at that point, kids in my class just thought it’d be funny to call me fat) they targeted that. The constant bullying for years on end played a huge part in my current, terrible mental state, but the trauma I endured has messed me up for the most part. This is the only context you’ll need, really.

Nowadays, I am so unmotivated and depressed. It’s hard to put into words how bad it is, so just imagine extremely bad. This isn’t for sympathy point  by the way, it’s just genuinely bad. I hate how I look, I hate everything about it. I want to cry whenever I look in the mirror. Basically I want to like how I look. I have a best friend who we’ll call Elizabeth for privacy reasons. She is an online best friend of mine, she made me feel like it’s okay that I look like this. Then, we met in real life. She seemed… disappointed. She makes jokes all the time now, and just flat out calls me ugly. We talked about it yesterday, she means it. I feel horrible. I started a diet two weeks ago or so, but I feel like it’s getting me nowhere. Also, here’s another thing. I’m now back into school full time. I get up at 6, school ends at 3:10, then I go to work, then I get home at 8:30. I’m always in pain, probably due to my weight, and EXHAUSTED.

627,"I \[M23\] live at home, just finished college. Been having troubles living here though. My mom has always been super nice and a great mother, my dad on the other hand is one of the biggest assholes I have ever met. Growing up, he'd always be the one to beat me if I were misbehaving or scream at me and terrify me. He probably thinks I forget that stuff but I don't. Now that I am older and stronger, I will speak back to him and put him in his place when he is out of line. He has always been weirdly obsessed with money to the point where I can tell that it makes him a miserable person. I understand the importance of money, but he is in the 1% and bitches about this shit constantly. For example, he will use the fact that he paid for my college against me and thinks that I owe him something in return, like I owe it to him to be a republican and have his ideals and blindly respect him ever though he shows me 0 respect. One day, I went in the hot tub with my mom and him, I express to them hundreds of times I have no interest in politics yet he always brings it up to me still. He brings up the subject of police, I told him how I see the only reasonable wayof dealing with the issue is to give police the same weaponry as civilians and make them have 4 years of training at least. Before I can even explain why I feel that way, he says ""well thats wrong because..."" I cut him off and say I havent even explained yet you have no idea if I am wrong or not. Then he yells at me saying how shitty it is of me to not let other people speak. The argument goes back and fourth, I keep my composure and am laughing throughout it because of his ridiculousness while he is infuriated with me. He goes on to call me a communist and to get out of his house. I do not prefer one political party to another, I would say I am more anti establishment than anything. As you can probably tell by now, he is a huge douchebag. I remember telling my mom to get a divorce throughout my childhood but she is christian and believes in one husband and unconditional love even though he treats her like shit. I literally cringe so hard when they interact. 

I do not know what to do but think I should move out for my own mental health and cut off communications with him. My family will not be too happy about cutting off communications but I know that I get treated like shit and he will never learn to treat me as a human being at this point. In his head I will just be the ungrateful spoiled son that used him for his money. I know that I have been treated poorly and not like a son throughout my childhood by him and that he is the rotten one not me. I also know if I pay for my child's education, it will be out of love and I won't expect anything in return. I get so sad when I see other people with good relationships with their parents cuz it seems like it is just so easy for them when for me I constantly get criticized for being who I am. When I first moved back home he'd always make jokes calling me gay or some other shit too. It wasnt until my sister yelled at him for being homophobic that he chilled with that stuff. I am tired of the constant disrespect. I do not know what to do.

628,"Mostly because of covid I don’t leave my room much. I leave once every other day/every few days but that’s about it. I see maybe one person every few days. I don’t have a lot of friends either so I’m pretty isolated. I don’t mind much but maybe it’s a problem? Is it normal?

It’s nice to go outside when the weather is nice but after like 5 min I’ve had my fill and just go back inside. Most of my hobbies are on the computer or don’t need me to leave my room so I don’t feel the need to leave.

Should I change my habits even though I'm fine where I am right now?",15Oct2020,1
629,"So I'm in a college apartment (off campus) with no RA or security system in place. When I first came to college, I had some roudy neighbors so the next year (this one) I decided to have an apartment to myself so I could you know...get some sleep at night (I know, how dare I). 

The first day I move in, the neighbors below me started blasting bass-heavy music that could be clearly heard throughout my apartment and vibrated objects on tables. They did this for over 12 hours (from around 2pm-4am) nonstop. After a couple weeks of them doing this, to varying degrees (sometimes it was super loud, sometimes it wasn't too long, but it was always annoying and at inconvenient times when I needed to focus on my work which includes a semester-long research project), I finally left a letter at their door basically asking nicely if they could turn down their music and not play it so loud on school nights so I could focus on work and get sleep. This apparently didn't work so I finally went down and knocked on their door a couple days later. Nice guys, we exchanged numbers so I could tell them when it was too loud and such, and we left it at that. 

At first, they pretty much abided by their word. No more music on weeknights and it wasn't so bad on weekends. But as time has gone on since the start of the semester, I have to remind them more of our agreement and it's getting to the point of just pure annoyance again where I'm woken up at 11pm by loud music on a Monday night with classes the next morning. 

At this point, I'm tired of reminding them and I don't want to be the neighbor who is constantly policing someone else's life, but like I'm sorry, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for there to not be constant music pounding my walls and floors. A party every now and then is fine, i really don't care if that were the case, but I literally cant enjoy my weekends the way I want to anymore unless I go over to my gf's apartment to watch movies. 

Anyways, I don't know what else to do. There is a rule about quiet time being after 10pm but it's a college apartment community. I don't want to seem like an asshole by just going to the leasing manager or someone at the office over this and then causing them to get a warning or fine or something. But at the same time I need sleep and I need my anxiety to not be a mess so I can finish school. 

If anyone has any thoughts or advice, lemme know. Please.",15Oct2020,1
630,"I’m 15, and I live with my mother and my older brother who’s got a diagnose. He always tries to provoke me by saying I’m fat, have no friends and that he hates me ( usually he goes on for a long time) and I don’t really care about it all that much (though there was a period I did), the only thing that truly bothers me is how my mom doesn’t care when I tell her about it. Sometimes she says that it’s natural with his diagnose, and sometimes she lightly tells him off but it’s not like I feel like she’s mad at him, now don’t get me wrong, my mother is an amazing parent, she works so hard every day to get through the day getting him to go to school and it really is understandable she gets exhausted from it it’s just that whenever I make a comment back at him, she gets mad at me (her tone gets a lot more mad I guess?) and tells me to go to my room. She says it’s because she’s too tired to hear us fight and that I should just let her rest (same reason when I ask her to tell him off), and I can understand that, but whenever I get mad at her reasoning she just brushes it off. I don’t know how much longer I can keep up with this, I just wanna be somewhere else, but I don’t know if I have the right to it, I’d like hear some unbiased advice, and get an overview on both what others think of my behaviour aswell as my families, if I should change or just try to do something about it.

631," I  was with my partner for 2 months officially. Before that 2 years of on and off, from him. I'll call him C I guess. It was grueling and frustrating but I guess it wasn't purely his fault as his religion was strict with dating and stuff so we couldn't really date or even hangout. This time was awful and I had a really close guy friend (D) who liked me but was mostly respectful I'd say of my thing or whatever it was. Never acted on it after I said I was seeing someone. After about a year and a half I had some flickering feelings for him (D) because we were closer than the guy I was seeing, but I pushed them down. There was a bit of flirting but I shut it down, this was during a time where I gave the guy an ultimatum cause I was sick of waiting. But we (C) ended up becoming a thing again, I was really infatuated through this time I wanted it to work with C. We ended up dating for 2 months in end of Dec till March and during this time he asked me to stop hanging out with D, I did but we were still close friends. By this time I was feeling really checked out because of how things were going and I was stirring a lot of shit in our relationship because I realized I did have feelings for D, and it was causing me to compare how things were with C. They were valid like not seeing eachother, pressure, religion, somewhat judgmental but It was why I was realizing it and not trying to work on it anymore.

I broke up with him after 2 months and pursued this guy that he was always worried about, D. I didnt tell him I had feelings for him cause I was afraid and didn't wanna put salt in the wound, I genuinely felt like things weren't working anyways but really those feelings caused it to end cause I dealt with it all for so long till then.

I felt I moved on so fast and D and I had a sexual relationship quite fast. It felt wrong the first few times but ended up feeling ok and we almost got official but it ended up feeling wrong so I ended it. I took a bit of time to sort shit out then reached out to my ex C. I trickle truthed a lot about it because I was in a fog that it wasn't his business as we broke up, but it was because it was a big part of WHY we broke up and it was selfish to not tell him more so he could move on if he 2anted to, I didnt want to set him up as a back up I just was scared to admit how I had moved so fast. We got back together a year later and I was kinda dumb in this time apart for more than that reason but I guess it doesn't matter much as we were apart, but I was trying to fix things but when he gave me no hope I searched for attention elsewhere like I had sent nudes to a friend. Idk dumb stuff.

When he got serious about getting together I cut off D completely, we had already stopped hanging out after the sexual relationship ended but were somewhat friends still online. I committed seriously and I ended up telling C everything recently about the hookups we had, the details, how I felt before we broke up and he is still healing obviously because some details were missed out the first time I reached out, I thought I said enough but the fog lifted so I told the rest so its like I did it all over again.

I feel awful like I left for someone else after so long of trying, I neglected him when he was finally really trying. I was feeling awful when we were together, I had drifted so far and worse so I wasn't as honest when we first talked so it's like im a liar.

I hate myself and im afraid ill never forgive myself, he wants to move past this but I feel so appalled with my actions. 

Things are great now except for my guilt and of course his healing but that is my fault. We see eachother lots now, and there isn't pressure from outside sources but I can't accept that I deserve this and I don't want to burden him by talking about it and don't really have anywhere else to go.

TL;DR Had a rocky first go with my partner, I left because of stress and feelings for someone else, my bestfriend at the time. I regretted the fling we had and sorted my feelings out.. I am back with my ex, and things are great but I feel so disgusted, guilty and undeserving. I am waiting on councilling but I want to be better this time and I am creating better boundaries, he has my passwords if he wants them etc but I want him to feel secure I am not leaving and I want to forgive myself, not forget but forgive. Don't really have anyone else to talk to and I am tired of burdening him because I am supposed to be worrying about his healing right now, not adding more stress. I am so lucky and I want to show him I can love him better.",15Oct2020,1

635,"I had a quarter-life crisis earlier this year and decided to use my financial aid to do my own sort of ghetto, ""study abroad"" in Mexico. Especially after my father encouraged me because of his concern over how the US is going right now. Right now I'm living out of a hostel.

The thing is though, is that I feel it's a bit unethical to use the financial aid to live in Mexico if I'm not 100% deadset on continuing on my Cybersecurity degree, and I'd rather just work a regular job and have my own place while I code in my free time because I'm not fully convinced I need a degree to launch a career as a programmer.

Though now that I say it out loud, it almost sounds kind of silly to say that I don't want to finish my degree. I mean I DO, but it's just a lot of debt for something I may not need to succeed.

That said, getting a degree is good just in case I DO need one to get a coding job, and it is important to me to finish something that I started. And I mean, it IS helping me ""study abroad"" in Mexico.

I also don't regret coming to Mexico. I've learned so much about myself and human nature that I probably would have spent another five years learning if I had stayed back in the South in the US.

I've made friends, I've lost friends, I've been told I'm great, I've been told I'll continue to fail, I've hitchhiked out of potentially bad situations using only my wits and limited Spanish, every day is an opportunity to learn Spanish (which can be a massive career boost), it's a little easier to get out and about and exercise, etc. 

I'm also beginning to learn more about my own nature, and am really starting to have a little more faith in myself, more self-love, and most importantly, I've learned to trust my gut.

However, it's currently pretty hard to find privacy and space to focus on homework and coding in my current place what with it being a hostel, and there only being one library open nearby, some days.

But hey. It is what it is. If I was back home, I'd be working a 12/6 job with only time for about 1 hour of code at MOST a day.

And oddly enough, it seems like a part of me wants that. The pressure of succeeding to get out of a bad situation, but I know that if I can just discipline myself and focus, I can make leaps and bounds of progress in my coding projects and ambitions right here in Mexico because, I can devote my entire day to coding.

I also don't know what the US is like right now. Is it even possible for me to get a job back home? Is it possible to move anywhere?

I at least know that I can survive here in Mexico if I really want to. My money will last for awhile if I'm careful, and I can always go to the border towns and find work there or back on the US side.

But I've just now heard him, through one of the rooms we are renting out, that's locked, Talking to a young sex worker. Asking how old she was when she had her first, ask if she ever had two guys at the same time etc.

It's just the fact that he's married, and that he's very old that makes it uncomfortable and angry.
Also, he is somehow incapable of realising how loud he is. 

His only defence is pure ""No i didn't....Nope I don't what you're talking about"" mentality""

646,"disclaimer: English isn't my first language. This might be a bit long  


Ok so here we go. My parents have been married for nearly 30 years. For almost my whole life I (18) thought they had a perfect marriage. They never had major arguments and they make each other laugh almost every day. I thought this is how healthy marriage should look like.   
But that changed last year. When I was 17 mum started telling me stories about how dad has been flirting with other women (theit mutual friends told her) and about cases wher she thinks that dad has been cheating on her. This happened when they had a rough patch. Mum has been stressed a lot because of her job to the point of burnout and was venting to us when she came home (she did so almost every day). After a few months dad became irritated and had said on numerous occasions that she's being negative, has an attitude, is always complaing and is only spreading the negativity on everyone else. He did so both if she was or wasn't present. (I learned only several months ago how bad has she really been, because she kept it to herself and I think dad still has no idea about that she was close to burnout).  
Well during that rough year mum and I were talking about how both her siblings got divorced recently (both got cheated on) and how mum thinks that her marriage lasted this long only because she was willing to work through everything.  
Time went by and things got better. Both my mums job and my parents relationship. It was almost as good as before. Almost. I noticed that dad stil mentions how annoying her negativity is (bear in mind that she wasn't talking about it anymore for quite some time). But he talked about it only when she wasn't there.   
Ok, now to how I found out about his cheating. We have a house in the countryside. My parents are planning on moving there when they retire, for now we are using it as weekend house. The thing is we don't have internet there and the only one of us that has data is my dad. It's a common occurrence that he's on his phone reading news. One day, he was checking the news again and I peeked over his shoulder to see if there are any interesting articles. When sudenly he got a text with like a thousand kissy face and hearts emojis. I instantly remembered the stories of suspicion mum has told me. I couldn't think of any other reason why someone would send him this type of text. On other occasion, when he was elsewhere his phone lit up and on the screen was a text from some woman saying that she missed him. After that I became suspicious of him. I should mention that my dad is working on himself. Meaning he's not an employee. His job makes him travel across the country and clients make arrangements with him via phone calls or texts. Which means he could be cheating on mum without ever being suspicious. I started paying closer attention to him and actualy noticed something. After all these years that he has been doing this job I know how long does it take to get to certain cities and what time does he get back (he's using public transport and always travels at the same time). And I noticed that sometimes he gets from a certain city later than usual. It's not always, but it's often enought, that it couldn't be caused by traffic.   
I laso have a habit of checking my parents battery percentage when they are charging their phone. (Because they forget to do so and their phones overcharge. I told them about the damage but they don't really care, so I do it for them.) One time my dad went out for a smoke and left his phone in the charger. I went to check his phone (because it has been in the charger for quite some time) and on the screen were two texts from two different women. I know his password so i unlocked his phone and checked his messages. At least two women were sexting him and there is a chance that one other is also, but he was coming back so I quickly turned his phone off and went to where I was sitting.  


So now the question is should tell my mother what I found? I mean up to now, she only had suspicion that dad was cheating and that it was some time ago. I would not only confirm that but now she wouldn't have the comfort of it being long time ago. She also told me those things when she was really down and hadn't mention it since. Plus she never asked me to tell her, if I had any suspicion. Is it my place to tell her or should I let her have the benefit of the doubt?   
Any advice would be welcome. Thanks a lot.",15Oct2020,1

I'm a Biology major on a pre-Health track in college and everything has gone to shit. I want to go to PA school and get into a Master's program beforehand, but now I feel like I'll never be able to. 

This is my senior year, but because of all of the classes I've dropped, I'm going to have to take an extra semester. I dropped a class Freshman year and Sophomore year because I accidentally enrolled myself into too many hours and I couldn't handle it. So, by then I had three W's, which was my limit. 

But in Junior year, my uncle got cancer and I had to drop three more classes to help out. That added up to six W's. 

And then, my sister got cancer in my Junior year summer and Senior year (I was taking summer classes to try and catch up), and I had to drop three more classes to help her. It's just been a devastating four years in general, but now with NINE W's, I feel like I'll never be able to succeed and get into any Master's programs or grad schools. The Master's program I want to get into is a Post-Baccalaureate program designed to help pre-health and pre-med majors raise their GPA and gain experience in the medical world. My GPA currently is a 3.65, but I have little experience.

She texted me saying she hasn't been feeling well. I said you might be pregnant and she said wouldn't be sick the next morning. That it doesn't happen that fast. It was probably something she had from breakfast. I asked her to please get an EPT and she keeps saying she isn't pregnant and blowing it off.

What do I do?",15Oct2020,1
653,"Some of this might sound familiar because I posted on AITA few days ago.

I found a job at a coffee store that's open from 6 am to 9 pm.  The store officially opened on the 12th. We did a week long training from the 4th to 11th.

The owner is pretty chill... but that's the only good thing.

He doesn't realize that he can schedule people for a clopen shift. So officially, we'll get out at 9:30, then come back for opening at 5 am next morning. I told him I can't do that (I wasn't even freaking out), and he told me that I should take a deep breath, no need to overreact/freak out, communication is the key, and he posted the schedule ""early"" just for this. Well, he posted the schedule on the 9th... 3 days before the official opening. I wouldn't even call that early. But I decided to be polite and say that I can't work with 3 or 4 hours of sleep, and he ignored it. He ""fixed"" it next day, but his idea of fixing it is pushing back my shift by 2 hours in the morning.

Also if people ask an important question, he has to ask the corporate (even though he technically owns the store since he's a franchise). He also tells the people right there but doesn't tell everyone else. Like I asked about the breaks since he didn't tell us, and he had to think about it for a bit and only told me.

A girl got written up because she was late for the first time, during the first week that the store opened.

He lied about the tips and the wage to the same coworker. (Was supposed to be tipped out at the end of each shift, except now we're tip pooling. He told her $9/hr, but she's getting $8.)

He doesn't know how to open or close the store properly, or how any of the espresso machines work.

I'm seriously considering only sticking around until I found a better job. If you were me, would you start looking for a new job immediately?",15Oct2020,1

They’re willing to talk at the surface level on social media, but whenever I’d want to do something beyond that (platonically obviously) it would be excuse after excuse and the reasons for not wanting to hang out kept changing. I get the message that they’re not interested and I shouldn’t have to force things, but are people really that paranoid about feelings coming back? Like why is it so hard on their end to put the past behind, especially as I hadn’t made another move since?

And it made me feel crappy for a long time that I’m not desirable even as a friend because I solely expressed interest in wanting something more and would have been okay if it wasn’t mutual. After a bit of therapy, I was convinced they’re toxic and ended up cutting them out of my life. Part of me wishes I never asked them out, but maybe overall they were a shitty friend to begin with. Am I an asshole for making that choice?",15Oct2020,1

I’ve really tried everything to get better. But nothing seems to work. I’m a 20m and I finally took myself to a counseling office. I haven’t even met my counsler and they are already putting me on psyc medication

I need to get out of this town. This state. It’s what I feel like I need right now. Just to get away. I’ve always planned on buying a van and living off saving in Oregon until I find a job. But I have no money or a van as of now. I’m debating on just leaving right now. And I’m most likley going to.  I need to before I give in..

I get my last paycheck tommorow. And it should be enough for gas and a little bit of food to make the 24 hour drive to Oregon. I don’t mind being homeless and starving. I’d like your advice on what to do next

I’ve thought about pan handeling. But for a job. I hate asking for people’s money. I feel as if the struggle of being homeless and hungry is a lot easier struggle than being where I am. I want to know how hard it’s going to be to get a job while homeless. I don’t care if it’s under the table. Just anything to get me started.

I fear if I don’t get my life started there. I will take my life after. That’s why I’m here asking for advice. 

I don’t have any contacts in Oregon to assist me. So I will be on my own

I’m thinking it’s a good idea to find a public shower. Where can I find one? I’m from a small country town and I haven’t experienced anything bigger.

Should I go strait to Portland? How are the roits and covid down there. Will I be safe? 

Should I go to a small town?

Were is the safest place to park my car and sleep for the night?

I have light colored eyes like him, and people on my dad's side tell me I look like him/my grandfather (they look alike) but I've never really seen it. I have always looked like my mother's twin, same hair, same cheeks, same face shape, the only difference was our eye color. I've only ever seen my mother in my features.

When my parents were married, she was caught cheating (after the fact) on my father before and during their dating life/marriage. My father was naive (he admits to it) and never questioned me being his, but now that I'm older, I have this continued fear that might not be true. 

Don't get me wrong, I would still view him as my father, he has raised me and is the only father I've ever known, BUT I'm terrified for myself since I've always wanted to take a DNA/ancestry test and God forbid the tests came back showing he isn't my actual father. He would be heart broken and though our family relationship won't change, I think it would break me.

666,"This year, due to corona, I’ve been pretty bored and my social life has gone to shit. So in order to combat that, I’ve been spending a lot of time on discord and I decided to make my own server. I had a very cool and original idea for it. I spent countless hours setting up bots, creating channels, organizing things to perfection before I began to advertise it on some platforms. In no time it became quite active. Within a few weeks though, some drama happened. Some user within the group disagreed with my rules and so to spite me he created his own server—a complete replica of mine, ripped off channel by channel, and began to poach my members. I banned 4 of the people who joined as a knee-jerk reaction but re-invited 2 of them back when they reached out to me (and we actually got close). 

So I had to start from square one again and advertise my server endlessly until I got a bunch of new people to join. I was quite happy with my new user base. From what I know, the other dude’s server just died out. It was in the past. My server was very active and successful. 

Then I found out just recently that he decided to revive his own server and started inviting people from my server onto his. And then members from my own server helped with that by sending out invite links. Even to people who joined much later after the drama had happened. They intentionally hid it from me because they knew I wouldn’t be pleased if I found out about it and surprise, surprise, I wasn’t. I told them how it made me feel betrayed, but I wasn’t about to demand them to leave his server or anything, I just told them to stop inviting more people from my server. They agreed. But they didn’t keep their word and now like the majority of my user base is now on his server, at least my entire active members, which has vastly slowed down my server activity. People still show up, but it’s not poppin anymore. 

It makes me feel like shit because I know it’s just discord but I’ve used it as a form of escapism and it helped me through a really tough time. I had a vision for my server. I built up a community from scratch. It took months of advertising to attract members. And some guy decides to steal my ideas. Instead of coming up with his own ideas for a server and finding his own people he piggybacked off of me and poached my entire user base. And for some odd reason, my so-called “friends” are just going along with it.  

I decided to take a mini break and stepped away from discord for a few days. When I came back, it was a ghost town. None of my mods even attempted to keep the server alive. As soon as I came back, people began talking but it’s still very slow. If I’m not being 100% attentive at all times, people don’t carry on without me. I see they’re online. But they’re on the other server.

I’ve considered deleting it and moving on, but they’re still my friends and I still have a vision for my server. It was just severely hampered by this dude. Idk what to do next and I’m aware of how silly I sound, but I invested a lot of time into this. And I feel betrayed.",15Oct2020,1
667,"So I made a pretty significant mistake at work and am getting multiple complaints because of it. It probably cost my work a shit ton Of money.

On top of that, I haven’t really been on my A game lately and have been doing my work right but with delays and a little back and forth and a few complaints here and there from nothing serious, just people that like to complain (i.e. one person got upset because I didnt do something the way he liked even though the way I did it is the way we’re supposed to - complaints still add up as complaints even if it’s just someone being difficult).

The mistake that I made was made when I was severely depressed and actively seeking treatment for it. My work does not know about my depression and I don’t want to tell them in fear that they’ll take away responsibilities and decrease pay. 

If it comes to getting reprimanded, does it make sense to bring up how I’ve been in treatment and am willing to go onto pills if it’ll keep me on my game like I used to be?

669,"My SO and I were originally planning on having our wedding ceremony before Thanksgiving this year. 

However, when Covid hit, we decided that a courthouse wedding this year and a big ceremony with our full families in a year or two (depending on whether or not the pandemic eases up considerably), would be best. We have been very transparent with both of our parents that we haven't decided between being alone for the courthouse wedding or having them there yet. However recently, we decided that we'd like to spend our wedding day alone together, as the big ceremony would be mainly for the family anyway and we'd like an intimate moment for ourselves. 

This is more than likely going disappoint a few people, and we are prepared to handle that. The only issue is that SO's parents like to be ***extremely*** involved in SO's life, and will more than likely be devastated that we decided to do this without them there. 

SO and I agree that we should tell them before we actually get married as telling them after may cause WW3. The only thing we can't decide on is how to tell them. I think we would go see them (they live 6+ hours away) and tell them in person. SO thinks we should call them and tell them over the phone.

676,"&amp;#x200B;

I am a (20M) my sister is (24), and my mum (60) and Dad (67). 

All of my life my parents have been hard workers, they earn very high salaries for where we live and own a number or houses and investment. As a child we were send to private schools, both of use went to private schools and were treated fairly. 

Our mother worked very hard constantly, and when she was home (very little time) she was always very dismissive of my problems and paid lots of attention to my sister. Out Father grew up incredible poor, and try’s to instil a sense of appreciation of money, and I unlike my sister have taken this to heart as I like to spend money however I like to earn it as it gives me a sense of pride in what I buy. 

As we grew up out parent were never home, it sounds very entitled but we were pushed aside for work, I know why they did this now but as a child I didn’t understand and we were pawned off the nannys, we had one nanny who was very mean to me and my sister and we now realise that she was just plane abusive to me and my sister, I felt cast aside and unloved by my parents and when my sister started her exams, it got worse, I got even less attention and it hurt. I would try to get more attention by getting into trouble at school, but I ended up getting told off. My father was a very strict man when it came to school and disrespect and took no shit, no matter the context. 

Whilst this was going on, I was gaining a lot of weight (this has continued to this day and am trying to change it), I started to get bullied very badly. It got to a point when I could no longer just take it and  all the abuse and one day I just lost it, I ended up breaking a kids arm and leading 2 other kids with bloodied noses and black eyes. I ended up having to be restrained by the teachers because I had complete lost it. Even to this day I only know about what happened from teachers and other who told me what I had done as to me it was all a blur. This continued for year the smallest thing would set me off and it got so bad they were threating to expel me; this is when I got really interested in science as a way to refocus myself on other things.

I have always been called bright and from a young age I was able to just remember things and understand concepts and apply them with ease. I never had to try in school and got good grades. However, this did not get any attention from my parents, as this was what was expected of me. To cut a long story short I wanted to be a scientist until I switched schools, I was put in a lower set that I was supposed to be in and due to my interest in science I was ahead of all the other kids, I was essentially told to shut up and sit there I lessons and it killed my love and enthusiasm for science. It started my downfall into a very very deep depression when I was 13, every day I would wake up regretting waking up, I was like an empty shell. Nothing I did made me happy anymore and I just gave up. I was able to keep up my persona around my parents friends and teachers until I was 15 when I just couldn’t take it anymore, and it just got too much and my friends told my parents about how I was feeling.

I was about 3 months away from taking my exams and I just didn’t have a will to live, I would stroll to the train station, and I just repeated everything over and over, It felt like I was watching a movie (if that makes sense). 

One day I came in 25 mins late to our registration and my teacher asked why I was late, and I said mind your own fucking business, and he sent me out of the room obviously. He took me into a room and he sat me down and he sat next to me and said “what’s wrong” and I said nothing and he asked me again and again until I just broke down I started to cry. I ended up running out of the room and taking some time for myself and went late to my lessons. 

When my parents found out that I was depressed from my friends, they just asked why, not asking me if I was ok, just why our son. They sent me to a therapist who did not care and I think my parents only did it to push the problem off to someone else. 

After 4-5 sessions with his therapist she decided that I was completely fine and happy with life, my parents just took her opinion and just ignored me. Like I was not even there and the whole reason that we were there was for me not for their peace of mind.

We went home and they ordered food in and did a mini celebration for me being OK, I just went numb. I haven’t felt anything since then and my mother who is very manipulative (cries for attention and to win arguments, because logic hurts her feelings), she tries to make me do things that I have told her explicitly I didn’t want to do and uses her manipulation tactics to try and make me but I just don’t get effect anymore. 

My dad who was a very macho man and does not show emotions just ignored it completely and brushed it off. Some other things happened between me and my dad during my childhood that I don’t want to get into but we don’t have a good relationship, he used to have all the power in the house but due to his age he has become fragile and no longer has this power over me.

Now that my sister is at uni and I am starting now, would it be wrong of me to cut them all off, my parents are paying my rent and I don’t think that I can pay for it myself even if I got another job. And I just do not if I should just put up with it for the rime being and then once I graduate cut them off completely. I have no desire to have a relationship with my family and I have always been the outcast as I am not very sociable and do not like people as I do not trust people due to me being bullied, and I fell like no one will miss me but I just really need the money right now especially with all that going on. 

I know its wrong to feel so much hate and resentment for my parents and sister, but I just can’t stop having this gut feeling of pure hatred when I see them, they try and act all nice and happy with me and it just makes me want to smash my fist through a wall.",15Oct2020,1

678,"I am going to try and explain my situation in the most streamlined and least convoluted way possible but I apologize for any unnecessary details that get thrown in.

I started law school in August and for anyone that is at all familiar with the law school experience, it is a very high stress and ultra competitive environment. I decided before the first week even started that I should try and find someone to be my study partner. I reached out to a girl that I had met when I took a tour of the school in January. It just so happened that we both ended up getting full ride scholarships to the school, we both grew up in the area, left for undergrad and then came back to the area. I knew from when we had met during our tour that we kind of had a similar sense of humor and she was obviously intelligent, so I asked her if she wanted to be study partners and she said yes.

From the start of our friendship I always thought she was beautiful but we worked really well together when it came to school so I never hit on her or anything because I didn't want to ruin that ""work"" relationship we had together. After about 3 months of getting to know each other better our ""work"" relationship has definitely flourished into a really strong friendship. We talk for hours on end every single day and we talk about our personal lives with each other just as much as we talk about school stuff. When I first realized I was developing feelings for her beyond just thinking she was really pretty, I told myself I would wait until the semester was over to ask her out, that was just in case things went badly I wouldn't lose my study partner in the middle of the semester.

However, then I found out she has a boyfriend, but she texts and calls me crying and complaining about her boyfriend at least every other day. She has told me things like ""If you are going to date someone make sure it is someone else in law school because other people just don't get how busy it can be"" and ""I honestly do not think my boyfriend and I will make it through the semester."" She asks me for advice and I have never outright told her to break up with him because I truly feel like that's not my place to push for that, if she wants to break up with him it should be because she feels like its necessary.

I honestly believe they will break up soon because from what she has told me about this guy, he is the absolute worst. However, even if they break up, I still am not sure if I should ask her out. Something I haven't mentioned is that on top of her being in a really rocky relationship right now and starting law school which is incredibly stressful, her dad was recently diagnosed with bone marrow cancer and has been going through chemo. Part of me feels like she just needs a friend right now and I should do everything in my power to just be a support system for her but the more selfish part of me doesn't want to friendzone myself and lose out on getting a chance to date her, what should I do?

(Just as a side note, I have NO IDEA how she feels about me, some days I am 100% convinced she is flirting with me and other days it is hard to get more than one word responses out of her, so that further complicates the situation.)",15Oct2020,1
679,"Hello fellow Redditors,

So as the title says my bfs bday is coming up and I want some ideas on what to get him.

Just some background on him, he is a nerd. We both play League of Legends, Destiny and a few other games but he's never been interested in in-game purchases so that's out the window. He's also heavily into stocks so I was wondering maybe like a fancy calculator or something along those lines?

He's never been a fan of spending money on himself he's a vey minimalist person and is very happy with what he has and won't buy anything unless he truly has to.

Thank you for reading (:",15Oct2020,1
680,"Hey I’m having trouble making a decision on 2 potential paths I could take and it’s hard to make a decision just alone and especially when all of my family and friends are telling me different things. I’m not asking for a decision to be made but if anyone could point out pros and cons of the 2 paths that maybe I didn’t notice by myself that’d help me out a ton!

My situation: At the start of September I moved to a new city to begin first year engineering at University of Guelph, to put it lightly, online learning and a couple of other factors made it very difficult for me to focus on my school work and I also wasn’t even really excited about going into engineering in the first place. I withdrew from the semester which means i dropped my courses this semester but I can come back next year if I want to in the same program.

My two options are the following:

Option 1: Continue to live in Guelph working full time until April 2021, then work full time over summer and during all this try to figure out what I actually want to do with my career so that when I attend a program for that thing I’ll be motivated to work hard and power through the tough times. 

My pros:
-Will save a lot of money
-Will get more accustomed to living on my own
-Get my work ethic up which will prepare me more for whatever program I choose to take
-Can focus on getting rid of some bad habits I’ve gotten into such as smoking weed and vaping

My Cons:
-Parents think other option is better and might stop supporting me emotionally partially( I know I shouldn’t rely on them but ayyy I may have parental emotional support issues esketit)


Option 2: Continue to live in Guelph working full time until December 18th, then move to Sudbury to try out a well renowned trades program for Powerline technician which I’ve been looking at for quite some time, the money is attractive but also hands on work might be better suited for my personality and if I attended that program it would show me if I liked it or not. From there I can decide whether to stay in the program or go for something else. The nice thing about this option is I can stop the program in May 2021 and I’ll still be able to attend a program starting in fall 2021 if I applied and was accepted.

Pros:
-Get to see if I might like Powerline technician or any other hands on trade
-Can still withdraw if I dislike the program after first semester (May2021 end) and attend a different program in fall 2021
-Fresh start in new city where I know absolutely no one (in Guelph I have a lot of friends that have known me for a bit)
-80% online, 20% in person

Cons:
-Might absolutely hate it and despise taking the program but force myself to follow through in the program(could be pro for work ethic)
-Might make no friends and be extremely alone which would definitely take a toll on me.



Any more pros or cons you all can see would help me a lot and maybe some of my pros and cons are deluded a bit and not living in reality, id love some input thanks erbody! :)",15Oct2020,1

So as the title implies I’m one of the multitudes of students  being forced by their parents to to medicine. All my siblings are going to become doctors and I know that I could do it, it’s not even that I don’t want to become one. I have no interests other than anime and video games.unfortunately lol, but that’s only because they never let me think of anything else, I spent my last year staying in school from 9 to 9 and of course have no free time in the weekends. I got the shit beaten out of me when my parents found out a skipped school one day last year. They threaten me if I show an interest in anything not medicine related, and I haven’t been allowed to go out with my friends. 

But like I said I’m not hugely opposed to medicine, I just feel I’ve been brainwashed to think that way. There’s no way all my siblings just ‘chose’ to be doctors (3 of them). I have only 2 months to decide on the college course I want to do. But I’m pretty sure I’m just going to go into medicine at this point. I feel like I’m just venting, I kinda want advice not just on this but like, where to go from here. I don’t want to be what my parents choose me to be. My life plan was written before I was born. My eldest sister has been my parents’ puppet, medicine, as they wanted she’s probably gonna marry who they want her to marry and all that shit too.

I just want some individuality they chose everything for me, recently I spoke to my dad on the phone since he works far now as he is a locum doctor. And this was in Arabic so I can’t translate directly but essentially he was complaining I wasn’t studying enough (tf??) and he signed me up for a different school that has longer hours. I for the first time basically said that they were forcing this all me. He was taken aback and didn’t speak for a few seconds then obviously he used the “we spend so much on your private school” and “disrespectful to your father” cards. 
This pissed me off a lot and is the reason I’m writing this. I’m so lost advice plzzz.

Everywhere I go in school he is there and I can’t even talk to other people without him just appearing and making some shit joke, and then he won’t leave me alone. The reason I haven’t told him to leave me alone is because he is the most sensitive person you will meet, like when someone called him annoying he was practically crying. He keeps asking me if I want to go out anywhere and do shit and I can’t just keep saying that I’m busy and I need advice on how to get him to be less clingy. Because (idk if this sounds petty) but it gets very tiring that he is constantly texting me and shit and I can’t have some time alone anymore.

687,"My husband and I had the opportunity to rent a 2 bedroom house from his dad for cheap when we moved out of our 1 bedroom apartment over a year ago. At the time our daughter had just turned one and we thought it would be good for us to have the extra space and our own yard. The neighborhood wasn’t appealing at all but it wasn’t as bad as other areas and was really the best we could get with my husbands pay and me being a stay at home mom. 

Maybe the neighbors across the street were quieter before or maybe I wasn’t so bothered back then, but as of this moment I stand to say I may actually hate these people. For multiple reasons, they are the worst neighbors and just the kind of people nobody wants to be around.

There had to be at least 6 people (2-3 being young children) living there when we moved in and 3 more random people have moved in in the last month. Every single car these people drive are such pieces of crap that they can’t leave without you hearing them pull off, and that’s on top of their shitty music they blast EVERY SINGLE TIME they leave. They constantly come and go at all hours of the day, including at night so yes, all of us get woken up multiple times a night. My husband having a history on the wrong side of the tracks, from his observation, he says these people are 100% buying/selling drugs. They are always inviting people over and standing around yelling in the yard, there are constantly visitors sitting outside in their cars, they constantly throw trash everywhere that ends up in my yard, they leave their kids outside all day to make more noise, they let their 2 dogs and 6 puppies run around in the street and in every one else’s yard, they are constantly fighting with each other, etc etc etc. ANWAY. The cops have been to this house 4 times in the past year so whatever our speculation is, we know these people are up to no good. My husband has recently asked me to just stay inside unless I’m going in the back yard because he doesn’t want the random people visiting to know we live here and their 2 dogs have already ran in our yard and nearly attacked me when I was checking my mail (we already called Animal Control and they did nothing). I don’t want to live where I can’t do what the fuck I want. Ya know?

Every time I hear a peep from them anymore, I just see red. I’m literally losing sleep over this people. I’m always angry and irritable and guess who I take it out on? At this point, I think if they just stopped blasting their music, I would feel a little bit better. We’re supposed to be moving in the next 6 months as we’ve come into a little extra money, but I don’t know if I can make it that long. How am I supposed to deal with my temper with these people?

689,"Throwaway account because some of my friends know my reddit.

So, I (M)have a thing for muscular girls, it's not something I look for in girls, it's just a weird fetish I seem to have, so I regularly masturbate to pictures of fit girls. I'm not into bodybuilders or anything, just girls with a strong fit body. I haven't told anyone about my fetish.

My friend(F) is skinny. In the summer she started working out so she developed a six-pack. She boasted about it and then I asked for pictures,teasing her about it, fully knowing that I would masturbate to them. I was really horny at that time. She sent one pic and that was it. This situation continued, as I kept teasing her for her six-pack and how she doesn't have one etc. So she sent more pictures etc. I kept masturbating at them.

At this point I want to say that I don't wish to have a relationship with her, we are really good friends, but I don't think that we would make a good couple. In any case, my actions are not influenced by the fact that I find that attribute of hers attractive. I wouldn't try to force a relationship or anything because of it. I even give her advice about her relationships etc.

Today we talked about working out. I'm working out too, and she told me that she only worked the abs. She then started sending videos of her working out. I didn't ask or anything, she just told me that these exercises are really good etc. So again, I was horny so I did the same.

I personally am feeling guilty about this, since she doesn't know I'm actually masturbating to her pictures(obviously). But my fetish is too strong and I lose control of myself. Do you think this is weird and I should stop it, or since it doesn't affect my actions, just keep it a secret?",15Oct2020,1

A year and a half ago, My mother had a procedure done with her back, and as that heals - she’s been heavily restricted when it comes to her back - especially bending. She’s need me to dress her, help her with almost very everything she needs to bend, lift etc. I get her her food, Help her make her coffee (she can’t lift the milk carton) the housework, the groceries, help her with her shower (I only dry legs, but I need to prepare everything) get everything bar a few light things she can actually lift - so a lot. I also Change the bandages on her back, and insert the gauze twice a week, which includes her showering to loosen bandages before taking them off.  She’s nervous when it comes to it, so it’s quite the job twice a week. 

She’s also in a bad relationship, and my grandma died a while back - so I support her. I also support my brother who’s in the late teenage years, and who’s doing through self esteem worries and teenage worries too (which is completely normal.) To put it this way - I’m in demand in my house - a lot. I accept that position. It’s what’s required.

Posting you want to die. (Even if you put, I wont, but think about it a lot, that's still serious.) And I would rather act on this information then have something happen to her. 

I had a talk with her after to which she stated I should have known she was feeling this way, and that she isn't sure she wants to continue this friendship, then talks about her intrusive thoughts and has a panic attack to which I talk to her for 4 hours.and she states she no longer wants to talk to me.

She then tells a friend she still wants to be friends with me. Just her feelings are mixed up and shell talk to me when she feels like it.

This has now gone on for 3 weeks, where shes practically ghosted me and ignored my existence other than saying, ""I dont want to talk yet."" and she wants to talk Friday, but honestly, part of me does not want to deal with this. Because I feel like I'm being reprimanded for being a good friend and worrying about their well being.

706,"Hey everyone, first off sorry for format as I am on my phone. Also, sorry for the length. I (24F) am in a huge dilemma and am looking for serious advice. I need to provide some background information before I explain my current situation. 

I am a Canadian and first generation student, none of my family has gone to post secondary. My mother got into alcohol when I was 16 and went downhill from there and I ended up moving away and going to university a few years later. I got an undergrad degree in health and physical education with a major in ecotourism and outdoor leadership. I know super specific. I love it, it’s my passion. I had a job in my field before the pandemic, and was planning to stay there for a few years until I can move further away and get a better job. I decided to buy a house during the pandemic because the job said they would keep me even after the pandemic, and I was counting on it to pay my mortgage and my $30,000 in student loans from the government. Fast forward to September, and they lay me off permanently. 

I have been looking for months even before I got laid off for a job in my field but I am in a big city and just bought a house which I can’t afford to sell so I am stuck here for a few years. There are no jobs in my field near me, they are all seasonal and at least 100kms away which I can’t make the commute everyday. I am not optimistic about the stability of the industry, especially being a new grad with little experience, and the pandemic. 

I do have a part time job at a grocery store where I have worked for the past seven years. I absolutely hate it, I am taken advantage of on the daily because it’s impossible to move up in the company and they keep cutting my hours. They expect me to do supervisor/manager duties and don’t pay me for it. I have also been looking for another part time job for on top of this one, but no luck so far. 

Now for the dilemma. I have been thinking for weeks on what my best option is, and I recently have thought of going back to school for IT specifically cyber security or cloud architecture. I have always been naturally good with computers but have not dove into the technology world and honestly don’t know much about it. I already have a house to pay for, 30k in student loans and am not sure if this is the best option. I’m looking for someone who is in this field and can tell me a little about it, or someone who has done a big career switch such as this and how you did it/why you did it. I am confident that if I do go back to school, I will be making much more money in the next 4-5 years than I would have with my current degree, which would help to pay my debt.

707,So can minors Chose to live with their grandparents without parent permission,15Oct2020,1
708,"This is a bit silly but I just wanted some advice on this.

Okay, so I have this neighbor whose a jerk and lives across the street from me. He had this loud diesel SUV, which would blast his heavy metal during the early mornings. Fortunately, he never took care of the vehicle and it died. He would always stare and just be completely unfriendly.

So my friend came over my house and he would notice something strange with my neighbor. Whenever he was in his car and about to get out, if I'm outside, he would wait and stare at me until I'm facing away from him then get out of the car and go into his home.

For some reason, my friend thinks since I'm black that my neighbor is being racist. My friend is white but keeps saying stuff like ""It's a racist trait that he thinks of you as some bad person that's going to harm or rob him"", he says this because he had a racist grandfather who sat in his car and waited until a black person wasn't around. I personally think he's just some unfriendly jerk.

Anyway, my friend was over my house and I decided to take the trash bin to the curb. Suddenly, my neighbor happens to pull up in his car from across the street and watched me as I rolled my bin down my driveway. I give a glance at him but just stared back somewhere else and saw a stick near my driveway. So I stopped and went down to pick up the stick and put it in my bin and then place my bin to the curb.

So during this WHOLE thing, my friend was peeping from my window and says ""Yep, that dude is godamn racist"" and I'm like ""Uh, how?"" and he says ""As you were going down the driveway, he was waiting and staring at you and when you looked away to pick up the stick, he finally left his car. That's how my racist grandpa was, he views you as dangerous or going to rob him"". 

But I'm questioning this and saying ""Well, why would he wait until I look down to grab the stick? If he was racist then wouldn't he just wait until I'm INSIDE my house?"" Yet he's like ""Dude, dude, trust me on this"" So then he wants to confront my neighbor and I'm like ""Man, this isn't serious like that"" 

But look, is he right or being way too judgmental with this? I personally think my neighbor is just some weirdo so I'm just going to ignore him. I'm not going to have some staring match with some weird person. Yes, it's very annoying to have someone just stare at me but I just ignore it. My friend is a little weird too but he means good and always has my back. Yet I think he's just super off on this.

711,"Hey guys,

I'm still trying to work out the problem so please bear with me if I forget some details.

My dad (m51) and I (m15) had a fight on the drive home from school. It started out with my grades. Both my parents know that I'm smart for my age or whatever and they've always said ""just try your best, that's good enough for us"". With the whole coronavirus situation, I'm at home 3 out of the 5 days I'm supposed to be in school which makes it super difficult to keep track of what I'm supposed to be doing at any given time. What's worse is that one of those days there's not guided instruction, the teachers for your classes just put an assignment on the website we use and then we're expected to do it. No late work is accepted (which I think is bs cause no matter what any of you say it's pretty hard not having the things I need to do in front of me). Anyways, I attend the classes and do most of the homework. However, a bunch of them have slipped through the cracks and my grades have fallen significantly as a result. My dad, being the one who oversees me and my work, has gotten many emails from my teachers notifying him that work is not getting done and that I'm falling behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's kind of where the current conflict begins; I walk out of school and I have to wait for my ride to come around to get me. I walk up to the car in a jovial and bright manner. I toss my bag in the backseat and ask my dad nicely how his day was. With a dark response of ""How do you THINK my day has been, AlphaGoldfish???!!"". I can instantly get the idea that something is wrong and a barrage of insults and faults is gonna come raining down on me like metal spikes (which happens every time he tries to talk to me about something). He starts bringing up my grades, that sorry means nothing to him anymore, that instead of doing my work I spend time on useless things like YouTube or Reddit. Since I have a bearded dragon, he mentions that he is the intermediary between me and the website we use to get the food to us and he also said that I pay for none of it (which is not true) and that I do no work around the house to help pay for it (which is also not true). He's using every swear word in the book to try to cut me down. I try to ignore it as much as possible. He made me feel like I'm worthless and don't deserve all the ""gifts"" I've been given because I never use any of them. I don't know what to do and I'm kind of in a dark place right now. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance",15Oct2020,1
712,"So I'm a 16 yr male and I just want some clarity of mind on if I'm the bad son or are my parents bad. Before you continue reading this is not a troll post I really wish it was but it's not this is my life. This will also be pretty long

So I'm only going to be starting from when I was 12 since that was when the most changes happened. This post will also only cover my mom since it's not much I can say about my dad and this post is already long


Mom: so me and my mom up until I was 12 and a iffy relationship some times it was good sometimes it was really bad. When I was 12 I invited a guy over he was 29 and we had sex. We were eventually caught by a family member and the police were called. We ended up going through court many counseling sessions for me and the guy ended having hiv I was lucky negative. After that I had my phone taken for over a year, my PS4 was mointored, I lost all my freedom that I had and couldn't go anywhere without an adult present.  

When I was 13 I did it again and this time I was sent to live with my dad for a month. 

13-15
When I came back I was given a phone but it was mointored still had no freedom and couldn't even do stuff like have my hair like I wanted ( I had a box haircut and basically I wanted to start over and get a afro and get free form dreds) but she said no because apparently that would prevent me from being a handsome young man and would very aggressively pull it out or pick it until it met her standards, was told I couldn't get my ears periced or get tattoos and was basically told her house her rules as reasoning. I was also told I couldn't basically go anywhere with anyone until she met the person and there parents when I tried to actually meet ppl my own age. Whenever I told the kids my age that they quickly lost interest, which eventually led me to invite another grown man to my house due to the fact that I tried meeting ppl my own age but everyone time I asked the answer.

15-16 after the 3rd time my phone and PS4 were taken.  I told I couldnt have any electronics until I move out. I couldn't have a job unless I agreed for her to be able to keep all the money and for me to have to notify her whenever I wanted to buy something to make sure I didn't buy any electronics. I still can't leave the house really unless a adult is with me. I've been caught with about 6-7 different phones and will continue to get to them. I also haven't invited a guy over in almost 2 years now. I was caught sneaking out  and my room was taken away and I was forced to sleep with my grandma at 16 years old. I planning to move out the moment I turn 18 so far.

Its more to it but that's basically the jist of everything. Anyway do you guys agree about the things she did and does. 

Because imo she was way to over protective I feel like with me personally

1st time she should taken away phone for less then a year explained to me what I did wrong and gradually give freedom back and monitor my phone

2nd time same as 1st time but phone taken for a longer period of time and introduce counseling

3rd make it clear that he should only be meeting with ppl he knows and feels save with but trust his judgment. Get him things like condoms and possible get him on things like prep and STD test to prevent STDs, let him basically have more freedom maybe let him leave and come back at a certain time and maybe put a tracker into his phone can continue to check on him to make sure he's safe. At 15 let him have his hair like he wants it and his ears periced and let him have money and let him get tattoos at least on his arms",15Oct2020,1
713,"I have a friend who is up shit creek right now. Suddenly lost multiple family members recently, some of whom were immediate family, and she’s now sole breadwinner for her entire family. She’s putting herself at risk in a covid hotspot every day, working minimum wage. When she’s not working she’s running legal errands to settle her family stuff, and no one at home can help. 

When I still had a job I was setting a little money aside for her in case she ever needed a “loan,” but because I’m high-risk for covid my doc advised me to stay home. Havent found a wfh job yet and it’s probably gonna be awhile. 

What I would love to do is find a way to give her six months of her mortgage and car payments, and try to help her cut her work hours back so she can train for something she can do from home. She’s been talking about it but she barely has time to eat, let alone anything else. She isn’t really sleeping, either.

If there wasn’t a global pandemic on I’d do a fundraiser for her. But now everyone is screwed because of what’s going on, I feel funny passing the hat. Not to mention, if I did a fundraiser I’d have to divulge her name and her situation, which would be humiliating for her. She’s already so, so stressed. I can’t add to that.

He's been a bit revitalized by his new interest in streaming, his kid is having behavior issues, I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm on discord w/ him right now, apparently he's got roaches in his coffee cup. I know his power supply burned up from a roach infestation.

Its hard to say this in words or even get it out. I am trying to decide what to do with this life we have right now. Little things do matter and I try to thank you for doing those things. I cant keep living this way anymore . I am considering many options right now on what to do . One I leave and dont turn back see if I can get taken off the lease and just drive delilah to school or transfer her in the long run. Two just try to stay and work on things,but it seems unlikely things will be fixed. I have just had enough of everything . I have suppoerted you solely for a year dealt with the house being a mess and let you stay in your funk and depression . Im at a loss because you see I do work 40hrs a week and have a paying job supporting the bills and everything . I should not have to do all this alone and reguardless of what you say I fell very alone . There is just no way to convine to you how I feel you are treating me and how i feel about myself for letting things get the way they are. I do not know what to do because ive asked numerous times for help from you with dishes,laundry,trash. Things have to be done everyday and needless to say right now your hobby doesnt pay and you have more time available to help . Im pulling a lot of weight and not getting any results as to how I have accomplished keeping everything together on my own. I know I will be fine and I will have support from my friends and family should I choose to go on my own . I just cant deal with all this any longer. I will stay in the room all day and will not be coming out because I dont want to see all the nothing that has been done again while im working . We dont seem to really have a relationship anymore and I grow more resentful everyday because nothing gets done . Im tired,exhauseted,sick and many more . Im doing what I can to change things but its just not worth it anymore . I love you but sometimes in a situation like this love is not enough . I have dealt with your funk,depression,loss of job for a year now and im tired of it . ITs not hard to ask for the one thing you do is work on the house because your not working . You are draining me and my account and everything I work for because of your habbits and obsessions. I cant keep doing this and it seems no matter how much I convey to you the roach problem got worst when you started being here all the time and the house just kept getting worst and worst . ITs not the apartments fault but the residents fault because you are here all day dishes,trash,laundry nothing is done . This problem got worst when you became a full time resident here and not putting effort in home",15Oct2020,1

723,"Hey everyone! I'm relatively new to this community, but I thought I could use some advice :) Anyways, I was wondering if I should just drop honors algebra II and opt with regular because of everything that's been going on with myself recently. 

**Background:** I'm a senior in high school and I'm in the process of applying to colleges like UCLA, UCI, UCSD, UCB, CalPoly, etc. (I was thinking of taking up CS as a software engineer). Alongside with college applications, I also take up AP Gov, AP Lit, Art, and Honors Chem which are just okay to manage for the most part. My H. Algebra II teacher was known around my school to teach higher level math like AP Calc, Honors Trig/Pre-Calc, and formerly, Honors Algebra I. She always had specific honors students in her class since the beginning, however I am the only new senior student in her ecosystem alongside mostly juniors and some sophomores who previously had her. I myself started high school with pre-algebra because I did badly on the placement test, but I was easily passed the class as well as regular Algebra I with an A. Regular Geometry, I did pretty well too and passed with an A. At that point after Junior year, I had to schedule my classes for senior year and I got the principal as my advisor (I personally knew her and she knew me since my school is small). She believed she saw potential in me because of all of my straight A's I've been earning since Freshmen year and wanted to challenge me. We both agreed that I'd be placed in AP Gov, AP Lit, Honors Chem, and Honors Algebra II and told me I got this.

**Present**: Fast forward today, I still take the 2 AP classes as well as the the 2 honors classes. However, it's math class that brings me down a lot. I even feel anxious and stressed every time I go online for it. My teacher's policy it to base grades mostly on quizzes every other week alongside with homework quizzes where we copy down certain homework questions from our assignment. Otherwise, it's purely tests and quizzes and as of now, I have an 81% in the class and have another quiz I don't thoroughly understand due by Friday night. She's relatively hard to understand and goes very fast in her teaching. She doesn't necessarily check to make sure her students understand the subject and every time we meet, she would take about 20 minutes going over homework and move on to the lesson. She does offer tutoring sessions for an hour, but there's only so much I can do during tutoring sessions as I'm still somewhat clueless on what to do for my homework after the entire session. It honestly feels like I'm being spoon fed answers during tutoring instead of a more thorough analysis of what to go over. While doing homework, I often get brain farts when I can't understand a concepts she went through in lecture. I tried everything from trying to take my own, easier to understand notes and even record our lectures with OBS and watch later if I don't understand it initially, but they don't seem to benefit a whole lot. What do you guys recommend? Am I just overthinking everything or I sound like I'm complaining a lot? I appreciate you guys taking the time reading this and thank you! &lt;3",15Oct2020,1

Alright so i’ll try to keep this as short and non confusing as possible. A long time ago I had friends that basically were my childhood friends. These kids gave me the best childhood that any kid at the time could want and as a result we were day ones for each other. However, I moved to a new town and as a result I started to find new friends but I still retained contact over xbox and stuff with the old town friends. I tried to introduce the 2 groups to each other however it didn’t go so well and as a result there was a lot of fights and arguments due to the fact that the new group of friends AT THE TIME were very toxic and argumentative. That resulted in me having to pick sides and it wasn’t a good time mixed with the fact that my anxiety kind of picked a side for me. However now they aren’t like that anymore and as a result I became close with the new group throughout high school and essentially I abandoned the old group and it’s been eating me up inside. The last time I came into contact with anyone from the old group was when I went to one of the guys dads funeral. I wanna reconnect and rekindle a relationship with these people as they’re my day ones who even had my back when I treated them very badly. However it wouldn’t be the first time and I fear that they’ll reject me or chastise me for my mistakes which they have every right to do. I also fear how stable the friendship would be if I end up reconnecting or being attacked by this new group for trying to reconnect as some of them are stubborn and won’t let go of the past. Look I know I messed up and it’s my fault but I just wanna fix things as we’re 19-20 years old now and I just miss how things used to be.

734,"I just had an MRI about 2 days ago that shows 2 herniated and degenerative discs in my lumbar region and one is pinching a nerve.

Basically my principal (not so much the teachers) are trying to force boys to cut off  their hair and its not just me, its a bunch of other male students aswell and im not a disrespectful student or anything. I get good grades and i've been at the school since i started highschool. Does how well I do in school just get thrown out the window because my hair is long? And we can't stand against it because what can a couple of Grade 9's do? 

To give a better clue of my hair, its about 4cm long on top and I can't go to my parents about this because my parents will do whatever the school tells them about me. The funny thing is, in the official school government rules, the hair rule with having VERY short hair was an abolished rule because it was deemed unnecessary. The OFFICIAL government boys hair dress code is that boys hair shouldn't be pass the collar. 

I find it stupid how my school preaches freedom of expression, but im not allowed to have slightly long hair.",15Oct2020,1
738,"Hi all,

So I’ve never been one for scary movies, especially ones involving ghosts. I recently was listening to this podcast a friend was playing where people call in and talk about their real ghost stories. For whatever reason I really enjoyed listening but as I continued to listen the more I became scared of ghosts. I now get so frightened at night if no one is home at night that it’s hard for me to get to sleep. Last night I had such a bad dream of a ghost that I slept with the lights on. Any tips on how to not be so afraid at night? (I’ve stopped listening to the podcast, even though I really do love it but it’s not worth getting scared over) 

Thanks in advanced",15Oct2020,1

Im tired of going through breakups and just wanna settle down now, we both live in the other sides of the world and so the timezones are different.

We plan to meet eachother once we are in our 20s.",15Oct2020,1
740,"I don't know where to start but hopefully title describes the situation near enough. I need advice from anyone who moved past a truly dark time in a relationship, especially if your partner exhibited dysfunctional or painful behaviours, and how/if you went about healing emotionally and forgiving them to move past it. Especially helpful is any advice about what kinds of conversations really helped you or how you found ways to process your pain together without turning it into a focus on things from the past that can't be changed or making your partner feel blamed/like they have to relive trauma.  


 I (33F) and my partner, Evan (35M), have been together for 7 years. For most of the first 5 years Evan has had moderate to severe depression, and refused to get treatment. I know now I should have been more insistent, but at the time I didn't know how to handle it, how best to help him, and the occasional talk of suicide scared me a lot, and I was afraid to push him away or make anything worse. Unfortunately, in his depression he struggled to control his emotions/frustration threshold and would go on thought spirals. Sometimes he would need to lie in bed for days. He would frequently lash out at me verbally, or take a minor slight and take it massively out of proportion (for example, he comes home anxious, doesn't want to acknowledge the anxiety so needs an outlet, decides that the fact that I didn't go shopping yet is an example of me not caring about him at all, and then completely ignore me for hours, sometimes for several days at a time, and if I try to broach it he will ignore me speaking to him face to face). The worst element of this was the unpredictability -- some days something elicited the worst possible reaction. Other days I'd tiptoe around it and get anxious waiting for him to go off only for him to say it didn't matter at all. Some days he would be offended that I asked how he was feeling, some days he would be extremely hurt and sad that I didn't ask because he was suffering and couldn't reach out. Yes, I am aware of my problems as an enabler and yes, I know this was very wrong, as does he. At the time, I can't really explain it, the situation was so bizarre and intense and we were both so isolated from anyone else to talk to about it that I think we really lost sight of what was normal baseline. I also started to think the situation was really all my fault and that if I were saying or doing the right things he would feel safe enough to go to treatment (again, yes, I know this was very not good). We did talk very intensely and deeply and sometimes productively about the issues we were facing and about these behaviours, but these conversations were an emotional minefield because I always initiated them, and if they went badly, in the heat of the moment he would simply out-escalate me, (because I never really raised my voice before and I don't ever say things in the 'heat of the moment' that I don't mean), so he would just out-anger or out-volume/shout/say something absurd or really hurtful to get the conversation to stop, usually followed by telling me he didn't want to have a conversation anyway and that I pushed him to have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After he sought treatment a year and a half ago, he started taking medication. The meds had some side effects and we were very open about them but within 6 weeks they faded considerably. They are not perfect, but by my understanding of these types of meds he's extremely lucky with first type and dose -- he is insistent they have really helped, and I see that in the attitude he brings to everything he does now, it's completely different. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is -- he no longer does literally any of the behaviours he did before - no ignoring, no manipulating, no yelling at me (literally, after probably minimum once to twice a week previously), no losing his temper unpredictably, no semi-manic highs to whiplash off etc. I knew that these behaviours were a product of his anxiety and depression, and I am very glad he is no longer suffering too, but it has been extremely difficult for me to adjust. He doesn't remember some of the behaviours but he obviously feels very guilty and has apologised. We have talked about what happened a fair amount but it doesn't really seem to help, although it always stays civil now. My mental health is now in the garbage because of the years that our relationship drained me, I suffer from anxiety and have recently stopped working to take a break because it has become unmanageable. I know at least some of this feeling is because I feel that we need to make progress on fixing/healing our relationship, or end it, quite soon. I don't know how to process any of my feelings or pain, or to get closure on any of the terrible experiences I feel I had in a way that is productive, because I feel like I need his input. Before treatment Evan would escalate things unstoppably and feeling guilt was a massive trigger for him so if he did something and I wanted to address it it almost never went productively. So I feel I have a lot of ""unfinished business"" mentally. It has completely killed my ability to have a normal sex life and my ability to move on emotionally. In fact I would say now that he is better, I am less able to be open or vulnerable with him.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like we chose each other over and over through the worst and darkest times of both of our lives, only for him to pull up into the light and me to be trying, and unable, to go into the light with him. I don't want to have had a conversation about how things would get better and we would still choose each other over and over again, for years, only for that opportunity to arrive and I can't reach for it because the past won't let me. If you need to tell me that you think we should break up I understand, it's not easy to put a whole relationship into enough paragraphs that anyone would read it and the issues I need help with are.. ugly, so I haven't devoted time to saying anything about the good parts, either of him or our relationship, but there were also a lot of those! I know how to end it if I choose to, I want to at least try to have what we both wanted for so long, if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this far thank you for taking the time, I know it's long and with my anxiety probably at least a bit disjointed.",15Oct2020,1
741,"I'm failing every single class, I have no social life, I gained like ten pounds, and I absolutely detest going to school right now. 

In high school I used to have a 3.6 GPA, multiple extra curriculars, and invited to like every party. I used to be someone, I used to take college courses like they were fucking nothing and now I'm struggling to do anything. 

This pandemic has kept me away from meeting new people, getting meaningful social interactions and most importantly, getting any work done. I miss in person classes, I hate having to teach MYSELF the fucking work. I stopped turning in assignments, sometimes I don't go to class, and I'm absolutely miserable. I need a god damn class where I can speak to other people, be around other people, I can't learn by staring at a fucking worksheet on my own. 

I've also gotta mention the loneliness. I have no one out here. I sometimes sit in my car just to cry. I have a single plant I brought with me and it's my god damn best friend right now. If something were to happen to that damn plant I'd probably officially go insane. (had a few friends, turns out they're not really my friends and were just using me for all the technology I had like my projector, vr, etc. How do I know they don't really like me? They only invite me when they want something I have. otherwise I can hear them laughing in the dorms when I pass through the halls or see them on snap)

Anyway, My college isn't doing in person classes but we're staying in dorms for some god damn reason. I'm in a new state entirely alone and that on it's own has been taking a toll on me. Arizona; you're a shitty state by the way. I'm half black and I cannot comprehend the casual and overt racism this place does DAILY. I was called the n-word by passing car just yesterday, people stare at my long braids and have the audacity to touch them, not to mention motherfuckers asking me about the riots like I'm the spokesperson for all god damn black people. AND THE STARES!!! I FUCKING HATE ALL THE DAMN STARING. IM NOT A GOD DAMN ZOO ANIMAL YOU FUCKING CRO MAGNONS!!!!

I can't go home. My parents just divorced, and are selling the house. My mom has a one room home and my dad is living with my aunt. My grandpa had a bedroom but my brother is now living there, so I have to stay on campus. I have no where else to go but I don't want to stay on campus. least of all Arizona, this place blows major ass and I'm supposedly in the most liberal area.

I just waste away in my dorm now. I lay in bed and sleep, scroll through reddit, I cant even bring myself to play videogames and that's like my favorite thing to do. All I do is just exist and feel sorry for myself. I look like the Pillsbury dough boy, no one likes me, and I'm feeling really tired all the time. I don't want to exist anymore, man. Now that I think about it I don't do most of my hobbies anymore. 

I'm angry, I'm miserable, and to be completely honest I kind of wish that time would stop so that I can get any bearings. I just want this pandemic to be over. I want to be in class. I want to meet people. go to parties, and get my life back together. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? How do I get any better? The semesters almost over, do I even bother emailing my professors? What happens if the school gets rid of me? I have no where else to go. How do I meet people and not get sick? what do I do.... I feel like I'm stuck in an endless cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

743,"I don't wanna be that a-hole that keeps a relationship going for too long when their heart isn't in it for months or years, out of comfort. I don't know what I feel. Reddit, I was so sure I had met the guy I was gonna marry within a few months of dating at 19. 

We don't have many obstacles except his glaring mental health issues. He won't see a professional (I forced him to see a free online therapist who ""diagnosed"" him with this thing he so clearly has). It's caused him to act really selfishly. It's really hard for him to resist telling me all his mean thoughts or bad things he's done, it's part of the disorder. He gets overwhelmed with guilt and telling me (or in the past his mom), calms him down. I was OK with this happening daily for a month or 2, summer 2019 but it started really getting to me. Many of the mean thoughts centred around me and it made me feel insecure whenever he would confess and then tell me he's pretty sure it's just his disorder talking. I felt like a therapist or a mom, trying to keep his relatively sane for 3ish months. He could say sorry and try making up for it all he wanted but the damage was done and some of those comments still hurt me and make me feel insecure. I've cried over some of these things in private. 

He relapses every so often, usually just for a month or so where I'm hearing a mean thought a few times a week. Normally it might happen once a week. He has been OK for the last month or so, but I just feel so bitter and like I could easily find someone without this issue that will come and go (forever?). I used to miss him almost painfully, if I didn't see him for a few days. We're both doing online college for the year cos COVID, so we're an hour apart and I see him 2/3 days a week. I don't think I've felt sad saying goodbye in 2 months. Now I haven't seen him in 3 weeks cos of lockdown and I barely miss him. Maybe once every few days I'll think ""a cuddle would be good"". I feel so heartless. The thoughts of breaking up and walking away forever fill me with sadness in not knowing how his life will pan out and guilt. But whenever my dad talks about a family holiday he can take with us late 2021/early 2022 I think to myself  ""pretty good chance we won't be together then"" and feel like a real a-hole. I never had thoughts like that about the future before. For the first time, the thoughts of meeting a new guy without these issues makes me happy and I suddenly want sex and to flirt with other guys and I hate it. Other men were invisible to me until like 2 months ago. 

I feel like the last 2 years have been a lie if I leave or just a waste and that I should suck it up because no relationship is perfect. I hear one of our songs and I feel this pang of guilt for all these doubts or a deep sadness, yearning to fix things and fall back in love. I've had some of the best moments of my life with him and walking away feels wrong. I can nitpick stuff like his weight gain (despite him doubting his attraction to me while I remain a size 0/2), his super unhealthy diet and hatred of most vegetables, his past (probable porn addiction), but it's really rhe mental illness that's got to me. The awful thing is, I worry that even if he did put in the work and make a full recovery, on some level I'd alwsys be bitter about the pain he put me through.

I'm currently working in marketing for a large company, the job is ok, the pay is pretty decent and I am pretty good at it. However, I have this gnawing feeling that this is not what I want to do. I feel like I would enjoy doing something on my own, have my own small business, but I don't really feel as an expert in any field so I'm very hesitant to start. I dipped my toes into freelancing, but I realised that it's even worse than a regular job, since you do a lot of unpaid work trying to win clients and you usually end up doing work for less money.

I graduated in 2019 from a top 25 university in the US with a bachelor's in physics and a decent gpa (\~3.5). I had been working in a lab where I basically did scientific programming and data analysis, but I had determined that I didn't want to pursue a PhD and so when I graduated I decided to take a little bit of time to figure out what I wanted to do. I started a job as a teacher's assistant at a local highschool and did that up until COVID hit while I applied to international teaching opportunities. I ended up applying and being accepted to the JET program, which is an english teaching exchange program in Japan. I studied Japanese in college and really enjoy the culture and language, so I'm intent on going, but now that COVID has hit our departure has been delayed and I've been out of work since April (again due to COVID). I'm supposed to be leaving for Japan about January or February, but I guess I'm worried about what the future holds.

I think my main concerns are:

* My resume now has a 6+ month gap in it because of COVID and I haven't been able to find a good fit for a temporary job before I leave the country in a few months
* I want to return to something scientific or technical as a job after I experience Japan for a year or two but I'm worried that being out of school with no technical job experience for so long might be detrimental

Also my face is all shot up with acne and I'm a little on the heavier side(I am working on it, it just takes time). I know for a fact some of my Indian aunties will say mean sarcastic shit to me and disguise it as ""advice"". Is it advisable for me to make myself sick on purpose during the pandemic? I haven't left home in a month or two and will not however I'm aware that making myself sick would make me more susceptible to the virus. I really don't want to go at any cost I'm willing to make a deal with the devil at this point.

764,"I’m 27F. All my life I did everything I was supposed to: got good grades, never got in trouble, never snuck out of the house. I married my high school boyfriend and we have a great relationship after 12 years. My parents divorced when I was 10. My mom had no other kids and my dad had two older children from a previous marriage. When I was in my early 20s there was a period where I lost my mom and all of my grandparents in under two years and my dad within 3 years. I’ve lost all my close family. My siblings are older than me and have children of their own. Through all of my trauma, I’ve made myself stable and am about to finish my second college degree. I see online that one of my aunts from my dad has this great relationship with one of my siblings and I don’t understand why I don’t have that with her. I went through all of my losses alone including caring for my mom with cancer and no family ever reached out to me. I even invited the same aunt to my wedding and she never responded. Now she hates my dad and he was going to be there but she could have called me and told me why she didn’t come. I recently saw her at my siblings wedding and she basically ignored me and didn’t ask anything about me even though I did ask about how she was doing.

Idk I guess I just don’t understand why in all my life none of my relatives care about me. I don’t think it’s fair for them to project their feelings about my parents onto me. Even my nieces and nephews who I would like to have a relationship with even though we are around the same age never respond to me. I guess my question is how do I let it go that my entire extended family acts like I don’t exist despite never doing anything wrong?",15Oct2020,1

771,"Ok so a bit of backstory, My gf's ex was a jerk(I would use a different word but ion wanna get banned) and I guess he would take every little thing and use it against her and yell at her until she apologised. Ik its messed up but now I guess she got it in her head that anytime she does something wrong, she HAS to apologize. He also was cheating on his main girl with her, which she did not know of. When his main girl dumped him he said it was all her fault and basically got the whole school to call her a sl*t and a wh*re. He also screenshotted a facetime call where she was undressing. She didnt know about it until those screenshots got leaked after they ""broke up"". Ive been told that he would also lie to her about a lot of stuff and would get really mad at her when she lied about something little. 

Anyways, back to the current situation, she has it drilled into her head that she HAS to apologize about little stuff. Like I really dont care if u lost a stack of wood on the minecraft realm. And whenever I'll get heated in pvp she will get like really nervous and think its directed at her. I dont mean to come off like I'm complaining about this I just dont know what to do.

I think I'm making progress by just being hella chill abt everything and i think shes getting better, but I think I just need a outside opinion. 

before we started dating, we were just really close friends and we would yell at each other and it was fine. But like when I asked her out she started to get really emotional and stuff. I'm not a very sympathetic or empathetic person. Like I'm autistic, so like I deal with trauma and pain and stuff by facing it head on and dealing with it. But like I cant tell her to do any of that because I think that will just make thing worse. Please help and like give some advice. Anything helps and I will update with any progress",15Oct2020,1

I am currently 17 years old and live in a period of constant stress and anxiety where the only thing that calms me right now is to lock myself in my room after classes to play with my friends at the computer.

My school classes are being a horror, with long homework and incompetent teachers who sit at their table and listen to music without giving any explanation of how they are done.

Here comes the question, should I throw it all away and look for something to change my life by 180º? or should I finish my studies and follow another 2 years of studies full of anxiety and stress? It’s a question I’ve been asking myself for a year and 2 months, and I don’t have a clear idea of what to do because my parents/mentors, They’re forcing me to spend this time where most people who finished school not long ago are told that it was a very bad time for them and they would never go through it again.

Besides, I’m starting to think that working on anything is much better than continuing to suffer to have a job that’s my goal, even though I don’t know what this is yet.

780,"Hi, I'm 15 years old and I'm about to be 16 in a few months. Here's a little bit about my situation. I will be giving a lot of details and some might be disturbing. It started when I was 10 years old. My sisters (twins) were born a day before my birthday. It was fine at first, but then a year or so later I had a bitter type feeling towards my sisters. My birthday was always their birthday and I was constantly having to give up my day and watch them for hours. It all got worse when they turned 3. I was 13 at the time having to watch them constantly for hours. I got in so much trouble because of them.

They never listened to me. After months of it I broke down and started crying in a closet. I still had to watch them, everywhere I went I was expected to watch them. If they did something wrong I took all of the blame. Then, heres where the stepdad comes into the picture. His job forces him to go back and forth between states. I was happier when he was there because mom didn't make me watch them. Once it was over I noticed that he was coming home later and later. Even as a 13 year old I thought we was cheating (Which turns out years later that I was right). I didn't tell my mom. I sorta just let it sit in the pot. When he was finally home for good, he started to hit my sisters. 3 years old, I'm sure that it started earlier. I can't remember, it got really bad. He would hit them so much. I was always the butt or the thigh (He was smart). You could hear the hits from another room. When ever he was done you could hear them coughing just trying to catch their breath. It happened almost everyday.

It just kept getting worse. I started to cry and hate him. Just being near him made me sick. Still does. He was always very strict with punishments. When I turned 14 we (Me and my older brother)  went to Cali to spend sometime with our family. Once me and my brother were there we told our grandma about what was happening and how we didn't want to go back. Then my mom sent my grandma a video of him taking them one by one into the bath room, hitting him as hard as he could. Moving forward a bunch of things happened and we ended up being forced to go back home. The hitting continued, I was super depressed, I'd skip school, talk to strangers on the internet, and I just kept eating. I gained 40-50 lbs in just a few months. I know this is going everywhere but just stay with me. It's now 2020, he still hits them, I'm still sad, but here's the problem.

He teaches, and his students LIKE him. If they knew what he did at home they wouldn't like him. First we'll talk about my brother, just a recap, my brother didn't want to go to the college that they wanted him to go to, so he told them that he wanted to go somewhere else. He's 17 (late birthday) My stepdad held my brother down, I listened from my room curled in a ball listening to my brother yell for him to get off. He has to stay here until he turns 18, which is soon. Now theres me, I have to stay here for another 2 years. I am constantly in trouble, I am a little disrespectful towards my stepdad (I'm not the best actor) but now I've been grounded for a few weeks now, I have to read a book with 14 chapters and then I have to write 250 words each one. Then we talk about it.

My problems with the talks is that everytime we have one I get something taken away. I was in a ministry class and I was so happy to be in it, talk one I was out. I was a Sunday school teacher, and yes I did earn money every so often but I didn't do it for the money, talk two I was out. I had to sit at the table for an hour because I said ""I don't know."". It goes on and on. I lose something every talk. If you have any questions, you can ask them. Thanks for reading",15Oct2020,1

785,"Hi reddit, 

I'm here to talk about a girl that I don't know really well. The only thing that's clearly apparent to me is that she copies me  **—** almost obsessively. I really didn't think I'd need to ask for advice but it's gotten to the point where it's creepy, unsettling, and most of all makes me upset on a daily basis. I feel like I can't truly express myself without her copying me constantly. 

So, a little backstory: I've known of this girl for about two years or so (?), and we've never been really close friends. We've talked occasionally but that's about it. I originally wasn't aware of how much she was copying me until several of my friends started pointing it out to me. It's been about a year now and it's progressively getting worse. 

Overall I'd say she copies my entire style at this point. I make one small change, and it seems that she instantly notices it and copies it. She copies my outfits, music taste, my personality, and even tries to go for the same people that I've been romantically interested in before, or have dated. 

I've blocked her on all social media, yet she still manages to find things like my spotify, my posts on websites, and profile pictures. And yes, you guessed it, she copies all of those things. Not directly, but it's pretty obvious that she's doing so. And when I say she copies everything even down to the minor details, she really copies *everything*.

I'm not really the confrontational type, so I've never confronted her about it, but I'm highly considering it now. I don't know if I'm overreacting with this, I've done some research about it and a lot of people seem to say that it's because said person ""admires"" you, but it just seems like she's obsessively stalking me and trying to literally become me. 

Any tips on what I should do? I honestly don't know if I'm overreacting but I just feel bothered by it, and it doesn't sit right with me. 

Thanks in advance.&lt;3",15Oct2020,1

787,"I feel lonely lately, and I don't know if it's because I've decided to stop dealing with bullshit or if i'm just becoming a piece of shit.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I lost my best friend of 7 years. I stopped talking to her because she would hang out with my ex often. We are all High school friends in the same group, so I understood there'd be an overlap and would never expect her to drop him because of me - I understand he's a person, not just my ex. But it felt like too much. When she asked me about him, it felt like she was a spy for him. She'd invite him to weekend getaways with her cousins, or he'd visit her during spring break &amp; spend the night. It was too much for me, especially because they seemed to get closer after he broke up with me. 

My guy friend from the same group just views me as childish and petty because of this, and talks shit about me behind my back. Except he will hit me up when he needs mental health issues because I struggle with depression.

My on and off again relationship keeps ending because he will get overwhelmed at college and fall into a depression and tell me he doesn't have the time or mental state to be with me.

My friends at college are negatively impacting me as well. Every time we drink and hang out, there seems to be a scream match. Luckily I'm usually not present for them, but then I have to hear them vent about each other. Everybody just talks shit in the group and I find myself doing the same because I'm in the group, and I don't want to. I moved home because I felt overwhelmed, and have been doing fun things with my two best friends from home. One of my college friends texted me saying ""why do you do cute things with them, but you never know what to do when we are at school?"" I've invited this friend group to multiple home activities, but they even caused drama at a party I attended at home, and the same first friend I mentioned blamed me for it basically because they were my guests.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I attract this. It's hurting me. I don't know if this is my fault but it is starting to feel like it is. It seems like my friend group from home is better off without me, or got closer once me and my ex broke up. It feels like I am a stressor in my on &amp; off again boyfriends life, even though I never ask for anything other than time &amp; attention. It seems like everywhere I go, I'm better off not being there. 

Then at home, my parents are in a loveless marriage. My mom takes my room when I'm gone, but when I'm home it forces my father to sleep on the couch.

So I'm majoring in (18f) Finance, I either want to do something in law, business, or government. I love to debate and read about politics and my family thinks I should go into law. According to everyone I talk to they're all soul crushing. I want to go into OCS for the navy after college but after that I'm terrified about my future. Breaking into any job market seems bleak. 

I'm trying to get an internship at either my dad's old company that deals with maritime shipping, probably in the office or my grandfather said he'd see if one of his lawyer friends would look over my resume. 

I am concerned about not making enough money. Maybe its naive of me but I'd like a nice house in the woods like where I grew up. I also have triplet sisters with a host of medical problems and I don't want them to have to live in crappy apartments working minimum wage. I want to be able to take care of my parents and give them whatever they want. I also am concerned that any career will have me alienate my family and my values/morals.

I really don't know what else I'd do with my life other than something in maritime. My dad is a tugboat captain and makes decent money

We don't know each other have only passed by few times - I thought she was really cute but I'm sure she hasn't paid attention to me at all; she must be early 20's at most. I want to meet her, but it feels weird because to walk to somebody and introduce myself because I have never done that. And there doesn't seem to be any other way to meet her - I don't know what year she is, what specialty, what circle of people she has, anything. And even if I do go to her and introduce myself, then what? Was she the one I saw wearing a band shirt which could start a conversation or was the person I only saw from behind just someone with similar build and hair? And even if she was I could only say that I don't find said band great. I just don't know what to say to a stranger.

I have tried to meet a girl once before, but to say I ""introduced"" myself is an exaggeration. No, I didn't know what to do after I say ""hi"", but I decided to not overthink it and looked like an absolute creep. I saw how uncomfortable she was and just left her. I apologized two days later and never talked to her again out of shame and honestly would she want to talk to me after a first impression like that? Not only that, but it took me almost two years to get over it with how hard it made me realize my ineptness.

There is also the thing that I am probably friendless - and I know that instantly makes it harder for other people to like me. Never been close with any of my peers ever, including my roommates and neighbors at the dorm and my student mates and I don't feel any kind of, how should I call it, relatability, compatibility, mutuality?. I only have two people to chat with online - I know them in real life, but the point is that I don't think I can call them friends even though we've known each other for years. Of course, they'd say we're friends, but I would never share anything personal with them. Not even to my family I feel connection and never have. I WISH I had just one person to whom I won't be afraid to open up, but there very well might be nobody out there.

I don't have any problem talking to people if it's about work, but outside of that I have to force every single word I say. Someone may start a conversation with me, ask ""Did you hear of...?"", I say yes and then silence or if they ask me about myself I am ashamed to share anything, because honestly there's nothing to share about my dull life. There were other people I wanted to meet, but this same shame of how boring I am as a person stops me. And here comes that girl from university again, I think it will be just very draining for me and that I will feel worse afterwards...

(I have been diagnosed with depression and I have low self-esteem. I have visited 8 different therapists over 3 years but always kept things just to me and sometimes outright lied; even if I start being more open and honest, I can't afford therapy at this time.)",15Oct2020,1

799,"So yeah,

A girl I met and I recently, and unexpectedly felt affection for each other. On the second night of hanging out, she and I had sex. To be fair, hooking up didn’t seem to be the intention, it seemed to be “serious”.

She said to me before that she isn’t the type of girl to never hookup only 1 time. Not even two days later, I hear that things are complicated with her ex again. She says she still likes me, but doesn’t know if she has feelings for him still. As of now, my last text has been left on “read”. :)

So, I am a fairly attractive dude and I didn’t feel that anything was going wrong, so this definitely felt like a punch to the gut. Is it that she used me? Is it that I wasn’t good enough? She told me everything was good, including sex... but now I am a bit of an insecure mess.

I tend to pride myself for “choosing right”, but maybe I am naive. 

So the question is, especially for girls who can relate... Why would she do this to me out of the blue?? It’s confusing that she was honest, said she likes me, but now i’m semi ghosted.. Should I take this as a confidence hit? Be honest with me, please.",15Oct2020,1

801,"Alright so

I'm 19yo university student (first year). I find the amount of work too much and all of I t too stressful to handle, I've been depressed and anxious for most if not all of my teenage years and I feel like it's coming back even though u had some better month this year.
I find it difficult to care about things especially mundane tasks and it's possible that I'm also terrible at recognising what I care about. But I feel like I desperately need something that can make me get up in the morning, something that can make me completely my assignments and do what I'm supposed to do.
I just don't have anything like that. 
Something that makes my heart race. 
I used to care about a woman but she's gone now..

I guess I care about angry particles (don't ask) 

I do care about protests, I care about people who are being hurt and are fighting for their own freedom or equality. But there's not much I can do about that. I haven't exactly been gifted with a body capable of protecting people.

I think having a single person who depends on me would be enough to keep me going, but those attempts haven't turned out so well in the past and forming new bonds especially for me is.. difficult to say the least. 


I feel tired, overwhelmed by school and generally apathetic. Last week I was so stressed about all the assignments I had, and doing well. I think something broke in me because now it's enough to just pass and if I don't.. Well I couldn't give less fucks about it. 
I'm studying to become a Mechatronics engineer I'd say it's not the most useless career out there. But I just can't fucking take the shit loads of work and having to do it all alone. 
I'm fucking sick of having to do everything on my own. 

Since about 4th grade I always assumed the position of the lone wolf. That's all I know, noone ever saw me for who I was. (except her but what did she do with that opportunity? Hurt me- and she's gone anyway SO-).  My solitude though may seem voluntary is not something I'd ever ask for. It's needless to say having a conversation about once a month doesn't suffice. 


Does anyone have a plan? What should I do about any of this?
My loneliness, lack of drive/purpose, fucking SCHOOL. 

I always hated school. I don't hate learning itself, that's fun to do, but boy do I hate deadlines, I hate not being able to choose my own pace, I hate not being able to learn what I want free. I hate having to do it all alone. I'm tired. Life is such a nuisance.

I have a horrible relationship with my mother (severely abusive in the past) and there’s no way I’m going back there over winter break. However, my school states that the only reasons I could stay on campus over break would be due to international COVID travel restrictions, or due to a “precarious living situation”.

804,"We (F 23 &amp; F 25) dated for a month, known each other for 2 months. 
The relationship is great, the best I have ever experienced. She loves it too. 

She broke up with me 2 weeks ago because she felt emotionally tired, and feels that I'm using her as an emotional punching bag, which.. is not true, I miss communicated my feelings, and not being fourth coming thinking that it would be better but its not. But the fault is all mine, I created the source of the miss communication. I should have been more forthcoming about how I feel, I just didn't do it because I was too insecure and careful. Should have just been myself. 

We broke up face to face, I cried my eyes out, she didnt. We hugged and parted ways. I swear, I never loved a back that much. 

Then after that we never talked to each other since. But all line of contact is still open. No blocking, nothing. 

I asked her friend and she said I should give her time, which I am. I am also still messy, and pathetic. I'm giving myself time. I try to just move on with it, and accept that it's over but damn, everytime I wake up in the morning for the past 2 weeks, after aaaaaaaalllll the talks I had with my friends, mom, and everyone, everybody says no, dont try, not even in a year.. I still feel, believe, and have faith that it can work. 

I'm just scared that if I say hi again, I will just make things worst. It's perfect right now, story wise. But.. yea, to me the break up doesnt feel like a break up.

809,"I’m sure some of you are familiar with the idea of “gifted child syndrome” which is what I (23F) grew up with. I excelled in every subject in school, learned instruments, had hobbies, overall just a good, smart kid. Once I hit college, it hit me like a ton of bricks. Suddenly I realized I wasn’t as smart as I thought I was because I was only relatively smart to the other students in the underfunded NYC schools I attended. I  went into a private university as  an “undecided” major expecting to land on biology in order to follow what my path was that was expected by my family. I was raised to believe that if you’re not a doctor, you’re nothing. It wasn’t until I was about 20 that I started learning that isn’t a good way to think. I didn’t do well in college (2.5 ish GPA) because I struggled with finding a purpose for it all. Internally I knew I didn’t want to be in the medical field but that’s what was expected of me. Ironically my mother is the only one to have entered the medical field (she was an immigrant teen mom and had me at 18, she just graduated dental school last year) but even though the path towards it wasn’t ideal, my family puts my mother on a pedestal. She has over half a million dollars in student debt, had to apply to dental school 3 times to even get in, failed her first year and was allowed to repeat it. Why would I want that kind of path for myself? Even now, that she’s making decent money but she’ll be paying off that debt for her entire life.
I was undecided in school for 2 1/2 years but withdrew bc I was starting to get into debt for an education I didn’t see going anywhere. Worked a few jobs here and there so support myself (financially independent from my family). I went back to school for one semester for hotel management but changed my mind and decided not to continue. I was actually doing pretty well (3.9 gpa) but I wasn’t happy. I Was just on the phone with my grandma and she just continues on and on about how I should become a dentist like my mother but she doesn’t understand what it takes to get there and I don’t want to be in school for another 6-8years (2-4 years doing all the prereqs and stuff and 4 years actually in dental school). She also doesn’t understand that it isn’t free or cheap or easy. 
I just don’t know what I want to do with my life, I want to live a simple life, I’m okay earning 50-75k per year which I can make happen with the education I have now or finishing a basic bachelor’s degree. I don’t want to be medically responsible for people. At this point in my life I am actually considering getting into the fitness industry because it’s one of the only passions I’ve had over the last few years but I know nobody in my family would take me seriously. 
It’s just so hard that I am not living up to anyone’s expectations or even the expectations I had for myself growing up. 
I’ve been unemployed since March but I’m feeling a little safer to start looking for a job again but whatever I choose to do, I know it will be followed immediately with “but you’re going back to school right?”

Hello. I'm doing horribly. Lol. So long story short, I have been stuck in an on again off again relationship. Here's backstory. It's long so if you read it all and reply it means a lot.

Me and my first love broke up August 2018. I went on my first date again March 2019, but didnt think i was ready. I also found out he went through a similar breakup May 2018 and he hadn't met someone he liked until me. We didn't go out again until May 2019. All of a sudden it's fantastic. We had a great summer together. He said his friends commented on him being happier, he'd say he used to write sad songs but thanks to me he can't because he's happy. We are exclusive, not official. He was going through family issues and wanted to wait till he was okay to make it official.

He makes if official in September. We're away at school, only 2 hours way, but it's still good. Then November comes and I tell him he seems like he barely tries to see me or put an effort in. He's freaking out about school and says this is too much. I say it's too little. We break up.

Winter break comes &amp; we communicate again. School starts up again and I tell him it feels like similar patterns are repeating - he gets mad and says its always the same shit. he needs to focus on school. I believe him, but now we are barely talking anymore. Weeks would go by. I do stalking and find a picture of him &amp; a girl. I tell him to fuck off and we are done.

May he reaches out. I say fuck off basically. July he asks to talk to me. He says he's sorry. He thought we both ended things in March, and nothing happened with the girl. He says he even stopped communicating with her once he realized I thought we were still exclusive. He says he's been missing me and feeling depressed. He says he realized I wasn't asking for too much, and I was only asking for the bare minimum.

We start up again and it's great. He planned a great beach date, and I am really excited because he changed. School starts again. He gets distant. We get into a huge fight and meet up to talk about it. I tell him I've just been going through a lot (losing friends) and just wanted him to make a little time for me to listen. He says he's failing a lot of his classes and has been depressed and that is why he is distant. We have regular conversation until he says his mind is in a bad place and he cannot give 100% and he can't string me along when he doesn't know when he will be okay again.

I said ""this is what you always say to me. i believed you in March when you said this."" He says it's different and he wishes I would try to understand. I don't cry this time i just say okay and ask him to take me home.

I blocked him on everything. But I feel sad as fuck. I tried soooo hard with him. I always gave him the benefit of the doubt. I struggle mentally, so i always tried to understand when he'd be distant because I know mental illnesses affect everyone differently. I just feel stupid, used, but also crazy for getting upset with him for not putting in effort to see me. I feel like maybe I just get upset over small shit and am clingy. I feel like he will reach out again &amp; I will cave, but I also feel like he never will. I'm not sure which scares me more.

I want to get out of this funk. I know I need someone who is better for me - can communicate better, encourages me to be better, makes a continuous effort, but i always find myself back to him. Always. I don't want to. I can't get out of this.",15Oct2020,1
813,"Hi all. I’ve been dealing with an internal conflict for quite some time now and would like some third party insights.

I’m 23 and have a stable job that pays well. I’m not very excited about the industry or the field I’m in, but the work can be interesting and I don’t mind it. However, I hate my boss and the city that I work in and have been trying to find a new job in a different city with no luck. 

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over 2 years now and he is wonderful. We’ve talked about marriage and moving in together. I love him dearly and know he would be a good husband, but part of me is scared of settling down so soon and with my first serious boyfriend.

I have a lot of pressure from my family to be financially successful and have children, so that also comes into play. 

On the other hand, I constantly daydream about bouncing from city to city, working as a waitress or bartender or teaching English abroad. I have some anxiety about meeting new people and being outgoing, but I have always wanted to travel, live in new places, and just make the most out of my life.

I do want a family and stability some day, but I’m only 23 now and want to live out my life while I’m young. But I’m scared that if I were to take the leap and quit my job to travel the world now, I wouldn’t be able to find another good paying, stable job.

I feel like all of my wants are so conflicting. I want financial stability and someone who loves me, but I also want to travel and live like a nomad.

814,"Backstory:

I have wanted to be a medical examiner since I was in elementary school. And my mom who works in the medical field (not as a medical examiner) has told me I should go for it, since t &amp; gore has never phased me. And since I’ve never had any problems with things of that nature.

My thoughts on this:
I feel like I could do it, and that I’d enjoy my career path. However I do think it may take a toll on me, for example how does one handle seeing dead children or even unexpectedly finding a person you love(d) on the table? I also have really bad anxiety with people. So I thought that I’d mostly be working with the dead and the occasional person from time to time. And since I would be working with the dead I wouldn’t have the stress of accidentally killing my patient, I hope this all makes sense.

Questions:
1) What kind of schooling does this entail?
2) How does schooling for a medical examiner differ from a doctor?
3) How did you know that this was the career for you?
4) What are the pro’s &amp; con’s?
5) What does a typical work day look like? 
6) What are some things you do to help with the things you see &amp; do from day to day?

817,"I'm an aspiring freelance artist (I say ""aspiring"" because I've only had 2 real clients), and I work a full-time job that pays hourly. Because I'm working full time, I can only dedicate 3-4 hours/day maximum to my art - obviously more on the weekends, but I do still need days off to relax. I'm getting things set up so that I can eventually be a full-time freelancer, but the transitioning process is making me anxious.

I'm already planning on quitting my existing job due to other reasons, and I've let management know that I'm job hunting, but I haven't put in my 2 weeks notice yet. It's been a few years since I've looked for jobs, and I'm definitely not used to looking for real life adult jobs (I'm in my early 20s), so I'm already stressed about job searching as it is. I'm also struggling to find something that is in the pay range I need - minimum wage is still $7.25 where I am, but I need to make AT LEAST $12/hr to stay afloat with rent/bills/food/etc.

Since I'm wanting to transition to a full-time freelancer, should I try looking for a part-time job for stable income so that I can dedicate more time for art commissions? Or should I wait until I have a more stable client base and look for more full-time work?

823,Hey everyone I am a (28)m and as described in the title I'm really just looking for advice on how to get back into the college scene specifically online after dropping out of community college 9 years ago at age 19.  The past 9 years I have worked in retail management and now feel mature enough and have enough money to pursue a degree.  I would like to go into something along the lines of Computer Science or IT if I cant find a CS program that works.  I am technologically inclined but have little experience.  Looking at programs is very intimidating and I'm not sure where to start.  I have looked at programs like full sail but it seems expensive for a degree that isnt full acreditted. Some of the more accredited online colleges I would assume I wouldnt get into because of my past. When I was 19 I did accrue some credits but I also was put on acedemic probation and had a very low GPA.  Any advice is welcome as I'm trying become as informed as possible.  I feel like my searches are dominated by larger for profit online schools and maybe a cheaper option closer to an online community college would be the best option.

824,"This was posted on r/AmITheAsshole but got taken down because it went against the rules? I'm not 100% sure why but I'll respect it. One comment mentioned putting it on here, so I am.

I (20f) have been online friends with my friend Jessica (24f) for 8 years. Jessica lives in the US and I live in AUS and live very different lives. I grew up a single child into a middle class home, and she was born into a family with siblings and lived above the poverty line.

 When I first met Jessica, she had big dreams of going to university and becoming a teacher,  a break from the rest of her family who all had babies very young and either had low paying jobs or none. We met in person when I was 16 when I went over to see her, she was in university and struggling, and I was the only person who was supporting her and telling her she can do it. Her mother would just tell her to drop out, and eventually, she did. 
I always noticed how her mother would manipulate her in different ways, like talking about how her very healthy grandmother might die when my mother invited Jessica to Australia, all expenses paid and a job for 6 months, which Jessica declined because of that fear. Since then, I've seen more and more and continued to bite my tongue. She gave up her dream, got a job at the same, low wage job her father worked, and allowed her mother to rent houses in her name, which has destoryed her credit. Her mother doesn't work, nor does the aunt that lives there, or her sister who has a baby or sister's Bf, they've only known each other 1 month . She the pays rent, and has given her parents $3k in 'loans'. She's been telling me she wants to move out with her GF for 2 years now, but her parents have taken all her money so she has no savings, and won't teach her to drive. I see all these things and I hate her family, but is it really my business to talk about what her family is doing to her? She complains to me how they treat her like garbage, call her name's and have her do housecleaning that take up hours because they refuse to clean up after themselves. For years I just went ""That sucks, I'm sorry"" or say ""Come live with me"" which she would decline because she always would fear someone dying while she was away. It came to a head when she called me today complaining that her sister is pregnant again, and the BF is leaving dishes and crap everywhere and when she mentioned this, the whole family chewed her out. I finally just told her all the ways her family treats her is wrong, and she needs to get out of there because they don't care about her only her use as a slave. It was probably harsh, but it's just so upsetting to see her go through this and to be blind to it. She got angry and yelled I don't understand what it's like and hung up and won't answer my messages. I don't know what it's like living in poverty, no, I am a very lucky person with my life. But she even stopped singing, which was the first thing we became friends over. I just hate to see everything about who she is wither away.

AITA for telling her that she needs to leave her toxic family?  Should I have just stayed out of it? I love her dearly, I want her safe. Is there anyway to help her?",15Oct2020,1

Hi. I’m a junior in high school so I don’t really know how to handle this. Yesterday my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I don’t know how severe it is but I don’t know what to do.

829,"My previous post was poorly written without the details I forgot to tell, so sorry about that.

So I have a friend, and I want to recommend one of the best games I've ever played to him. The only problem is the situation we're currently in.

If I were to recommend it to him, he would immediately refuse. He says it's because he hates it. But I find that weird because he hasn't even seen anything about this game. No footage, no story summary, not even how it works. This annoys me because he's basically saying that he judges a book without even looking at the cover or any part of the book.

Another thing that irritates me is that he says that the reason he doesn't even bother trying is because I play it. It's so irritating because I feel horrible, and I feel that he just threw this huge possible potential for him away for a stupid reason like that. I wanna talk about this game with him. I'm not 100% sure whether he likes the game or not, but at this rate I'll never know

What do I do with this. Every time I try to talk about this game he keeps stating the same reasons, making me feel sadder and sadder by every day. I've asked whether he, hypothetically, could be serious for about 20 minutes, and he said yes. Idk if this is useful information or not but I kept it just in case.

Edit: I also realised that he doesn't really has interest in my hobbies at all. Usually he isn't interested what I have to say and often just changes the subject

If you're curious, the game is Danganronpa.

I might've forgotten some other details, so it's possible that you'll see a bunch of edit histories.

831,"Let me explain myself.

Quarantine was hell for me. It was truly hell and there’s no other way I can explain it. It turned me into an old soul and made me question everything. It made me a better person because of it but because of that, I now regret everything.

There are people who I have unintentionally hurt or manipulated before I changed. I didn’t mean to, I wasn’t actively thinking “I’m going to manipulate them”. But I know I would say certain things to get their attention. At best I was emotionally draining to them because I was constantly a mess. At worst I was a manipulative asshole. I fear that I may have unknowingly been manipulative. I wasn’t thinking “oh, let me manipulate someone” 

I have been unfaithful a few times in my life, which is selfish to the people I know. I don’t even think I truly understand the pain I have caused.

I fear I’m a fucking monster. How can I only be 20 and yet somehow still have made so many fucking mistakes and hurt so many people that I’ve become a fucking monster?

I feel I need consequences. I think I’m going to confess to something I didn’t do so I can just get thrown in jail and face some sort of consequences for the people I’ve hurt. At least then I’m a man and I’m owning up to my actions. I mean what else could I possibly do??",15Oct2020,1
832,"About two months ago I moved back into my college dorm, and this year I decided to live in my sorority house. My roommate is a girl I had really only talked to a few times, but those times we talked were pretty chill and we got along fine. And we still do get along when we talk, but those times are rare.

A little info on us to set the vibe- I wouldn't say very \~girly girl\~ but I definitely do appreciate good fashion, makeup, and self-care. I'm just kind of a glamourous person, but very chill and go with the flow.

She on the other hand is kind of the opposite of me. Wears t-shirts all day every day, ex-high school athlete, not very refined tastes.

But ever since we've moved in, I knew she was a bit odd. She doesn't step on the bare tile floor of our room without shoes on, brushes her hair for at least 2 minutes at least once a day (yes... I timed it), and very frequently and loudly watches Netflix and laughs out loud to whatever she's watching. There are a few more things she does that are just kind of bizarre, but these are the key things that I CANNOT stand.

Obviously, she is just living her life in a way that doesn't, and shouldn't, affect me, however, the accumulation of these things has made me completely miserable the past few weeks. I listen to music whenever she's in the room because I know she won't say anything to me, without me prompting it, so I won't be in complete silence with her.

I cannot comprehend why I get so frustrated with her just existing, but every night when I try to go to bed I have to wear earplugs so I won't hear her breath or move in her bed.

So honestly I cannot tell if she is the bad roommate or I am. She has done nothing wrong by any means but I just get so frustrated every. single. day.

I really do just need some advice on figuring out myself or how to go about this situation.",15Oct2020,1

The job I applied for called me today and wanted to follow up too an email they sent me and was probing to see why I had not replied back. I wasn't expecting it and told them ""I wanted too wait first before I decide on responding"" and I don't know if that left a good impression or a bad impression?

No need to give details as to how old we are, as like stated we are both teens under 18. So me and my girlfriend of a few months now are both panicking, as we have done quite a bit of sexual things in the past 2 months, I’d say around 6 or so times. None of these times have been full intercourse, genital contact, but the closest to full intercourse it has been was attempting to put it in twice but not actually going in, once was with a condom. Today we believe her period has started, but are kind of worried since I was talking about implantation bleeding. Earlier today the color started off brown, but changed to red, and she’s at work now freaking out about it, and saying she thinks it’s getting pink like, which apparently could be another color of concern. We’re waiting for the next couple days to hopefully not have to worry about it, but we’re both freaking out about it right now. I have pissed a couple times before each time we have done anything, and from what I hear that should get most of the left over sperm out, but I’m still very worried.

Now tonight she decided to force me to listen to her on call read out a suicide note from about 2-3 years ago which was when i was at my absolute lowest point in life , i told her to stop and she literally blackmailed me by saying “ ill post it on instagram for everyone to see if you dont listen to it “ , this brought back some really bad memories which i have tried really hard to suppress to stop me getting in that mental state again so i just ended the call and told her we are over and blocked her on everything, we are both 20 years old and in university.

I dont wanna paint her in bad light because she is actually a very generous lovely person who does alot for me and means alot to me but recently i.e the last month she has just been annoying and irritating and not acting rationally at all.

she has no issues going on just she keeps on bring up different male friends she has and all this in a way to make me jealous i think.

845,"Okay, long story. By the way, I'm on mobile, sorry for formatting errors or whatever. First time poster as well.

So, about a year ago I (14) moved from Iowa to Alabama. My older brother (23?) still lives in Iowa, and I want to move in with him. He said he would love to have me, but the problem is that he works for a tow trucking company and sometimes has to leave during the night, and since I'm only 14, I can't stay at his house alone by myself or else he could get into legal trouble. 

His insurance also won't let him take me with him. He has a girlfriend who stays with him a lot but she has a job that has urgent and demanding nightshifts as well. 

I've talked to it to my mom, but she doesn't really want me to go in the first place, so she's not telling me any ideas. She thinks that I'm running from my problems by trying to leave this state.

I don't see it that way. I see it as me trying to do that I think will make me happy. I understand that for as long as I'm under her roof that she has the upperhand in situations like this, but I really want to go back to Iowa. 

My mental health has declined so rapidly since moving here, but I guessed it's always been pretty bad. Plus, I feel like Iowa has more opportunity for me rather than living in the middle of the woods in Alabama.

So I was apologizing to one of my favorite professors for fucking up in her class last semester. It wasn’t about the grade, I actually got an A- (which I honestly didn’t deserve and I think she did it out of pity) but because I turned in everything late and my papers weren’t nearly as good as they usually are/should have been.

I was embarrassed and disappointed in myself because I was so excited for this class and passionate about the subject but I had some personal problems/mental health issues/procrastination and I really blew it. You have to understand that, as immature as this probably sounds, I really really look up to this particular professor as a mentor and scholar. I’ve read her research and discussed it with her. She’s given me lots of book and movie recommendations. We’ve talked outside of class about art and philosophy and mental illness and life in general. I try not to burden her too much, and to give her space, because I know she’s not my friend, or parent, but she’s been so encouraging and motivating to me, and shown me a lot of kindness and sympathy when my depression, OCD, and PTSD stated to become more and more obvious (I was eventually hospitalized in the middle of the semester once).

Anyway, I told her how much I genuinely enjoyed the class and learned from it, despite my poor performance, and admitted that I was disappointed in myself and wished I could do it over again. She told me I needed to “take life less seriously” and that I perhaps cared “a little too much” about her class for my own good. She was very sympathetic (as always), but it made me realize how I come across and how I need to change that.

I know she’s right. I'm overly earnest and hypersensitive. I really want to stop being so self-absorbed and taking everything so seriously and just relax, but I do really care about the impression I’ve made, not on everyone, but on her and my other mentors. I need to just stop caring so much.

I just don’t enjoy the gym anymore. It pains me to realise how different I am now compared to before. Before I used to always look forward to going to the gym, progressing on my programmes and hitting PRs. I’d spend 2-3 hours in the gym including talking to gym friends. The long journey to and from the gym didn’t bother me. Always loved updating my training logs. Having to carry my bulky lifting belt, lunch, school work and towel/shower stuff even! Didn’t bother me. I genuinely enjoyed going to the gym. When gyms had closed due to covid I brought the elitefts bands, and spent a lot of time tracking Rogue restock for weights. Just trying to show how much I used to like lifting and gym. And btw now I live close to my gym so getting there is easy and I don’t need to always carry everything. So I can’t really blame inconveniences for me not enjoying the gym because there aren’t any! 

I’ve been going to the gym since I was 16, I am now 22. I’ve had some annoying health obstacles which mean my journey hasn’t been as good as it should be progress wise. It’s easy for me to hate on myself and hate how I look. But I’m getting better at giving myself credit, and appreciating that EVERYONE has obstacles along the way.

I just don’t enjoy the gym anymore. And it’s been like this for a few months now. Today was bad I left after only getting through 25% of my workout, I just felt down/miserable. But I feel like I have to keep trying to enjoy it again. Because

1.) I hate how I look. It’s taken me much longer to get to where I want to get. I’ve done many cutting cycles. I’ve had only 1 successful bulk gains wise. I’m like 18% bf so I’m cutting again. But yeah I need to be lifting weights otherwise my cut will be a disaster if I lose muscle. 5’8 70kg, and my goal atm is to get down to 65kg. Like I said I honestly don’t like how I look, o appreciate I’m way better than last year and the year before. But for example I have no idea how anyone could ever find me appealing based on how I look. 

2.) Quitting now at 22 y.o will be a big mistake. People wish they started at this age. 

3.) I hate how I look. I haven’t found another hobby that can fill the void aswell. Especially with events being cancelled due to covid. 

The only thing in my life atm that helps me feel good about myself is my studies tbh. No girlfriend and hell me meeting someone I can actually click with seems very unlikely.

856,"Hi reddit,

I need some advice.

I'm currently a community college freshman, and I got dropped from my intro to business class a couple days ago (I'm only 3.5 weeks into my first quarter). Remote learning has been really awful, and it almost caused me to not graduate from high school due to my constantly diminishing motivation (also ADHD takes a pretty big toll on the self-responsibility factor). Despite that experience, I still haven't adjusted to it nearly 3 months later, which has naturally resulted in poor college performance. I just need to tell my parents. Like a lot of students out there, I'm on my parents' payroll for college but there are a couple things to consider: 1.) Money is not a concern of theirs, 2.) My community college tuition is mostly free, and 3.) My mom talked to me 2 weeks ago about how they supposedly won't be on my ass about college like they were in high school, since they say I'm an adult now and it's my own life. My dad, on the other hand, might have a negative reaction because he's always been tight about school. 70% of conversations I had with him for the past 18 yrs were about grades and school. He also asks about how college is going pretty frequently, so I feel like I need to say something about my academic predicament. 

How do I go about this?

860,"Well I am debating on whether I should reach out to this person. I had a fallout with this girl let’s call her “k” last year, last time we spoke it ended in argument between us and I just added her off of Facebook so I could move on but almost a year later I can’t move on from this friendship. It all started when she ghosted me back in September and I didn’t even know why. It wasn’t until I got closure. We are 4 years apart in age 

She ghosted me because she was tired of me talking about my relationship problems And felt like I was using her for emotional support And felt like I was using her for emotional support People tell me to move on and I try.

I fed bad for what happened I wish I had been more self aware and I genuinely wish I could have been a better friend.

I’ve thought about writing an apology to her I genuinely do feel bad for how things ended",15Oct2020,1
861,"So I'm in high school, I've had pretty much the same friend group for 4 or so years now. People have come and gone, I have surface level friendships with most people at my school, but this group has remained. We're a close group, these are the people I feel I could ask for help ya know? Everyone has their flaws and so too does everyone have their limits. For a while I've found some of my friends to do more and more things that I just can't tolerate. Many of them are very dramatic so I tend to hold in a lot. But anyway, I'm in grade 11 and I just don't think it's worth it to go through all the hassle of finding more friends, I'm at the point I'm counting months not years and we're all going our seperate ways after high school and I just don't know what to do.

862,"Applying to a couple of community colleges for possibly going back for an A.S. degree in Health Information Technology. Schools are asking for transcripts from some other schools I attended in the past with the earliest one being from five years ago.

I can't imagine any of the past schools have anything to show in a transcript other than that I went to them before since it's not only been so long but also because I barely went to any of them. I stopped going half-way through the first set of classes at the last school I went to because our first-time teacher quit on us and I didn't want to wait for a workaround. Before that was around 2009 where I went for a couple of classes and believe I finished them but they were for something that had nothing to do with what I'm looking into now.

Is there a way to not have to track down my old schools and pay for transcripts just to show nothing for it in the end? Is there something else they get from these I'm not aware of? Or is it just the way the system is and I have to get this shit done regardless?

867,"This has been eating me alive and I need someone else’s perspective, I’ve never spoken to anyone about this and I’m not sure I ever will. From as young as I can remember I would spend a lot of time at my grandmothers house and everytime I was there she would force me to watch her take a bath, force me to watch her “wash herself” (looking back im sure she was masturbating) she made me get in the bath with her until I was probably about 12, I remember one time her making me wash her privates for her. She used to watch me bath even when I would ask her not to, she refused to respect my privacy. I would tell her I didn’t want to watch her bath and she would tell me that if I didn’t do what I was told she would tell my parents that I was naughty and I’d get in trouble. She would always say things like “this is our little secret”. She would and still does make a lot of sexual comments that make me extremely uncomfortable. She would give me gifts and money and take me on holidays as bribes for watching her as I got older. It worked for so long I used to absolutely adore her, This only stopped when I was about 16 when I realised this wasn’t normal behaviour and I stopped going over there. I can remember being about 6-7 and finally having the courage to tell my mum that she makes me watch her bath and I don’t like it and my mum snapped at me and said well don’t go back there then!! My mum definitely knew something was going on and turned a blind eye to it. That was the last time I’ve ever spoken about it. I struggle to know if this was classed as abuse? All I know is that it makes me sick to think about and it made me extremely uncomfortable it still does. 
Here’s where it gets tricky I’m 26 now and I’m expecting my first baby, a girl. it has bought up so much childhood trauma for me, my grandmother is still in my life, I obviously try to limit contact with her but I haven’t been able to cut her out of my life without telling people around me why, my mother my partner, my family. I’m just not ready to talk about it and I’m not sure I ever will. My grandmother keeps talking about watching the baby and I keep thinking about what she did to me. I won’t let what happened to me happen to my baby but I don’t know how to go about it without having to talk about my past. I’m really struggling with this. Please give me some advice, tips, anything. I will die before I let anything like that happen to my baby girl 

I almost feel stupid for thinking like this because there are so many people out there that were subjected to terrible childhood abuse. This is just really affecting me and eating away at me, I almost feel like there’s more that went on that my subconscious is blocking out I just can’t shake the feeling.",15Oct2020,1

872,"Tldr: Will I be making a mistake by spending more money in a different living situation to have better piece of mind/mental health? 

I will preface this by saying that stressing over being financially secure has been a huge and ever present  weight over my family, and no doubt it very much affects my decision making.

Due to the world health situation, I am living with my mom again while I am at university. For the first few months I basically ignored her because I was so busy with classes, but lately my interactions with her and the general environment have really been affecting my mental health. To sum it up, I feel like I need more physical space to do all my virtual things (which is not an option if I stay), and there are a myriad of boundary breaking issues that I am tired of having to repeatedly enforce. I am constantly on edge at home and have had panic attacks over how unhappy I am. 

I have stayed with her this long because, economically, it makes sense to pay less rent and have less debt, because rent is so expensive where I am, and because there are some genuinely good and supportive times. 

However, I've just been offered a decent place that is within my preferred price range, and I know it would be best to move out, but I keep... second guessing myself because I should always do the most economically responsible thing, right? And paying extra money to pay for someone else's mortgage seems like not a good financial decision. To be clear, this will put some financial stress on me, but I do have an emergency savings fund in case everything crumbles. 

I do know that my mental health right now is suffering, which is affecting my physical health and productivity. In addition to also worrying about finances, I also do worry about my mom being alone during the pandemic, but I suppose that is more of a me problem. Perhape people will also read this as being afraid to take a risk, and I suppose that may be accurate - though I find I am most confused when I am at home and things are good for however brief the time is. 

I am expecting some backlash when I move out re: finances/loneliness. I guess I am asking for some encouragement or advice on how I can frame this so that my last 2 weeks at home will not be hell. Or asking if anyone has any other advice or stories or wisdom to share on feeling bad about wanting to spend more on myself/my living situation - my mind keeps running in circles over mental health vs. finances.

875,"Hey everyone,

So around December 2019 I stopped talking to someone because they kept using me for money. Like i have my parents to support on top of my own bills and student loans and what not, but I still helped out when I could. But it was more than I can bear. It took every ounce in me but I cut them off. 2 months ago, I decided, “hey you should go reconnect with them, they probably changed their ways.” And I texted them and we started talking again...but the thing is, they started asking me for money again. Asked me 60 times this past 2 months. Good thing is that I stood up for myself and told them no every  time. But every time I say no, they give me the silent treatment for a day and ask me again a couple times the next day. 

Like before Corona they refused to get a job. She has family, and a boyfriend she can turn too so why is she reaching out to be every other day for money?

My question is, how do I cut them off for good? Do I block their number and social media? I guess I’m just tired of someone having their hands out when they’re not even taking the initiative to apply for work. I’m just tired. I thought they changed but they didn’t.",15Oct2020,1

879,"A girl recently reached out to me but before I was able to read the message, my partner deleted it. He then confessed to me that he had flirted with this girl - I won't go in to too much detail but it was a lapse in judgement and he did it for what he believed to be a good reason. I know this man is not unfaithful, I fully trust and believe and understand his reasons, but what I'm struggling to deal with is the fact that he had hidden it from me.

I empathise with how he must have felt to have kept it in secret, and I know if I were in his place, it'd be so hard to be truthful. But I'm conflicted, because if this girl never contacted me, it's very possible that I would never have known or suspected he'd done something. This may seem so naive, but I truly thought we had a transparent and trusting relationship. 

I can't sit with the fact that he was able to spend time with me, fight with me, and make love to me (sorry, cringe I know) knowing he'd done something that would hurt me to my core. I always took him as the type of person who would never lie to me about something like this, or who would be truthful because I deserve the truth, so I feel so betrayed.

tldr: my partner did something behind my back and I can't cope with the fact that he hid it from me. I understand people make mistakes, but I'm finding it hard to digest how easily he could lie to me.

This isn't a question about whether I should stay or leave, but how to rationalise and heal from this situation. There are complexities to his circumstance that I can't explain, but trust that it's fully understandable. It just hurts to be in this position, and I know it hurts for him too. How can I move on from this? :'))

Bonus Q: communication is obviously an important aspect, but it's hard for me to talk to him about these feelings because I know it hurts him to revisit his mistakes. How should I navigate this? Wait for time to heal a little before discussing it, or just tough it out and move on?

880,"To sum things up with them: Their mental health made them manipulative and emotionally draining to me before treatment. They went to residential for 10ish months and recently got out. I was hoping that the therapy would’ve improved their behavior and I’m sure it did in some areas. 

Though, last night they tried to contact me and they were doing the same stupid patterns they did before they left. They made stupid lies (including who they were cause they made a new account on social media and found me) that were obvious and I confronted them about it. Instead of coming clean, they got defensive over it by claiming they weren’t lying... At that point, I just stopped trying cause they were only going to get worse if I said more about the obvious lie they made. 

Now, I want them to improve and such. However, if they’re going to continue doing the same shit they did before treatment then I’m not sure if it’s worth it for me to interact with them.

seizure the morning after the argument and came in and said it was my fault and was crying saying why are you being so horrible Cole and Aimee are so scared of you when I wasn’t even talking to them cause I had been avoiding them and I wasn’t talk to my nana and grandad that much before cause they constantly made me feel like a burden whenever I asked for anything no matter how small and the after she was like “I’m not saying it’s your fault but you should be taking care of your sister” when I had been I even got her gifts to make her feel better after her seizure anyways on the way home wasn’t much better because she promised me a window seat on the plane since I gave it up on the way there and she acting so nice and going aww your so nice to do that you can have it on the way home like the thing is I wasn’t even bothered that much by the window seat I didn’t care but when I said “Okay, remember I’m getting the window seat” in the airport she got all stroppy and snappy and was like “Ugh! Donna do start acting like that” making me feel like garbage, like I didn’t even care so I just when and board the plane but since I’ve came back she’s just been extremely moody with me and she makes horrible comments to me like I feel afraid to say anything to her and I just feel extremely depressed like she criticises every single thing I do and she’s done that for a long time like no matter how stupid it is like on what I say or act or how I make my own coffee or tea she always has something to say about it and she makes comments on how much I eat and I just feel so done like my nana is someone you can’t reason with like when I was smoking which I understand is bad like of course but she was sitting me down and was like are you just here for money are you using us or do you wanna go to a home or move back with you mum which she knows I can’t, I’ve even been planning to run away now and I really want to like I have absolutely no where else to go I’m only 15 the only thing that keeps me home is my education and my cat I’m just so done and I do not wanna talk about it to anyone at all I don’t like talking I just need help someone please help.

884,"Some backstory: I am 22, in my senior year of college, and living with my parents and two \[younger\] brothers. Last year, my mom got a job in a factory for the free insurance and to occupy time to help keep her mental health in check. This August she got the opportunity for a promotion as a technician and went out with her coworkers and bosses to celebrate. She came home drunk and didn't contact anyone, and accidentally slept in her truck.

When saying this my dad didn't believe her and this dissolved into an argument, with some points that I agree with (like her not contacting anyone). After about a week, Dad said some stuff along the lines of him owning everything and that she wasn't being present due to the long hours of the job, and mom stopped speaking to him and started to come home late at night, sometimes not even at all to avoid talking to him. Dad would try to get her to talk things out when she was here and she'd get angry, and he got worried that she would harm herself and told her to quit her job and tried to block her from going by taking her truck keys about two weeks ago. She goes to work, sits in parking lots, or goes to sit by the river, or a hotel to sleep, and I go to check on her and talk about things with her.

She says that she opened up to him at the beginning and his first response was ""do you want me to leave? am I the problem for you?"" and that made her shut down and not want to speak. She doesn't speak much in the first place so now she's clammed up and wants to avoid everything. She told me she was going to virtual counseling, but it's been at least three weeks and I haven't heard much about it so I don't know how valid it is. She also said something about taking my brothers and just leaving.

My dad started taking steps to try and empathize with what she's going through and briefly talked to a counselor about depression and how to best help. He convinced her to go to a couple's counseling session but was told to give her space, so he did, by telling me he was leaving and going to a campground. This lasted a total of one day and he came back saying that he would work on our previous discussion of talking over others and taking over discussions, but that we all needed to try and communicate. Mom didn't come home. Last week he said that he was leaving permanently to give her space and that he was looking for an apartment. He left on Thursday and came back Saturday after the counseling session, which lasted a total of 20 minutes before my mom walked out without speaking to anyone (both parents had told me this). He convinced her not to leave the house, and Dad stated that the therapists had said she needed to be committed for her health. If it comes to that, he wants me to take her to the ER because she would refuse to get in the car with him. Currently he is giving her space by sleeping on an air mattress in our basement. He also has been using his vacation days for work and is worried about losing his job due to this. He drove all the way to one of his stores (about 1.5 hrs away), sat out there, and came back because he couldn't handle it.

I genuinely don't know what to do anymore, because I am taking care of a 16-year-old and a 12-year-old, the house and meals, all our animals (plus my diabetic cat who is not doing okay), a new job, and helping a friend who just totaled her car and is getting kicked out by her father by letting her room with me in the one space I can call my own. I'm trying so hard to keep up and help the people I love while also keeping up with schoolwork but I don't know if I have it in me to keep this up. My mom's getting more distant, my dad is crying on air mattresses, I and the sixteen-year-old are ""stress-y and depress-y,"" and the 12-year-old is with my grandparents for Fall Break, with not much knowledge on anything.

885,"I've been a mess for 4 or 5 months.

I've always been an overthinker and have a tendancy to jump to the worst conclusion (which is usually wrong). For this reason, I started turning to Reddit for advice in my personal life. A lot. Way too much. So much so that I've had multiple accounts suspended or banned for posting similar stuff over and over for help. I just don't trust myself or my judgment on *anything* anymore. 

The problems really started (and the addictive posting for relief), when I started thinking hard about bad stuff my boyfriend did in the past. My boyfriend has undiagnosed (but textbook and an online therapist agreed) OCD. I was terrified his OCD wasn't OCD and he was just a bad person/creep. It causes him extreme guilt if he doesn't tell me something bad he did. I've heard all about incest porn he read as a teen, the time he pegged himself with a toilet brush, the time he tried to steal someone's girlfriend so he could get sex (she had a huge crush on him). My boyfriend's OCD also makes him think disgusting, immoral sexual thoughts and it'll make him panic that he enjoys him. It's like torture for him and I often hear them. He also gets doubts about me/his feelings a lot. Sometimes he will confess these outright and they really hurt. Other times he has this zoned out or pained expression and I just *know* he's hurting and when I ask he'll confess what doubt he has about me or disgusting sexual image/doubt. 

I have often acted like a hypocrite after he confesses his OCD thoughts and I get hurt by these images or thoughts and accuse him of faking his OCD and secretly being a monster because *if he really had OCD he would get help so he wouldn't hurt me anymore*. This is so abusive on my part and I'm ashamed. To try and cope with my fears he was a bad person or faking his OCD, I posted practically daily about whichever doubt/thought of his worried me most for reassuance. I did this so much I got suspended and kept making new accounts. All I wanted was reassuance my BF was just a good dude with OCD and he still loved me. I posted daily, often reposting the same question if I didn't get enough replies to feel ""better"". I even made 2 new Gmail accounts just to make more accounts for more reassuance.

I feel like I've gone so far and acted so toxic, I have to leave my BF and let him find a nice, normal person. I also feel terrified that I've acted so crazy no decent dude will ever want me after my BF, even if I get therapy and get my crap together. Who could be happy with someone as crazy as me? Am I being redemption?",15Oct2020,1

- Getting the National Abuse button app on phone (what if she was get to her phone?)
- Metal door stop bars, just so her brother can't get in to be at her (brother will kick down floor)
- Pack safety bags to run with (her faster, stronger and my friend has severe 'Anorexia Nervosa and can be quite weak/tiered

897,"So I [23M] have been talking on chats with girl [18] for 3 weeks literally every single day. We meet in Tinder (my account was not full done but we still talked) but after a week we changed to Facebook and then we talked even more frequently, played few online games. 
We have almost exactly sense of humor, music taste and things like this. Me and she both used to start conversations early morning every day.
We could talk about everything. 
Finally I asked her to get out, there was no ""date"" keyword.
Since she had work we meet and talked for only like 3 hours.

And then boom, silence on chat... I mean I tried to talk to her after few hours but it ended with few short words.
Today I tried again and felt a lot better, bit of laugh. I even asked if meeting was all right and if there would be possibility to meet once again maybe, she did not say NO but did not say clear YES either. But there again. Silence.
Tried few hours ago, send some stuff, she read it and did not respond.

I'm not gonna lie, I am confused and adding to this my not best understanding of this situation I am not sure what to think/do.
Also, we both knew how we look before meeting so there should not be appearance problem (I think). 

In my head I have 2 things I can do.
1. Let it be it's own way... If she responds, start chat then fine, I will be happy to talk and see what I can do.
Or
2. Wait maybe few days, not much, and just go all in. By this I mean tell her straight i like her and find her attractive and ask her out more official.

905,"Before I even start, I am a 14 year old female with anxiety. This is my very first post ever, so sorry if the format isn’t what you usually see! I am on an alt account because I don’t really want personal stuff on my main.

**/ Background /**

5 months ago, I was toxic to my friends without realizing it. I was anxious that they wanted to leave me for being a bad person, which they did. I know those aren’t excuses at all, but I am really trying to change. Since I lost all of my friends, I have been having problems with my self esteem, and I assume everything I do is bad.

**/ My Dilemma /**

While I was at an after-school marching band practice yesterday, I met someone who I talked to for a little while. We traded phone numbers and stuff. We texted each other a little bit, and I am scared whether or not they actually wanted to be my friend. They did say they didn’t talk to many people right now. I know it is just anxiety but I do not know how to stop it. The lingering thought of my anxiety still being true persists because of my old friends. What should I do?",15Oct2020,1
906,"I've never really understood the social dynamics of romantic relationships. I don't frequently or strongly experience romantic attraction. For a while I considered myself to be aromantic. But I've been a bit unsure of that lately, and I've wanted to try dating to help figure things out. I remember a few years ago there was this guy I almost dated, but then I got confused about my feelings and we didn't end up dating. I regret that I didn't at least try a relationship with him to see how I felt. I know I had some feelings for him even though I'm not sure what exactly they were. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I was in my zoom guitar class at school and a girl from that class DMed me her number on Instagram. I guess being one of the only people with my camera on paid off. I didn't know what to do, but I knew how much I had regretted when I turned down that guy a few years ago. (Oh yeah background info to avoid confusion, I'm bi). I decided I wanted to give this a try, so I sent my number back.

Now the other problem I had to deal with was my severe social anxiety. I struggle to understand and follow social dynamics and carry conversations, and the fact that I can't communicate face to face and read body language bc corona makes it a lot worse. I've wondered if I might be on the autism spectrum for a while, but I'll save that for a different post. Calling and face-timing people is also really difficult because it makes me really anxious for some reason. 

So I know that it's typically customary for the guy to always make the first moves, but I was just so anxious I waited for her to text me first. While I was waiting, I checked her instagram to see what she looks like and if I even felt any initial attraction. I don't often experience romantic attraction and when I do, I struggle to recognize it. I can't remember or visualize people very well in my head, so I kept forgetting what she even looked like. She never turns her camera on in class and the only references I have are two of her instagram posts. And it kept stressing me out, because how am I supposed to tell if I like someone if I don't even know what they look like? And if I don't know if I like this person, then I don't want to lead them on. It didn't feel ethical to talk to her. She obviously has some sort of feelings for me, and I don't know if I reciprocate those feelings. The possibility that I would be leading her on if I started talking to her made me even more anxious. I couldn't think clearly that day.

The next day we texted each other a bit. And she seems genuinely really nice. But I still can't tell whether I just want to be friends or something more. My anxiety went down. I looked at her instagram again, trying to remember what she looked like. And I realized she's actually pretty cute, my brain was just too panicked to realize earlier. I'm still not certain how I feel about her yet. I think we would have to meet in person before I could know. But think I want to continue to pursue this. I at least want to get to know her and see where it goes from there. Maybe we'll just be friends, maybe it'll develop into something more, we'll just have to see.

We had like- one short conversation. And then it kind of fizzled out. I think I should be the one to initiate the conversation this time. I have no issue with a girl making the first move, but I don't want to make her do all the work. I don't want her to think I don't care. But I don't know how to start the conversation or what to talk about. I don't want to sound abrupt or weird. I don't want to freak her out. But I feel like if I don't put in an effort to start conversations with her she'll get bored or think I'm not interested and move on. But I have no idea how to just start a conversation with her out of the blue. Do you guys have any advice?",15Oct2020,1

I don't care what she does and never mention hours or anything, but it drives me nuts that every time I talk to her about anything it's all about how busy she is, she has no time, blah blah. Get over yourself, everyone's busy! I'm usually all for complaining and be able to vent without feeling like a nuisance, but at this point, she's not doing it to vent. She's doing it constantly. I'll say how much of a nice night I am having, after having worked an 8 hour shift, came home and did 2 hours of homework, cleaned up, made myself dinner, did laundry, showered, and finally got a moment to myself. I'll bask in it and say it's so nice, and she'll go off on a tangent about how she's so busy, meanwhile she's sitting right beside me enjoying the same moment, after having not worked all day or having worked a 5 hour shift.

I texted her saying how excited I was to relax and she replied with a paragraph about how she's so busy right now. I just answered with a simple one word, because I'm trying to make it known that I don't want to hear it anymore. My conflict is that I want her to know I am here for her whenever she needs to complain or vent or anything, but when it comes to this, I'm so sick of it.

In the beginning when i liked someone i would just go ask them and tell them i liked them, this would lead to there answer always being no. but we'd always just stay friends afterwards.

Im now in University but my luck still hasnt changed, ive asked out three different girls during my 3 years on this course and still im told ""i like you as a friend"".   


Im trying to see things in a positive light, like damn right im happy i at least have some amazing friends but its not what im after. Im always told im a great friend and that im kind, but that never seems to be enough for people to be interested in me, other than them seeing me as Just a friend.

So now I'm sitting here in the dead of night wondering how do I react to this? Should I block her and just ignore it? Try to tell her that its not okay? Is it socially acceptable to even complain about the fact that your ''SO'' slept with another, I feel that to express and judge her in front of other people that do not know her is somehow wrong and therefore I have no venting mechanism, only shame and anxiety. 

Extra info; my ex-girlfriend and I were together for 3 years, and I also found out she cheated on me, havent really dealt with that either,

so dear Reddit, how the fuck do you deal with this weird feeling when being cheated on?",15Oct2020,1
925,"I’m 29F very introverted, am not much of a talker except with extremely close friends/family. But I tend to attract big talkers. 

There’s some psychological phenomenon where people do 95% of the talking and then come away feeling like you’ve had a great conversation and really connected. They mistake my quietness for “being a great listener”. 

In reality, I’m just waiting for the interaction to be over. I’m amazed at people’s ability to drone on. Am I a good actress or are they oblivious that I might be bored? I don’t know. 

It’s not that I want a bigger share of the talking time. I don’t want to talk to these people more, or at all. They’re nice, nothing wrong with them, I just feel none of the fulfillment from our “friendship” that they apparently do. I have had 3 different women say they consider me a sister and I’m baffled because I offer them nothing except “uh huh”ing through the occasional lunch I failed to weasel out of. 

How do I pump the brakes with these people and quit attracting new ones?",15Oct2020,1

927,"Last sunday, I (18M) had quite a huge fight with my mom. It doesn't happen often, I tend to keep everything to myself, but here she made me feel terrible during a panic attack and I'm still really mad about it. I see her again next sunday but she sent me a few hours ago an e-mail saying that she ""wasn't very tactful"" but that I had to be ""more polite"".

For the context, I was doing my homework and I was hella stressed because I had a LOT to do but just couldn't find the time or the energy and I was losing my concentration all the time (+ the stress building up wasn't helping). My laptop kept freezing and I lost quite a part of my progression at some point so, yeah, I was about to explode with stress.

My mom came a few times in my room to ask about dinner and I tried to keep my cool but ended up breaking down crying in front of her (she hadn't done anything yet).

Later, she drove me to my dad's place and she told me I should have been nicer and more polite and that I should have started homework sooner if I didn't want to be stressed. I was still trying to recover from the panic attack and that gave me another one. I was super mad, I told her two months ago that I didn't need her comments on how I deal with my stuff because I already put a lot of pressure on myself, and now she gives me some stupid useless advice when I'm still trying to fight suicidal urges ?? My mental health is terrible and I try so hard to be functioning and make her and my dad proud, I thought that her seeing me break down would be enough to make her feel some kind of empathy for me but I'm apparently wrong ??

The thing is, I'm still really mad, but I know I'll have to act normal again when I see her on sunday. But what happened really hurt me and I really don't know what to do to make her understand how shitty she has been to me.

I just answered to her e-mail : ""I was having a panic attack and doing my best not to kill myself. Being polite wasn't really a priority."" and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be yelled at for it but apparently talking like adults is liking talking to a wall and watching me hurting myself wasn't enough to make her question her actions so I'm kinda out of ideas right now...",15Oct2020,1
928,"I’m the kind of person that doesn’t want to live a simple life. I want it all. I want to meet so many people, travel around the world, find my soulmate, get rich, and even famous for something! 

Currently I have been feeling like I’m only existing, not living. I’m 18 years old and I’m only getting older. My mind keeps telling me to start my life already; start LIVING. 

You’re probably thinking “Okay so just live then.” But me being a perfectionist, it’s extremely hard to do. 

Every time I try to start a new chapter in my life or a new beginning, I keep seeing myself fall back into my old habits and then I have to start over. This has been going on for years now. I hate to see myself growing older.

I just don’t want to feel regret once I hit the last day of my life. 

But other people seem to be living their life just fine. I seen people have so many friends, go to these wild parties, seen all the beautiful places. And they don’t need to put in all the effort that I have been doing to get their life. 

Other people have told me I’m thinking this way too deep and that I should just relax, go with the motions. But I just can’t. I’m not wired that way. I want to plan my life. I want to finally achieve my dreams.

What do you think? Am I taking life too seriously?",15Oct2020,1
929,"I (f) have only ever had a crush on one man. He's my childhood friend and ever since we were younger I had feelings for him. He didn't really pick up on them at all but I just figured that he was a little dense. I've lived like this for so long, subtly flirting and thinking one day he'd understand. 

Recently quarantine has made me a little more confident in myself, so I worked up the courage to tell him how I felt. It was like a regular rejection, he said he only saw me as a friend and that's it, sure it stung but I gathered my wits and went on. 

Today, a couple days later, he came out as gay to me. I respected his decision to come out, that's not the problem. After he came out he told me that I was his type and would be quoted ""perfect"" for him, but only if I was a man. I was speechless, but I think he took it as a sign to continue on his monologue. He explained how he knew I was flirting with him all these years and would have genuinely dated me if I was a gay man. How all of my features and actions would be attractive as a guy. He said other stuff, but these statements felt like an emotional kick to my ribcage. 

Reading my own words right now, it doesn't seem like such a big deal, but I don't understand why it hurts so much. Is it normal to be upset/sad in this situation? 

Does anyone have advice on how to cope or perhaps forget about this? Any advice helps.",15Oct2020,1
930,"What do you guys think of this and your interpretation of this writing...


Today you lost a good friend. Someone who honestly did his best to be there and help you even it it meant taking time off work, despite being behind. It wasn't that he wasn't busy, he just simply gave you his time. He helped you with things you needed to buy even though he barely had enough to pay bills at the end of the month. He did small things in hopes to make her day just a little better because it made him happy to see her that way. He wanted to show her that there are people out there that truly care.... but then it started to get exhausting for him to keep up....not giving him time nor day for a chat when he needed it. Just twice he tried... He thought she would be the good friend that he imagined, but he was mistaken. She would make excuses day after day until she conveniently felt like being there. This whole time he was blinded and never realized that their ""friendship""was run only on her time...He hopes you'll be considerate the next time you find someone that's good to you. He'll still be your friend because he cares, just not that ""good"" friend.",15Oct2020,1
931,"I swear I always feel this low level sadness all the time but that can't be true because I know I've been out and hung out with people and felt good and come back to my room and felt happy that I did those things, yet I feel like I'm never happy with my life. It's ridiculous because I'm better off than a lot of people in the world and I honestly don't know why the fuck I feel this way, it doesn't make any sense and I don't know where it's coming from. I'm just being ungrateful for what I have in the most stupid way possible by feeling like there's this constant dissatisfaction in the background. I'm 18 and I just started uni. I'm in halls and I feel like I'm fucking up everything. I want to have fun but there's corona and with online learning I keep procrastinating like an idiot. I've got into a really competitive course at a great uni yet I feel so fucking stupid all the fucking time. Like I'm not even a person because I'm so stupid. I don't know how anything works or anything about the world. I get stressed to voice chat with someone in case I can't answer their questions or I don't know something they're talking about that I'm supposed to know.

If I get on with things and find something to do, just typical boring shit like doing laundry, having a shower, changing my bedsheets, I feel ok. But if I have to do something that actually requires me to think I procrastinate and don't want to do it. I swear the only things I really truly fully enjoy is sexting my online friends (only 1-2 people), eating a nice meal, and sleeping. But if I think about it, I've also enjoyed meeting certain people in my hall and talking to them. So I don't know what I mean. I just feel like I don't know what makes me happy apart from those 3 very basic things and I'll never experience true happiness beyond having a great orgasm on camera.

I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm just complaining about nothing. But I don't know how to make myself stop thinking like this and fucking over analysing everything.",15Oct2020,1

Hello. It’s my last autumn break, and for the next two weeks I’ll have nothing but free time... which is my problem...

You see, I was always the quiet one. My life hasn’t been good for many reasons, and I grew up alone, passing the time via consumption of video games, tv shows and other media. I thought I could live like this forever, and even though I feel completely apathetic towards everything else in life, I’ll have the fiction I hold so dearly to motivate me to carry on.

Recently though, I’ve lost all interest in everything, starting in the last few months.
I’ll start new series, be interested in them for a few days then ultimately forget about them. It never used to be this way; I’d watch it then go and find every last bit of content I could, engaging with the fandom along with way. I’m terrified of losing the things I hold dearly. My favorite series of all time just started a new season yet I feel completely indifferent. It’s tearing me apart.

I know I can’t rely on fiction to keep me happy forever but I can’t fathom the idea of losing these stories and characters that mean so much to me. I’m starting to question what I even saw in them that made myself grow to be this attached. 

People change, I’m changing, hopefully, for the better, but this... I can’t do this. I’m sorry. I know how pathetic it sounds, but I have nothing else to rely on for happiness. These series have become ingrained into my personality, and when they start to fall out of reach, it’s too much.",15Oct2020,1
933,"I'm a 16 y.o highschool student in Turkey and I'm honestly scared. İt's very very very hard to go to university abroad in Turkey unless you got tons and tons of cash and we don't have those. As I grew, our economy, education and many other things got worse and I witnessed every second of it and I want to leave or at least flee my country. İn our education system, it's all based on memory and nothing actually helpful in life. While politicians have their own schools with other politician's children in it, it's so unfair that words would be indequent. Also I'm very lonely even though I'm considered social by many. All of my friends treat me like a piece of toilet paper and I have no one to talk about my feelings and yes even my parents doesn't seem to understand how fucked up of a condition I'm in. But I will not get into details to both upset you or make you tired so anyways, I had no certain objective about where to go but wanted to try my chance on Japan or America for a while. I specificely wanted to avoid west since many people seem to be misunderstanding who Turks are and have prejudices. But when I explained all of this to my parents, they literally ignored me and said ""Do if you can""
İt's a very important topic and yet I'm being ignored by them to this day. When I talk about even going abroad, they start laughing inside thinking this is some kind of temporary childish desire but no. I'm scared.

944,"I've been a mess for 4 or 5 months.

I've always been an overthinker and have a tendancy to jump to the worst conclusion (which is usually wrong). For this reason, I started turning to Reddit for advice in my personal life. A lot. Way too much. So much so that I've had multiple accounts suspended or banned for posting similar stuff over and over for help. I just don't trust myself or my judgment on *anything* anymore. I have no idea how many accounts I've made, could be as high as 60 on the last 5 Months? I sound so deranged.

The problems really started (and the addictive posting for relief for my anxiety and other opinion), when I started thinking hard about bad stuff my boyfriend did in the past. My boyfriend has undiagnosed (but textbook and an online therapist agreed) OCD. I was terrified his OCD wasn't OCD and he was just a bad person/creep. It causes him extreme guilt if he doesn't tell me something bad/weird he did. I've heard all about incest porn he read as a teen, the times he pegged himself with a toilet brush, the time he tried to steal someone's girlfriend so he could get sex (she had a huge crush on him). My boyfriend's OCD also makes him think disgusting, immoral sexual thoughts and it'll make him panic that he enjoys him. It's like torture for him and I often hear them. He also gets doubts about me/his feelings a lot. Sometimes he will confess these outright and they really hurt. Other times he has this zoned out or pained expression and I just *know* he's hurting and when I ask he'll confess what doubt he has about me or disgusting sexual image/doubt. 

I have often acted like a hypocrite after he confesses his OCD thoughts and I get hurt by these images or thoughts and accuse him of faking his OCD and secretly being a monster because *if he really had OCD he would get help so he wouldn't hurt me anymore*. This is so abusive on my part and I'm ashamed. To try and cope with my fears he was a bad person or faking his OCD, I posted practically daily about whichever doubt/thought of his worried me most for reassuance. I did this so much I got suspended and kept making new accounts. All I wanted was reassuance my BF was just a good dude with OCD and he still loved me. I posted daily, often reposting the same question if I didn't get enough replies to feel ""better"". I even made 2 new Gmail accounts just to make more accounts for more reassuance.

I feel like I've gone so far and acted so toxic, I have to leave my BF and let him find a nice, normal person.

946,"i need the best advice possible on how to become independent and distance myself from my parents. sorry in advance for how long this is. i hope you stick around and read it. 

some background: i go to college in new jersey. my whole life is in new jersey. i horseback ride in new jersey. my parents decided to move to delaware on a whim this summer and they basically uprooted my whole life. all of my family is in new jersey. but yeah, now i’m stuck living on campus because i have no other choice. i would’ve saved thousands and commuted but they just said “oh well”. they’re extremely toxic and hold finances over my head. they pay for my car insurance and health insurance which means they pay for all of my meds. 

i would move out in a heartbeat but everything is so expensive in new jersey and minimum wage isn’t nearly enough. i don’t know what to do because i can’t afford my college. my parents told me i’m paying for each semester and they’ll only reimburse me if i get all As and Bs. every semester. for the rest of college. in a finance/management business program. 

here’s the shitty part: they just spent hundreds of thousands on a new house (built from the ground up), $8k on a quad, they bought a fucking kubota, and they’re looking into buying another horse and a pickup truck. but they can’t pay for my education. the most ironic of it all is on their anniversary my mom thanked my dad on facebook for being a great father and paying for my education. 

i don’t know what to do. i’m already having dark thoughts and i know i’m going to be suicidal again if i have to live with them for another year, on top of having the pressure of needing to get As and Bs if i want my money back. when they reimburse me for this semester (fall 2020) i will have $15k in savings. 

if i move out i will have no health insurance and no car insurance. my medications are several hundred dollars for less than a month’s supply. i could move in with my aunt and uncle but the same problem arises: health insurance and car insurance. my biggest issue aside from my meds is how i’m going to finish school when i can only afford one semester. i don’t know what to do. i’m really at a loss.",15Oct2020,1
