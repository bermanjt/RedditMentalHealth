0,"I'm a college student doing work study and I find it difficult to work. I get so choked up when I have to talk to my supervisors. I don't have any problem answering other students' questions or following orders. But there's a lot of times where I've finished my job and everything looks stocked (I work in the bookstore/student store) and I know I have to go up to my supervisor or the other employees to ask for something else to do, but I just can't. Fortunately, they're all kind and laid back so I don't get in trouble for not speaking up. But I'm so grateful for working there that I want to be a good worker without them having to remind me of my responsibilities.

I also think this is a huge issue for when I start working outside jobs or when I actually graduate college. I don't know what exactly my problem is. I've always had trouble speaking during certain situations, usually with like people w higher authority than me. I've tried the most common advice like just speaking and going out of my comfort zone. But like I said, I get choked up, so even if I'm forcing myself, no words come out. I don't even know what exactly triggers my problem. I get nervous when people ask me for help, but I'm still able to talk to them. I feel like it's a problem related to me being the one to initiate things. I'd much rather the other person start a conversation or be the one to give orders rather than me asking for it or going up to them.

Anyways, I don't know what to do. TIA for any advice given.",27Jan2020,1
1,"I'm a female boy scout and I met this boy at summer camp last July. (I didn't go into scouts for boys btw) He was one of the boys that came without the rest of their troops, and my dad voulenteered to help watch them. We were on the same campsite, and we hung out all the time. Every night we would look at the stars, we had some merit badge classes together, he taught me lashings, he even cheered me on during the mile swim. After summer camp I convinced myslef i didnt like him though.

I saw him last weekend at winter rondezvous. (district wide campout) He came up to me while we were serving dinner. He didnt say much and went back to his table with all his giggling friends. Later i gave him my number while literally shaking. He looked and nodded and i walked away to my friend. He came and found us later and we talked more. Nothing had changed and we looked at stars again.

It's been a week and he hasnt texted me. :( idk if I did something wrong or maybe he lost it ot his parents didn't approve.",27Jan2020,1
2,"A couple months ago I was invited out to eat with a few friends and a few people who I didn’t really know. They all knew each other. After, I was invited to their friend group and hung out with them a lot.

One of the people in this group, the kind of leader, I guess(?) used to be my best friend. Like we were brothers. Then, he came out to me as gay, and one of our mutual friends told him that I told her. I didn’t. Basically, she said I outed him.  I didn’t. He believes her and hated me for a long time. He cooled off after about a year and we weren’t friends but we weren’t enemies. Cool. He seemed kind of cold to me at first but I shrugged it off. He befriended some people after that and those are all the people I didn’t really know in the group. Then there were a few that I knew.

It seemed pretty fine until a couple weeks ago when I noticed the group began to hang out without me. Like everyone except me. I wasn’t the only one invited to be a part of the group, a lot of the people that I already knew kind of joined with me. They were invited and I wasn’t. No big deal, I don’t have to be a part of anything. I’m moving away to college soon anyway so not the biggest of my worries. 

One time, they were at a place that was closing soon and needed somewhere to go. One of them who is a close friend of mine suggested my house. Someone else agreed. The rest got really angry with them. Because “clearly they should have known that [Leader] doesn’t like” me. They stood up for me, asking what was going on. Then the [leader] told them the story that includes me outing him. Now, this isn’t his fault. He was told something that wasn’t true, but he believed it. He was certain that the experience of coming out would begin a new chapter of life where he could be who he was freely. He would do it in his own style, and it was ruined for him. I’m not angry with him at all. Maybe a little for holding a grudge for 2 years over it but I’m straight so I dont really understand his point.

I had told everyone in that group “my side” of the story. (In quotes because I’m not sure what to call it, it’s the truth.) I told them that what this guy was told was wrong. It seemed like they believed me. Until now. 


Fast forward to 2 nights ago. Our school is taking a field trip to Chicago in about 3 months. We needed to figure out chaperone groups. Originally, the 13 of us were going to split up between 2 chaperones but stay together, in order to alleviate the responsibility for the chaperones. We were just going to randomly choose someone because it didn’t really matter. Our group request was due Friday and in typical high schooler fashion we waited until Friday to get it done. 

One member of the group asked if his girlfriend could be with us. I didn’t mind, but a lot of the group don like her and they said no and gave a bunch of bullshit reasons why, and he shut them all down. I said I thought it was kinda shitty to exclude her and I got totally shit on. After a while, and a ton of me fighting for her, they finally agreed to it. But one of the people (who originally stood up for me) said that she tells her mom a lot and apparently badmouthed this guys girlfriend to her. Because of that, she said her mom would be “biased against her.” I asked why that had to be the case and she accused me twice of talking shit about her mom. Then, our whole groupchat got into a kind of fight about whether or not to let this girl in. This was after I submitted the request. Then, another girl chimes in and says she already sent a request in with just some of the people in the chat in her group. Problem is, I was told to send an email asking the school to disregard all other requests with these people and only use the one I sent. That’s what I was told to do. So I wasn’t going to send another email saying “jk.” After a little while longer of intense infighting, it was agreed that what I sent in was acceptable, we would just have to get along with this girl.


I then find out that I’m universally hated for:
“Talking shit” about this girls mom
“Outing” the [Leader]
Standing up for this girl.

This was all told to me by my closest friend in the group, and the group doesn’t know I know this. I can’t say anything to the group or else the girl will be ostracized.

I’ve thought about just removing myself from the chat and the group, but I have to be with them in Chicago, and they would be really awkward. 

What can I do to rectify the situation? It’s just high school drama but still I’d like to remain friends with them and have a fun trip.",27Jan2020,1
3,"I'm a 17 year old boy. 
Last night I was at my school's dance and I was having a good time with my friends. I didn't drink much alcohol, because I usually can't drink a lot, but my friends went wild, which is why I ended up not spending all my evening with them. Eventually I went to the disco area where I met a girl that I went to school with a long time ago, but even after such a long time she immerdiately remembered me and we started to talk and dance and I had a great time with her. She was clearly pretty drunk, so I didn't think too much of it, but afterwards and now I can't help myself but to wanting to getting to know her better at least. But since she was drunk I wouldn't know if she was being genuinely nice to me or if she just acted like that with everybody. As I said I'm pretty stupid when it comes to social questions, but that's why I'm here to ask for advice. I hope this is even the right place for this

4,"So, im in a really strange situation. Im really not trying to make this one long stretched out post. Ill do my best to get straight to the point. 

Been with my boyfriend 4 years now. At the beginning of us living together he would talk to this girl. Now i already had a fucked up feeling about her, especially when he forced us to talk through FB messenger. Now he said they were just friends, nothing else was mentioned. Besides shes was married and had 2 kids. I felt I needed to chill and control my jealousy and reminded myself that I have guys I've been friends with since childhood. So I pulled myself together . 

Well soon after this awkward video meeting, her and her family came to visit. She also ""Hired"" my boyfriend to do some work and paint her MILs home. We both went over, met her family as well as her husbands. 
While she was here we even went out as couples and shed also helped in getting supplies with my boyfriend. He even went out with her one night with her family to chilies- supposedly. 

Forward 4 years. Her name was randomly mentioned. I've had this feeling forever so out of curiosity I opened his messenger on a shared tablet. Now it says they haven't chatted since 2017.  I see all this sexting, like true video talking dirty , fuck me type sexting, pretending they are married, them hooking up during her visits. This was only weeks before we became official and a couple months after having to meet her. It shows her Making sure her husband was a sleep or at work when they talked. He even said things to her he never says to me. The one text that got me , was the one of her asking if I were around. That was a few days before what's seems to be no more communication. So many little details left out like their time alone during her visit. The awkward dinner I had to sit through with her and her husband. The gazing I caught a few times when they thought no one was looking. 

I don't know how to approach this because i no longer look at him in the light i use to. He put me in a position and her husband to look like fools. I feel beyond disrespected. Plus he still does maintenance work for her entire family and friends.

Im shaking so bad right now out of anger.",27Jan2020,1

Hello,

My mother, who has a psychiatric condition, is leaving a long-running domestic violence tainted relationship from another state. She previously collected social security benefits and federal or local government paid for half of her rent.

I'd like to put her in a home I own in the MD area and would like assistance from the government for utilities and cost to keep her there.

May I charge her the fair market value of the house without being rejected or affecting her benefits?

If not, what are my options? Open to any advice. In addition, I assume she will be eligible for EBT assistance for food, etc. regardless, correct?

Thank you.",27Jan2020,1
10,"Hi. I take 100mg sertraline every day. I don't smoke nor drink alcohol. When I was a child, my cousin abused me sexually. I no longer have contact with him. Since 2012 until the present day I have depression and anxiety because of the separation of my parents, for a search for meaning that have been explained several times to me: the reason for the separation and the reason why my father ran away to a city. I still want to live a life that is not perfect, that life when I was going to play a game I was happy to play. That life that when I talked to my friends, they asked me out. Today it is no longer the same. I want to escape this thought of wanting to kill myself because I know that the current problems will get worse in the future and will consequently affect my family.

Since I moved to Portugal I live with that and I don't know how to explain why I diminished this desire to create friendships or even serious relationships. About wanting to have serious relationships, I like a girl, she sings in the choir with me. Unfortunately, I am still anxious and introverted. It is practically impossible to have a relationship with her, when I see that she does not have much time to get on the phone due to priorities. She said it is because of her studies, and I believe her. I already installed several applications on my phone to see if they helped me, but without any result, funny that I only managed to like two people in this entire country. I lived 20 years locked inside my room playing games and making friends online, unfortunately I see that it is over and I want help.

I wanted to ask for advice from Reddit on what I should do to improve my life and not always stay on the same timeline. But please, I didn't want people to come and say, ""You can't end this life for X reason! Y still love you"".

Thanks.",27Jan2020,1
11,"TLDR 

Talked with friend about sex, I was 16, they were 18.  Conversations went more detailed, then into kinks, then into illegal sexual activities... I was never touched, I was never “with” them, but I am left with nightmares and ptsd.

Situation

I used to role play or talk about romantic situations with someone I was obsessed with.  I wanted to impress them and they kept escalating the discussions.  Regular intercourse, detailed description, kinks, bdsm, to illegal sexual activity discussion.  I was 16/17, they were 18/19.  I was NEVER touched.  It was always talking or written on paper.

Now, I start to fantasize sometimes and a perfectly normal wet dream will turn into visions of disgusting illegal sex activities that were put into my head at such a young age.  I wake up in a panic and I am worried that if/when I get with someone, ptsd will prevent intimacy.

I’ve worked hard by myself and I no longer blame myself.  I couldn’t have known and I am not into these invasive visions.  Also I have not and will not replicate them.

I need help understanding what to call what I’ve been through and were to seek help.  Is it sexual trauma?  Even though no touching occurred?  Was I a childhood sexual abuse victim even though no one touched me?  Verbal abuse?  It feels worse than just being berated and insulted.  It effects my daily life and is a major hurtle for me.  Will sexual abuse therapists not take this matter seriously even though it didn’t escalate to physical abuse?",27Jan2020,1

Info about me: 19F living in an expensive city in a first world country. I work retail and make $1.30USD (converted, not from the Americas) above minimum wage. I live at home with one parent and two flatmates my age. 25% of my paycheck goes into savings, 40% of my paycheck goes to rent and utilities, and the other 35% is fun money.

17,"Now before you call me an idiot for dropping out of trade school, consider the following: I never wanted to go. I felt pressured by my parents to immediately pursue _some_ education, anything. I wanted to escape going to college because I absolutely despised school, and still do. Since I awakened to the fact that I’m in a course I have zero desire to take, in a field I have zero desire to work in, I decided to drop out and not waste all that time and money.

But now I’ve got no idea what else to do, because right now whatever career I choose to go with has to follow specific criteria.

My passion is fighting. I want to be a pro MMA fighter. And I’m well aware that I can’t live off of that, unless I happen to luck out, make it into the UFC, and become the next Conor McGregor. So I need a job that;

1. Is not back-breaking
2. Can lead to a more lucrative position, because I can’t fight forever
3. Does not require a higher education

I understand that I can’t expect to make a good living without a skill. Good thing about that it, now’s the time to get skilled while I’m still young and living with my parents.

I’ve heard that you can get into IT without a degree. Or coding or something. I don’t know. But that doesn’t sound so bad. I’ll be working with computers, and I’ll come home not too physically exhausted to go to the gym and train.

Whatever you can tell me about getting into IT from scratch, or other career paths that follow the criteria, is a huge help.",27Jan2020,1

22,"well to start off, most of my life i didn't have many friends, which was entirely my fault, it was due to my bad attitude and how annoying i was etc. but as i've matured i've gotten over that and while i'm far from perfect i am much better than i was. 

I've had friends at school for a while (i'm s5 which is the second last year of high school) but i never hung out with them outside of school. in may of last year i started to do just that, i partied, drank all the stupid shit teens get up to and it was fun.

I've had mental issues, anxiety and stuff, for a long time but i started becoming depressed and suicidal around august of last year with a few attempts occurring around November. At first i kept this a secret from my friends and everyone i knew but when i was drunk it all came spilling out. 

From this some of my closest friends who i cared for and trusted started to say i was doing it for attention, which i wasn't but honestly some of the time when i was drunk i could see why they would think so.

I was angry and hurt but because i thought it was only a few of them, it wasn't, i went to another party (which turned out to be my last) i got drunk at the party and I did something which offended a few 'influential' people in my group. these people didn't like me anyway and decided to bandwagon what i did resulting in me getting ostracized, which hurts but hey ho.

There are a number of people in the group who i like and still talk to, its a large group 40 or so, but in order to separate myself from the whole group i have  to stop talking to them as well.

this task would be relatively easy but the difficult issue is there are a few members of the group who are so deeply integrated in my life i don't know how or if i can get away from them. for example one of my best friends A and his sister B, I am close with both of them and have been for years and they were my best friends but recently A hasn't been nice, only way i can describe it, so i want to stop talking to him

If i am to go through with this i would be almost completely alone, but i am ready for that so please give me advice on how to get away from all of them, if it helps i will be moving away long term in a year and a half so only for that amount of time and the main issue is school because these people are in my classes and walk the same way home

i want to stop being friends with people but am finding it insanely difficult because they are in most aspects of my life.",27Jan2020,1

I asked my friend for this boss's name so I could connect with him on LinkedIn and he refused to tell me. He didn't give a straightforward answer, just saying that he didn't feel comfortable giving his boss's name or information out.

I know that people don't actively dislike me and that they are not excluding me on purpose, but I feel like I am only fun as a part of a larger group.
It's not like I'm new to the group or anything, I even did a board year for an association with four others which made us pretty close at the time, but lately I have been noticing that the previous board members hang out and chat individually with each other but not with me.
I very rarely (once every two months or so) hang out with two people individually but it's only at my initiative, they never ask me. When we do I don't feel like there is something wrong or awkward but still it doesn't become more frequent than that.

This has led me to believe that there is something I do or say/something about my behavior that makes me either annoying or kind of boring and that is the reason people don't really feel like asking me to hang out. I find this very frustrating because I have no idea what I could do to improve myself and make me a nicer person to be around.

She has a small group of people that she talks to daily on discord. (Voice chat and text) I have tried to let her have her privacy regarding this but it has bothered me a little. Anytime that I have brought up my unease with her getting to know these online guys she gets very defensive and claims I'm being jealous and ""won't let her have friends just because they're male"". 

Cut to some time later and we had a long chat about how this is becoming a problem (her spending so much time playing video games as well as spending it with her online friends). After this conversation I felt really good about our relationship. It really seemed like she was going to try and pick herself up and be more productive. Then this weekend happened... (Only about a week later)

This Saturday just passed was my nephew's birthday so I had plans to be there. My girlfriend the night before said she was going to stay at her mom's for the weekend to help clean which isn't exactly unusual. I got a strange sense from her but I decided not to question it because I was working on trying to be more trusting. Anyway, come Saturday I message her good morning with no response. Around noon I send a few more messages and still no response. Around 3pm I message her with no response; I can even see she hasn't read the messages. I get somewhat worried because this is very unusual. I try calling her but no one picks up. I then call her mom who answers. I ask her if (girlfriend) is there. She says no. At this point my worry is peaking. I ask her where she is and her mom says she doesn't know. I question further and her mom claims she took a nap and when she woke up (girlfriend) wasn't there. I begin freaking out at this point. 

At around 11pm my girlfriend messages me claiming her phone was dead. I ask her where she is and she says she's at her mom's house. I know this is a lie and I call her out on it. She insists she's at her mom's house and has been there all day. I know 100% this is a lie because I went to her mom's house on my way home and she wasn't there. I tell her this and she finally tells me she's in a town about 2 hours away. Come to find out, one of her online friends also lives in the same state and she wanted to meet him. She spent the whole day with him. She claims nothing happened romantically or sexually and that they are just friends and that they just went shopping and had dinner. 

I have been going through a roller coaster of emotions at this point. Beyond the actual actions, it's more of the blatant lying to my face that disturbs me. I even found out that her mom knew the whole time. I eventually ask her if I can read the messages between her and the online friend she just met. She tells me know because she think I will take them the wrong way. She does tell me that she mentioned in the chat that she invited they guy to stay at her hotel room (She insists it had 2 beds and that she once again meant nothing romantic or sexual. Supposedly for the purpose so they could hang out Sunday morning since he live about 45 mins away from the hotel). She only showed me one message where she flirtatiously asks him what kind of perfume she should wear (referring to the choices as either ""soft"" or ""sexy""). When I learned these last two things I honestly wanted to tell her to just fuck off. She refuses to let me see any of her other messages claiming that breaking her privacy like that will just ruin the relationship. 

The sad thing is, I actually do believe that nothing sexual did happen. I am just mortified by the blatant lies and deception. Her reason being, by the way, was that she thought I wouldn't let her go if she asked me. I do think she talks way to flirtatiously with her friends online however. 

I really don't know what to do. My gut instinct was to drop all of her stuff off at her mom's and tell her to have a nice life. I really don't like giving up on things so quickly, though. She's broken my trust so badly I don't know I can continue and not question anything she says. She told me that for this to work, we need to start clean slate and I just need to trust her. She swears she will never do something like this again. I'm having a very difficult time doing so. I do realize that if I can't bring myself to trust her then the point is moot. She went to her mom's house and I told her that I would like to cease contact for some time. I'm going to try to use this time to get a clear head.

Thank you for reading this far. Sorry everything is so scatterbrained. I'm not exactly thinking clearly right now. If you have any questions I'll try to answer to clarify anything.

34,"TL/DR: What do you say to the open-ended question, ""are you busy?"" when it is not a super close friend who you typically would drop everything to hang out with? 

I recently connected with an old friend. We have not been hanging out for a few decades. My life has changed significantly in that time, as I have welcomed 3 children into my life, 2 of whom have high needs. We recently reconnected because her significant other died unexpectedly and suddenly. 

I want to help her through this difficult transition to a different life, but I have limited time. We went out last week for dinner and social time and it was nice. She sent me a text today asking only, ""Are you busy tomorrow?""

I am, in general, super busy, but have been working on regulating the ""busyness"" and guarding my free time carefully. As it turns out tomorrow is my one free day this week. In addition to kids' games, appointments and school and house stuff, I have three social outings this week, which is two more than I like to have but whatever - that's how it worked out. I would be up with helping her with something but I really don't want to get together unless it is for something important.  (by my definition) 

Since we have not been in touch regularly for years, she has limited knowledge of the scope of my life and how busy I am as just a baseline. So I want to be kind in my response, but I don't know how to say all that quickly in a Facebook message. 

Complaint insert: In general, I dislike texts like this because just because I am not busy doesn't mean I necessarily am going to want to do whatever the asker has in mind. I really wish people could be more direct with requests. But being that this friend is in a really tough part of life, I could be open to helping her with something. I want to be sensitive to the difficulty she may have with even asking!",27Jan2020,1

37,"So it’s 2020. Hurray? 

Not quite. 

So I decided to take a break from college. With only only one more general to take. Which sounds ridiculous if you word it that way, but it’s because it’s math and I was doing well until I got sick and missed several classes. And then my depression relapsed. So I ended up failing the class. 

I was so done with everything that semester so I told my parents that I wanted to quit and die. So they suggested that I just took some time off. 

So I’m taking a break and at first it was a relief. But then my depression settled in and I didn’t have the passion to do anything. I would just sit and watch tv all day and then my parents would yell at me if I admitted that I hadn’t done anything productive that day. And they would really get angry if they asked me to do something g and I didn’t do it. Like wash the dishes or shovel the deck. But it was like, I knew I would get yelled at if I did it, but I wouldn’t do it anyway. And then I would panic and do it at the last second and finish after they got home. It was a stupid cycle, I know, but it’s like I couldn’t even do that. 

And then anxiety settled in. For a while I just felt thirsty. All the time. And I was worried that I might be diabetic because my dad is and everyone in my dad’s side is diabetic. And then I would have moments where I would feel just icky and I would panic and ask my dad to test my blood sugar levels. And if they were low, I would panic because even though he is diabetic, he never tells me what is a good level to be at. He’s just say: “oh that’s pretty normal” or “you’re a little low”. But when I would look up the levels online, I would find that I would be close to very low most of the time. And then I would try to eat or drink something g with a lot of sugar but it would take a while to get through my system. And I wouldn’t know how much to take. So I wouldn’t over do it. 

So I would like to go in and get tested, but my primary care is back at where I went to college. And now we have the virus going around. And hospitals are probably the first place where you could get it. 

And on top of all of that, my sister is in China at the moment. 

She says she is doing fine but after I checked her location at where she is staying, it’s only about maybe 50 miles away from where the virus started. So I’m trying to stay calm and not worry about it, but now she want to travel to Australia. And I just don’t want her to be around a bunch of people since we don’t know what’s causing it. 

And on top of THAT, my dad and I just got back from traveling to a big city in our state and we just HAPPENED to go to a China buffet. And I don’t know if anyone just happened to be visiting home from China and decided to eat out the night we went there, but who knows?

And my dad has been struggling with his job, been working a lot, traveling, might be coming down with something because he’s always saying how he’s “too warm” and gets sweaty easily. 

And my Mom doesn’t eat a whole lot. 

And my sister doesn’t eat a whole lot as well because she has been diagnosed with celiac disease. And it makes it hard for to eat certain foods without getting a stomach ache. 

So I haven’t been able to tell anyone this because I haven’t been talking with friends for awhile. And because of that I feel like it would be weird to suddenly reach out and dump all of this on them.

The first floor has the sweetest old lady and she's been here forever! love her to death, barely around, sweet as pie, quiet as a mouse. Then... there are the couple on the first floor directly above me. I have never met them. They have a dog. It never barks. BUT... the woman walks like she's trying to stomp out ants with every damn step she takes. I mean. She sounds like the hulk running through a freaking field. I know it's her because I can hear her talking on the phone as she walks (Ghetto talk for days). I can deal with the dog's nails on the hardwood. cause I mean... PUPPY! Squee...

I feel that most women are off limits to me because of my height. I think that a girl would never entertain dating me if she had opportunities to date a taller man. My preferred height on a girl is about 5’3” to 5’4” so I’d likely be taller than the girl I’d be trying to ask out. Does that matter?

43,"So I (F19) moved to another country recently and I'm going to university now. I made some friends in my classes and when we mess around alot.
Where I'm coming from it's totally okay to playfully hit your friend and people do that alot, I do it a lot less than my other friends and I would kinda get mad at them if they were doing it alot.
Now I'm just kinda used to it and I cannot stop it, and I feel like it's a really bad habit in the country I'm living rn. (I live in north America)
Most of my friends are guys and I don't do it with girls around me (and girls usually don't mess with each other).
Once one of my friends was messing with me and kinda making fun of me (in a friendly way tho nothing bad) and I hit his shoulder (upper arm) it wasn't like slapping or anything it was all playful and he was like hey watch it but he wasn't mad at me or anything (he was saying it while laughing)

Or once one of my friends called me bitch ( again not in a bad way we just mess with each other alot) and I tapped his shoulder.
They don't get mad at me but I don't like the feeling I get after this! I feel like I shouldn't be doing this and It's not a good thing to do but I can't stop myself from it. What should I do?
I'm pretty sure they won't feel any pain or anything but I just don't like it. I rather just mess with them verbally than physically but it's out of my control and I'm starting to hate myself for it and getting distance with my friends cuz I don't want to hit them.

Any advice? What should I do?

46,"Last semester I [M20] matched with a girl [F20] I know on Tinder. We’re in the same club and see each other often, and I thought that she might be interested since she matched. We were about to go on break, so I suggested we get together for lunch once we got back. She said yes, but at a party the next night I heard from someone that she had talked to that she didn’t know what to make of it and that she wasn’t interested. 

That was just one person, who evidently also was into her but had been rejected, but over break I realized that I wasn’t in the best place to be dating. I had mostly asked her out because we matched, and while I do like her, it wasn’t a big crush that lead to me asking her out. Since we were both in the same small club too (where apparently it was *not* a thing for people to date, which I think is dumb) I decided to just drop it. She didn’t seem that interested anyway.

I got back to school, and at our first meeting my awkwardness hit and I didn’t talk to her at all, and she noticed. I ended up starting a text convo later so it wouldn’t seem like I was ignoring her. She ended up not responding for 2 days and then saying she forgot to answer. Club meetings have been awkward around her now, which is partially on me, but I’ve been trying to make them not uncomfortable. 

The group also went to a big party recently, and I learned that she made out with some guy there. That itself doesn’t bother me, but it was brought up at our meeting and I turned beet red. I’m just frustrated because I hate this awkwardness, and we never talked about it, but I feel like that would make things worse.

The answer I’m probably going to get is “Just cut her out of your life”, but she’s pretty cool, and obviously I have to be around her a lot. I just don’t know what to do

TL;DR: Matched with a girl I know on Tinder from the club I’m in and asked her out, then I got vibes and heard she wasn’t interested and never followed up. Things are awkward now and I’d still like to be friends with her",27Jan2020,1
47,"Things are getting too much for me right now and I've got no idea what to do.

quick run down of my life, mother has lots of mental health issues as do a lot of people in my family.

parents are separated, when i was younger we lived in a flat together and it was relatively okay, me, my brother, my mum and stepdad. mother had a pretty bad psychosis at one point which was pretty stressful for me as a kid but i put on a brave face.

first year of high school we move to live with grandma and grandmother, big house always someone home. mum has divorce and gets with heroin addict who we move in with, until mother is sick again.

i move in with my dad who finds the responsibility too much and gets abusive, i leave to live with mum (don't see dad for a year but we are on okay terms now and see each other every couple months) in new flat as heroin addict was being violent and am diagnosed with diabetes. she lets the heroin addict live with us again. same thing happens. we move to a place about an hour away new school etc.

minor fights because she continues to let heroin addict into our house and i'm old enough to stand up to her now. she then just leaves to go live abroad, i go and live with family member i'm 14/15 at the time. after  she moves, with no job lined up, and not being able to speak the language (great plan) she gets stressed and very mentally sick again, family member looking after me goes out to see her for a week, week turns into 4 months where i'm left alone. i end up with bad depression and anxiety and am that stressed that i literally forget how to read and write properly. having panic attacks multiple times a day, crying all the time, insomnia. the only reason i wasn't dead is because my gf was there, and she still is now.

she comes home, says i don't know real depression etc and we move into a new place, which is where i am now, i turned 18 at the end of last year.

among other things she is very petty, stubborn and childish when we fight and will often not talk to me for several weeks over it. it has gotten to the point where i literally don't feel anything toward her anymore,  she's abusive and manipulates my family. she doesn't get on with me because i call her out on her manipulation, and have told her to fuck off straight to her face when being unreasonable because nothing else seems to work. I've told her i'm struggling before with many things and she won't believe me. in the end i always have to apologise regardless of who's fault it is, otherwise she makes my life hell.

&amp;#x200B;

recently a family friend has been visiting, we went for food with my auntie (who my mum doesn't speak to) and her family and said family friend. my aunties husband asked if i could sell some stuff on eBay for him, as that's what I've been doing since i was made redundant, and we would split 50/50.

We also went to an escape room with family friend and some other close friends/family. i snapped at mum while in there and said ""if you'f just listen for one f\*cking second"", because i was trying to explain something &amp; she interrupted me 5 times in the same sentence, later on she did the same thing at home and wouldn't let me speak, so i got up and left mid sentence, so i didn't say something stupid. seriously whats the point of me being there if everything i say gets talked over?

today aunties husband said he would drop it off for me, i'd come out to meet him and all that as there was some heavy stuff and i don't drive. i told mum what time he was coming and that he was just dropping stuff outside, so she wouldn't walk the dog and bump into him because she hates him (her reasoning is ridiculous and a situation everyone including her agreed to, about inheritance and my auntie.shes pissed because she blew all the money on Buddha statues and incense while abroad. aunties husband is a lovely guy and loves her kids.) this is how our whats-app conversation went, bearing in mind i asked aunties not to come as it was going to be a war-zone soon and i knew it.

mum: You shouldn't have asked (aunties husband) to come here, make a new arrangement.

me: he was just dropping some stuff for me to sell, i wouldn't be able to get it here on my own. whatever, i'll figure something else out sorry.

mum: Well i don't want him here. you treat me like rubbish and i'm sick of it. this is my house - go find somewhere else to live if you can't modify your behaviour or seek help for your ""problems"".

me: are you serious? I've been doing my best (dishes, dog walking, clean room etc) you can see that? what problems? what are you trying to imply? i said i was sorry i didn't think it would bother you that much.

mum: your anger issues/depression/ADHD

me: i don't have any anger issues, I've been trying for years to get help for my depression and i'm currently waiting on a referral to go through in terms of my possible ADHD. I've been doing my best. I'd like to think my own mother would have supported me through these things.

mum: Doesn't give you the right to speak to me like shite, sorry i'm such an awful mother (lol)

me: I've never spoken to you like shite, unwarranted, is this about the escape room? or me leaving the room? I'm sorry, it stresses me out when you talk over me and don't listen. it stressed me out a lot when you were interrupting in the escape room with 2 other conversations happening at the same time.

mum: both, my friends think you're disgraceful. i am a person too OP with feelings, not just an unsupportive mother.

me: do they? can you ask them to tell me that? (in hindsight that sounds threatening lol, i was calling her bluff not threatening her friends.) i am also a person, not just the child you don't want anymore.

mum: Why should they tell you? You aren't a child anymore, its not that i don't want you, i just don't want those parts you seem unaware of.

me: because i want them to say that to me. if you'll notice a pattern, i usually snap like that or leave because you've interrupted me , mid sentence 3 times in ten seconds. i'm not a child anymore no, but i am your child. i haven't felt like you wanted me for a long time.

and then i sent a big apology because if i didn't she probably wouldn't speak to me for a month.

she treats me like crap all the time. she called me all sorts and tells me i'm a disappointment &amp; disgrace and threatens to kick me out. i do dishes every day, i walk the dog every day, i don't even eat her food 90% the time, i pay my food, toiletries,travel,clothes. 

one second she doesn't believe i have depression, or i'm looking into ADHD for attention. next she's using them as a weapon in argument. i never talk to her like that unless she has done something really not okay, and i have already politely warned her to stop. i am sick to death of her manipulating my family. they are all in debt because of bailing her out, but she's doing just fine. and she's so ignorant, imagine having to explain to someone that saying ""chink"" and ""china-man"" loudly in a restaurant run by a Chinese family, full of Asian students is not okay. but if i ever say anything back to her i'm a disgrace and need to leave. why can she call out bad stuff in retaliation but me calling out her BS is the worst thing ever.

I understand how incredibly unlikely it is that he could be at risk, trust me i do, but should I completely dismiss this, or is there even a small part of me that should stay aware and keep it in mind? 

He had a sinus infection before leaving and still seems to have it so i cannot objectively comment on “symptoms” and i also seem to be a bunged up and snotty, presumably from his sinus infection spreading to me. 

I understand how silly this all sounds but i just wanted some reassurance that i have nothing to worry about at all

63,"I've been doing some (passive) apartment hunting for a few months now and found what I think is the best place yet. It's a nice little condo with a basement, full kitchen, laundry and plenty of room for storage and perhaps a roommate in the future if need be. The basement would be nice for my part time music production gig as well as it would make a nice studio.

It is on the high side of what I look to spend, but still within my budget. I have seen other decent places that are cheaper but no where as nice as this. I plan to call tomorrow and see what is included in the rent.

I guess my question is whether I should go big for what will be my first apartment or if I should be a little more conservative/play it safe.",27Jan2020,1

70,"Hi all!

Essentially I'm a really tall (6""8) guy and just generally looking for some reassurance and advice for how to be confident in myself?

I find that I'm always feeling like everyone is staring and I often get the stereotypical questions about being tall - 'How's the weather', 'Just how tall are you?!' etc which generally really bogs down my self confidence. I think this has an impact on my social skills and I generally dont feel comfortable in conversation in public but still hold a longing to make more friends.

I try and dress as well as I can and always make myself somewhat presentable and I'm known for being very polite and a general nice-guy but I still have a feeling of being a bit of a freak show, walking around my 'regular sized' peers.

I think I'm after some reassurance more than anything and some tips on how I can start helping myself forget about the feeling of being the person everyone points at (whether or not that is actually true or just all in my head!)

72,"Hey, i'm kind of new to this so don't shoot me if i do this incorrectly. Just needed some outside opinions looking in on my current situation to help me understand it better.

So, for context, im 24/f and have a bf 24/m. We don't currently live together and I normally commute to his parents house to sleepover and hangout. I live with my family as well (mom/gmom/aunt/ sister).  My household is where most of the contempt comes from. 

Currently, my mom thinks my bf is isolating me and thinks he will one day go on to abuse and manipulate me like my father did to her. I, personally, don't see those traits in him and have never thought he would be capable of something to that extent. 

We had a fight today and I came back to my mothers, told her about it, and immediately she wanted to know if we broke up and starts talking about how i'm going to heal and grow from the experience. I explained to her that we didn't break up and that we already talked about it and are working on fixing it. She got grumpy and started talking about how she doesn't like him as my bf and thinks it would be better if we just ended it now. 

I understand why she thinks i'm being isolated and why she thinks he is bad in her eyes. He and I really just keep to ourselves and don't have large friend groups outside of one another. We spend most days at his place or going on adventures to new places. She just sees me with him and only him. She doesn't get why he feels uncomfortable with coming to her house, but it's mainly because of how passive aggressive she and my family can be when tensions are high in the house. They think they're being welcoming, but it seriously turns the whole atmosphere in the house cold. 

I don't know how to get them all on the same page :/ I have a sinking feeling that they never will get along and that really breaks my heart, but hopefully we can work through this and find a common ground.",27Jan2020,1
73,"I don't know where to start. Honestly, I thought I would be in a much better stage in life, but here I am working 3 jobs with a college degree in Hospitality that won't get me anywhere. My friends are moving out into their own apartments or with significant others while I'm living at home still since I cannot afford to do so.

I've been working 2-3 jobs since graduating from college since finding a decent job in the hospitality industry is hard. The jobs either can't pay a decent wage or they aren't fulltime even though they are advertised as fulltime.  I thought I got a dream job at a country club, but it turned out to be a complete nightmare and I ended up quitting due to the management.  It's honestly embarrassing at times when you're the only friend that can't afford to do certain things or you're always working or you have no benefits at all because again, the industry sucks. 

I thought about going for a post-baccalaureate degree in education since where I live, they make good money, get decent benefits, and I've always liked the idea of being a teacher. But financial aid won't cover a lot of the costs and once I transfer to a university, the cost will triple. I then thought of getting my master's degree in either Project Management or Organizational Management but then again, those types of degrees don't guarantee anything. 

I've applied for, I don't know, 200 jobs since graduation, 2ish years ago. I get interviews, 2-3 interviews at one company or at least an interview and they last over an hour, the conversation is strong and positive, they compliment my resume and experience and then BAM, no offer at all. Sometimes the person who interviewed me up and quits or gets promoted and everything is put on hold and then I hear nothing even though I reach out.  I don't lie on my resume or cover letter, everything is black and white on there. 

I then thought about ditching my degree and going into a new industry, but it's even harder to start over with no experience. My friends say I should go work at a doctor's office or dental office at the front desk, but all the applications I've seen have 2-3 questions about knowledge and experience in the medical field. I really can't ""fake it til ya make it"" on those. I even went as far as looking into being a cam model... 

I'm so exhausted from working so many jobs and so many hours, I just cannot see the light or any positive outcome in my life right now. A few weeks ago, I passed out at one of my jobs and woke in the ER, probably due to stress and overworking my self.  I don't drink or do any drugs to take any pain away and I try to live a positive life, but when you hate your jobs and everyone is doing much better, it's just so hard to not think about ending it. 

Everyone says I should start my own event planning business since that's what I really want to do, but it's hard starting a business like that. I'm just so sad and upset that I can't go back to school to become a teacher. It's like anything I try to do, a bunch of hurdles comes up and I can't get over them.  It sucks when you've worked so hard to get somewhere in life and then nothing works out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. Is it worth getting a master's degree or should I take a risk and do my own thing and start my event business?",27Jan2020,1
74,"
I feel my heart and my mind are conflicted I’m looking for guidance.

I (22m) feel my girlfriends (24f) goals aren’t realistic short term but I can tell her how to get them long term. How do I go about telling her this.

So there is a lot more to it than the title. I’m in a relationship with a girl from Bulgaria, I’m from England. She goes back to Bulgaria in may and we will split up. She has dreams of what she wants from life and I want to support her. Her dreams don’t involve me and that’s okay the thing is I feel like she is passing up a great opportunity which I want to tell her about but will feel like I’m trying to keep her with me. Now for the record if we do end up staying together I would be happy but I’m not doing this for my self. 

So let me give you context! She wants to go into the film industry but she also wants to live in LA.  She has told me that when she leaves England that she doesn’t want to come back and she is going to apply for internships in LA. 

I think this is a good thing to do. However I feel that she is wasting an opportunity by not staying in England. London is the film capital of Europe and to just rule it out because she doesn’t like the country in my opinion is a bad move especially if she wants a job in the film industry. 

It’s not impossible to get internships in LA and I hope she lands one because that’s her dream! But I feel that she is just banking on that and doesn’t have a back up plan. Because of brexit she is allowed to stay in England and work till 2025 after this I don’t know how the immigration system will work, if it will be as hard to get into this country and work as it is somewhere like America or Australia or it might still be easy. I just don’t know. 

I just don’t want it to get to 5 years from now and she hasn’t landed an internship and she can’t get in the film industry and best place for who to go would have been London but now she can’t go because of brexit. 

I want to tell her she should move to London and try get a job in film there whilst simultaneously applying for internships to LA this way if she doesn’t land one she can work her way up in London and then one day she will probably meet the immigration requirements. 

Please tell me if I sound unreasonable or stupid. I want her to do well in life it’s not me about me. 

I feel like some bias might be at play here on my side as I really like her and don’t want her to go but just thinking about I just feel it’s the best step for her career and dream. 

Thanks for reading and please give me the honest truth! 😊

TL;dr I want to tell my girlfriend I think she’s missing an opportunity but it might be more about what I want.",27Jan2020,1
75,"I would like to think of myself as a patient individual. Most people will never see me truly “angry.” Certainly not to the point of raising my voice at anyone. Yet for some reason, when it comes time to help with homework, My wife and I almost always lose our minds.
Our daughter is in third grade, and homework has really dialed up. She struggles with math, a lot. It was always my best subject, so I have trouble empathizing with her when she doesn’t understand the problems. We have gotten her tutors through school, and have seen some progress, and she’s doing much better with multiplication than she ever did with subtraction. 
   More recently however, she got one of her first book reports, wherein she had to write a summary for her book. A book, that I had not read myself (yet). I tried my best to walk her through what exactly a summary entailed, but she was completely lost. 
Now, I know it isn’t fair to get upset with my poor baby for being ignorant.. but for whatever reason it just makes my blood boil. I don’t scream at her, i’m not a monster, but My patience wears thin very quickly.. 
  I have ALWAYS hated homework. I managed to maintain a c average in school by getting a’s on all of my tests but only actually doing maybe 10% of my homework. I’m sure that doesn’t help the situation, but there has to be more to it than that.

77,"I am making this post on behalf of my friend. She's been having some trouble with some debt that has been attached to her name but isn't hers. 

So back story she rented a flat from a agency with her then boyfriend, she ended up moving out bc she felt unsafe. Immediately after moving out she emailed the agency explaining that she was no longer living there and informed them that she wanted to be removed from the contract. She got a reply to this email saying they had spoke to the landlord and was happy for the tendency to be changed. 

In the same email the agency stated that they will have to renew the tendency with the guarantor and will contact the ex (who was still living there) about signing a new contract and inform him that  there will be a £75 admin charge for the new contract. They then asked her to confirm that she was happy for this to go ahead. She replied staring that she was happy for it to go ahead- this was the last time she contacted the agency and the last time they contacted them. 

Cut to 6 months later, my friend was rejected from a housing application as her previous landlords hadn't gave an adequate reference. She questioned this and was told that the letting agent had said she had not been taken off the contract when requested as the £75 admin was never paid. As a result she is jointly liable for any outstanding debt. She later found out that her ex partner had not paid rent since she left and that there was additional charges due to damage on the property. 

She is obviously upset and annoyed that she was not removed from the contract. As well as been shocked at the debt as she was never informed about it. She has proof that she formally requested to be removed from the contract and that the request was confirmed as she has the email thread. 

I was wondering what can be done here?? 

The landlord told her she was removed from the contract and that another was being signed- at no point did they ask for the £75 from her - she was told the bill would be her ex's. Besides, even if it wasn't, why would the housing agency not follow up? Why wouldn't they at least ask her if she was still wanting to leave and if so tell her she had to pay it? Surly it's there job to do that? And to get new contracts organised and signed? as far as she was aware, she had been removed. 

Additionally, if she was informed about the debt at any point she would have been aware that the contract still had her name on it and as such would have enquired and eventually paid the £75 for it to be removed. Her ex had lived there for 5 months after she left and didn't pay rent at all- if they had told her that rent was owed after the first month she could have got this sorted.  (to this day she has still not had any contact from the landlord or agency about any debt despite it being approx 4 months since the poor reference). 

It just seems so unfair that she has been left with this debt as a result of the housing agency not doing their job. She doesn't know what to do but hasn't contacted the agency that the debt is owed too as she's afraid they'll demand the money (which she does not have). - are these emails enough proof that this debt is not here? What can she do about this whole situation.",27Jan2020,1

She told me when she was initially pregnant but had multiple partners during the time we were together (2-3 is all she admits to). At this time i told her she could move in with me and id support her and the child if said child was mine. Not a day later she blocked me on facebook and my cell number. And i.assumed this meant she figured out one of the other guys was the father as she jumped from being with me to another guy immediately upon our relationship ending. I assumed i was off the hook so to speak, i kept tabs and searched out the guy she was withs facebook upon the kids birth for pictures of the kid when it was born. For the next year i looked now and then and didnt really see a resemblance to myself in the kids face. At that point i let it go and went my separate way.

This last may she messaged me out of the blue and told me about our son. And how he was mine and the guy she was with pressured her to block off contact with me and kept her from it until this point. I went to see them and it was a good two days i spent with them and then i had to go back to work as i lived an hour and a half away, and now i live across the country for work. After this point communication almost stopped completely. I send her money every two weeks and the most contact i get is a message or 5 to 10 days after i message her.

82,"This is my first year of college and I moved into an on campus apartment with 3 other roommates. We’ll call them Viv, Brien, and Ivy (fake names).

First semester starts and I tried to get to know my roommates. Ivy stayed in her room, i didn’t see her for the first month. Brien did the same. Viv and I became friends and agreed it was super awkward that Brien and Ivy didn’t talk to us. 

For the first two months only Viv and I took out the kitchen trash. No one else did, so we stopped. The trash started to overflow and instead of taking it out my roommates would tie the bag and leave it by the door. Eventually 4 bags of trash formed by the door so Viv asked in our groupchat if we could each take one out. Brien said she didn’t use that trash and if we didn’t take it out then she would report us. Ivy said she “didn’t really” use that trash. Total lie. Viv went off on Ivy and it caused a lot of tension. 

Second semester starts and Brien and Viv have moved out. We have a new roommate Nora. I try to talk to Nora and introduce myself, but she just goes into her room. I try to talk to Ivy and get to know her, but my efforts aren’t reciprocated. I decided to give up because apparently its a crime to be friends with your roommates. 

In the first week, the trash got full, so I took it out. Two weeks later, the trash is overflowing. I decide to ignore it since its not my turn. Then my roommates start stacking trash on top of the trash can. When the top can’t be stacked anymore, they put their trash ON THE FLOOR next to the trash can. I was so grossed out i took the trash out and decided to stop using the kitchen trash entirely so I don’t feel obligated to take it out. I also took the trash bags and hid them since clearly my roommates aren’t capable of sharing a trashcan. They got more trash bags, which are too small for the trash can, and now theres food on the inside of the trash can just crusted there. Its disgusting. 

The dish situation is also a mess. I always do my own dishes within a few hours of using them (we dont have a dishwasher). We have a drying rack and I always make sure my dishes aren’t in there for too long. My roommates have been leaving dishes in the sink for a week at a time. They also have gross food in them that hasn’t been rinsed. My roommate left pots and pans in the sink for several days, finally cleaned them, and now they’ve been taking up all the space in the drying rack for a week and a half. I could put them away, but the last time I did that Ivy accused me of stealing her bowl because I put it away in the wrong spot. Ivy also leaves a cookie sheet on the stove 24/7. She never washes it. It has chicken crumbs on it, and I’m vegetarian so that grosses me out. The stove also has chicken crumbs all over it. Someone decided to microwave something (spaghetti I assume) so now the microwave is covered in red sauce that no one has cleaned. Its so bad that anywhere there doesn’t have a red spot, the microwave is orange. 

The one thing that bothers the most is that they constantly turn the AC off. Our thermostat doesn’t go below 74°, and we live in Arizona, where it’s usually 80°. It gets so hot in our apartment without the AC on. I work out in my room, and without the AC on I just feel way too hot. If they’re cold, I don’t get why they can’t put on a sweater or use a blanket. If you’re hot, there’s nothing you can do to cool off. Our rooms dont have ceiling fans. I bought a fan for my room but it still feels so hot to me. We’ve had days where they’ll have the AC off all day, and i turn it back on in the evening and someone immediately turns it off. Im so fed up with them. I have done their dishes, taken out their trash, and cleaned their messes, all while trying to be their friend when they couldn’t care less, and i cant have ONE thing i want. Even with the AC on it doesn’t get cold in my opinion.

83,"I'm 15F and last year my family and I decided to get a kitten because our older cat was getting lonely around the house and was starting to get a little high energy and violent. We thought that having a younger pet in the house would allow him to get more of his energy out and be a bit more calm. It worked out great and they love each other very much. This kitten got comfortable in my room for a couple of days when we first got him, so naturally he's a bit more bonded to me and I to him. 

He eventually got feline leukemia from what I presume to be the days before he was picked up at the shelter. I'm unsure of all of the details but from what my mom says, young cats with that disease are prone to kidney failure or something like that. The other day she says he had a small seizure and he is losing some weight. We're taking him to the vet this week but I doubt the news will be good. Mom says that as he's my cat, I should decide whether to inject him with fluid so he stays alive or put him down if it turns out he has a life threatening problem.

The two had just planned a vacation together and bought tickets, Stuart even bought an engagement ring which he was going to use once on vacation. Now from the beginning Dana and Stuart had a rough time together however they had been working on it and they seemed to be doing awesome. My boyfriend and I see them often, as we have almost a weekly game night together, so we had seen their relationship through the good, bad, and straight up ugly. 

Jason saw even more as he lived with them. He thought they were as happy as ever as they only argued on mundane things, dishes, laundry, pets, etc. My boyfriend, me, Dana, and jason all put together a surprise party for Stuart just last month, so I was very shocked she ended things. Although my issue isnt that she ended it but how she ended it.

Dana has a serving job which allows her to dress however she pleases, even provactovely, although she gains good tips so stuart doesnt mind as long as shes not flirting. Last weekend and yesterday Dana was working but didnt return home until 4am. She had her location turned off on all apps, even the one just for her boyfriend. She was hanging out with a guy she had met a previous weekend. I do not know for sure whether she slept with him or they simply flirted. This plays a role in the break up as she said that him flirting with her made her realize how much she didnt love her boyfriend, Stuart. She didnt warn Stuart at all, she simplt started packing out of the blue,Stuart asked what she was doing and she simply said ""I'm packing my things and moving out because I don't love you anymore"" no other explanation other than mentioning the other guy. This was a complete shock, to her family, to him, their roommate, me and my boyfriend, etc.


I am very hurt and upset and confused. I just want to know if anyone else has done this or had this happen to them or a close friend, any advice on how to talk to my close friend about it or to talk to Dana would help.",27Jan2020,1

I'm not asking for advice on how to hide my true feelings, I need advice on how to channel those i to something else, something that can help me out of my now 3 year rut.

99,"My cousin recently became hospitalized involuntarily on doctor's orders because the doctor believed he would harm himself. When I heard the news, it came as a shock to me and my brother but I knew that my cousin was struggling, however, I also knew he was seeking help in therapy and by taking medication. We visited him the next day and once or twice a week since it happened 3 weeks ago. 

About a week ago, he was finally granted privileges to leave the hospital with supervision to go get a haircut, some fresh air and cure some boredom. I had high hopes that my cousin would leave the ward soon and believed that he would recover. However, while he was out on the privileged leave, he got some pills and tried to overdose. His sister had to drag him back to the hospital and he lost all of his privileges and will probably stay at the ward even longer. 

We are quite close and I had just saw him a week before this all happened during Christmas eve. We grew up together, update each other and regularly hang out maybe once a month. I know my cousin is struggling with a number of things, but I never expected him to go this far. I try my best to offer advice, to let him know that he is loved and cared for and try to guide him in the right direction. 

I think this all happened because he feels hopeless. He recently got dumped from a long term relationship, has thousands in debt, and a toxic home situation because his parents are insane. His career is sort of dead end so I think he finds it unfulfilling and wants to pursue engineering but he is 26, in debt, has a learning disability and I just don't think it's realistic. I want to help him find a career that he can find stability in that isn't as stressful as engineering because he can't deal with stress. 

This is a loaded post, but what should I do? I don't expect him to leave the hospital soon and when he does I'm not sure what to do about his home situation. His parents were spoken to by the doctor and I think they want to see him get better and are getting counselling. There's so many things that make this such a difficult situation and I'm not really in a position where I can do a whole lot but I want to see my cousin live, not kill himself.",27Jan2020,1

101,"I’m still a minor, and am therefore mostly dependent on my parents for vehicles, housing, etc.

I just got a (nearly) minimum wage job working at Jewel, and I was starting to enjoy being able to make my own money. After only two real work days, however, I was T-boned while driving to school, and the car which I was dependent on to get to work was totaled. (It wasn’t my fault.) I had a sibling in the passenger seat, and we’re both quite lucky to be uninjured. 

This has removed my ability to get to work on time on all days except weekends, and it should take at least a few weeks to get a new car. I talked to my boss, and she seemed really disappointed, since the Jewel I work at is already short on staff.

My mom thinks that it’s probably better for me to leave the job until there’s a new car that I can rely on. Should I take her advice?

105,"Hey this is a throwaway I made long ago. The story is that I have had a terminal syndrome my whole life. I have seen what it can do to me and how much it can hurt the people who love me. So I decided on something when I was very young, it's to never date or marry anyone. I understood what my life was and took this decision so as to not bring another soul into an already sinking boat. I was pretty good at it too. If I caught wind there was someone who liked me in my social circle, I would start to slowly move away and to slowly show my more serious side to them so that they eventually lose interest in me. Now I have had crushes in the past and I made sure that it stayed that way and had never interacted with my crush. Well all was going smooth but then something changed. I went through a really big medical procedure and now I am cured of this terminal syndrome. Well you could think ""You should just start dating now that you're cured""... Well thats the whole point of this post. The treatment while it cured my syndrome now, I have taken extremely toxic drugs and been through some things like chemo and radiation. Now the implications have changed from me definitely dying at 30+ to a LOT of maybes. The long term side effects of this treatment are:
1) As the treatment was a transplant, the organ in itself could get rejected at any point in time and I can die. However the longer this doesn't happen, the lower the chances it will happen.
2) All of the drugs that ran through, have increased(Don't know by how much) my chances of getting cancer at an older age. So the longer time passes, the higher the chance I get it.
3) All of the drugs that ran through have also damaged my other organs. As I got older the chances of these organs failing increases.
4) Eventhough the syndrome has been cured, my kids have a chance of getting it, so I am not going to give birth to a kid.

The problem is previously I was able to shutdown this feeling within me using practical thinking and pessimism. Now my heart is starting to falter, it keeps saying ""Well all of these are mere chances, there could be a life where none of these happen and you could lead a happy normal life. If you don't, and this life really does happen, you'll regret not dating your whole life"". And I'm really starting to give in. So I need your advice on this whole dating thing with these implications.

I really like this girl, and I really wanna go for her but I am stuck in this moral dillema.

 I could tell her the whole truth and see what she decides but that means she wouldn't really give me a chance as she doesn't see me beyong my sickness.

 I could date her for a few months, then tell her the whole truth and see how she reacts. This would give her a chance to see me beyond my sickness but this is morally wrong and feels like pushing her into a trap.

Or I could go back to my original life, and just try my best to move on. It will be a bit hard and sad but I know I can do it.

I really am lost in this aspect and don't even know who to ask these questions hence I have turned here. Hope you guys can help. Thanks for coming to the end!",27Jan2020,1

109," Hello, I'm an undergraduate student in top 50\~100 schools of US, and want to apply for a graduate school for CS(Computer Science) or ECE(Electrical and Computer Engineering). I'm senior right now, and major in Mathematics(B.S.)&lt;+Computer Science minor&gt;. I got gpa 3.27, which is the lowest grade in my undergraduate life last semester, and 3.39 as cumulative gpa. To explain my introduction briefly, I was a transfer student from 150\~200 ranking in US after Fall 2018. Before transferring the previous school, my final cumulative gpa was 3.91/4.0. At the time, my major was Computer Science(B.S.). Why I transferred the previous school is I want to get more opportunities such as various undergraduate research, internship programs and so on. I want to study for a field : Artificial Intelligence(AI) for Autonomous Vehicle such as robotics. During one year, I endeavored to find a research lab or internship related what I want to research. In addition, I visited a career center, met some academic advisors in Math department or emailed some professors conducting the research. I cannot get any advice about what I want to do, and research professors replied me that they only accepted undergraduate research student majored ECE or CS in the current school. Accidentally, I was accepted as an undergraduate researcher in a lab : Computational Material for Machine Learning. When I start researching the field, I felt that I am not interested in the field, and it is not idealistic that I want to do research. In this year, I eventually quit the research lab. In this situation, I lose my direction how to prepare for the graduate school. I will graduate math major Fall 2020 or Spring 2021.

**What should I do in this situation?** Isn't there any way to solve this problem to apply for a graduate school? I know I made a wrong direction and misthink that AI are relevant to math field. I have an option to transfer CS or ECE major, but it is too late to transfer it. This is because the majors are really competitive to transfer internally and required the highest gpa around 3.8\~4.0. To be honest, I am really exhausted to find a way. If any questions to know my situation in detail, leave a comment or chat me. I could answer them in detail. Thank you.",27Jan2020,1

I don’t think there has been a month where I haven’t worried about pregnancy, besides the one month where we didn’t have sex. So basically, if we have sex, I’m going to worry, no matter how safe it is. Even if I do everything right my brain finds a problem to worry about for the whole month. 

While I learn my mistakes every month and then avoid making them again, there’s always something new.

129,"I graduate high school on May 22, and turn 18 on June 17. This means I am getting ready to get my own life together. A life that I do not think will be going very well for quite a few years at least.

I've been living on the island of Molokai, Hawaii since June 7, 2008. But this place has the highest unemployment rate in the state, some of highest shipping costs in the state, and virtually nothing to do. Plus, starting in September, the barge is gonna raise rates by 60%, and cut arrivals down from twice a week to only once, just for us. I'd be a fool if I stayed over here.

So I decided I'll be moving back to where I used to live: Kauai. I applied to Kauai Community College to go for a Business Associate in Science degree, and am currently applying for scholarships (I'd need around $20K per year). Besides that, I'd also get a part time job doing whatever they're hiring for that I'm good at. I'd probably be making minimum wage $10.10/hour.

Rent over there for a studio apartment is $950/month at the bare minimum. Who in the world can afford that on minimum wage, especially not working full time?! Rich, greedy real estate moguls make me sick. Plus, I'd need a car to get around, which will set me back a few thousand dollars at least, and that's if I but a used one off of Craigslist. What am I gonna have left over for groceries and toiletries? How am I supposed to save or invest anything?

I feel like in order to actually love a good, secure life, I have to make $100K or $1M a year. If I don't wanna have to wait until I'm in my 30s to be rich like that, I'd have to become a criminal, selling  drugs, being a pimp, doing all kinds of shady deeds. What other choice do I have?!

Not to mention the economic crash all the experts are predicting for this year. That certainly can't be helping matters at all.

To give an example of where I'd love for my life to end up at, my sister's old classmate is 32 this year, and she lives in Kailua, one of the nice and expensive towns in windward Oahu. It's one of the few aces on Oahu I'd actually enjoy living in. But, you have to be a rich 6-7 figure earner to afford life in that town. Lucky little bitch

I don't know man, am I just thinking with a bad mindset here? I'm ready to get my life going, but I'm just super worried that I'll be living a shit life until I'm in 30s and old. What's your suggestion?",27Jan2020,1

Theres dishes that are piled in the sink, they dont clean my microwave when they use it, the stove is super greasy, there are food crumbs basically everywhere, they leave dirty dishes outside of the sink too, they leave food in the pans, leave food in the sink too and it's all a mess. 

Last semester I didnt cook at all but rather ate at the dining hall so I stopped using the kitchen to prove a point of the mess. Later on in the first semester X(21) came on knock on my door to tell me that there are flies everywhere in the kitchen and I proceeded to tell her that I havent been cooking. So she cleaned everything with her friends that she always had over.

So now that it's the second semester, I'd decided that I'm going to start using the kitchen more so I can eat healthier as well as learn to cook since I'm not very good at it. But now everytime I go to the kitchen there is still a huge mess there. I dont think they have learned from what happened last semester. 

I want to tell them that I'm tired of seeing the kitchen in all a mess because I cant cook in a clean environment.  And when I usually do cook or make something I make sure that I clean whatever mess I made as well as washing my own dishes. 

I'm not the confrontational type of person. I get anxiety. And I'm not sure how to tell them because man people are scary. So I'm hoping I can get some advice to help me out and have my environment to be much cleaner. Thank you for reading this far. :)",27Jan2020,1
133,"My wife recently got a job working for Samsung. Her FIRST day at work her supervisor told her that he could hold her phone and bag and stuff while she worked. She works in an ESD sensitive site, so no electronics obviously. Later on that night he sent her a text, and an intimate video popped up being sent from her phone to his. She confronted him about it, and he came out apologizing and saying not tell on him because he’d lose his job. So she told the manager what happened which was he took her phone and sent himself pictures and videos. They went to HR. And HR did nothing. I’m obviously pissed. And she came home crying today.

It's been years since I have had gastro issues ranging from acidity to malabsorption.

137,"I really need some advice in regards to my job. I've been lurking for some time. Throwaway account because of all the personal info. Posted this on another sub but I need more opinions.

I'm in the audio visual industry working on things like conferences and government meetings. At one of my jobs I am considered part time casual. It means that instead of sending me a schedule every week, they message me with job offers whenever they need me and I can choose to accept or decline. Shifts are given out based on level, full time schedule gets filled first. PT regulars go second and then after overtime is filled, PT casual gets whats left. Part of my role is the expectation that I don't require training so they pay me at a higher rate than their part time regular staff. I am currently paid at $20/hr whereas the regulars are paid at $16.50. A specific amount of hours cannot be guaranteed per week.

A very important caveat to my situation is that I have a physical disability. It limits me in the types of shifts I can actually take on. There are a lot of shifts that revolve around heavy lifting. So, I already get less shifts than the average person by default simply because I just can't do the manual labour required.

In general I don't work a lot. Its been very hard for me to get a job in the industry because no one wants to take a chance on me once they know im disabled. I really love this job. Working with these people is a joy.

Recently I asked if I could be moved up to PT regular. Moving up to PT regular would in theory give me more shifts. when switching to PT regular i would be put on a normal weekly schedule instead of getting to accept/decline shifts. Again, no amount of hours a week can be guaranteed a week. In an email my boss wrote ""however we would need to address your rate"". This worries me that he might try to bring my rate down to $16.50. My main concern is the fact that no matter what happens I will always get less shifts than my peers doesn't change. Thats just the nature of the work.

How do I advocate for myself and negotiate to keep my pay? Is there a fair rate to negotiate down to? Is it even financially worth it to switch to PT regular if I have to take a pay cut with no actual guarantee? It feels like such a gamble.",27Jan2020,1
138,"Hi all, I'm hoping to get some perspective on an issue that's been bugging me for a minute.

I live on the second floor of a condo building and have people who live below me.  They like to have parties and host movie nights and play loud, bassy music and loud action movies.  I can feel the bass from the music rumbling in my floors and when they watch movies it's like it's thundering outside.  

I haven't asked them to keep it down a bit as I'm really trying to not be an asshole neighbor.  Lately, however, it's been happening more and more often and much later into the night (sometimes til midnight).  

I try my best to walk very lightly as I know it's annoying to have people stomping around above you when you live on the first floor.  I try not to have loud parties (I've only had one since I moved in three years ago) and I don't have any amplified sound for my tv or radio (usually just wear headphones or use a small bluetooth speaker).  I try to be as respectful as I can.

I haven't lived in a building where this has been an issue in the past so I'm wondering -- how loud is too loud?  It is bothersome when they let their parties last late into the night and when I can hear the words of their podcasts in my living room.  But at the same time, I don't want to create any bad blood.  When would you politely say something?  Where should I draw the line?

Thank you for any help!",27Jan2020,1

142,"A little background information: we’re both seniors at the same highschool, and both 18. This guy has asked me out on multiple dates, all of which I kindly made up an excuse for because I was going through something with this one guy. I started talking to let’s call him Aiden, a little over a week ago (I hit him up) and we have texted back and fourth ever since. No sexual conversations, pretty normal getting to know you things. I have never talked to this guy inrl before, as we had no classes. Long story short on how we met: I was at McDonald’s with 2 of my friends and he was with 2 of his friends as well. Aiden and a friend came up to me and said his friend thought I was cute and left. I got his friends Snapchat, but it didn’t go anywhere and I didn’t have thing for his friend. Then we matched on tinder. 

We made plans to hangout at my house today. 

He comes over, we play videogames. We have pretty good conversation with few awkward pauses. He then suggests we watch something. I put a show on. Within like 2 mins he puts his arm around my shoulder and starts rubbing my arm. We start making out. We eventually move into my room from the game room and lay on my bed. He tried to touch my boobs, touch my ass, and unzip my jacket. I said no and that I’m not that type of girl, and he was respectful and stopped that. We made out/cuddled for around 2 hours and I enjoyed it. He would be rubbing my pack/waist and ask if it was okay, and I said yes. 

We then start talking about relationships/dating partners. He’s had sex with I think it was 3 girls, and he even named them. I only had very few short relationships. We cuddled for most of the time and it felt really good. 

For some reason I feel weird, I don’t know why. I’m sexually attracted to him, but want a relationship and don’t want word to go around about me. Do you guys think he just wants to have sex with me?",27Jan2020,1

Well I think his girlfriend realized that we had a really strong connection...and made him cut me off. He might sound like a horrible friend for listening to her but we both knew it was for the best and it was understandable.

Well they broke up earlier this week. He contacted me after months of not being able to. He apologized for everything, we chatted, resolved everything and Honestly our friendship feels just as easy and fun. Later on he asked me if I wanted to hang out so I said sure and he mentioned wanting  to go to a restaurant so that’s what we’re doing. It’s in a few days and Idk if this would be considered a date or not since it’s just us and we’ve never hung out alone before. We would always hangout with a group.  Is this considered a date even though he asked to “hang out”.

144,"First of all, this is a throwaway account, i dont really want to see this kind of ""negative"" things in my main account. And sorry if this sound rambly, i have many things that have been build up all over the years.

I am currently 22, i'm studying abroad in japan, right now studying at a college specializes in game design. I am at my 3 out of 4 years.

I came to japan in 2015, right after finishing high school. 

There are many reasons why i came to japan, but 2 of the main reasons are :

1. I dont know what to do with my life, and i want some more times to think
2. I was actually accepted to a well known art and design college, but im not ready to go to a college

So, i went to japan and attended a japanese school for 2 years, and in that 2 years, i kinda had my life decided, ""i want to stay in this country. I want to get a job here and maybe even start a family"" is what i think at that time. So after i was recommended to this game design college and was accepted.

Now my problems :

1. I'm extremely lazy. Unless i was told to do something, i will just gonna lay around, spend my days playing video games and watching youtube
2. Everytime i see my friends do something better than me, rather than, getting a motivation to get better (like most of my friends), i instead lost my motivation

I also want to learn digital arts, drawing is something that i really like, and yet i'm too lazy to do it. I am a bit overweight, and have been meaning to go to a gym, lose some weights, again i'm too lazy to do it. I just cant find that motivation. And i dont really want to go home because i dont want to dissappoint my parents and i'm probably cant get a job in my country with a degree in game design.

146,"Hi. I'm (f, 20s) in a situation where I'm living with a family member with a short temperament. I typically act passively around this person so as to not rouse their anger -- and because they're going through a lot.

I find myself in conflict with the questions: how can I call myself a good person if I hold so much resentment? And am I being ""good"" by keeping quiet and not showing anger? What should a ""normal"" person act like in a situation where they're living with an emotionally volatile person?

A friend told me that I could stay at her place and find a new job\\home.

I've been spamming my resume at jobs for the last month and I'm only now starting to get actual interviews. I'm also running out of the money I saved from my last job. When I get back to her place from an out of state interview I think I'll be down to my last $100.

I'm looking at being stuck in the middle of Oklahoma in the middle of winter with no money. I've already checked out r\\vagabond and other subreddits for information but I don't know how to handle it.

I met this guy, a few months ago, at a climbing gym. He works there, and he is a little younger than me. But I immediately have feelings for him. Which I have been trying to cope with and just trying to become friends. 

But anyways, I usually go climbing on Sundays and I am always partnered with him. He belays and I climb. Sometimes I belay him to climb. So whatever. To me he is a very quiet person, but once he talks, he is super nice. Sometimes though we have these awkward silence which it seems he doesn’t really like it because he walks away from me and I wait a few minutes for him to come back so I can climb once more. 

Sometimes I take that as he doesn’t really like being around me. But unfortunately, I have no one else to climb with, so I gotta stick with him for a little bit. 

Today though, there were more girls climbing and obviously he had to help them, so I was like “ok, I’ll just do my thing over here.” I mean that’s his job and I wasn’t going to interfere. 

But I noticed that he was way more friendly with them than me. He would be super talkative, super outgoing and such. 

The worst part though is that he saw me the whole day but he didn’t even care to say hi until at the end of the day, and only because I was walking towards his direction. 

I’m kinda hurt by this, since we climb together every Sunday. And usually he is very quiet and reserved when I am with him. I have to keep the conversation going most of the time.

The first kiss was kind of awkward and I was terrible at it. I freaked out a little after too, but he reassured me it was ok.

When I asked why he was ignoring me he made some excuse about being busy and having friend drama, but said he was not ""done with me"".  A few weeks later I gave him an ultimatum, either tell me bluntly if he is not interested or stop messing me about. He apologised and we talked for about 2 days before he started ignoring me again. 

I don't want to come across as needy or clingy, and I am probably overthinking this but now I'm attached because he was my first kiss.

I go to school four times a week for a couple hours or so, hang out with a small group of friends a few hours a week, work a couple days out of the week on average for a few hours, and basically have nothing else.

I was starting to focus on self-improvement (no porn, working out at home most days, etc.), but a recent acid trip took me in another direction. It seems like writing may be what I want to do in the future, so that is what it seems I should be focusing on right now... although I have few solid ideas for what to write about and little motivation to continue stories past a few thousand words.

I know that my future is kind of in the air right now considering everything, but I simply feel useless not doing anything right now besides going to school and accumulating money for the most part. There are fun times with my friends, but recently I’ve just felt more alone in this world. Anyone have thoughts?

I kept asking him why he wouldn’t kiss me and he said it was because I just sucked his dick and that’s gross. He kept telling me to drink water and saying that he would only do that if it was his girlfriend. Well I definitely didn’t want to lose my virginity without kissing the guy so overall it was just making me feel so worthless, like I just had YOUR dick in my mouth and now your refusing to kiss me? So we stopped hooking up and he took me home. I expected the night to go way different and good but I didn’t then today I later come to find out he unadded me on Snapchat so I can’t contact him at all.

For instance I get really scared of the doctors, dentists, or even barbers because I’m scared they have are someone that’s out to get me. I worry that the doctor will hate me and try to kill me by not helping my problem or give me the wrong medicine. or  report that I need to be in a psych ward and get me sectioned. It’s like that but with a lot of people, meeting new people or trusting new people is extremely difficult cause I worry their out to get me. Not just as in to end my life but also just ruin it or cause pain, mentally or physically. Even with friends, it’s can be hard, especially if I’m in one of my down moods (I tend to go for a couple weeks and my mood dips really low) I will worry that they will do something to get rid of me. There was a time, it was only about 2/3 days but was pretty scary, that I thought one of my closest friends was planning to harm me. I didn’t talk to them until I came to realise that i was being stupid and they would never. Going to seek help is hard because of this, theres other things in my life that I need to go to a doctor about but I’m too scared, when I’m in a higher mood I’m more likely to get help but even then i worry the doctor doesn’t have my interests. 
I also sometimes get worried that there’s cameras or someone following me. Just a feeling that there’s some sort of surveillance on me at all time’s. 
I know this might seem like I’m crazy, it’s something I’m able to hide often, I just come up with excuses or will make other plans to avoid it.   I know that I’m not normal as I have other issues mentally, getting help is something I want but feel like no one actually can.

186,"So here's the long story!

When I was very young, around 3-5 (Actual Details fuzzy, but between '94-'96) a family member took me to a local stage group's performance of ""Singing In The Rain"". During the title song, I was so excited about the rain (inside!!! my tiny brain couldn't believe it lol) and it was my first stage experience that I ran up and danced in front of the stage with the actor - he had such a wonderful smile and he danced along the edge with me and splashed me. It's one of my most favorite songs, woven into my heart because of that experience and it's one of the most 'magical' moments of my childhood. As I got older my Patronus-inducing memories became an endangered species and through concussions, PTSD memory loss and decades of gaslighting, my memory of this and the joy it still brings has remained clear and constant. Now I'm waxing poetic, whoops XD anyways so Gene Kelly's version has always been my go-to song,  it's stopped panic attacks and truly saved my life once because of the actor who made me feel so special, and I like to think he enjoyed my toddler dancing as much as I enjoyed his.

Some backstory details: my childhood is a whole NMotherload of Story that I'm thinking of typing out as a self-led therapy/healing process - I've been unable to go back to therapy for a while and I've gone back to my usual habit of Bottling Everything Up and that is not a 'good enough' coping mechanism for me now. So I've recently begun working myself through my childhood as a way to process my emotions and eventually the trauma and Such but for now going through my most clear but Happy Feelings memories (from childhood to recently, so there's more #awkwardfingerguns), and it's a memory that's been always present and cherished, just more so on my mind than usual. More backstory: I used to work in a daycare (5yrs old and younger), and my own Spawn Thing is just about to turn 3 - many of my perspectives on my childhood have changed as I watch him grow and as I look at the years ahead. My reasons for wanting to reach out are just to thank him for making that such a special moment for me; as the child that I was, and as the mother that I am now.

So......finding the actor and possibly reaching out just to say thank you - I don't even know where to begin to start looking, tbh? Do small theater groups save the playbills and such for shows for that long? And would it be Weird if I did find and maybe send a letter? I have a lot of social anxiety these days, ha, so I feel like reaching out to a literal stranger for a one-time interaction maybe 26 years later is Awkward? But....is it tho??

I'll stop, uhm, word-vomiting here, I guess, because that all sums it up pretty good if a bit long-winded 😅",27Jan2020,1

188,"$900/pw for a house, one flatmate who conveniently organizes the rent has the entire bottom floor of the house to himself.

Three other flatmates share upstairs, we share a kitchen, bathroom, laundry, etc - bottom floor has all these self contained. 

I pay $225p/w, a flatmate with the same sized room pays $230p/w for reasons unknown, and the other flatmates who is an advocate for the downstairs guy turns out in a recent revelation to pay $205p/w - admittedly his room is slightly smaller than mine which is 3x3m, but this pricing has seemed to be chosen arbitrarily or based on how recently we moved in. 

Guy on the bottom floor turns out to pay $240p/w, and while I admit this could be said to be my own fault for not looking into the specifics sooner I realize it seems like a disproportionate amount of rent me and the younger renter pay while one tenant is claiming a whole floor with his own bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, balcony and storeroom for a measly extra $10 for the younger renter or $15 for me. 

So, while its hard to assess because as you guess there's all sorts of little things that would contribute to pricing, me being angry about the current situation may be affecting my judgement, so I'm happy to answer any specific questions about the place to give you more info but my question remains:

Are me and the younger renter being screwed over by the other two flatmates?

Sure, I agree that I play a lot of games, but that’s my hobby, and I am able to balance it very well with school and have very good grades.

197,"My problem might not seem that urgent but let me explain a few things. I go to a nursing school in Kuwait (a muslim and homophobic country) and there's this flamboyant gay guy following my friend and I around. We have no problem with gay guys cuz we're gay too but we keep to oursleves cuz after all what we do in the bedroom is nobody's business. The professors and other students don't care for us that much because we never flaunt our gayness so agressivly. But one day this guy noticed the way I spoke and knew I was gay instantly so he tried to be our friend ever since. 

But recently he's changed his tactic from ""I'll try to spark a conversation once a day"" to ""I'll literally just follow them around and uncomfortably include myself in every conversation""
Our college is tiny and everyone knows everyone there, it's more of a highschool really. So you could imagine how every homophobic student and professor started hating us and calling us names just because we associated with such an aggressively gay individual. And yes in Kuwait it's very much normal to be openly homophobic so y'all can just imagine how we just take it and shut up. 

I know this guy is probably just looking for friends and we tried to give him the hint that we don't want him to be so open anymore. And when I say openly and aggressively gay I mean makeup and slutty clothes and flirting with every guy he sees. But now he's straight up creeping us out. He's always talking about his rich family trying to impress us and how he's so connected to everyone around this college (btw everyone hates his guts so he's obviously lying)

We tried just giving him hints to fuck off but it's not working at all so I'm just guessing now it's time to be rude. 

I don't know guys what do you think I should do with him? 

And I'm sorry if my problem comes off as trivial but as I said Kuwait is very openly homophobic and we've literally gotten deaths threats in school because we're ""faggots"" so please anyone who has any advice please share

202,"This would be the first time reaching out about this subject that I recall, so I haven't carefully planned my approach or what I'm going to say. If anyone needs more information just ask, and I'll be sure to provide.

Some insight:

Currently, I'm a near-full time graveyard server (32 hours weekly) at 17, and soon I plan to move away in June, at 18, to get settled before college two months after. The college in question is about three hours away from where I currently live, so home living is out of the question. As of now, I plan to move with an ex-coworker/friend of mine, despite her struggling finances, but that is a different topic entirely.

Due to my grades, GPA, and dependency from my FAFSA, I have a lot of money for college. If all goes well, college in its entirety should be paid off, with a refund due to the over-awarding of federal grants, by my estimates, anywhere between 3,000-6,000 as immediate as the first pay period of the Fall 2020 term.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I feel really stressed about this whole thing. My future roommate is doing the best she can to increase her funds, moving up in her current job situation and I have little doubt in her endeavor, but I'm more-so worried about my situation. See, I understand the well-known 50-30-20 rule, and other studies as to how much you should put into rent from your paychecks, how much you save, etc.. At my current rate, I'm worried I'll fall short of my future rent costs immediately, and be forced into situations I don't want to be in just to save face (ex. moving home).

At my current job, they allow transfers to other locations, and the town I plan to live in has one of thee locations with plenty openings of my available hours, so I'm not worried about finding the job, rather, working there at the current, if not faster, rate that I am, while also juggling in full time school in order to keep my federal aid on me.

Right now, it seems like such a long time to go until any of that actually comes into effect, but that's five months away. In all honesty, I'm terrified because I've never handled change very well, but I'm doing my best to try and keep all my cards in one place. I will appreciate any and all help I could get from r/Advice, because God I need it.

204,"I am really lost on how to feel right now. I'm 25 years old, active, and thought I would not need to even think about cancer for many years if ever. 

I found a lump on my breast before Christmas. I just thought for my age range and health, this was likely a fatty lump or cyst and didn't want to worry about it too much. I booked a doctor's appointment a week later and they said I could come in January 16th as it was pretty busy. I thought that was fine.

I went to the appointment and told the doctor about the lump but explained I was sure it was just a random lump and downplayed it. She did a small examination and told me that where it was, how it felt and the location of it caused concern. She said on a scale of slight concern to extreme concern, it was moderate concern. She said I had to get tests done right away.

I left the doctors office feeling a bit afraid but after speaking with some friends about it, just felt still it was a fatty lump or cyst and this would show on the tests. 

I went for an ultrasound the following Thursday. The girl that did the ultrasound said it was strange the doctor would request this over the mammogram but did the test anyways. She got some images and said she had to talk to the doctor. She left the room for 5 minutes, came back and said I needed the mammogram. I did this test, again she went to the doctor, then told me the doctor should be calling me within 1-3 days. She said if I didn't hear from her to give a call.

The next morning, I thought I would call the doctors office once they opened to let them know I was stressed and wanted to know everything was okay. The doctors office opened at 9am. By 8:53am, I saw the doctor was calling me. I answered and she said the tests came back suspicious and I need a biopsy as soon as possible. I would be getting a call for the test soon.

I am so stressed out and have no sick time left from work, I am really thinking I should go on stress leave. My job is helping families whose loved ones passed away or have illnesses, and so this triggers the stress of possibly having cancer more than any other job. I don't want to feel I'm being overly dramatic but I also know I'm not eating, sleeping or okay. I know getting a biopsy doesn't mean you have cancer. I'm just so upset as I went in thinking this was nothing to now a test came back suspicious and I'm getting it checked out for cancer.

It feels so one sided on my part as she comes with the same problem over and over, almost everyday, and in varying degree of severity. It’s gotten to a point where I feel so much rage towards her, and it disgusts me that I do. I don’t want this anymore, I feel guilty about stepping back as I vent to her too and she’s in a really unstable place but I can’t do it anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",27Jan2020,1
217,"My fiance and I have been together for a year. My birth control failed sometime in November and I am pregnant. We were happy with it, though it was earlier than I really wanted it to be. I believe in abortion, but simply didn't see that as the option for myself, especially knowing I'd want kids in the future.

When we started dating, I knew from the beginning that he had a daughter from a one-night stand. She is 19 months. I love her to bits, and she seems to love me. It's not easy, but I feel it's worth it.

Well. Today he got a phone call from an ex who said she has a baby boy who is his. She says she didn't contact him earlier because she thought someone else was the father, but the DNA test was negative. So now it has to be him.

We are waiting for his DNA test now. I don't necessarily doubt her (his daughter being the main reason), but he is black and she is white, and this baby has no pigment and I would think he would by now. But if the baby is my fiance's, I don't know what to do.

This baby isn't the result of cheating or anything, but we can just barely afford the family we were expecting. She says she doesn't want anything from him, and she's moving to another state, but I think it's weird she'd go through all this for nothing.

Also, I really, really don't want this baby, too. And I feel terrible about it, but it's the truth. Can I get any sort of feedback? Response? Or better yet, a ""what would you do"" comment? Thank you, I'm really at a loss.",27Jan2020,1

222,"This is a long one with 2 different parts. Also I’m drunk at the moment so bare with me. 
 Okay so basically I have a very good friend who I consider a brother (19m). I am (21m) We have known each other for 8 years. We were the only friends each other had growing up so we formed a very close bond. He knows me better than anyone else in my life and that’s saying a lot because I do not open up to many people. About 9 months ago he got this girlfriend and they fell in love almost immediately. They moved in together etc. I’m of course very happy for him and hope everything works out, because his past girlfriends have been shitty towards him (cheaters). I know people tend to change once they get in a relationship and I understand that completely, but ever since he met her he has completely turned a 180 in his personality towards me. He has been very passive aggressive, hardly ever replies to my texts, never answers my phone calls, when we do talk he doesn’t seem to listen to what I say or just won’t really say much. All the times that we hung out since he got this gf, she has always been there. I don’t mind that too much because I want to get to know her and she seems cool and I can tell she makes him happy, but a little privacy to catch up on shit and reflect would be nice. Being the third wheel gets old too. I also suspect she doesn’t really like me because every time I tell him that I like her, he never tells me that she likes me too. He recently got a job at Walmart which is where I work (different stores) so he was very talkative then but now that the job has kind of settled down he has gone back to ignoring me. Just about every day on my lunch break I give him a call. Sometimes when I get off so that’s twice a day. He never answers. On the rare occasion that he does call me, I always answer. Even if I’m in bed about to fall asleep. If I can’t answer, I make sure I text him sorry I missed his call and explain why I missed it. He never does the same to me, it’s like I never even called. Being ignored by a so called “brother” fucking hurts. 
 
 Part 2 he also met a group of friends in his city who are into the same stuff he’s into which is rare because he is into some very “different” interests. He formed close bonds with them as well and I am happy for that also. To give him some credit, he has invited me to hang out with all of them and I did accept but I did not really like them all that much. Not out of spite, but just found them to seem fake and were kind of opposite of me. They also didn’t really acknowledge me much when I did put myself out there. But they are his friends so I never said any of that to him because it isn’t my place to put my opinion, his happiness is all that matters. Since he met them, his personality really started to flourish and I thought that was so fucking great because he never really showed much personality before them. However, he has complained to me about them about some of the things they say/do before so I found that kinda odd seeing how much time they spend together (hence why I think they’re fake). 
 As for me, I have texted him and he never replies. I don’t expect a reply every single time. I understand life happens. But to go 1 to 2 weeks without even a call back? That’s strange considering the effort I put in. Yesterday was his gf’s bday which just so happen to be the day I text him “why don’t you ever reply back?” To which he replied “sorry man. Today is ____ bday so I’ve been busy with that shit” I replied “tell her I said happy bday” he never replied. I have always been the type to be straightforward and avoid the bullshit but every time I ask what’s up with him he never gives me a direct answer. Being busy with a birthday doesn’t explain why you’ve been ignoring me for the past month. Just a few weeks ago, we made plans to hang out and come that day he completely blew me off. His excuse “I got drunk the night before and slept in till 4pm” but that was only after I asked what happened because he didn’t tell me until I asked. Also later on he told me he woke up at 1pm so there’s a lie right there. My music/hobbies/interest etc are fairly different from his but he never really explored mine despite me exploring his, giving his friends a chance, etc. He never even showed me what music he listened to, I just saw what he was listening to one day and decided to listen to it myself then told him I listened to it and then he started telling me about the music. He got me into some pretty cool bands and shit (music is a big part of him) but he never cared to try any of my music out. He doesn’t seem to give a shit about my interests. Even the stuff I don’t like about him I still give a chance with an open mind and just experience it because I know he’s passionate about it. But he never, ever does the same for me. 
 Anyway, to tie it all up I’m at a standstill. I don’t want to lose my so called “brother” over something stupid but at the same time I want to know why he just acts like I don’t exist. That shit fucking hurts. Obviously I’m going to make my self sound like the victim here and you’re only hearing my side, but I really want some 3rd party advice here.",27Jan2020,1

So I have this oppertunity to go to a studyhall, the thing is they have so many room options. I know I would love to take the solo room by default, but realistically I do want to get along with others so I don't want to go with that. Theres like a range of living with 7 to 1 other person. The thing is I dont know which option I should go with. 

One the one hand, 7 roommates I don't get along with can be stressful, but I also get a greater chance of getting along with one of them.  Maybe I just cohabitate with one person and they arent social at all and it feels akward if I wanted to kinda get along with a roommate... So I feel like in in between might be nice.

I'd have my own room for sure though, its like an apartment style thing, so if I did have a roommate we would have a shared kitchen and bathroom. Just another thing to think about.

232,"So it‘s Sunday morning and everybody’s just staying home today. I’m a 17 year old only child living with my parents in a two bedroom apartment. For as long as I can remember my father has been an asshole. He’s not physically abusive but there’s definitely a screw loose up there. He‘s self-centered, narcissistic, illogical, irrational, gets furious over the most ridiculous things, spends money left and right, and basically is an all-around man-child. Every single hardship my family has ever faced, he is in some capacity responsible for it due to his stupidity and selfishness. My mom has often stated that if we didn’t need him to get by, she would’ve left his ass and taken me with her a long time ago. Unfortunately though, he’s the primary breadwinner, so leaving is not an adequate option. My mom can’t work for health reasons and my part time job doesn’t pay nearly enough for rent. So back to Sunday morning, the day before my father had received a card for his birthday which was last week. The card was from his mother (my grandma) and included a check for $50. Since he‘s too lazy to do anything himself he told my mom to deal with the card and check. So she left it on a chair in the bedroom, but Sunday morning comes and the card and check are nowhere to be found. Me and my mom have gone over the situation in our heads a million times and it’s just disappearing object phenomenon, where something inexplicably goes missing and there doesn’t seem to be any logical explanation for what happened to it. It just slipped from existence. The last place anybody saw it was on that chair. So this situation here is obviously not a big deal. The card doesn’t matter and the missing check can be easily fixed by giving grandma a call and explaining what happened. Simple right? Not for my father. Instead he flips his shit and starts verbally attacking my mom for losing the card. He also tore the damn apartment apart looking for it, cussing to himself the whole time and going around banging things and slamming doors and shit. The worst part is I know for a fact he doesn’t give two shits about the card or the money. He’s just using this situation as an excuse to yell at my mom, which is something he loves to do. So fast forward five hours later and he‘s still screaming bloody murder about the damn card. Now my mom has always made it clear that she can handle him and that she doesn’t want me to get involved because she needs to keep the peace between the two of us. But I just couldn’t take it anymore so I confronted him in an effort to defend my mom. All of this shit over a fucking card? I told him enough was enough and that he needed to shut up about the stupid card. It’s nobody’s fault that it went missing and constantly bitching about it isn’t going to make it magically reappear. Obviously that escalated things even further. All I wanted to do was protect my mom but now asshole father is yelling at me saying that I disrespected him and that I’m a son of a bitch and a worthless piece of shit (yeah he actually said those words). I honestly don’t give a fuck. I stopped seeing him as my dad a long time ago. But the problem is that now he‘s saying that he’s refusing to support us in any way. He doesn’t want to pay rent or help pay for food and the most bullshit thing is that he’s not even leaving. He‘s still going to be living with us even though he wants nothing to do with us. Cause deep down in that tiny brain of his, he knows that he’s too lazy or too stupid to be able to survive out there on his own. Me and my mom literally do everything. All he does is bring home the money and hand some of it to us for bills and other costs. So that’s my situation as it is.

247,"I (18M) am unsure whether or not I want to be in a relationship with a friend of mine (18F)

So as a bit of context I started college last year and I made friends with a girl at a club we both attend last fall. We talked a bit during and after the meeting, and we exchanged numbers before parting. I realized immediately that I was attracted to her because of our similar interests and her funny and ambitious personality. We’ve been hanging out a lot since then, and even now when we don’t have any mutual classes we still make time to hang out at least once a week. 

As I mentioned before, I really admire her ambition and passion for her field of study, which I kind of strive for as well. More recently however, I’ve sort of been questioning my current career path as well as my goals in life, that it feels kind of like I don’t match her in terms of having a particularly strong aspiration I’m pursuing in life. As a result I feel that I don’t have goals of my own that she could push me towards, as I push her towards hers. Also, I still haven’t sorted out my feelings for her. I feel that my attraction to her is as a result of my admiration and respect for her, but would these translate into a romantic relationship with her? I’ve only recently began becoming more intimate with my close friends in general, (in terms of talking about mental health, insecurities, and the state of our current paths in life) and I feel that I’ve gotten more comfortable with hugging and comforting people. I’ve also had to hug and comfort her recently, as a result of a recent loss.

Sorry if my post is kind of all over the place, I wanted to get these thoughts out before I forget them in the morning.

TL:DR: I’ve had feelings for a friend of mine the entire time I’ve known her (for about four months), but I’m not sure if I’m ready to have a relationship with her (or anyone else) because I’m still growing and trying to find my passions/goals in life.

* My truck has had a few issues here and there but at 153k miles, it's been very reliable! I enjoy going camping and going off roading. So I don't NEED a new car.   
* My friends say that the truck suits me better than the car I'm looking into, because I'm really into the outdoors.
* Since I am looking at a used BMW, I am worried about the reliability. But from the rentals I've had, they are very fun to drive. The other thing too is that I can do a lot of work on my own, so I'm not too worried about repair costs.   

But why am I looking for a new car?

* My truck getting up in miles. Definitely a lot of wear on the drivers seat
* I want a cooler looking car   
* Now that I work full time, I rarely have time to go camping/offroading since I sometimes work weekends or want to rest my brain. But if I do get a new car, I'd just give my truck to my parents and use it whenever I go camping/offroading.
* Daily driving this truck SUCKS! At 9 city/15 highway mpg, I do spend quite a lot on gas. The BMW I'm looking at uses Premium fuel, but gets 21 city/31 highway. If I did my math correct, I would save quite a bit of money.   
* I want to reward myself for working so hard through college, working 2 jobs, and getting my full time role before graduating. 

I really want to buy a car. The more immature version of me really WANTS a new-to-me car to look cool in a fast looking car and reward myself, but the more mature version of me says that I should keep driving my truck and just save the money for a down payment on a house or travel or etc, especially since I am more of an outdoors person, and the truck just suits me better... I really don't know what to do, so that's why I'm here asking for advice. It's been bothering me enough to stay up late at night and distract me at work. What do you think I should do?",27Jan2020,1

256,"I'm 20 years old and have never at all feared flying commercially; if anything I enjoyed it and felt at ease, regardless of turbulence and what have you. Sometime this past year I was on a flight with my mother who has always had a fear of flying and I sit next to her when I can to help calm her nerves when she's panicking. During said flight, as we were landing, we were facing a great deal of turbulence and wind, which was all fine. The air stewardess sat by my mother in the aisle to help calm her down, and before you know it lightning hit's one of the engines/the right wing (I was sat next to the window) leaving my mom in tears and the air stewardess turning pale out of fear (she revealed as we landed). Ever since then I've never been the same. I fly multiple times a year and these past few flights have been hell; I can't even go to sleep normally anymore or function properly because I tell myself nothing matters if I'm going to die in a plane crash in a few months. I've never had a fear of flying, it was all fine up until that moment. I'd appreciate any help, as it's been eating me inside recently and have no clue what to do.",27Jan2020,1
257,"first time writing on reddit. Basically I had this friend for around five years. We'd constantly talk about our thoughts on Disney movies for most of those years. Obviously after talking about such a topic for that long it the discussion grew stagnant. So this year I figured that it would be nice to talk about other things.

That's where it all went downhill.

It started out with little things. She'd use dead pronouns for characters in a show, then tell me to stop over-reacting if I informed her that she was using dead pronouns.

Then she'd randomly ask me when I would become bi, even though I'm gay and don't find any interest in men. I told her this, then told her I can't exactly choose to like guys sexually or romantically. And she went to telling me that I could, even though she obviously can't choose to do the same with girls. But I let it go.

It got even worse from there. She'd randomly try to convince me to wear dresses and such even though I told her how much I would rather just **not**. Mock my taste in women every once in a while. Straight-up ignore me if I tried to talk about something other than Disney or what she saw on some show.

The breaking point for me was a few weeks ago. We'll call her friend A for this, we were walking around, then I got a headache. It was bright, loud, and suddenly really enclosed. So I left to the room near it, which was quiet, dark, and devoid of people. I walked off without telling them (my other friend was there, just gonna call her friend b), but it didn't warrant them barging in, turning on the lights and yelling. I got back out to continue talking to them, but it was obvious that I wasn't well. Friend B asked if I wanted to sit down or something, I can't remember. I said no, I was ok. But friend A decided that it was the wrong answer. So she grabbed my wrist, I already get uncomfortable being randomly poked at, but this actually hurt with how tight she was holding it. I asked her to let me go, that it kinda hurt, but she ignored me and instead tried pulling me to go sit down. I really didn't like how much it hurt, so I tried to get her to let go. She wouldn't budge, so I had to pry off her hand. She told me that it hurt, even though I tried getting her hand off my wrist as gently as I could. By then I had enough so I just apologized.

I'm now just trying to ignore her as best as I can before I do something rash. She grew up overly sheltered, and I'm not exactly telling her that what she does is making me uncomfortable, to her face. I don't know.

261,"So a couple of months ago my friend and I started hooking up. Kind of out of the blue. We are in a tight-knit friend group and only the two of us know this and I want to keep it that way. It’s kind of sporadic and usually when he wants to/makes the first move which I think is what is causing these issues.

With my history, I hate feeling like I’m being used or not wanted or only wanted sometimes. This inconsistency hurts deep. When we go out with friends, he’s always talking about this or that girl he’s attracted to, another friend (I don’t know her) he has a crush on but she’s married, talking about a tinder profile, just things that actually sting to me.

Here’s the thing though, I know that I am not into him for a LTR, we are just not compatible in that regard. Besides, last fall he got out of a LTR himself, so I do cut some slack especially since I’m not looking for LTR from him. 

I can’t talk to anyone else about this, so it’s hard to hide when I may be hurt by him or his comments that can often be very insensitive. To the rest of the group, I have no reason to be mad or hurt.

I am freaking out internally but I also don’t want to fuck up their trip. My parents are really like “non-believers”. Just a quick example, we were in Hawaii when there was a false missile alert and although it was a true alarm but was mistakenly sent, they just didn’t. believe. it.  Even after we saw everyone running to the shelters. They were like that’s a bug or sumthin. So they basically think they imune or immortal or some bullsh.

265,"If you go and look at my only other post there is a little more context to this story. After posting that previous post I realized i needed to stop all contact with this other girl. Things got better and then way worse.

I’m sorry but this is going to be a really long post.

I’m going to skip why we broke up because that is not relevant to this post. 

A few days after Christmas I (M17) broke up with my girlfriend (17) of a little over a year and then a few days later the girl from my other post (17) come into my work with her friend to get food. (She doesn’t drive) We talked for a little bit and she said that she would text me later. So understandably I unblocked her on instagram, I blocked her when i decided to cut all contact, so she could text me that night.

I got off work at 9 and this was during the weekend so she asked if i wanted to go over to her house after work and that she was home alone. Well duh I’m going to say yes and that’s exactly what I did. It was her time of the month so we got about as far as you could while that’s going on. So we decided that I would start taking her home from school since she lived close and we would both enjoy the extra time hanging out with each other.

Now it’s important to know that I wanted to continue being friends with my Ex. So we could continue to talk and hangout. Sometimes things would turn sexual and I really think that kept us both VERY invested in each other which is a VERY bad thing.

First day back to school comes around and I take the girl home (From here on out will now be called A). After I took A home my Ex asked if I wanted to run errands with her after she got off dance practice. I agreed and went to her house and waited until 4:30 for her to get home. Schools gets out at 2:40. 

I’m going to over simplify this part of the story since it’s not as relevant to the title.

I doze off and I wake up to my car getting moved. Ex had hit my car with hers and then parked over at her house. Turns out when A and I were walking to my car one of the girls on my Ex’s dance team saw us and must have told her. So I didn’t want to deal with that so I drove away, but she called me crying and begging for me to come back so I did. When I got back she got into my car and started to hit me and freak out, asking me why I would take A home. I stayed quiet and calm the entire time and waited for her to stop. She eventually got out of my car after me asking her for 10-20 minutes and I left. While I was driving home I got a call from her mom asking me why I stole her phone. While Ex was freaking out she dropped her phone under the passenger seat and left without it. I had to go back and when I did Ex got into my backseat and was looking for her phone. She eventually got it and then screamed at me some more while crying. Ex then took a golf club I had in the back and got out of my car. She walked up to a tree and started to beat it. Ex got back into my car and yelled at me some more but then eventually went inside her house and I could leave. 

After this happens Ex harasses A until A is scared to even talk to me. So up until Thursday, January 23rd, I hadn’t spoken to A. So that Thursday I asked A if she wanted to go get coffee after school and talk. And that’s exactly what we did. We talked, I took a few pictures of us and put it on my private story on SnapChat, Ex Gf is not able to see this on her phone. I had work at 4 so I took A home at 3:40 and before she got out of my car we kissed and made out a little. It was the best day I had in a long time and I was genuinely happy again. 

Next day comes around. The faithful day. What this whole post it about. Friday, January 24th. A went home early from school that day so I didn’t get to take her home so I took my friend home who didn’t have his car because he got in trouble a few weeks before. Ex wanted to talk after school so I went to her car after dropping my friend off. She was still at the school parking lot. I got in and she wanted to see my snapchat story. I reminded her that her and I were not together and that she needs to be calm and not be violent. She promises and I show her. Instantly she grabs my hair and starts to pull me back into my seat. She is yelling in my face and saying horrible things. She starts to hit me and punch me and pull my hair. I respond by pushing her off of me. This makes her more mad and she starts to attack me again. I push her off by her neck and she stops for a few seconds. Then she puts her car in reverse and slams on the gas. She’s in the middle of the road in the parking lot and I put the car in park when her foots on the brake. I tell her that she needs to unlock the doors and let me out. 

This is when it gets worse. 

She starts to laugh and cry and scream all at the same time and she puts the car into drive and pulls out of the parking lot. I tell her she needs to let me out and that I want to go to my car. She’s yelling at me telling me I either have to jump out of the car or walk back to the school from her house. The whole ride I’m telling her to bring me back to the school and to my car. When we get onto her road I yell at her to pull over and she finally listens. She attacks me again and I punch her in her arm to get her to stop. She then gets out of the car and runs down the street towards her house. Leaving her phone and keys in the car. I decide to just walk back to the school, but I don’t want her mom calling me asking why I stole her car. Ex is a chronic liar and would 100% tell her mom that. So I thought it would be in my best interest to park her car in front of her house and then walk back. So I drove her car down the street and I saw her on the sidewalk. I pulled the car over and I got out. I started to walk back to the school, but then I told her she needs to drive me back. It was very cold. She takes me back and I get her to calm down at the school parking lot then I leave. 

I was just going to leave it at that. Stop talking to her, and just leave it in the past. I went to work an hour and a half early and I was just sitting in our office waiting for a little bit before I clocked in. That’s when my mom called me and said that Ex’s mom called her and said that I was punching her and that I was wouldn’t let her out of my car. I had to explain to my mom what really happened. My mom said that Ex’s mom had called the school and that she spoke with the resource officer and that Monday, tomorrow, January 27th, I was going to get pulled out of school to speak to him. My Ex lied to her mom about what happened and tried to get me in trouble. She then started to tell people from on her dance team that I attacked her. Luckily my friends are dating some of the other members and they set the story straight and they all said that they didn’t believe her. 

So today, January 26th. I went to the police department and I filed a police report against my Ex. I have 3 choices on what to do next. 
1) Take no further action.
2) Get a PFA (Protection from Abuse) Order
3) Take her to court and try to get her charged with battery and kidnapping.

I don’t want to ruin her whole life and get her convicted as a domestic abuser. I also don’t want to embarrass her. I just want to be able to protect myself from whatever things she’s going to lie and say to other people. I don’t know what to do and I know I have a lot of time to make my decision. I’m family friends with the Judge of our city so I went to talk to him today and he thinks I should get the PFA. My grandpa who used to be the detective in San Diego when I lived there also thinks I should do that. The cop I talked to also said the same thing.

271,"TL;DR: How can I overcome my lack of motivation and fear? I am already seeing a therapist and taking medication.

The question explains the majority of it. My brother has been known to be violent in the past when he doesn't get his way and slightly mentally unsound. I'm afraid of him finding me and hurting me. I also feel guilty about my sister, but I've tri d helping her out so much even before our mother's death with money, textbooks, laptops, homework help, etc. The straw that broke the camel's back was when she got arrested for aggravated assault against her abusive boyfriend. This was after I had already moved her out of that place when she called me screaming and crying about her boyfriend having a knife. I got her in contact with a free therapist, resources for victims, some money, several housing options, etc. She then reconnected with him a week later, lied to me about it, and told the rest of my family I was being overdramatic and then blocked me until she got arrested. 
My step dad thinks I should just reconnect but I just feel done after years of dealing with the craziness. Recently, my brother asked my step dad for my address because my brother had an ""important business letter"" that was sent to him that was for me. My step dad gave him without asking me first about a week and half ago and I still haven't received whatever this letter was. I was so upset because I have nightmares of my brother coming to hurt me and there's no good reason anything important should have been mailed to his address. 
The constant guilt, worry, and fear has made grad school and even menial tasks like brushing my teeth hard to do because I feel paralyzed. I find myself not even putting PJs on or getting underneath the blankets. Half the nights I just sleep right on top of the bed with my clothes still on. 
I am seeing a therapist and am on a couple different medications but every day it seems that I am drained and occasionally I'll have a really good day only to be followed by feeling even more exhausted. I have also joined Habitica a couple months ago to try to motivate me to complete chores, etc. How have other Redditors overcome similar fears or found motivation despite a lack of energy?

I mean he's known me since I was 10 and he's 6 years older then me so I don't know if he could ever even see me as something more then a little sister. Now we are both in our 20's But, there are these times when we have deep conversations about thing I know he doesn't just talk to anyone else about. I feel like I know most of his darkest secrets.

And my villain obsession has carried through my whole life and why do I keep crushing on them? I always see people say villains get fangirls because they think they can fix them. I don't want to fix them I just want them to be complete assholes. And the thing is, I've never had a crush on anyone even mildy rebelious in real life, I think girls who drool over Ted Bundy need serious help (real life killers is wayyyy over the line), and I would ABSOLUTELY NOT want a partner in real life who is in any way shape or form like the villains I like. 

So what is it about Villains that makes me have crushes on them. And sometimes I don't even find an actor attractive until they play a villain. Some I like are
Loki, Draco Malfoy, The Joker, Commodus (who I know goes against my real life person rule but I just like Joaquin Phoenix), Michael Corleone (who I know is the protagonist but he's clearly not a good person. I also like young Vito too), Billy Loomis, Killgrave, Erik Killmonger, Jareth, Damon and Klaus from TVD, Tom Riddle, Mr Blonde, Gary Oldman as Dracula, Barty Crouch Jr, everytime Michael Fassbender is a villain,  and I could literally go on forever.

My favourite are the ones that are really really creepy (the creepier the better) and yet still manage to be charming. And to reiterate, I don't want to fantasize about 'fixing them', I don't want to justify their horrible actions, and all the people I've ever liked in real life have been very sweet and wouldn't harm a fly, and I wouldn't want to date anyone so horrible I just want to observe them from afar in the safety of my own house lol.

284,"My husband and I recently moved back into my childhood home with my parents while house hunting in a new city. 
Just to give some background... Since moving back in October, my next door neighbor died of a tragic accident. We still aren’t quite sure what happened... the day he died, my parents got a phone call from his wife saying she hadn’t heard back from him. My parents went next door to check on him but no one answered but his truck was there. My parents left for a play, and got a phone call during the play from the wife saying she found him dead just past the bottom of the stairs. My parents rushed to be with her, and help her until her family arrived. 
For the past 2 weeks, we have noticed some unsettling things... 
One week night, I got home not too long after dark and my brother’s first question was if I knew if our neighbor was home. I said “yeah, she’s home” not thinking anything of it. He responded with, “ok... cause something weird happened not too long ago, are you sure?” I told him it was weird he asked that because I even thought about how many lights were on in her house when I was pulling in and she never has that many lights on, so she must be home” 
I could tell he was holding something back and thinking hard.... so when I asked him what happened, he said he saw a man in the woods on the side of her house. He was standing behind a big bush that’s right on the tree line. (We live in a culdesac and there’s no fence separating our yards. There’s woods all behind us with no houses) He said that when he was throwing the ball with our dog, he noticed an orange light like the tip of an ecig blinking. The man had a square super dimmed flashlight... not bright at all. My brother shouted, “hey! Hey!” And the man ran to the side of my neighbors house and stood still crouched behind the AC unit with his back against her house. The orange light was still blinking. My brother got freaked out and got the dogs in and locked the door.

Another strange thing happened this week, my neighbor told my dad that she had a friend come check on her house while she was out of town. When her friend went to check on the house, there was a truck in her driveway. When the friend asked the man in the truck who he was, he said she had inquired about getting the house painted and he was walking the perimeter to give a quote. Noone ever told her that would be happening. Keep in mind, it was night and dark when this happened. She thought that was weird, but did inquire about getting her house painted so didn’t think more of it. 

Well, 3 nights ago, my neighbor called my dad saying she thought she saw someone in the woods and asked if he could check it out. My brother, husband and dad went out back and looked but never saw anyone. The next day, my dad went to Home Depot and bought a super bright/long distance flash light because things are getting weird. 

** at this point, we still haven’t told her about what my brother saw because we don’t want to freak her out as a widow who just lost her husband, living in a huge house by herself.

Well, tonight around 11PM, my dog is crying to go out. There’s been coyotes so we have been going out with the dogs every-time we let them out. Well... my husband returned super spooked. He said while he was on the side of the house, he was going to pee (typical guy lol) but out of the corner of his eye, he saw an orange light... when he turned to look in the woods he saw the orange light and then it shut off. He said it looked exactly like what my brother saw. We went back out... and saw nothing.

Our family is starting to get spooked, and we are closer than ever to telling our neighbor about this... she has cameras on every part of her house besides the side this has all happened on all at night. What could the orange light be? Should we tell her and how do we tell her?",27Jan2020,1
285,"I just want to know the best ways to ease the pain and this new found sexual desire I have. 

I identified as asexual and potentially aromantic when I was 14. Never been in a relationship and didn’t really care. Last year I somehow caught feelings for a man I met on a MMO after getting to know him for about a year and a half. After sometime of dating I began to feel this desire for him, beyond just physical pleasure. I still have no idea on how to describe it. A spiritual/sensual/emotional desire to feel/see/experience him? Long distance of course. We never met in person. About half a year of being together he breaks up with me. He had things he needed to fix and I recently(8months after breakup) I got closure for him. The breakup itself was him not talking to ANYONE for a month then telling me it was over so he could fix things. 

I just wanna know how to ease a pain that hasn’t seem to have gotten any easier these last 8months?

How I can stop this desire for physical touch/intimacy?

Should I be having these chest pains? Is that normal?

Note: I do not have any new desire to be in a relationship nor do I care to put dating as something I wanna do in the future. It’s like my mentality of dating has gone back to “normal.” He was the only exception, for whatever reason.",27Jan2020,1
286,"So, I'm 18. As many 18 year olds do feel, I feel like my life has no direction. I'm not sure what I want to do. For years, my parents have been forging me to become a doctor, but honestly I really don't want to. One thing is that the more they push it the less i want to be one. I was always attached to becoming a psychiatrist to study the mind and to help people coping with depression or anxiety, but the more my parents harp on me becoming a doctor (mainly because they think it's the only way to success and they are the only respectable profession) the less I want to do it. I'm just upset. 




Recently more than ever I find myself either completely unable to do anything like homework or anything I enjoy, or in a completely angry and aggressive state. Maybe it just rh pressure of the college admissions process, maybe it's me contemplating on what I want to do with my life. Now, I was never a math kid. Never was and never will be. I'm barely scraping by in calculus right now in senior year and I was scraping by math fit the past e years as well. In terms of science I did get good grades in biology. But I'm struggling and becoming disenfranchised with chemistry. I feel like STEM isn't my thing.


Now, here's the catch. I've always excelled in the humanities department. I was always the star student in my social studies, government and politics, history, and english classes (so much so my english teacher suggested that I pursue english and teaching english or social studies as a career). But, and this is a big BUT, I know they're considered useless degrees (the humanities) and I'm scared I'm only going to scrape by with a humanities degree. A part of me was attracted to either majoring in political science and becoming a professor in it down the road or teaching it in high school (I particularly really liked my euro teacher who seems to command the respect of the building, holding a professorship with the state college and teaching dual enrollment classes at my school with a pretty free reign on how he runs things), but then there is the family dynamic of my parents and family looking down on things like that. 




They see no value in civics, social sciences, or the likes. My aunt is an english teacher, and my family doesn't really respect her for that. They also HATE lawyers. My cousin became one, and they have a negative view of the profession in general. I'm just so unsure of so many things right now, and I feel like I have my head in the clouds. Sometimes I feel like I should just major in computer science and get a decent cs related desk job and live a mundane life. Because if I do anything else I'll fail, or that I should become a doctor, even if I hate it (i know it's going to be impossible to succeed in undergrad and med school if i hate the subject, but idk), but I don't know what to do. I'm stuck, and life seems hopeless. I don't think anyone will read this, although I hope someone will, but any advice? I'm sorry that this is do muddled, I'm just do tired but I can't sleep and I have did many thought whirling through my head that I can't really get everything I want to say down to word format. There is so much I want to say but I'm unsure how to say it. Everything feels so hopeless that I'm unsure how to carry on.",27Jan2020,1

292,"My ex-best friend (f17) is spreading rumors about me saying that I (f17) have a crush on her. The only issue is that I’m not gay. I’ve had 3 people witness her going around saying this and it hurts. There is. nothing wrong with gay people at all, but her saying that about me, especially when we used to be so close, hurts a lot. She and I literally would hang out hours on end and sleepover a lot. 
I think her newest boyfriend has a lot to do with it. There was a day that she and I hung out for a few hours and then I spent the night. He messaged her saying that he was going to break up with her and that she should spend more time with him (even though the previous day they spent 8hours together). Her mom doesn’t like him very much and after that night I didn’t much either. 
Then there was an incident in August and after being there for her for a straight week and getting little to no sleep because of it, things fell off. We would see each other at church and other events, but we didn’t talk very much. That’s really when she started talking about me to everyone in her choir where I luckily have some good friends that have my back. It truly breaks my heart going through this especially when I don’t know what I did wrong. One of my friends wants me to report it to the school for bullying and I’m not sure I want to go that route. I’m not sure exactly what to do and I also don’t want to talk to my mom who works at another school in the district to avoid conflict.

but anyway, when i wasn't in a good mood for a few days so i hadn't been all bubbly like normal he tried to talk to me. he had to step in front of me when i was trying to get through the doors to the commons without anyone noticing me but he came through and blocked me. he asked if i was okay, to which i didnt even realize what he said because i was just out of it.. i kinda looked at him like, huh? he asked again,, i just said ""oh..."" while i couldnt think of a lie and after a bit just said yeah. i immediately regretted how i spoke and didnt act better or just tell the truth. he just looked a little bit sad, maybe confused and said alright... and i sped away of course. i hate to think he might think im upset at him in any way, or that he even had to worry enough in the first place to ask me how i had been, fuck.

i just hate that i get so involved in my own thoughts about what's going on with me and my family that i do this to my friends. i really do care about him a lot even if he doesnt like me back romantically or all that shit. i hate worrying people. i wish i was better at suppressing things but it's so hard to come across happy anymore, its tiring... i havent even been able to bring myself to message him or call him this weekend and im afraid he thinks i dont like him anymore or whatever. im just super mad at myself and i hate that i cant just be normal. something's seriously wrong with me... can i get any advice on how to fix this? it's so awkward and all my fault at that..",27Jan2020,1

Long story short the inmate got life (under appeal/most likely to win) for manslaughter due to drunk driving of one victim deceased 8 years ago (7 years already served).

I avoided contact with inmate until the last two years because they had a relationship when put in custody but we were childhood sweethearts.  He’s been single from that relationship for more than over 4 years. We regularly talk on the phone, visit and write.  

I want to know if marrying a convict (dropped charges vs worst scenario) affects me and what I have built for myself.  I have good credit, and a really good high security clearance career that’s in medical.  I stay to myself and haven’t really seriously dated but in the back of my head I just really want to marry my sweet heart, but if the legality of it hurts my civilian/private party social status etc judgmental BS that happens then I don’t want too and I’ve discussed this with him.

My Dad owns a small computer company and expects me to take it over after he retires. I really want to do that because my whole life I've been raised around computers and technology and I really love it. The only issue is, he says that I have to have a 4 year college degree. I didn't do too well in high school so I'm having to go to a community college to get my grades up before I can get accepted to a university.  I applied for one this year but didn't get accepted because I've failed 3 classes in community college which tanked my GPA. The reason that I've failed isn't because I don't understand the classes it's because I don't really care that much about school. I spend most of my free time programming and learning on my own and I'm pretty good at it. I've actually re-designed my Dad's company's website and have tackled some of the higher level programming projects, but even after that he still says that I have to have a 4-year degree. On top of that I'll have to do at least 1 more year of community college and do well before I can get accepted to a 4 year school. I could end up being 25   and in way over my head in student debt.

And double tapping the left or right side of my phone screen does little to fix the out-of-sync audio, since the video I'm watching will sometimes also buffer for a half-second and put the audio out of sync again.

I have the YouTube app up-to-date, my phone is a Galaxy S9, and I'm using the Aiwa Exos-9 Portable Bluetooth Speaker.

A friend was recently jailed at this facility, and I’m out of state. I’m curious about a few things:

1) Upon booking, do they allow inmates to have their phone so they can have a number for the phone call? Since no one memorizes numbers anymore 
2) How does an inmate know they’ve got money on their books? 
3) How often can they shop commissary?
4) Does an inmate know who sent them the money?
5)  Are inmates usually held until their court date?

307," I'm (F)  bisexual, but more attracted to women. I'm now in my first year of college, but my father found out about a year ago that I'm attracted to women by seeing my texts with a friend discussing a crush I had at the time. He sat me down and had me delete every single text conversation I had on my phone regardless of who and what, and let me know that if my mother, my grandparents, any of my relatives found out, they'd most likely be so distraught that they'd die. That was super cool and all, so I began to rely on university to let me out of my own internalized homophobia that was festering in my family home. But now that I'm in university it's not any easier. I'm openly gay to people here (my family is in the states, I'm in Canada), but my ""freedom"" here makes me feel even more suffocated.

 My family calls often and whenever I speak to them I feel like I'm drowning in guilt. That guilt also comes along in me seeking both friendships and a relationship. What right do I have to subject another human to my fucking mess just because I want some emotional support, opening up to them would be terrible. So, I'm pretty lonely here. I'm really just at a loss as to what I'm supposed to do with all this guilt. It's so much.

 My mother keeps confronting me to ask if I like women because she found out that a few of my friends are gay (and I go to art school so she's scared of that ""influence"" too) , and it makes me feel like a monster. The way she speaks about them makes me feel sick, because she speaks /about/ them with such well intentions and doesn't slander /them/ at all, but is adamant in the fact that they as human beings are Wrong. I've tried to force my liking towards men to take triumph but I know deep down it's never going to happen. My parents deserve a child that they can be proud of, that they feel like they can support. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be that child. And I'd also love some advice as to how to get rid of this black hole of internalized homophobia.

She is sad all the time and super low energy, enough so that it's difficult to get her to do things for fun like going out or painting or even playing games. Difficult conversations are impossible since she instantly cries and shuts down, so talking about this with her has failed several times. 

We are going to be living together next year and I'm starting to get worried, because I can't take care of her all the time. It's genuinely exhausting and it feels like in the friendship she's not ""pulling her weight"" so to speak. I have to help her with every single basic interaction with new people, I have to teach her how to eat right, I have to get her new clothes when she wants them because she doesn't know how to shop for her size, it goes on and on. She's just missing the basic life stuff and the energy to learn it. 

I have also had mental health issues but I was blessed with loving parents and the ability to see a therapist early, so I'm coming into this with a fully-functional toolkit that has helped me and many friends through hard times. I've tried time and time again to get her to do the things she needs to get better (see a therapist, change her meds if they aren't helping, eat well, exercise, get out and do stuff she enjoys, journal, meditate, etc) but she always ALWAYS says it's ""too much effort"" and then just... Doesn't. Refuses to try. 

I don't know what to do. I know she can't control it and if she could, she would probably stop. She's told me she's super unhappy but she's unwilling to make even the slightest effort to do a goddamn thing and try to make it better. I've been patient and I haven't forced her and I've been trying to make everything easier and small, digestible steps.

So I don't want to hurt her and I'm fine to fake it for a few more years but I don't want to live my life hiding. I just don't know what to do and I need some advice on the whole situation.

316,"I recently learned that there’s a word for the things that happened to me when I was a teenager. When I was 15 (which is below the age of consent in my state), I entered a physical relationship with a 19 year old man I met on tumblr. We were together until I was 18, still physically in contact until I was 20. He was emotionally and verbally abusive and would throw things when he was mad.  It is a textbook case of grooming and I recently started following a case of a man who was grooming kids around the same age I was when it happened to me. I’ve made excuses for so long and defended his actions so it’s difficult for me to see it as it really was. I am affected in so many ways every day because of the things he put me through. I’m trying to come to terms with it and I feel silly for being upset over it because before I knew what grooming was I never considered myself a victim of it. I feel like I just have this information and i have no idea what to do with it. Got any advice? How to come to terms with things like that?",27Jan2020,1

321,"I’m 32, work in an office with another girl, 31. We’ve been hooking up on and off for the last year. Nothing serious, no real dates except lunch once or twice. She calls it off a couple months ago. 

Two days ago I get a text from her, she’s four months pregnant, she’s known the whole time, and she intends to keep it. It’s not an issue of not being able to obtain an abortion (were in California), she is saying that she is going to raise it and it will be loved.

She keeps texting me asking to come to her appointments and family planning, asking how I want to be involved. My response is of course why the hell did you wait to tell me this long and what do you expect from me?

Most interesting part; I’ve long suspected myself of being infertile. Never had even one pregnancy scare. I took a SpermCheck test that people use after vasectomies to see if the operation was successful. 

My results indicate that my sperm count is no higher than 250,000/mL. Keep in mind the average sperm count of a fertile male is 40,000,000/mL. I qualify as having severe oligozoospermia but without a further assay I can’t say just how small my count is.

322,"Please read throughout and give advice, I would really appreciate it.

I'm currently 20 years old attending a top Canadian university, but don't feel like I'm particularly enjoying myself as I could be. 

Two years ago when I left highschool I was partying all the time, drinking, getting girls and doing almost literally everything stereotypical of a teenager. Now, the question people ask me is ""oh you should be getting girls left right centre"" and ""oh you're so young you should be partying your brains out"".

When I was in highschool I had a bad experience with alcohol that completely turned me off (whiskey to be specific) and told myself to stop drinking (I have stopped so much that's it's unnoticeable that I even drank at all). To this day I haven't ordered a drink from a restaurant.

My grades in university are looking terrible at the moment (am working hard to improve). Due to this I cannot join a fraternity as they require a certain GPA requirement, it's for the better as I must focus on getting my grades up. I really still would like to be part of a frat.

I'm still single and don't feel as if I got along with the ""getting girls all in university"" type of stuff, it hasn't worked for me at all.

When I'm with my friends I feel so awkward sometimes. Back a couple years ago I could just walk into the room and it'd be poppin', now I feel like I have to 'warm-up' before I have fun and even at that I still don't have fun in the end after a 'warm-up'. Sometimes I do sometimes I don't.

My whole personality has changed to a more conservative somewhat boring individual. It's not even a maybe man I've just straight up gotten more serious and boring and I kind of hate it. If I want to have fun w my friends from the get go I'll have to somewhat fake it and it really is hard to maintain that fake 'fun-ness' for a long time.

325,"I've been dating my current girlfriend for 10 months and I've been very bad boyfriend, I only think of myself, she's been very good and like a mother to me, but I just at some point stopped being interested in our relationship. Her physical flaws really bothered me even though she is very very attractive. What bothered me the most is that she had just a little bit bigger ears when she tied her hair, otherwise she is a 10 in face and 10 in a body and looks like a model. And that little thing annoyed me so much that I couldn't think of anything else when we are hanging out together only looking at her flaw and thinking about it. I would've went to my friends and not hang out with my girlfriend because we couldn't have sex for certain time, I wouldn't talk about our problems, I'm not sure if I have any feelings for her anymore because she broke up with me 3 times but kept coming back because she loves me and I accepted and told her that I loved her and wanted our relationship just because I don't want to risk feeling guilty in the future about some of my decisions. The worst thing I did is when I was out of money and had to go to some party and I wanted to go by myself so I can talk to and hookup with other girls. She had money enough for only one of us and offered to me hoping that I would say let's go together and spend it together, but no, I took it and went by myself there. Never cheated on her but that was my intention in the first place. Now she broke up with me and I don't feel sad, just bad for those things. I'm extremely selfish and protective of my money, I count everything I spend, every little bit, if I spend a little bit more on something I don't have to, I get sad and think about it a lot. If I'm the one that is paying for my friends drink, I count how many times he has paid for mine and calculate in my head if we are even, if we are not I feel extremely sad and like I'm losing money, same goes with my family and money, I'm always calculating something, how much someone has given me so I can give it back in exact equal value.",27Jan2020,1
326,"This is my first post here, and I am struggling with how exactly I should express myself and format this. With that being said, I am looking for advice with regards to my current situation. I am currently a junior in college who is going through what can only be described as a depressive episode. I also struggle with anxiety, and I got help with that past summer. Now my depression seems to be getting worse; I struggle with lethargy and low energy and have a lot of trouble leaving bed in the morning. I'm also very irritable and have an extremely difficult time focusing on anything which is extremely problematic considering I am in upper-level English and philosophy classes. On top of that, I've been procrastinating on my studies which is compounding my feelings of worthlessness. I am also having thoughts of taking my own life, and these thoughts have been increasing as of late. I feel as if all my confidence has been removed from my body and soul. I also feel like one of the worst people on the face of the Earth; like I am subhuman and will never truly relate to or fit in with anybody; like I am fundamentally flawed. A round peg in a square hole. And I feel like and fear that I'm on a trajectory that ends with suicide unless I do something drastic, and receive help.

To the external world, however, I am doing great. I am currently working on my resume so that I can apply to Law school and I should be studying for my LSAT right now. I have a small group of friends and am in a steady relationship. I just was hired to be an RA next year in our dormitories. I feel enormous pressure to maintain these appearances, however, and I am also consciously aware that my mental health issues are holding me back academically and socially. At the same time, I fear that I could be setting myself back by taking a semester off (or some other drastic measure) to receive help for my issues; plus I know most people in my life would not be supportive of this decision at ALL. I would be met with derision and scorn, as most of the people in my life have already voiced their skepticism towards mental health issues. My friends definitely wouldn't understand. And I'm afraid I would be setting myself back career-wise as well.

At the same time, I truly think I am slowly deteriorating mentally and may need intervention to prevent me from going down a dark path. I am feeling more and more inclined towards suicide each and every day, and the thought of no longer being alive is enticing. I feel as if it is a struggle to continue and be functional each and every day. Every day is extremely painful, and I don't think I have done justice to the pain I feel in this block of text. I just want someone to be supportive and tell me that no matter what I decide to do, I'll be okay.

They're very cultured and Intelligent 

they're able to learn all of that and more, and maintain their academic progress just at the same time I've wondered ""how did they get the time to do all of this, and how did they overcome procrastination, where did they acquire such determination?""

329,"So I grew up with a very ""tough shit"" upbringing. When something was out of your control you were free to worry however much you wanted but we understood that there wasn't much to be done. And you dealt with it. Yourself.   
When I am scared of something I use humor to cope. It helps me put my worries into perspective, but apparently this was the wrong move to make with my roommate/friend.   
She gets worked up about anything and everything. She's had emotional breaks over a 2mm burn on her palm, finding a weird seed, and not doing the dishes often enough. After trying to be comforting I usually try to lighten the mood by joking about the situation. Because honestly, I'm not very comfortable with this sort of thing. When I'm uncomfortable, I make jokes.   
Apparently my coping mechanism came off as trivializing her emotions. Even worse, when she ( quite out of nowhere) told me about this, I drew a complete blank. I just looked up from my phone like an idiot and said: ""um... sorry"".   
In my opinion, actions speak louder than words. I'm going to try to make a solid effort to stop doing this because even though I come off as brash I genuinely care about my friend. Any advice on this? Should I make some sort of formal apology or just try my best going forward?   
I also don't really know how to help it, either. Seeing her panic over nothing throws me into a tailspin. When I get worried, I rationalize. I don't know how to rationalize completely irrational reactions other than to be ""haha when you think about it though..""",27Jan2020,1

First of sorry if the title is confusing but english is not my main language so i didnt know how to put it correctly

Anyways onto the story

So I am 17 years old and I am male.When i was a kid i was really fat so i spent  2-3 years going to the gym,This was back when i was 13-15 years old.I would go to gym everyday and i would box everyday as well.I was pretty strong back then as I was and still am really tall,185 cm 80kg and could bench 80kg at my prime.During that time i also got a girlfriend,Life was going great as my health was perfect I was  a great boxer among my friend my grades were good aswell. That all changed when i needed to have a nose operation because i had polyps,doctors said that my case was so bad they have never seen anything so worse,recovery was kinda okay but i didnt box and go to gym until my health was fine.Then after some time i had to take another operation but this time it was insane,the recovery was really something i will remember for the rest of my life. It was so painful. Imagine someone taking something pointy and sharp and stabbing you right in your nostril.During that recovery time i just played league of legends all day everyday and i became really good at it.I mean i was really good back then but this time i was better.I was playing that game almost since the game was made.I started a boosting and coaching page on instagram where i would boost people in game or teach them for money,that page has 1.3k followers now with many many active followers and a lot of people who love me.I earned a lot of money doing this and i really love being able to buy something not so cheap out of my money that i earned. So I am in a weird spot.Should i continue playing league of legends and grow this little business of mine,invest money in it and make something awesome as i came across a lot of good people,or should i go back to training and boxing being really good at throwing punches and being fit.

And couple things just to add.Right now im more fat than i ever were,and no i cant do both at the same time as both require a lot of attention.",27Jan2020,1

348,"I (34F) was in a 2 year relationship that ended 14 years ago. He was 6 years older than me. In many ways I was not a great girlfriend. I loved him intensely but I was immature and in hindsight I was probably really depressed and needed professional help. I won't go into details but I was a complete psycho at times. He had his faults but overall he was a great boyfriend that taught me how I should be treated in a relationship and he tried to make me believe in my potential and bring out the best in me. He eventually broke up with me due to my inability to get my shit together. Whilst this broke my heart at the time, as time went on I realised what I needed to learn and moved on.
Fast forward 14 years,  I now have no romantic feelings towards this person and am married to a wonderful man who I love deeply. We have been married for 12 years.

Ever since I matured up a bit I have really wanted to contact my ex and tell him how sorry I am about being a psycho and all the shit I put him through. I want him to know that I eventually turned out fine and now have a great career, family and life and to thank him for having the faith in me all those years ago.

About a year ago me and my ex have become friends on FB. We have not interacted beyond occasionally liking each other's posts. If it makes a difference at all, I added him a couple of years after we broke up and he declined my friend request. I saw his profile pop up 10 years later and on a whim sent a friend request which was accepted.

Would it be weird if I sent him a PM with a big apology and a thank you for the belief that he had for me back then and to let him know I turned out ok in the end? I have not seen him in person since we broke up but we live in a smallish place with a number of joint friends so may run into each other one day. I don't want to send him something that may make me embarrassed to face him one day. I also feel that this would be rather self serving and he may not actually want anything to do with me.

350,"I don’t really know where to post this so I decided here might be a good place. 

When I was 17, I think I was sexually assaulted. I was visiting my sister for the weekend at her college. She took me to a house party at some drug dealers house. While I was there, I smoked weed for the first time, did a dab (not sure if that’s the right terminology?) and got black out drunk. I am NOT proud of my actions that night but the last thing I need right now is for people to judge me so please don’t. 

There was this guy there who showed no real interest in me until I was blackout drunk. I was a virgin and had made out with 2 guys at this point in my life. I know people do things they normally wouldn’t when drunk but I strongly believe I wouldn’t have voluntarily did what I’m about to say. I barely remember the incident but what I do remember disgusts me. This guy went outside because he was mad about something. His girlfriend (my sisters friend) asked me to go see what was wrong so I did. After that it’s a blur and my memory goes in and out. (WARNING: this next part might be triggering) I can remember he was shoving his penis in my mouth on the side of the house. I remember his friend coming outside and not doing anything. Lastly, I remember my sister screaming at the guy. Apparently I went back into the house and threw up everywhere and then we left. My sister and I have never talked about this incident again. I woke up the next morning and my throat hurt so bad. That day I saw the guy again and he said NOTHING to me and didn’t even look at me. I looked him up recently and learned that he went to jail for awhile because he sold someone LSD and they tried to jump off a parking garage or something like that. 

BTW, the whole night he wasn’t even drinking but he was smoking weed. 

I’m 20 now and I try not to think about it. I feel like I’ve detached myself from the situation. I think I might know what happened was sexual assault but I don’t want to admit it to myself. I have this weird thing that if I admit it and I actually tell people what happened to me then I’ll be ruining his life. I also don’t know what’s considered sexual assault. I don’t get why I have pity for someone who I think took advantage of me and who I don’t even know. I don’t even want to seek legal action because by now I’m sure it’s too late and I doubt anybody will care. Please help me.",27Jan2020,1

Plus I’ve got a sister across the country in high school who I’m paying for her to go to therapy cause we’ve both had pretty shitty childhoods so I want her to have everything that I couldn’t and I just don’t know what to do.

353,"So my relatives left Shanghai on the 19th, a few days before the quarantine. My aunt and uncle are in their 60s, their daughter and son-in-law are in their 30s, and finally there’s a 6-year-old grandson. I left Los Angeles on the 19th. We ate at a couple restaurants in Portugal and saw many other Chinese tourists there.

Yesterday I had a headache (my cousin mentioned she had one too) and this morning I have a sore throat. My family is otherwise symptom-free but my 66-year-old uncle mentioned he was briefly in Wuhan back in December.

Obviously if I suspected I had the coronavirus I would cancel my trip, but maybe I am worried about nothing because it’s just a sore throat and I’m in a country with 0 coronavirus cases. My ticket is non-refundable, plus I already took 2 weeks off from work and my boss expects me back.

356,"31/m, married with baby on the way and a dog.  I work in software from a home office with some travel to train new clients.  I’m good at this work, but I have been doing it for 3 years now and just feel like I haven’t developed any passion or future goals with this career.

I do not want to advance or take on new responsibilities, I do not have any interest in the industry our software is for, and my mental and physical health are definitely the worst they’ve been as an adult.

That said, I’m terrified of doing anything else.  This job pays better than anything else I’ve had, has by far the best benefits I’ve ever seen, and they are small and respectful employers.

I feel torn between money and my soul.  I have to support my growing family financially, but would much rather do almost any other job, if it only paid the same.

358,"Hi, I need some advice.

My boyfriend and I moved in to a budget apartment 6 months ago. When we moved in it was obvious that the apartment had never been cleaned between tenants despite us paying a mandatory cleaning deposit.

This apartment is utterly filthy. The mini blinds are cracking apart and caked with dirt and grime. A window screen is broken, hanging, and a theft and safety hazard as we are on the ground floor. The carpet is matted with dirt, grime, cigarette tar, and cigarette burns.  In many places it is so matted and filthy it cannot be properly vacuumed.

The leasing agent who had us sign the lease knew all of these things, and promised that these things would be fixed immediately  In the 6 months since I reminded them twice, And both times I have been entirely ignored.

I am asking for advice on how to escalate the situation so that my leasing agency is forced to adequately clean this apartment.  I'm tired of having slippers on in my own house full time, because bare feet or socks will turn sticky and black inside half an hour.

The mom pounced on this opportunity to get a lawyer and long story short, we couldn't afford one and she got full custody.

Turns out, we have the the kiddo about 60% of the time. The mom, however, has started randomly canceling our days, and using other babysitters behind our backs, and now she is bitching that he doesn't pay child support (he is still laid off). What resources are available for us to use? I'm afraid any free lawyer will be worth exactly what we pay for...
I've documented the time she spends with us, it's about 60%

She doesn't dress her appropriately for cold weather
She doesn't read her bedtime stories

367,"First some context:

I've always been an anxiety riddled person and I've always been scared of who I really am. I had a speech impediment basically up until the last two years, and I'm only now seeing the real *real* side of life. All the friends who I still consider friends I've made in the least two years and I'm getting to understand what it means to be normal... and I sort of like it. 

I also have an intense perfectionistic competitive drive and a superiority complex and what I can summarize as OCD. It broke me last year and now I'm getting my shit back together. I've realized some of my limitations. One thing that always bothered me was that although I was testing above average (87-92nd percentile,) as a kid it was never enough to beat the truly super talented kids (and trust me I tried so so hard). Living in a competitive area it felt like hell and I always tried to hide myself because of that. I can say I did nothing that made me happy as a kid.

 But kids don't care about that stuff usually and the 'normal' kids who I kind of looked down upon are super happy and successful. Of course the super talented kids are still on their path to greatness, but all I can say is- I don't care. The fact that I wasn't the 99th percentile on those tests just absolutely destroyed me back. Later on that mindset spread to my looks (I'm good looking enough to get a date, but I'm not a model- but I thought I could be... which is why I developed quasi anorexia when I was 16 1/2- I'm also a guy), my height (I'm again above average 75th percentile, but it still didn't feel good enough) and for my whole life my work (I had to beat everyone I met or my ego couldn't take it). Art was probably the one thing that I was developing a talent for, but I killed it because I couldn't get good at it fast enough. I'm decidedly below average at shit I've actually done in life and my happiness and that's probably worse than anything else I mentioned. My iq is only 125 (I'm not gifted), I'm only 5'11.5 (I'm not tall), and I'm probably only as good looking as Benedict Cumberbatch (I do look like him a lil bit). I go to an ivy league college, where all of these things just make me decidedly... average (the actual average iq for an ivy league student is 125 lol). I know I can say that these things don't matter, but I've always wanted to be the best at something and it frustrates me to no end that in some sense I can't be. I want to know how to break my limits and actually make something of myself.

I've always been a pensive person and I think my personality is unique- but so is everyone else's.

I'm sort of making a breakthrough and seeing the complexity of life and what it can be at the ripe old age of 19 . I'm willing to work as hard as possible to break my limits. I can point to the source of my insecurities being that I thought I wasn't strong enough or naturally talented enough to achieve my goals. But life is about sports and doing crazy things. It's about changing and growing and being unpredictable. I can see that maybe I'm not blessed with all I want, but fuck it I'm still going to go for it.  I've stopped making excuses that I'm not smart enough or tall enough or good enough, but that's still the last thing holding me back.

I got a big assignment to submit tomorrow that could change my life and I feel like I'm finally letting go of shit that hampered me my entire life. How do I get my shit together and make a positive change that can get me where I want to go? Based on your impression of me what changes can I make?

I just recovered from a year long (really a two year long depression) and I want to achieve my goals. My goals are to have more choices- the choice to spend money or save it, the choice to go where I want or stay where I want, the choice to chill or go ham.",27Jan2020,1

386,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Im a 20 YO male and I'm living with my mother, my father and my youngest (17 YO) brother. I took a semester off college to tackle serious depression and a lack of coping mechanisms. I think I've actually won in terms of that. I have a completely new determination to return to school and to get my degree. 

But over the past month I have began to suspect that my father is becomming very very ill, and he hasn't told anyone about it, even though we can all hear his coughing in the night.

Allow me to explain first what shape my dad is in, and then I will go into his actions as of late. My father is in his late 40's. He did a crazy amount of drugs (alcohol, pot, cocaine, crack, meth, heroin, perscription opiods) in his teens, 20's and 30's, and has really only wound down in his 40's when he was put on probation. He has smoked excessively ever since he was 13, the man went through 3 packs a day at one point. Now he's somewhere between 1-2, I'm not really sure to be honest. I just know that its a lot. He stopped drinking when he drunkenly crashed a car and broke several several bones, and from that point was on perscription opioids from what feels like forever. He got chicken pox while he was in his 30's I think (everything is a blur to be honest, I think I've repressed a lot of whats happened) and I remember him mentioning something about it spreading to his lungs when he was in the ICU.  Due to his excessive injuries and health complications, he was baiscally always on perscription opioids ever since I was a teen. He was put on probation for some reason when I was 16-ish, and ever since then, he really has been a good good to me. But over the past couple of years, his doctors have cut his perscriptions due to the war on opioids, and from a physical standpoint his health has declined steadily over the past 2.5 years. 

About 3 years ago, you could find a photo of my dad and us, and he'd look like santa claus's thinner jolly redneck brother with a big beard and brown hair. He had a belly, but was in no way too overweight. He was physically active all the time, and seemed quite healthy if you ignored the complications of his car accident. 

Fast forward to now, and the man is almost a skeleton, and it breaks my heart to admit that. He almost completely lost his appetite for food after his perscriptions were cut, and deffinitely does not eat enough food everyday. His pains are so bad sometimes that he can barely get out of bed, let alone walk, and he is increadibly irratable almost all of the time. Medical marijanna has helped a good bit, but it's not enough, nowhere near enough. He's not in great shape.

Now I'm going to talk about what my father's personality is like, and why his actions as of late are beginning to worry me. My father is a very very abrasive kind of guy. The kind of  ""rock out with your c\*ck out"" or ""f\*ck you you don't have to like me cunt"" personality. It's very hard to have a logical argument with the man when its about personal issues or flaws. 

For the past month or two now, he has become very very disconnected from myself ,my brother and mother. I almost never see him during the daytime now, and sometimes he doesn't come home at night until 2 or 3 in the AM. He's beginning to act very errattic and spontainously, things like needless shouting, and singing nonsense, like hes just trying to drown out the pain. When he does come home, he often sleeps on the couch and not alongside my mom. Even then, before this he told me about how his uncle told him once he hit 50, he would want to put a bullet in his head. Or how he'd rather be dead than be in a wheel chair. Things like that, that would show that he recognises his diminishing strength. 

And now, for the past month, he's been coughing a lot, and I mean A LOT, and its only getting worse. Every night I can hear him coughing. Even now when typing this I've heard him have 3 separate coughing fits, only 3 or 4 coughs per, but I can hear how hard he's coughing. It has gotten so bad, and I don't think he has even seen a doctor yet. My mom asked him if he wanted to go see the doctor last weekend and he said he would go do it later, but he never did. I think he's afraid, afraid that if he goes to the doctor that they might tell him he's a dead man. 

Maybe an hour ago I saw him and said ""hey dad hows it goin"" and he replied ""oh you know just dying"" and proceeded to hagh a loogie outside. The worse part is is that I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or crying for help. And I don't think I have the heart to ask him if he's okay, because he'll either tell me no, or I'll think he's lying to me. 

My dad is a really flawed person, and he did a lot of questionable things when I was a kid, but I love him, I really do. And I don't want to know I lost him when some random person calls me and tells me they found him dead in his truck an hour ago. I just need to know how to ask him if everything is okay, and to get the truth.

There is also a language barrier. Whilst my Mandarin is acceptable, I don't believe it's anywhere near a level in which I can properly communicate what I want to say to her.
There is also the Wuhan virus thing going on and they work at a hospital (apparently haven't gone home for like 2 days now) so I'm also thinking it might be at a time where they are under stress and pressure.

I don't know what to do. 

I don't know if I can properly get my message across to them (language barrier), I'm afraid that they will feel betrayed (I kept it a secret for like 3 years) and I don't want them to hate me (I didn't actively try to support them during one of the toughest moments of their life).

My only means of communication with them is through an app called ”WeChat” that I hardly use. 

I'm very troubled and I need advice as to how I should tell them. I already feel guilty for leaving it as a secret for a few years now, and I don't want January to end without me telling them.

I want to straight up tell them everything as honest as I can through multiple voice messages since I can't write Chinese.

I know that by keeping it a secret, I've already damaged our relationship to some capacity.

396,"(This post was made on my phone, sry if it looks weird on pc.) 

Im having alot of trouble with the only 2 friends I have that I feel comfortable enough to talk to right now.

A bit of context : I'm in highschool

 I get nervous alot with any social interaction with anyone and always fumble with my words alot. I get embarassed, think too much about the thing I just did or said, and default to the most generic responses any person could ever give wile hafl of me keeps thinking about that incredibly embarassing thing I just did. 

Then they start drifting of to other more intresting people more and more, and I get scared of losing them and start trying to strike up conversations with them constantly, which then makes me feel like I'm too clingy.

The I start drifting and comming back closer to them because I don't know where yhe boundary is. I'm especially scared of this because both of them have told me about a friend that they don't talk to much anyomre because they find them uncomftable and way too clingy.

 But I don't want to lose the only 2 people I talk to (kinda) regularly. So then, in an attempt to make myself say more intresting things and not overthink everything, I try to not think about what I'm saying at all and just say the first responses I can think of.

 Which is incredibly bad to do, I know, but I couldn't, and still can't, think of what else im supposed to do to to get my nervous wreck if a brain to spit out something intresting enough to keep the both of them talking to me. 

So then, as a result of not thinking before speaking, which I know understand why this is one of the top things my school and my kindergarden used to tell me everytime, I stared saying things that were rude, offensive, or just akward half the time I was speaking. 

Which just makes people not like me, because duh, I was rude, offensive, pretty akward, and made them feel uncomfortable. So then I get incredibly embrassed, uncomftable, and start bashing myself for how fucking horrible I just was, and go back to the start, where I keep on thinking of what I just did, and start giving generic, boring responses. 

Probably, if I was a better person, socialising woild be alot more easier. But I'm not. But I do really want to try to improve, i just really dont know how. Maybe if I was a bit more of a naturally witty or funny person, I could spout out more intresting things to rectify some uncomftable situations. But I'm not that either. 

When I overthink, what I said at the start of this ramble happens, when I dont, i start spouting rude, akward things. I've been trying to find a middle ground but just can't seem to. 

I do sometimes manage to find a foothold in a conversation and manage to get both me and the peeson im talking to talking naturally with a constant flowing stream of dialogue, like what I imagine is supposed to be a normal conversation. 

But again, here's the problem of me being yet again, a pretty shitty person. I have a habit of intrupting people. Especially ones that I start to feel comftable with talking to. I start to not think about what I'm going to say before I say it and just spit out that thought I just got while they're still talikng. I've started catching myself more, but it's still pretty akward when I do that, and they, the alot more better person, let me continue talking. 

How do I catch myself before I interupt. How do other people manage to? God why is talking this hard...

𝗦𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺

At least 80% fo the time it, at least feels like, im the one starting all the conversations. I tried experimenting this a couple times with the both of them and for one of them we would both just be silent for the whole time until one of us, usually me, breaks the silence with a very akward ""so...uh...whatcha wanna talk about..."" or a very generic and 'what your aunts and uncles you haven't seen in a few months would ask' question  "" how's your day been?"" ""How's school been for you?""  or what I now usually respond with, which most of the time gets responeded with the same "" nothing much"", ""anything intresting happened/ happening latley?"".

For the other it would be similar, except the majority of the time they would just go to their other friends who they talk to more regularly or often. I sometimes try to join in the conversation, but I'm mostly just standing awkardly there, or if it's with their SO they are dating right now, it just feels like I'm third wheeling. 

I know to them I'm that other friend they both talk to when they have problems with their actual close friends, but I'm way too much of a nervous wreck to actually make any new friends. I do talk to some of their friends in their freind groups but we never really click.

Neither of these friends have any mutual intrests with me either, except for a couple small ones that we've already talked about everything we can talk about, which is probably part of the problem.

How do I stop overthinking every social interaction with my friends?

How do I keep the conversation intresting enough to keep them talking to me?

How do I know wether I'm being too clingy? (I'm sorry I'm giving barley anything on this but one of them uses reddit and I prefer they not find this post, just give me a couple tips or pointers if you can.)

How do I stop being so nervous all the time?

But any advice on anything else besides these questions are welcome, of course. 

If you read through the whole thing, thanks. I probably could have made it shorter, but I'm not good at explaining either.

We are very happy with our relationship, but one of the people that used to be his friend is not.   She has repeatedly tried to break us up.

She would complain about how he was not talking to her as much since he met me and how that she deserved more attention.  I LITERALLY MADE A SCHEDULE OF WHEN I WOULDN'T TALK TO MY OWN BOYFRIEND SO THAT SHE COULD HAVE HIS FULL UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.  But guess what. It wasn't enough for her. And he would literally talk to his other friends or do homework instead of talking to her.  Eventually I was like no, this is my boyfriend and I'm not gonna give up my time with him for you.  It's been almost 2 months now and shes still stuck in my head.  The things she said about me and my relationship.  I am still losing sleep over this but I don't know why.

So I dated this girl for just over 4 years, and we broke up maybe 4 years ago and ever since I've really struggled with girls. I've had a few one night stands that I just wasn't into, most the time didn't even finish because I just wasn't interested. I've tried tinder, met some really awesome girls, made some friends but my feelings never really developed past that and it got to the point where I gave up because I felt like I was wasting everyone's time. I just have no interest in other girls and now I just feel like I've isolated myself because of it and I'm really tired of feeling lonely and undesirable but at the same time have no interest in dating girls that aren't her.   


Anyone have any advice, or been in a similar situation? Usually I turn to drugs but I'm really trying not to but it just gets worse and worse each day. Dreaming of going to dinner or the movies with her and what not every single night and then waking up feeling awful is driving me crazy.  


 I've tried counselling and I didn't really feel like it helped, just felt like somewhere for me to go and talk about it at a time I really didn't want too which would then just bring it up and make me dwell on it even more without being offered a solution.

402,"* This is my first time on Reddit and probably the last time. I made this account specifically to ask you for advice.  
**I'm having a problem  ""being really lazy"".** I get AT LEAST 1100 euros every month for doing almost nothing. I have my own house and live happily alone. I have friends that I try not to meet because they are always depressed and always trying to drag you down with them. I feel like a lot people on YouTube/Facebook/Instagram are depressed if you think about it.  Happy people don't need to post everyday about their perfect life...  I think hypocrisy is everywhere. I think Liars are called honest and honest are called liars.  

* ***TLDR.  I lost hope in our society.*** This makes me lazy and kinda cruel in my judgement (My head is always saying to me ""there is no salvation for what we've become"").  
I feel guilty for not doing anything to help people but sometimes I think (It's their life choices why would I care).   I've become like a parasite taking much more than I'm giving. Most people thinks that **this is success**. Getting paid for doing almost nothing. However, I wanted to make a difference... I want to give more than take and to make a difference.  

* But I lost hope in us. I don't want to have a heart of stone but I'm struggling. **Do YOU think that there is still hope? Salvation? Redemption after what society(we) did? Or should I continue to relax and take money the easy way because this is not my problem?**",27Jan2020,1

Two months ago my boyfriend came to live in my home and for a little while it all stayed the same. Then one of my cats (the eldest at a whopping 16 years old) suddenly became very afraid of him. Like when my bf is not home he's his usual calm self and then suddenly when he comes home he runs under my dad's desk with his ears down, flattened on the floor and if he tries to go comfort him my cat growls at him and sometimes, if he gets too close, he even hisses. Sometimes he growls at me too, exclusively when my bf is home, the only one he doesn't growl at is my dad. I don't know what changed. I mean, he had behavior problems before, like he used to poop on the floor but we always thought it was because he was old and he like...forgot where he was??? but this is specifically directed towards my bf. The worst part is when he gets super scared he pees wherever he is. He can pee when he's ""escaping"" from my bf leaving a trail of pee leading towards him, or worse, he can be too scared to come out of his hideout and just pee there and be left to soak in his own pee for hours.

409,"Okay, this is a long post, with a lot of backstory. I am a 24yr old (Canadian) solo game developer, with a few published titles, but no real big hits. Recently i've been struggling financially, and to earn some money I started working on a portfolio to show off my work, with hopes of applying and securing a spot in a smaller already established game studio.

Unfortunately, my older brother and I have always had a bad relationship, we never really got along, even when we were kids. This is mainly because he is **extremely** narcissistic, which is '*mostly'* due to our parents and how we were raised. See r/raisedbynarcissists if you don't know what i'm talking about.

5 years ago I introduced him to programming and game development, and would off and on teach him during my time off of school ***(went for video game design).*** After a some time, and when he had a good grasp on the basics, we had a falling out *(like usual)* and I didn't talk or see him until just this year.

My mom recently passed away this June of cancer. When she started getting sick (a year before), me and my wife moved in to help her out. I would take care of the house, my nephew (12 yr old which she had custody of ***\*Sisters kid\****), as well as help out financially. To my brother's credit, when my mom got closer to her death (May), he had randomly popped up, and stayed at the house to give me a hand and take some of the load off. *(First time seeing/talking to each other since 5 years before)*

About a month after she died (July), my dad (*parents separated a few years before*) moved in because he still had half custody of my nephew, and also to help us pack all of her stuff up, and tie up the loose ends. My brother decided to ***'officially'*** move in around this time also. So now it's me, my brother, my wife, and my father all staying at my late mom's house.

When my mom started getting really bad, I had put all my game stuff on hold. Even after her death, I don't think I touched a computer for months. This is the main reason as to why my financial situation is as bad as it is.

Flash forward to November 8th.

Finding a studio I like, and setting my sights on it, I noticed they have mainly released top down pixel art games. Not having any to show off, I decided to create a small demo/game to really show this studio that I would be a 'Perfect fit'.

Now, here's where the problems all started.

My brother had continued his game development journey the entire time we didn't talk *(although didn't progress to much).* A few all-nighter's into my new project, my brother had seen me working on it. Now this project obviously wasn't very far along, nor the best thing I have ever done, but since it was for my portfolio, the little bit I had was well polished, looked nice, and had a few features already done. Upon seeing it, my brother asked the obvious question *""What are you working on?""* to which I gave a brief explanation of what the game idea was, and that it was for my portfolio.

HE WAS HOOKED.

One question led to another, and soon enough i'm explaining every detail, and game mechanic, all the while painting a pretty picture in his head of what this game was all about. In hindsight, this is where I went wrong. Just to give you an idea, the game I was developing was actually very innovative for the genre. As you can probably guess, he wanted in on it. Due to our history, I really wanted this to be another solo project. Also it'd be an impressive portfolio piece that I could flush out into a full fledged game, and I was pretty confident in the idea. So I declined his offer and moved forward with what I was doing. Let the 2 weeks of constant nagging, and begging to work on it begin. Now when I say nagging and begging, I am not joking. As per his idea, our computers are right next to each others, and i'm telling you at least every hour for 2 weeks straight something was mentioned. This led to my downfall, I caved.

Flash forward to last week

It's been about **2 months** since I let him in on my game. I cannot describe the agony, the frustration, the absolute bullshittery that has happened in a mere 2 months. Let me shed at least a little bit of light on what has happened. 10%... A generous estimate of my brothers contribution to the entire project. This includes an inventory system, which is 80% of his work. I can't tell you all of what I did because it would out my game idea. But let me tell you it was A LOT. including all of the art, since he cant draw to save his life. Every time I turn around he is going into my very well commented code (*a comment is plain English written next to the code outlining what it does*), breaking it, freaking out for 30-60 mins about how it's ""programmed wrong"", how ""i'm horrible at game development"", how ""It doesn't make sense"". I could quote him all day. This would conclude by me walking over, taking the script and fixing it within 2 minutes while he watches over my shoulder, criticizes, tells me to write code that wont work (I ignore him), me explaining why things are written how they are (best optimized, common sense) him saying ""Oh your right"", taking the now fixed script, and returning to his desk. Let me remind you, that this is 1 of 1000 hourly/daily reoccurring events.

**I can't take it anymore.** I am so fed up with everything, I don't want to go near him, I don't want to see him, I don't want to work on anything, I don't want to do anything. My motivations are gone, my passion for the project is gone. This is all thanks to him. **IT GETS WORSE.** I take a 2 day break, the first I have had since starting, and he is **FURIOUS**. Constantly bothering me, nagging me, even messaging me on social media. During I am trying to relax with my wife, take my mind off things, and I ended up venting to my wife about it all. She suggests I cut and give my brother his 10% of the work, and do things on my own. I know that this will not fly with him, and try and think of other solutions. Enter my dad.

Since I had been ignoring my brother, and without me to harass, my brother sought to venting to my dad. After my 2 days, my dad, knowing different, tells me all the things that my brother has been saying. Which include: ""I did all the work on this project"", I have a business license"", ""I plan to publish the game under my name"", ""He's such a horrible game developer"", and how ""I taught him everything he knows"". **I. WAS. PISSED.** What I do next, is not satisfying in the slightest, it makes me mad thinking about it, and everyone else mad when they hear it. I tell my brother that i'm done working on the game, to take my work out of his version, and I will take his out of mine. **HE WAS NOT HAVING IT.**   This resulted in a bit of a screaming match, tensions were high, and I didn't want it to get physical. In the end this is what happened. I deleted the entire project, except all the art (Remember he didn't do a single sprite). And he kept everything, but has to replace my art.

This is where the problem is, and where I have no idea what to do. Despite afterwards calling  my art ""trash"" and saying ""Why would I want your garbage art anyways"". My brother took it upon himself to import all of my sprites into essentially ""Photoshop for pixel art"", trace my art, and recolor it, although instead of complex shading like mine, it's 2 tone. He has all my programming, level design, sfx, and my idea. The game was 85% to demo stage when I left it a week ago, and today I found out that he plans on posting a kick starter sometime this week (He told my dad tomorrow) and along side it the demo. Now there is no way this demo is going to be any good, since that 85% wasn't actually compiled into a story line, and no tutorial. Just game mechanics 100% done, and ready to go. I know he is basically useless, and wouldn't be capable of doing it that quickly. I backed up all my original art just now on google drive, for a time stamp, but I have no idea what to do rather than possibly make some youtube videos with all this information in it when he posts the kickstarter. As not to leave you guys on a sad note, I'm also in the process of re-making the game from scratch. Since now I wasted roughly 3 months on a portfolio piece that I can't use. I've spent 2 days on it so far, and have most of the basics done (*Goes quicker if you've done it already*), including an even better inventory system. (**Remember that was 80% of his time**) :P

Around 2ish I went out to grab some things like snacks because my friends are coming over. My friends, **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D**. 

I receive a group text saying **A** and **B** are going to be late and are coming back from the city, **C** is getting upset because she has to leave early and wants to hang out. During this time, I'm not sure where **C** is, but I texted them that they can come over to hang while we wait for them. At this point I'm getting ready to leave the store. I come back to the house, still in the zone, trying to get everything look nice. At this point, I'm not even sure if the vehicle was there when I left to go to the store and when I came back. I just remembered that my neighbor parked in front where the truck originally was. **NOTE:** So this is where things get weird. So my parents always have given my neighbors the keys when they're away on vacation. They're super nice, and my parents are very reserved and would only trust certain people. So my parents gave them the keys so they can move the cars for street cleaning. They've done it for years.

So I assume my neighbors just moved the car somewhere no big deal. Later around at 4 my friend **C** comes over. They park exactly where my parent's vehicle is. Then **A** and **B** uber over to my house. We play some nintendo switch and played some board games. **C** leaves early, then **D** comes over around 8. My brother and **2 other of his friends** come over the night too.  So Sunday comes, my bro asks our neighbor if they moved the car and they said they haven't. Uh oh. The vehicle is gone and I went to report it stolen. Recalling, I knew that the vehicle was officially missing when my friend **C** parked at that spot.

There was no broken glass, and it turns out the spare keys are missing for the cars. It would be impossible to start the car unless you had the key. The placement of the spare keys are pretty visible so anyone who could have entered the house could have possibly seen it. Whats also sketchy was that buckets of rocks were moved when someone pushed the gate open. So there might have been someone that opened the gate  and went through the backdoor to enter the house. I went around talking to my neighbors to see if they saw anything suspicious or if they have any surveillance. My neighbor didn't catch anything suspicious on his property, but he did mention that the **construction workers** did park up the street from where I live.

**Ruling suspects out:**

* My friend's A and B don't know how to drive
* Friend D didn't come over until later
* My SO had work and left early.

**What I gathered so far:**

* From the sounds of it, this sounds like we're the only one being targeted if not any of my neighbors had their vehicles targeted or their house.
* This happened in broad daylight and the construction workers we're there in the morning til noon. 
* Who steals vehicles in broad day light? 
* Someone must have been watching me...?
* Someone inside the house that day must have stolen the keys but I don't think my neighbors did it or my friends or my bros friends..
* Maybe a neighbor stole the keys?
* Maybe the construction workers were scouting my house and stole the keys?
* Would friend C have done it? Where we're they during the scene of the crime?
*  Someone might have entered our backdoor to steal the spare keys

How do you suspect your own friends of doing something, but don't want to accuse them? Should I just wait for the police to call me back for any info? It's making me anxious just not knowing what happened and I feel really terrible that this happened.",27Jan2020,1

I have been dating this girl since about October of 2018. I dated her about two years prior to that too (we broke up, but found our ways back to each other) and I have yet to tell my parents/family. I'm not one to really be open with anyone unless they really open themselves to me, or I dont have to see this person everyday. So, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of telling my parents I'm dating my best friend. I want them to know, I just dont want to have to talk about it all the time with them.

417,"So this is a throwaway account because I don't want people to find out who I actually am. I'm sorry about that. TL;DR included in the end.

The past 20 weeks of my life I have spent in a mental hospital because of several reasons, the main ones being depression and anxiety. I just recently got back and started school again. I'll have to retake the year but until the end of the school year I will go into the same class I have been over the past couple of years. 

Through some friends of mine I have found out that a particular friend of mine, that I considered to be very close, has been spreading rumours and talking about me behind my back for this past 20 weeks, while I was in a mental hospital. Apparently she finds it unfairly then I wasn't in school for half a year and is angry at me that I'm now going to the same class as her and my other classmates. She's also angry that I am in a reintegration program that will help me get into school again and thus don't have as many classes as her.

I knew her for the past for years and I considered her a very close friend, so I don't know why she is talking like that about me behind my back. When I saw her again for the first time in 6 months she didn't say hello to me and for the past week she has been actively avoiding talking with me. In groups she actively avoids looking at me or making eye contact and will not talk to me. Also it is important to note that she is aware of my condition and where I have been over the past 20 weeks. 

I don't know what to do with her now. She was a very important part of my life and I don't know if I should confront her about it or just leave it alone. I honestly don't know how to deal with that and I am asking for advice on what I should do.

A little info because I'll probably be asked...  I'm 29, I was 27 when my dad died.  He was 64.

Lately, however, I have been finding myself struggling again.  Finding myself tearing up in random situations, listening to music which reminds me of him and sometimes forgetting he's gone altogether, thinking to myself ""I'll have to show this song to Dad."" and things like that, only to remind myself I can't anymore.

Basically I'm feeling like the healing which should be happening after my dad passed away is going in reverse.  I'd like to have some advice from people who have dealt with the loss of a loved one.

About 3 years ago i starred talking to a girl, we spoke for about 3 months and it was good but i started to date someone and she got jealous (rightfully so)  so i stopped talking too her. About a year later i started talking too her again this time for about 6 months,  i heard from her friends that she liked me and wanted to date me but i was a dick who got cocky and decided that now I didn't want to date her, i think it was the way we spoke, we were very bitchy but in a funny way where we knew we were joking and i liked that,  how stubborn she was so knowing she liked me just made me act line a dick and i told her i liked her but didn't wanna date as hoped we could be friends but the thing is im a lazy asshole and barely message friends so we feel out of contract again, then about 6 months ago we started speaking again because i am a person that didn't regret things, i mage my decisions and i always love how they turn out (with personal things atleast) but i deeply regretted turning her down and knew i couldn't do that again,  this time after about a month of talking  and multiple years of knowing each other i finally asked her out o  a date with just the two of us, were watched a movie and had a late lunch and spoke,  i was a little awkward but she made it fine and started conversation and we laughed about my nerves, it was good.

The next week i asked again and she told me that she didn't feel like saying atm, and i was fine with that i was willing to wait,  but after that I just couldn't talk too her because I unfairly thought she did it just too get me back,  so we stopped talking again.  Two months later she was dating someone,  but i didn't mind i was fine to wait, the thing is she didn't publicise her relationship at all so i have no way of knowing if she is still dating someone other than asking my friends, see just after i stopped talking too her my friend started dating one of her friends and because of that became friends with her, then my other friends became friends with her and more she is always on their stories cos they do things together so i can't stop seeibg her, I started talking too another girl but i feel unfair to take it anywhere because i am hung up on her,  but have no way too know if she likes me or is even willing too start talking again even if it is as friends.

434,"Hi, I used to have facebook but left and I'm planning on joining again.

I'm a young gay man. One reason I don't want to add any relatives is I'm not really out to most of my extended family (I'm out to my immediate family) because some of them are very religious, especially my granddad. If I did add my immediate family and interact with them my extended family would probably see, and try to add me. Being out to my friends and interacting with them publicly on facebook but not being out to my extended family obviously can't work. 

Another reason I don't want to add relatives on facebook is that naturally you behave differently with friends than relatives. I want to keep these social circles separate. I don't want relatives getting involved in the conversation when I post something directed at my friends. In the past I've tried using facebook's list feature to keep my social circles separate, but if you've ever tried using it for this purpose you would know that it's a hassle. But who knows, maybe it's improved since I left facebook.

I specifically don't want to add my grandma on facebook. Last time I was at my grandparent's place my grandma (not on the same side of the family as the granddad I mentioned earlier) touched my bum (on purpose) in a way that I'm sure was inappropriate. I'm an adult (over 18). She has only touched me inappropriately that one time. This is something I don't want to discuss further here, and I'm not sure to what extent I will keep her in my life (and I'll discuss this with my psychologist) but obviously I don't want to add her on facebook like everything is normal.

So what do you think, does all this sound reasonable? Is it strange to only use facebook to communicate with actual friends and not relatives?",27Jan2020,1
435,"I know, stupid question. The answer is obvious but I guess there must be more to this question if they had to ask reddit. 

 Answer: Really not. But we’ll give you a really long post that’ll hopefully explain it all.

Basically, I’m the baby of the family. The last of four. I am my mother’s hopes and dreams. Not kidding; she named me when she was 16 and had me at 39. The pressure grows. I was a wise child but not particularly obedient. A baby teenager. Letting my mom down #1. I liked the learning part of school, still do, but I procrastinate. Low grades for homework, high grades on tests. It worked out. I’m gonna do a bit of skimming. 
Three family deaths when I was five. Obviously didn’t understand that yet. Saw my uncles dead body laying in a casket. Tried waking him up by shaking his hand. Balled my eyes out at the touch. 
Had to move, left all of my friends. Made new friends. Now going to middle school and all of my new-turned old friends are going to different schools. Yay. Stayed away from making solid friendships until 8th grade (the year before going into high school). Got myself a best friend. After the year was over she moves to Oklahoma. I live in California. 

Here’s where I gotta get a little specific. Freshman year, I meet my two best friends. Sophomore year, I find out that my best friend from 8th grade is having a baby so I help her by being the person she can talk to. The guy wanted nothing to do with it. I’m the godmother of a beautiful baby boy. Junior year, my grandmother passes away(my dads mom). I wasn’t very close to her, but she was very sweet and we shared a birthday. Senior year, my friend has a new boyfriend and now they’re engaged and having a baby. I am the godmother of a beautiful baby girl. My two best friends stop being friends with each other. I tell 1 that I won’t stop being friends with 2 just because she won’t. She gets it. 2 starts ghosting me after graduation. I have 1 best friend who I’m still friends with today. YAY ACTUAL HAPPINESS!! And I’m still the therapist/mom friend for everyone. I like it, it’s a good thing. But starts to feel like mental self-harm if I look back.
My plan was to take a year off before college to collect myself (I had a 3.2 GPA so I was fine). But, I didn’t get that. (My mom had a dream of all of her kids taking 2 years at community college and then going into a 4-year) spoiler alert: nope.
Went straight into college on a downward spiral. And it only gets steeper when in my second semester, my other grandmother dies(moms mom). I was very close to her, and she taught me everything that I love. Piano, art, music. I looked up to her a lot. And...I still haven’t dealt with her death. 
After that I wasn’t good for anything except putting my own thoughts aside to fill my brain with other peoples problems. Cause those are easier to deal with. Long story short, I failed both semesters and I’ve given up. For now. Obviously I have the willpower to continue, but I have patience for myself. I don’t HAVE TO be done with school. My mother does not have patience. 
So I suppose....

TLDR; Been depressed for most of my life, showing every sign except physical self harm. How do I tell my Mom that I’ve decided to go to a therapist instead of school when my education is her first priority. 

P.S. I could tell my dad, no problem. I’m more like him personality-wise so he can understand my point of view a lot better 

P.P.S. I had decided to pay for my own schooling and she got mad at that. The confusion.",27Jan2020,1
436,"My 1-year contract with a certain software ~~house~~ factory didn't end very well.

Basically, after I stated that I won't renew my contract after my term ends in the next 2 months time, the company dropped me a big project, which, no matter how I look at it, just not possible to be done within what's left of my term.

I told the Boss that it was impossible to accomplish the required tasks in two months, but the Boss insisted it could be done, we verbally-argued about it that day and no conclusion was achieved. The Boss keep insisting that the project must be done within my term no matter what.

My request to be given another programmer to help me work on it was rejected, he said that if I want a helping hand, I should get one from my personal connection to work at that place. Why would I be the one to provide a new talent for them? And no, I did not introduce any of my friends to such workplace.

*(Later I tried asking fellows who worked in similar field with me, and they generally asking for 5-8 months of work time and valued the project at more than 14 times of my monthly salary, just to tell you how big that project is from a programmer's perspective.)*

I spent the rest of my term working on the accursed project, cutting down features and code-quality to complete as many tasks as possible to make the project presentable within the resources constraints. *And believe me when I say that during this period, the company actually made me work on another new project which took me a week of the little time that I had, before I could return working on the accursed project*. The supervisor approved my work and presented the result to the client 3 days before my term ends (which I didn't attend btw). And then the client asked for new features to be added to the project, which once again, simply not possible to do due to time constraint. So I simply did whatever I could do before my term ends... and stopped coming after my contract expires.

So yeah... they haven't paid my 2 months worth of paychecks (plus bonuses for previous completed projects). Saying it was because I have *bad manner*, *uncooperative* and *refusing to complete my responsibilities*.

On my defense though, my *bad manner* is simply me pulling my hair due stress thanks to all these BS and the company's stunt of holding my paycheck hostage. Me being *uncooperative* is mostly when I told the Supervisor that a feature is simply not plausible and he keep saying that the Client WANTS that feature... seriously, one of the feature is basically a DROPDOWN LIST OF CITIES on signup form... I mean... last time I checked there are more than 210000 cities out there... so why not just let users fill a textfield instead of giving them a frikken dropdown list? and as my Supervisor says ""But the client wants it to be like that."" and when I asked him hypothetically who's going to input the list, he said ""you of course."", And thus I got labelled as one uncooperative a--hole. regarding for *refusing to complete my responsibilities*... they're telling me continue working, telling me to add new features and stuffs that the client asked, while withholding multiple of my paychecks... promising me they would pay me after the project's completed... well, I don't believe the project would be *complete* even if I finished adding the new features since the client would ask for another new features after that and the nightmarish loop would continue for a while... trust me, I worked there for a whole year, so I just know what the company/Boss will approve the request for new features, thus I stopped coming to the office right after my contract ends.

I reported the company the respective Government Department about my unpaid paycheck. And after waiting for almost two months, today, they're going to help mediate this problem. Though I pretty much facepalmed when The Boss started by saying ""I know Mr X and Mr Y"" before giving his side of story, which I presume would be the names of people on high places in the government, and then the Government official started telling me ""The Boss has given you a chance, right? it's a good one so take it. Complete the job and get your paycheck."" and I keep saying, ""No, give me my unpaid paychecks first, and we can negotiate about everything else after that."" Thus the meeting ended without any conclusion. No... I believe I got effed up back there, for being a pleb with no connection on high places.

So... yeah... I pretty much given up on those paychecks. My new job has pretty much stabilized now, while I still have loans here and there thanks to these unpaid working months, I think I could survive it. Not sure if I could stay put with this bitterness though.

My parent told me to move on and forget about this *""unfortunate things""*, but to be honest I still want to continue pursuing this matter. But people often told me that my thought process were too idealistic and childish. To be honest, I'm at a loss here, I know I'm no longer a kid but I'm not sure I could change this mindset of mine no matter how long. *I simply cannot forgive such unfairness*.

437,"Sorry if this is wordy, I’m not good at explaining things sometimes. 

I feel stupid about all of this but here it goes anyway. I feel lonely quite a bit, and I think a lot of it is my own fault. I think my own doubts and anxieties get in the way of and interfere with how I relate with other people, and I don’t know what to do about it. 

I’ve got adhd, so I’ve always been a little on the hyperactive side, especially around friends. I know I can get annoying sometimes, but it’s not like I can’t read social queues (or someone straight up tells me), and know when to reel it in. Logically I know that people get on each other’s nerves, even friends, and I shouldn’t worry about it too much, especially since everyone moves on from it so quick. But it really gets to me, and I shut down pretty quick and close myself off. 

I got yelled at a lot growing up, which is why it happens. It was normally just me and my mom, and I was pretty well behaved. But she had a lot of stuff going on, so she would take it out on me, sometimes if I asked a question at the wrong time, or said the wrong thing, that kinda stuff. We’ve since talked about it and are working on repairing our own relationship (kinda), but it still affects me in other places. I’ll be afraid to ask people stuff, or share my interests, because I have this fear it’s going to make them angry or think I’m stupid or annoying. Or, like above, if I really do get on someone’s nerves, even mildly, it really freaks me out and I distance myself. 

I don’t share a whole lot about myself with other people. Anyone I’m really close to knows what I’m interested in, but even then, I keep talking about it to a minimum. I don’t really share how I’m feeling a lot of the time. I would really love to share this kind of thing with people, but I’m scared to. I always try to keep myself open for others to share with me, but it just seems kind of weird when it’s only one way. And it gets frustrating when someone really does want to get to know me better, as a friend or more or less or whatever, because when they do ask me stuff, I’m afraid it’ll make them dislike me if I tell them, which is dumb but I can’t stop thinking that way. Then I end up coming across as cold or uninterested. 

I don’t want to be afraid of being myself, and I don’t want peoples negative reactions to affect me as much as they do, but I don’t know how to go about doing that. I thought repairing my relationship with my mom would be a start, but that’s proving kind of... awkward, since she’s got her own stuff still (and there’s drinking involved and I don’t want to deal with any of that). I don’t know who else to talk to since uh, I’m afraid of doing that. All in all I feel pretty alone because of it.",27Jan2020,1

I will probably delete this but I followed her recently on reddit, &amp; I was looking thru her comments cause she had made a post about me so I was seeing if she made anything else or talked about me
    Come to find out it was my father who molested her. Multiple times. I have no one to talk about this I don’t know what to do, i have a 6 month old son and i don’t know if I should even have him around him now. I’m so disgusted with my dad. How could he do that to her. I feel so helpless I just want to give my sister a hug. Reading her post killed me on the inside. 
   I recall one incident specifically where I was in the car with him in the passenger seat and I was showing him something on my thigh it was like a scratch or something but I remember he touched my vagina but I shrugged it off but it has always stuck with me and now I’m just putting two and two together I always thought I was crazy. I just need advice on what I should do, should I talk to my sister?

447,"I (M20) have just been told by my 'Best friend'(M20) that he slept with my ex-girlfriend. 

We'll call my 'best friend': Kal and my Ex: Leah

It happened well over 2 years ago, and I have fully gotten over her since then, so its weird to only now just find this out.

**Background**

&gt;Me and her were together for a while before, maybe 6 months. However I decided to go to uni and she decided not to. By the 6 month mark it was around August, so I was getting ready to go to uni in September. This is roughly when they slept together. They had always been good friends since school, so for them to see each other wasn't anything too out the ordinary.  
&gt;  
&gt;There was a hiccup between me and her with me going to uni, We argued and she possibly confided within Kal because she went round his one evening. That slightly raised  my alarm bells. I was angry, so me and my friend went round to Kal's house and sure enough saw them there. My friend said he glanced them cuddling as he walked by, but I didn't see this, and had already knocked on the door. We argued (I can't remember specifics) but me and my friend left.   
&gt;  
&gt;I was trying to make it work whilst I was at uni, however, I was always putting more effort in than her.   
&gt;  
&gt;I found out she was  and had cheating on me with multiple people around 4 months into me being at uni, I was devastated and it really affected me at the time; complete heartbreak, borderline suicidal, and countless sleepless nights. I was told by her most of  what she did in April 2018, and that was the night I nearly ended it all. But saner heads prevailed.  
&gt;  
&gt;That was the most blissful morning I've ever had. But I received a text in the morning from her (a massively long paragraph). I decided not to read it for months, then one day my phone bricked itself. My friend said that it was fate I never read that text.

I moved on from all of  that, and am extremely happy now, both within myself and with the people around me. 

But Kal told me today that he slept with Leah that night I went round there.  I didn't know how to feel when he told me? Its a wound that has healed fully, so there no damage left for it to take. Why did he tell me this? Because of his now ex-girlfriend, Lucy. Lucy told Kal that she would tell me all his lies about what happened that night. Kal's first sentence to me on the phone was ""I've been caught out, man"". 

My reaction was impeccable, no outbursts, nothing given away. Just questions, why, how, when, etc. I had a feeling he was still lying, and i was right. He then did ""stuff"" with her roughly a week or 2 after they slept with each other. So would assume head.

I don't know how to feel towards it all.

I can forgive him for it, because I forgave her, and that's best way to move on. But what do I do about him now?

450,"4 months ago I was really mentally ill. For various reasons I couldn't tolerate living with my family anymore and moved out after I lost my cool a couple times. I moved out on a bad note. I didn't visit much.

I had a cat for 16 years there. He was too old for me to take to visit and my new place and I barely visited. He was the only thing I've ever loved unconditionally. Always stuck to me. Now in the past week, he's really gone downhill. He isn't the same cat anymore. He went senile and I missed the decline. I just left suddenly.

452,"Hi everyone,

My ex boyfriend (M35) is most likely gay. I was at talking to my therapist about him and i told her that this ex told me once ""Well you must know that i am attracted to your masculine physicality"" (i'm translating from italian). So this offended me a lot and everyone since then has told me it's completely untrue, and they couldn't understand why he would say that. My therapist told me ""he sounds like he might be gay"". Since then I have been thinking about it a lot and there were so many signs! i am shocked it never even crossed my mind. 

The problem is now, how can I approach the topic? obviously i don't want to stick a label on him if he doesn't even know, but i truly think the sooner he starts thinking about it the better.  Also, as an ex, it was very painful to hear a lot of comments he made and thoughts he had, plus he never seemed so interested in my lady parts (but i was insecure and didn't think much of it). I wish to be delicate though, it might not be my place but at the same time if it isn't me, how is he gonna know if he hasn't admit it to himself until now?

453,"He really is going insane. Doing drugs, lashing out on family, threatening to leave, showing signs of mania, likes to self harm. He's in his mid twenties. He did show signs of depression and kinda ""i'm different and nobody understands me"" vibes before this happened in his teens, but i think the main thing thats hurting him now is the guilt.

In general, how do you make a person feel better about loss, especially if the death was directly related to the person?

Here were some things I thought up, I actually have problems processing some emotions as well so I don't judge my thoughts as reliable. 

I was thinking of taking my friend out, going to the dead friends favorite spot, talking about them, visiting their grave, (etc, focusing on doing what the passed away guy would enjoy, ordering his favorite food, etc.) and try getting through to my friend that it wasn't his fault, and that his friend is in a better place now and he wouldn't want this. And he doesn't have to feel responsible for anything and slowly if he lets out his emotions right he'll eventually heal and lead a normal life again.

In all honestly, I'm somebody who doesn't perceive himself as being too interesting, I think that I'm quite boring. I'm a bit of a nerd one it comes to one specific topic and know almost everything that there is to know about this topic, I also know quite a bit about topics that people don't find too interesting (ASDs, and some Psychology), but then when it comes to any topics outside of my interest range, I feel like I know virtually nothing about them and is never able to bring anything to a discussion about them.

Due to myself being an introvert and due to everyone around me having little to no interest in the topics I like, I find it hard to make and keep friends, let alone date.

So i got the mail and it said that the hotel notified us that you didn't checked in the hotel on this date and there were two buttons below that, saying yes i didn't checked in and another one saying, i checked in.

461,"I've always been ""the smart one"" in my family. I took school really seriously (and still do,) and had super big plans for college and my life after high school. But within the last few years, the picture of my future has kind of just fallen apart. I'm a senior in high school with no idea what I want to do or where I want to go to college (or if I even want to.) I have no clue where I'm going to be or what I'll be doing at the end of the year.

The biggest issue isn't even that I'm not sure. Of course, it's terrifying, but the expectation of who I'm supposed to be is the worst part. My family acts like it's the end of the world that I haven't decided on a college or major yet, and they expect so much from me. I don't know how to tell them that nothing about college is even remotely appealing to me anymore. If anything, it's more upsetting to think about.

It feels like the ""deadlines"" for my decisions are coming up so fast. But I don't know if I even want to go to college or if I want to go immediately after high school. I know that telling my family I don't want to go would be such a disappointment.

Even though I know my decision has to be about me, it's hard to ignore what my family would think since they're super important in my life.

I have no idea what to do. I don't know how to decide between doing what I think is best for me or just doing what everyone else expects from me to prevent how bad the reaction would be. How do I even tell my family how I feel? How do I even figure out how I feel in time to decide?",27Jan2020,1

I have no one left in my life. I go without talking to anyone for days even though. Telling myself that there's no one there for me and I'm my only strength has made me push to this point. Even after having a good professional life, my personal life and emotional health is totally fucked up.

Troll begins posting on other platforms about you, again being careful with language, saying things like “I’ve heard that &lt;your name&gt; is a thief, you better watch your stuff when &lt;you&gt; is around”.  Troll’s not saying you're a thief just that it’s heard from others that you are.

Your FB and Insta friends stick up for you so Troll starts engaging them directly, suggesting they be careful when you're around.  Troll starts contacting your family, place of work and business associates (via LinkedIn and other platforms), all the while being very careful not to actually accuse you of anything (asks questions like ""What do you think of the rumours that &lt;your name&gt; is a thief?"")

You have absolutely nothing to hide and were willing to ignore and block, but now your family and work are involved and if someone throws enough sh!t at you, the unfortunate reality is that some will stick.

What legally can be done?  Note defamation is extremely hard to prove here, is VERY costly to pursue through the courts, and the remedy is likely to be limited to Troll removing their comments from the one account from which they were made.

I'm a 20 year old male living in the states, and sometimes feel at a lost with the direction my life is heading in and sometimes find myself feeling a concavity in my psyche which can only be described to me as emptiness, it's very hard to explain. Some days I'm proud of the person I look at in the mirror and other days a feeling of unease entangles my vessel, and am in fear of not generating anything in this life I have. 

I'm second year in college studying psychology with minimal help and am not interested in going to medical school to be a psychiatrist due to the nature and longevity of the work along with future debt I will have to face if finding a job is some what rough for me. Leading me to wanting to transition to fire fighting, but I have an outstanding injury that may interfere with the requirements of being a FF. I was devastated when I found this out. 

I have friends, a decent family, hobbies, a nice girl that I hopefully continue to see, and a pretty good head on my shoulders, but I still feel uneasy. I worry which way the subtle winds will blow my floating, light mind, and feel ill at ease with the direction that the currents/waves of the sea we call life will take my vessel. 

I also sometimes feel empty but not sad? I experience long periods where I dont experience conscious thought and notice it quite a bit. Kind of like something in a certain area of my mind shuts off and dont think anything of it.

477,"Hello! The title honestly says it all but I'll provide more context. 

My [18F] relationship with my parents is not the best. I dislike going home and have thought of living on my own for a few years now. Aspects of them both can make it to r/raisedbynarcissists. Basically, the older I get the more bs I see through and the less I can swallow it and not speak up. I also feel that I cannot be as independent as I would like with them. Apart from that, they place restrictions on me that's harder to handle when I get older. For example, I have to ask for permission to hang out with my friends, detailing who they are, where we will be and at what times. It's like planning an itinerary. My mother gets annoyed when it doesn't suit her timings and doesn't like late nights, so she will get annoyed if I came back late too. Before the comments ask, she only sleeps when everyone is back home so that she can ensure the house is clean to her standards. My relationship with my mother is better than my father, but she's still toxic in some ways. 

I don't make my outing plans known to my father. He would not let me hang out with guy friends alone because he thinks I'm still his precious baby daughter and his only child at that (somebody please cue the eyeroll). He is also religious and wants me to be too. Slight problem of not being slightly religious at all. All in all, a very traditional Asian male figure.

The only reason I look forward to coming home to is my grandmother because she'll be lonely without me speaking to her every day when I get back from school. 

Now I can choose to consider going to a university where living on campus for the entire degree is compulsory. Let's call this university ""School ABC"". Of course, School ABC has other peaks besides that but for the field that I'm considering going into, there are better universities. Furthermore, that university was not on my mind until I found out about the compulsory stay. However, I'm not yet certain that that field is what I want. School ABC only lets you pick your degree in the second year. The first year is a taster of all the degrees they offer.

We came here to visit the HQ of UN, and we are going to Boston to participate in the Harvard Model of UN as well, which is one of the biggest international high school conferences in the world. And I can't seem to make friends with anyone. 
Everybody seems so receptive and super friends with everybody, I don't know how to do that as well, because I have a really hard time communicating with them. I come from a different background, and our ideas are immensely different, but I really shouldn't waste the amazing opportunity that has been given to me.

483,"My neighbor (50m) moved from out of state and came out of retirement to help raise his grandson (6yo). The boy, lets call him Michael, is the coolest little kid I’ve ever met. He’s smart, funny, adorable, compassionate, and all that good stuff. Michael stays with my neighbor every Friday after school through until late Sunday night and every single holiday, he seems to be the only REAL care giver in this boy’s life. But the mom comes around to pick Michael up sometimes, but it looks like she’s on some heavy drugs. Also, she has a new boyfriend who just moved in with her and Michael. The boyfriend seems like a scum bag. Anyways, for Christmas my husband and I got michael a little guitar because he always asks to hold mine, but it’s too big for him to try to play. He loves it and brings it over to my house for guitar lessons every chance he gets. Lately, during our jam sessions, he has been saying some bizarre and violent things. They aren’t really directed at anyone or anything, but it’s caught me off guard because it’s so out of character. During his last “lesson” Sunday night, his mom banged on the door to pick him up. When I answered the door she saw my cat on the couch and started frantically gesturing me to come outside while cussing loudly at no one in particular. I stepped out, confused since I had never really had a conversation with her up to this point, and she was acting so insane. She rambled on for about 30 minutes about how mean cats are. She was intense about it and not making much sense at all. Then she said her and Michael had two pet cats, but last month one of the cats scratched her hand, so her new boyfriend “snapped the cat in half in the middle of their living room”. She said he then killed the other pet cat too. She said she doesn’t like talking about it in front of “the kid” because he “doesn’t really get it”.  But she was smiling while telling me the details of exactly how her boyfriend murdered the animals. It was nauseating. I’m worried about Michaels safety but I’m hesitant to call it in because I know  CPS or DCF or whatever often just makes situations worse. I don’t want to cause more harm in Michaels life. I’d hate it if I caused some type of situation where Michael wouldn’t be able to spend the weekend with his grandpa. I’m not sure what to do to help him, but it seems obvious to me that he is being deeply affected by this unhealthy environment and it breaks my heart.

tl;dr: I’m worried my neighbors grandkid (6m) needs help. His mom told me her boyfriend killed his pets in front of him. How can I help him without making things worse?",27Jan2020,1
484,"Basically the title. 

But seriously, how do I stop comparing myself to others. I really struggle with this as I’m quite academic (or like to think of myself as being so and constantly get told by others that I am), so when I hear of someone talking about their grades and then realise they did better than me, I go through a cycle of emotions. These mainly include; discouraged, envy and a tad angry. 

For example, we recently got our grades back for an assignment and two of my classmates got a slightly higher score than me, was I happy for them? Of course. Do I wish I had their scores? In a sense yeah.

It seems abnormal for me to be thinking this way, however I do feel I sometimes strive for perfection and when I don’t get that but others do, it hurts me inside. 

I just wondered if anyone had any advice on this at all, cause I’d like these thought processes to stop so I can be grateful for my achievements, without comparing myself to others or feeling envious because they’ve done better than me...

Started my new job a few months ago. Everything is great, i love the job and the people i work with but one person that i want to punch in the face with a hammer! 

We work as part of the same team so unfortunately we sometimes get to do some work together. She makes me feel like she does not trust me and always double checks on me and my work! Last week she briefed me on a project and made me repeat everything she said even though i clearly said i had it under control! 

Last year i had a to do list to do over the festive period  and she created a meeting in Jan to check on my work! She is not my manager why does she think she is entitled to do this?

As i am new j am trying to put my head down and do what I’m told but in the long run i see this escalating!!

486,"So I’m in a bit of a pickle

I (m21) broke up with my ex-gf (19) about a year ago. We agreed to stay friends as we have the same friend group and wanted to keep everyone happy and stay in each other’s lives. Last weekend however really pissed me off. 
She spent the whole weekend at the flat I live at. I live with 3 of my mates (1 girl 2 boys) and we’re 4 people of a friend group of 8 so it isn’t uncommon for all 8 of us to be coming and going from the flat all weekend. My ex showed up Friday night and didn’t leave until Sunday night. Since everyone’s all friends no one sees it as a problem, except for me. 
The problem is she literally never leaves me alone, she sits right next to me all the time, only goes places if I’m going, is constantly trying to start conversation with me even if I’m busy or distracted, wants to help me cook or clean and can’t seem to take a hint to leave me alone. It honestly feels like Im with her the whole time. I reside to my room to play ps4 only for her to come in and watch me. I feel smothered and I’m getting all this unwanted attention. From my perspective it looks like she doesn’t really want to let go of what we had and is trying to hold on. I want her to be happy -I truly do- but she only wants me and doesn’t seem to want to move on. The worst part is that she is genuinely the sweetest and caring person but since I spend the whole weekend trying to ignore her I get cold and mean to her, which I feel really bad about. 
The thing to top it all off I get a text late at night from a girl(G) I’ve been talking to recently asking to come over, my ex sees it and gets very upset, she says that G is her friend and it would really cut her if I kept talking to her or did anything further. I tell her she cant dictate what or who I do because I’m single(I already knew from G that they hadn’t even spoken in over 3 years). She of course gets very upset. But I’m stuck wondering how and why I have got to sneak out of my own house to go get laid. 

I’m stuck 

I feel like the bad guy here. I know it sounds dumb and petty but I don’t want to feel like I’m living in this cage, otherwise I may as well just go back to dating her. I feel like my only two options are ask her to leave me alone and for her to cut ties with all of our mates, or I move out and cut ties with her and all our mates.

Any advice ?",27Jan2020,1

489,"Long-ish story ahead, you have been warned!

Started playing games a while ago, like 2 years maybe, around 95% slots and 5% sporting bets. No roulette or any other table games becaause they are not available in my country (or at least not in my city, maybe only in the top 3 biggest cities or so). Even though, like any gambler more or less, I know that the odds are against me, I play slots quite a lot. I never lose essential money that is supposed to go for basic living stuff, I never borrow money to play or do such things, BUT I lose most of my ""expendable"" money to them, which angers me in the end, because I can no longer invest as much as I used to in my hobbies and similar things. I can take breaks, but even so, at some point I will start again and it's making me unable to save money. I can save for 2-3-4 weeks at times but it always ends up the same way. Also, did not have a decent win in a year.

Bigger problem is that slots here are even more stacked against the player than in other places. No one really controls the casinos or they just bribe the people who are supposed to check them, so they mess with the pay rate as they please. There have been people who actually looked into it deep and found out that some casinos raise the RTP (or similar thing) to very high 1-2 nights a month when there are many people playing, only to lower them waaaay beyond the legal level and winning becomes outright impossible. Since a lot of people are outright addicted, it doesn't matter, they are still gonna play and the casinos are exploiting this to get way more money than they'd usually do.

I've managed to make some progress lately (my playing sessions have become rarer and the money lost has decreased (let's say that from losing 90-95% of my disposable money, it's down to a 60-70%). It's a progress, but still. I tried to quit completely (and still am) many times but since there are literally multiple slot machine places on every slightly important street, you're gonna get the temptation 5 times if you do as little as go to the next supermarket to buy 2 beers. They. Are. Literally. Everywhere.

Any advice on how to stop for good will be highly appreciated. As I have mentioned, some progress was made in the past few months, but I want to go beyond that. Thanks!",27Jan2020,1

I lived with this friend twice and we have been through a hell of a lot. They haven’t known each other all that long, just over a year, and I have never met them or heard about them before until they were mentioned in front of my partner. My friend is also now friends with their current partner, who mine was cheated on with. 


My friend knew about the cheating, but not other elements of the past or that is was to do with us, and insists this person is different now, and that they were mentally ill back then. 
I feel like it is going to get left with them still being close regardless, and I can’t help but scrutinise my friend’s character judgement on this person. I just don’t think I could be close with someone who had cheated on a past partner without struggling to trust them, particularly if cheating wasn’t a one time thing. And I would definitely reevaluate if I knew it concerned a friend and was affecting them. This friend always says loyalty is massive to them and I can’t help but doubt theirs if they don’t distance themselves. 

My partner is still working through forgiving what this person did to them which has been hard for me, and I am taking on the role of helping unravel it as I want them in my life and they are a wonderful person but it has been challenging.
I want to give my friend an untimatum about being so close with this person, but I know this is unreasonable.

2 years ago, I was approached by a buyer for a small piece of land I own. This buyer promised a great price, so I was happy to sign a sale agreement and open escrow with them. The buyer promised me they would close within 45 days.

2 years later, and 10 (TEN!) extensions later, this buyer still hasn't sent the funds to close the deal. Needless to say, I am frustrated and considering cancelling the sale.

The buyer has claimed they have poured in tons of time and money into changing the zoning/entitlements of the land to increase it's value, and that cancelling on them now, just before closing, would be unfair. On the other hand, I have waited 2 years for nothing, and am considering finishing their work myself to fetch a higher price with another buyer later on.

This buyer is obviously a slimy person, and has no respect for my time or money. Then again, they are offering a great price, and without months/years of my own entitlement work on the land, I may not get a better offer. 

Is this fair? Do you think I should sell to this buyer today? Or show no mercy and try to increase the land value on my own, so I can get a better deal later? 

Thanks again Reddit.

Music kept me going through my teenage years, music made me want to live when I became severely depressed, the music was always there for me from moment one. I would listen to music when my parents used to fight so I could escape the painful reality I was facing as a child. Music was everything to me. And for the past two years, no matter what I listen to and how many bands and genres I try to get into, I can't feel anything anymore. Music has lost its charm and it was the only thing that kept me alive. Now, without it, life is simply over for me. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I don't have any other interests. No friends. My family mocks me because I'm a loser. I have nothing. I try everyday to reignite my passion for music but nothing sounds remotely good to my ears anymore and this is making me unbelievably depressed, to the point where I can't function anymore.

At least I get to do schoolwork and do things like that but they aren't school and still will be on my permanent record. I got kicked out in 8th grade because I was hanging out with the hood rats in my school and i'm not trying to insult anyone but most of them were addicted to meth in 8th grade. (Also my town is 83% meth heads anyway). Kept getting in trouble outside of school but inside of school I wouldn't listen either (this isn't an excuse but I have ODD so I have trouble with teachers anyway) I got caught skipping class for the 30th time (that is not a random number that is the actual amount of times I skipped) and the 2 years before that I had been suspended multiple times basically I have a really rough time with adults treating me like I know nothing. I got sent to alternative which is basically where they send all the kids who are either not actually mentally handicapped but didn't put in the effort to learn anything so they're stupid or the kids who didn't care enough (me) and got sent there because of behavior. I actually kinda thrived in this environment but my whole family thought I was a disappointment at this point. so lets move on to 9th grade. I get to go back to school I actually do good for a few months join the wrestling team getting good grade etc. But everything that could have gone wrong went wrong one day (literally no one is going to believe this story but I swear it is 100% accurate and is actually unbelievable so I understand if you don't believe me). Me my friend Ken and my other friend Sean were in gym (first class) and we find a can of dip (I have no clue why it was in the gym but we had a morning assembly that day so some kid probably left it there). So my friend sean wants it so he takes it well I think nothing of it at the time I mean I didn't take it I don't care. Well a few classes later I see sean again and he asks if I can hold it through his next class because of some suck ass excuse he gave me I said sure and hold it well I forgot my headphones in my last class so after this class I go to get them. well I see one of the old hood rat friends and we talk basically he has a dab pen and asks if I want to hit it in the bathroom I say yes (this isn't abnormal like probably other highschools you walk in the bathroom you see kids vaping). well we're in there and some kid is in the stall he starts playing music and we didn't think anything of it well a teacher walks in mid hit for me and catches us. so in all got caught with a vape but not only a vape a DAB PEN which is illegal in my state anyway so i'm not only cause underage smoking i'm caught with illegal drugs in a school zone. So of course I got kicked out now my family calls me a fuck up and at this point I don't know what steps to take to help my life i'm in APA (if you don't know what that is it's basically home school except I go to the high school to take BIG tests so they know I don't cheat).

I worked construction and made around $3000 after tax but there's no way I can study full time and work construction, I used to work very long shifts barely had time to shower, eat and have enough sleep. I have severe stutter so construction was my only choice as it requires little speech. My mom and my little sister live with me, my mom cannot speak English at all therefore can not find a job but she's applying to get single mother support cause my sister is underage. 

Now I'm on employment (it will end in a couple of months) cause it's winter and I'm getting paid 60%. I desperately wanna go to college and get a degree before it's too late, my age is perfect but time is flying by quick so I need to hurry, the degree I want will take at least 10 years of studying, cause I didn't go to high-school, I'm an immigrant came to Canada at the age of 18.

I'm open to selling the house, or doing anything so my family can live comfortably and not make them work, but I can't express how much I wanna study, I'm unable to sleep every night thinking of studying, with my age and my love and passion for studying, I just can't let it go, also cause my future as a severe stutterer without a degree/professional career is definitely SHIT. Geared to income housing will take a very long time, I don't know what to do and how can the government help in any way so I can make my family live comfortably while I study, I definitely will find a part time job but it won't be enough with the expenses I have.

508,"In our very small circle of friends, i have one friend named who I think is stealing our money. 



Yesterday we were sitting next to each other at school and well my friend is pretty notorious for not caring and he even admits he steals around 20$ from his family frequently. Me and my other friends were playing a game so since it was his turn to buy some food for us i told him to get 3$ from my wallet.
Then afterwards my wallet was in a different section and the originally 60$ that was in a secret pocket was just in the normal pocket of my wallet and it was just 40$. I know for sure that my money was 60$ since i was supposed to buy a game with my money and counted it multiple times. My other friends didnt see him take money since they were playing but at the same time our friend wasnt playing with them or even near them so they cant verify if he really got money

There was another time when we were in a cafe outside of school with another friend (so we were 3). Then my friend bought some drinks and left hid wallet on the table, then my friend gets it and pretends to hide it for awhile then when our other friend returns back he playfully gets the 40$ from his wallet then returns it to him. My friend noticing his missing money asks for his money back. Then he returned 20$. The next day my other friend says that be thinks he had 40$ and not 20$, but he wasn't sure. And i also didn't see if our friend got 40$ or 20$. 




At this point in pretty sure that it was him who got our money and I want to tell our teacher about it but my other friend wants to just leave it as it is as he wouldn't want a fuss about it. 
But i would feel really bad if our teacher confronts him and it wasnt him or smth. Also i think our friendship might get destroyed either ways. Our class and school is really small so we cant really distance each other.

520,"Hi

After multiple inquiries to decrease the AC level in the office, nothing has improved. However, when someone asks to have the AC hotter, it happens instantly.

So as time goes by the office has just gotten hotter and hotter.

People who get cold can wear a jacket or use a blanket, but people who get hot can't take off more clothes to get relief from the heat. And since it's an office job, you can't just wear shorts and a t-shirt for the heat. You have to dress nice, which translates to warm...

It is currently summer time (South Africa), so as you can guess it gets HOT!

Any advice on how to address this?

521,"I’ve been raised by strict parents and had problems with my self confidence during my youth. I think this has caused me to lie to people as to portray myself better. This includes exaggeration as well as making up stories.
Since I don’t live with my parents anymore and am an adult now I don’t need to lie to them about things anymore and they’ve come to accept me as who I am and support me.
The problem is that the lying has shifted to my social life now. I will tell lies to my friends or potential partners to seem cooler or in any other way better than I am. 
I really don’t know how to stop since most of the time the lying just happens naturally without consciously thinking about it. Other times though I fabricate stories when I’m thinking about something and will tell these stories as the truth later on when I’m in a conversation and that topic comes up. 
I don’t really have problems with my self confidence anymore and have to come accept myself the way I am and am comfortable to be myself around others. The lying is just like a bad habit I can’t really help.

I was in that relationship 5 months and it draind me,but i still feel for her,i have been 2 years thinking that it was just toxic but idk why i texted her.  


she quickly started getting comfortable talking w/me and i soon realized that she still loves me,she told me about the problems she has had in this 2 years and the experiences she has had with her recent ex,and i really felt bad,bad to a point where something that i didnt realize i still had came out,i realized that i still love her but i dont want to get too close.  


the problem comes here,i have planned to meet with her soon and we both are still emotionally atached to eachother but know not to get too close,idk what to do,i feel like i cant decide and i need help

Now, my mother is using him to get me to obey her commands. If I don't heed her request, she restricts my gaming access. Fair enough. I find that consequence fitting.

The computer is one of the few ways he communicates with his friends; I am highly reluctant to let my best friend receive punishment for my own affairs, and yet I feel I must somehow make my own decisions without this one consequence affecting everything.

I helped her as much as I could, tried to support her and be there. She's convinced that ending it with me and moving out will help her, so she broke it off. I have no suspicion of cheating going on. Just a formerly good relationship with a sad ending.

530," I'm 27, have a really good job that I've worked at for five years with a great boss. In the last semester of my masters and graduate in May. I got married last year and she's the best wife a guy could ask for. Decent but smaller friend group since college, engaging church on weekends and I'm in decent shape and enjoy outdoors stuff. My question is this, I feel like nothing ever really gets me super excited or that I never feel fulfilled as I picture it in my head. I'm not a sad person or a downer and I'm super happy with how my life is.... and yet I feel like I've never found my purpose... I'd like to become a manager in higher education or private sector IT and use my skills and knowledge I've acquired. I want to buy a house and have kids in the next five years. My wife and I have plans on trips to take. Yet I feel like I'm sleepwalking through life because nothing is as fulfilling or exciting as I think it should be. I'll occasionally buy stuff I don't need and then wonder why I did it (not too often). I'm a go-getter and want to be really good at everything I do and to everyone I know. One example is I'll buy books that look interesting and I love the topics, but I never feel like sitting down to enjoy them. A lot of this I realize sounds like depression and maybe to some extent it is, but it's more to me like I don't know what brought me here or what to do with my time... I have hobbies like reading, walking, podcasts on sports, business, leadership, and video games, I love to fish, etc... My wife and I also have a ton of the same interests so that's always been good too. I'd bet 9/10 people would say you've got everything going for you, and I mean that in a humble way.

Yet... here I am posting this haha. Does anybody have suggestions for how to fix what I'm feeling/thoughts? I've felt this way since the late teenage years. Thanks.

531,"So, I (M 18) basically didn't start puberty till I was 17/18, besides getting armpit hair, due to Kallmann syndrome.

I don't really relate to any guys my age whatsoever because I haven't done any of the sexual things you do when going through puberty at all. I only actually felt lust really maybe 2 years ago? Like, I had it before that obviously but not fully if that makes sense? I crushes but I didn't actually feel aroused.

Girls and guys my age are a lot more mature than me, in general and sexually, and I have a hard time trying to be with any girls close to my age because of that.

532,"I'm sorry, this is my first post, and I don't know how long Reddit posts on an average are.

TL;DR 
I have only my mom to talk to in my life, and now her job has completely swallowed her. I'm utterly confused about everything. I sometimes think I'm some sort of a genius, and other times think I should work as a janitor somewhere. I used to like mathematics very much, but now I don't find any pleasure in studying it, because I've come to see it as some sort of necessary justification of my intelligence. 

****
I dropped out of school 5 days ago (junior year of high school, according to western standards) because I found the teachers and the students to be extremely stupid. Maybe universities prefer their applicants to have attended a school, but I don't care about that. I have taken many decisions on a whim, and this is not the first time. (but it's certainly the most objectively consequencial decision...)

I feel extremely guilty whenever I do anything except studying, (even as I am writing this post), because I've verbally absused others so many times, and have called my teachers 'idiots' in their faces, that I cannot bear to see any quality that they posses in me, I cannot bear to be unable to do things they cannot do. I tried to play the guitar today, but I failed, I tried to solve a maths problem, a physics problem, something in chemistry, and even that I could not do. I have implicitly adopted a very flawed viewpoint - that one does these things to impress society, and to such an extent that I no longer am able to derive any pleasure out of these activities. I have also developed this desire to disassociate myself from everyone, because I don't want to be like them, and I want to be special. 

PS: 
I am not special however. I had prepared 3 months for the first selection round of the maths Olympiad in my country, but on the day of the exam I was so terrified that I after all decided not to appear for it. It was a bad decision, but the incident highlights my cowardice, and my escapism. This is exactly what I have done this time, by dropping out of school. (Except this time I have belittled THEM, and terrified THEM, because well, they were introducing me to sin,cos,tan and logarithms (which I think is very elementary) halfway in my junior year...!) 

PPS: 
The preceding statement in the brackets, I wrote intentionally just to showcase my extraordinary thought process. To convince you, the reader, that somehow I am self-contradictory, and the patient of a psychological disorder. I take pleasure in labelling myself, in using big words, and in being verbose.

I don't have the funds saved up and only a place that looks promising that I was going to attempt to apply for in May.  Is there any type of assistance I can look into or kinds of housing that would allow me to room suddenly? Or possibly how I can best go about this situation?",27Jan2020,1
539,"I work for a huge company bearing a household name most of us know. Due to the company’s social media policy I can’t say which company it is. However I’ve only been there for three months. The general manager (who is/was a personal friend of mine and is also my old boss) has only been there slightly longer. This means that the assistant manager and one chosen coworker basically run the show while the general manager acclimates herself to the company. This has led to a “too many chiefs and not enough Indians” scenario. 

It’s also led to the gross mistreatment of several people who work for the company. This one coworker hollers (as in yells at people like they’re children) whenever things don’t go her way. She has no idea how to effectively communicate with others yet she communicates with authority she doesn’t have on a very regular basis. I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and she has already caused me to have several panic attacks in my short three month tenure with the company. Yesterday at a work meeting she was called out for hollering at us a few months ago and she started hollering again. Management did not immediately shut it down and instead let the storm continue to brew for awhile. I had another panic attack but luckily most people didn’t notice. 

This same coworker trained me and regularly spoke down to me throughout training. She would rudely call me out for mistakes I made while I was learning in front of customers, other coworkers and management. I didn’t say anything, but it got brought to the attention of management because of another coworker who overheard. Management spoke to her because of my coworkers complaint, but she soon started again. One day we were stocking equipment in the back. I was stocking the same way I usually do, but I missed the pile she started. She again talked down to me, “can’t you see I already started THIS pile?” 

This same coworker humiliated me in front of a friend’s parent. It was my second weekend of training with her. She told me to do something on the computer and provided no additional instruction. I did what I thought I was supposed to do and she just stood there watching. She chastised me when I got it wrong, but wouldn’t tell me the correct way to do it. Eventually she pushed me out of the way and said, “you can’t even figure this out and it’s simple. I’ll just do it.” Ummm... she was supposed to be training me. 

Furthermore, if I went to her with any questions after training she’d refuse to help me and would just refer me to a catalog of FAQs which provided no answers to the question I was asking. 

The assistant manager (her friend) would always send me to figure out problems myself as well. If I asked about a particular way to do something she’d say, the supplies you need are in the back so you figure it out yourself. Even if she could tell me how to do it without coming in the back she wouldn’t. I was literally thrown to the wolves. The other day I had a customer come in yelling, asking to speak to a manager. I did my best to handle the situation before getting the assistant manager involved. When I finally got her involved she told me that she’d never come to a manager for things like this and that I need to learn how to deal with it myself. 

Back to my coworker, she regularly hollers at people who don’t do their job effectively, but she’s regularly late. She also does her best to push her duties off on other people and take long naps on the break room couch when she’s hungover. 

This coworker is the one being groomed for management. I have no idea why when there are several other fully capable and qualified people on the team. I know I won’t be sticking around once she’s promoted. 

I brought all of this up to my general manager who said she’d say something, but it might make it worse for me. I’m sick of having panic attacks. I refuse to go back on medication so I can handle my coworkers as we should all be able to communicate like adults in the workplace. I don’t want to go to work today, I’d prefer to take a mental health day instead so all of this can process and I can figure out what to do. It’s just that after the corporate security training at our meeting yesterday I’ve learned that people who have mental illness (anxiety in my case) and call off work are looked at as potential threats to the company. 

If you made it this far I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Im very masculine, I’m charismatic, funny, hold interesting conversations yet I’m still a virgin and can’t seem to lose it. All my friends were getting laid in middle school/high school and always made fun of me for being a virgin. I usually meet a girl, we talk for 2-3 days and she ends up ignoring my texts and it never goes anywhere. I am always the one putting in the most effort during conversations. It seems like it never even gets close to sexual. They’ll even tell me I’m cute but then it always ends up not going anywhere. I get so jealous when I see other men getting laid, it actually makes me mad sometimes because I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m not ugly, I mean I’m no Chris Brown or Leonardo DiCaprio but I’m not ugly. I don’t get it. I have literally talked to maybe 2 thousand women in my life through school, online, parties etc.. literally over 2 thousand, maybe more. And not once have I gotten sexual with anyone. It’s starting to make me feel like maybe I’m not meant for sex? Maybe I just don’t deserve it? But that pisses me off because I see undeserving douchebags getting laid everyday. I’m starting to think I should just pay for it. That goes against all my morals and ethics but I’m starting to feel hopeless. I also feel like why should I pay for it if other dudes get it for free? That makes me feel even less worthy. I see myself starting to get incel type thoughts. I’m starting to become bitter towards women. I hate that I feel this way. I don’t even think it’s about to physical sex itself, it’s about ACCEPTANCE. I don’t feel accepted. I feel rejected by every woman I meet. I literally don’t know what’s wrong with me. I look just a good as the typical guy who gets laid. I don’t understand. When I was in college my roommate made fun of me everyday and even told the whole campus about how I couldn’t get laid. I despised him for this. He took a personal issue of mine and broadcasted it to the ENTIRE school. Which made me even more frustrated.

541,"I just read that only a small amount of people born with autism or Asperger's will end up getting a relationship and starting a family, the others will stay forever alone. And even maintaining the relationship is hard for autistic people. And white women are significantly less likely to date Asian men than other races. I was unlucky enough to end up being both autistic and Asian. And I, for the most part, get attracted to only white women. I can't even fully blame myself for that. 99% of people I see outside or in media are white. Finding other Asian people outside is a very rare occurence for me, even at school. Also, I started disliking my Asian culture. Mostly because of how awful Asian parents can be, and I got the short end of the stick. And I'm tired of eating rice for dinner, I want spaghetti for christ's sake.

This has made me genuinely afraid of my future. I'm born with Asperger's (I think. could also be regular autism but I have traits of Asperger's) I can confidently say that the autism has ruined my life. My parents don't understand me and couldn't properly deal with me having autism, I struggled badly with school and ended up failing class multiple times in a row and I'm still extremely socially awkward and hardly have any friends. I feel like there's not much hope left for me now unless I get help, but my parents don't even want me to get help from psychiatrists, they don't trust them and believe I don't need them. And I can't convince them otherwise.

I'm 18 and still far from finishing school so I probably shouldn't even be worried about a relationship rn, but I am, cuz I wanna know how high my chances really are. And I can't even focus on school anyway because of all the crap that makes me afraid of school. I'm lagging behind with life badly but I want to repair everything. I can't even ride a bicycle or tie my shoes for Christ's sake.

So besides having Asperger's, I'm also the son of Asian parents. I read somewhere that Asian men are among the bottom of the barrel in terms of attractiveness. And of course they're a lot shorter than Dutch people. I'm literally the offsping of parents from a country whose people are among the shortest and I'm born in a country whose people are among the tallest. I'm over 18 and 1,75m and no longer able to grow. And imagine getting rejected simply because your member is shorter than almost every other guy in the country. 

Heck, even among the Asians, I'm ugly as sin. My face is way too round, my nose is too big, my eyebrows are too wide. I look a lot like Youtuber ProZD. I don't watch his videos, but he looks shockingly similar. I'm not saying ProZD is ugly, I just look a lot like him but I don't look like Jackie Chan either. I'm also slightly overweight cuz I don't exercise, don't even have time for it. I want to work on it when I do get the time but for now I have too much fat. I'm not going to post a selfie tho. In fact, I never posted a selfie on the internet in my entire life so far. Just assume I look almost exactly like ProZD.

Heck, when I was 14, I was in class with a girl who was pretty much perfect (but white) I had a huge crush on her. And don't tell me I'm an incel cuz I literally just learned about sexuality at the time and I didn't fully understand everything yet. I kinda tried approaching her but she told me to stop. Not that it mattered anyway. I wasn't good enough for her anyway and I must've literally been the least attractive guy of the class. I ended up failing that class and I've never seen her, or anyone who looked similar to her, ever since.

I didn't choose this life. I want to be like the Dutch people.

I know I currently shouldn't even think about this stuff but I am. Finding someone to talk about stuff like this irl is very hard for me. Please give me some advice and convince me that I still have something going for me in my life and it's not hopeless.",27Jan2020,1

My mom hears this comes and just says, ""You are annoying him don't do that""  (which I had said multiple times before)

He gets visibly angry at us and says my mom ""Don't interrupt while I am talking to him"" and says many times that ""I can't take a fucking joke"" and ""I can't even laugh in this family""

548,"My friends sister recently got married and she’s moving to a new country, she had a lot of stuff still left at home and coincidentally my brother goes to university in that country too, he was home for the holidays and my friend knew he was going back in a few days so she gave me some pots and pans and clothes and lotions for my brother to take with him, I said sure but warned her that my brother doesn’t take stuff in his luggage that I tell him to take, so my brother left 2 days ago but his bags were completely full so I thought I’ll just mail it to her sister instead because I already promised her I’ll send it and her mom,sister and basically her whole family knew my brother was taking the stuff and they mentioned it a loooot if times, well anyway, today I went to mail everything but they refused the lotions and liquids, I just messaged her telling her that they refused them, she first asked what did they do,did they throw them away??

549,"Hey all.

I am unable to fall asleep at night before 3:00AM. I have tried everything to combat this. No phone at night, no food after 7:00pm, no computer after 9:00pm, sleep meds, different beds, white noise, everything. 

I hop in to bed with my husband usually around 11-11:30PM. Then I curl up to try and go to bed, but succumb to staring at the ceiling until exhaustion wears me out.

If I ignore all advice, I can eat food and play computer games until 2:59am, and I will fall asleep almost instantly, but if I follow all of the ‘rules’ I can’t.

Ive tried combating this in the past by getting jobs that require me to be up earlier. However, that only results in A: being completely exhausted throughout the day,  or B: sleeping through my alarm. I worked from 6:30am - 3:00pm for two years, where I would get roughly 3 hours of sleep, and then “catch up” on the weekends where I’d sleep anywhere between 10-13 hours. 

Being up earlier also results in me being aggressive and irritable and depressed throughout the day as I got less sleep, but around 9:30pm I get a “second wind” and I’m awake until 3. If I cave and fall asleep around 7pm, I will wake up at 3:00 and not sleep at all after that. 

I also can’t seem to find sleeping pills that work for me, all they seem to do is give me restless legs.

I’m really losing my mind here. I just want to be able to go to bed at midnight and wake up at 8:00 like a normal person. Right now I have my husband waking me up at 8 so I have time to work out and shower before going in to work, and my husband is annoyed because it’s like trying to wake a child up everyday for school.

Please, u don’t know what to do.",27Jan2020,1
550,"So I've spent the last 2 years knowing that the path I was taking with school wasn't something I wanted to continue with. I (probably stupidly) continued the program, finished clinical rotations and hated every second of it, and got a job where I've been working the past 7 months. It's even worse than school and even worse than I could have imagined for so many different reasons I'm not going to get into here.

A year ago I decided I was going to start learning coding, so I self taught when I had time and recently got accepted into a great coding bootcamp. It's expensive though, and while I have most of the tuition covered I will have to take out a small loan.

Now that I've been accepted, I'm juggling the idea of postponing the bootcamp another month to make a little extra cash.

I'm torn though. The money would be nice, and would probably be the most ""mature"" path to take, but I'm already at my wits end with my job, I'll be starting night shifts (all mixed in with day AND evening shifts in the same week. Hooray for non-unionized hospital schedules...). The bootcamp is 70-80 hours a week for 3 months and the last thing I need is to feel burnt out and exhausted from lack of sleep before I start the program. 

Intuitively the earlier start date makes more sense to me, but logically the later one does. I just want to move on with my life at this point - its already been 2 years of forcing myself to do push through knowing how much I hated it and how much I dreamt of escaping. Another month does mean more financial security but I don't know if I can (or should) take it anymore.

Any advice? Thanks :)",27Jan2020,1
551,"First off: I want to clarify I don't want think anyone is wrong for believing in the supernatural or religion, but I can not in any way wrap my head around this situation. This is why I can't help but wonder whether this is related to a mental illness. I'm 100% open to advice on either option, I'm just worried about my friend and have no idea how to help him feel safe right now.

My housemate texted me yesterday asking whether anyone else was home, I said there wasn't. He messaged me he was stressed and scared and he had been hearing people talking late at night. I did call on the phone on loud speaker until 10ish pm, but I kind of doubt it was that because of the details of the conversations he's been having/hearing which I will clarify later. I am however thinking this may play a part, as our rooms are across each other, and I sometimes I can be kind of loud playing videogames or calling on the phone... but I've asked plenty of time and my housemates always tell me they can't hear me at all. I tried to push for him to explain what he meant, he dropped the conversation, and I just wished him luck.

Today I ran into him in, asked him what was up and he explained to me that two friendly spirits had been visiting him for months now. A boy and a girl, early 20s like us. At the highest frequency 5 times in 2 weeks. They are very friendly and like to act goofy. They told him they have friends at one of our neighboring dorms, and he thinks they're only acting happy but they're really hiding away from their 'friends'. I tried to comfort him by saying it's nice that they are happy spirits, and he agreed, but he seemed very distressed still. He said he was scared they wouldn't always stay happy.

He's talked to a friend whose dad is familiar with spirits, and I also adviced him another friend of ours to talk to, because I just don't know enough about spirits to give any 'proper' advice. I want to be understanding and give appropriate spirit-related advice, but the only thing I can think of is that he needs to talk to a therapist because of how much it terrifies him. But I can see that if he's experiencing these real spirits, the last thing he wants to hear is me implying he has a mental issue.

What can I do to help my friend here, support-wise? For people who are familiar with spirits: is this what spiritual encounters are like, and is it possible they visit me sometime as well, or are spirits kind of tied to a specific person?

Again, I truly wish to not offend anyone with experience with the supernatural, or actual mental illness, I just have no idea what to think of this and I'm just kind of grasping at straws here.

552," Hello! Long story short, I have this friend group which some friends always talk about how they have depression and that they want to die etc, you know, the usual nihilistic stuff. I have reached out to help them so many times, only for them to barely cooperate or give anything decent for me to advice them on. They state stuff like ""I'm used to people leaving me"", ""my life is going downhill"". Every time I am in call with them I just lose less energy, it feels like their negativity is just draining my energy. I always try to make them laugh, it used to be full of energy and fun but now I feel really empty talking to them. I do have an anxiety problem which is linked to several of my medical conditions and I have been seeing a psychologist for about 6 years now, my parents are divorced, my family has had several problems and that cancer occurred twice in my family. However, I really appreciate life in all it's beauty and I have many interests which is what keeps me going, but on the inside I just want to breakdown and let it all out. I do always reach out to others to help them. Back to the friend group, I sometimes get annoyed and shoot back at them saying stuff like, ""there's a difference between feeling sad and having actual depression."" It's really annoying and I want to leave. I'm not the only person in the group to think this way but those that think so aren't close to these several nihilistic people and I am close to them, it's really hard to say ""bye"" because they were the ones I'm with everyday in school. It seems they also really enjoy my company sometimes as well... I have talked to my psychologist about this and he said ""humans have the ability to sense emotion and you can clearly tell whether if they're faking it or not."" Yes I can sense it sometimes, but it's really hard to put it into words since the word ""fake"" can't be used when they're actually feeling down. He also did laugh when I gave some examples of what they say LOL, saying it's exaggerated. One advice he did give me was that I could distant myself from the group and return when they're alright because I need to take care of myself first, which I haven't been doing since I always help others out with their issues. That's what I did and I sort of focused on my hobbies, which I really love doing along with listening to my favorite types of music but it seems they have gotten worse while I was gone. I am a patient person but really, this is draining and I feel that I am in a toxic relationship. I want to leave but it's morally hard.

I'm a teen who really loves gaming, especially this game called Rocket League. I discovered it last year at a friend's place and instantly fell in love with the game. I really wanted a copy of the game for myself, so my parents bought me one for my b'day. Recently, the developer of the game announced that it would stop support for Mac, which is what I use. 

I looked for many solutions but found none, so my only option is to buy a windows PC/laptop. I tried asking my parents for one, but the idea was shut down immediately. I had just started thinking about my future career, and I was really interested in a career based around Rocket League, and I was really hopeful about it. I made a lot of plans and basically based my life around it, and now it's all basically gone.

I am currently at a university in England in my first year doing Physics and to say the least I am not enjoying it at all and it's not really something I want to do although I do find some stuff interesting nevertheless.

I lost a lot of friends from high school because I moved into a city to go to community college, I haven’t made any new friends mostly on me for not being more involved but that’s besides the point. my only friend down here is someone I became friends with because we shared the same best friend i’ll call her emma. this friend we both are both friends with i’ll call Sara. anyways I met sara in middle school and moved after middle school but we always kept in touch and emma met sara in high school. We all became associated because we would go on vacations with sara and her family and it was usually fine. Although me and emma had weird tensions (I always thought because we shared the same best friend). anyways flash forward into college emma moved to the city I loved too so we became actual friends after a while so no longer just because we shared a friend. A couple nights ago me and emma brought up caitlyn and things started to unravel. She brought up how sara made her feel awful about (a situation I won’t get into) and Then I brought up how sara always made feel like I did something wrong, then we talked about how sara is living super reckless and I said how i’m really trying to mature and become successful and how sometimes I feel like hanging out with sara makes me feel like i’m not progressing in life (not in a mean way just in like a we don’t have the same goals in life so it’s hard). Me and emma both realized that sara has been an incredibly toxic friend in other ways too examples (ignores people until she needs something, always puts her boyfriends ahead of everyone even if they are rude to her friends, and many other little things) me and emma just felt weird that we never expressed how we both felt about sara and why are we still friends with her... we both realized we are almost scared to cut sara off. We also found out that she would talk bad about both of us to the other person which is why me and emma used to have weird tension when we first met. Sara told super outlandish things to emma like she thinks i’m a pathological liar (which is so weird because I see her twice a year and other than that we went to middle school together and i don’t even remember what i said or did in middle school lmao) and sara told things to me about jeni that were weird as well. I guess i’m scared to cut sara out because I feel like she will “expose me” even if there isn’t anything to expose. i’m also worried because I don’t have a lot of friends rn and I know i’m my heart i eventually won’t be friends with emma just due to how different we are ( even though I really like her I just know we will eventually or hopefully make more friends and go our own way) but in my head I feel like maybe i’m the person that is all wrong because I don’t want to be friends with anyone from high school due to how much I have changed and now my long time friend from middle school. anyways sorry this is so long winded and dramatic I just don’t know what to do and all of this is driving me mad.",27Jan2020,1

562,"Tl;dr at the bottom

I work in a regular office space, for a company that's closely monitored by the government. Because of this, we have strict rules and procedures to follow (in theory). I had to sign many documents stating the correct way to comply with these procedural ""guidelines"", when I first started this job. It's considered a breach of contract to not follow them to a tee. 

However - my department only rarely follows the procedural guidelines. My boss changes the rules on a whim (he is not paid enough to be allowed such leeway), and so do the other employees. 

I am currently in the hot seat and need some advice. Our guidelines clearly state how to proceed in case of conflicts with clients, but my colleagues have been solving this conflict on the side, unbeknownst to me. There have been several meetings with the client, e-mail communication as well as a refund directly deposited into the clients bank account. That's a clear nono, as our budget is controlled by the government and we are not authorised to handle refunds like this.
The correct way to handle the situation, as stated in our rules and signed by all employees, is to bring the matter forward to an advisor, who will then escalate this to higher ups who will take the appropriate steps to refund the client.
Quite frankly, we are now missing more than a few thousands dollars which can't be accounted for officially, because my colleagues apparently can't think ahead.

But the fun part is this: my boss decided this is how all refund claims should be handled from now on. Except he did not issue any sort of authorization for this (as he can't!), so I've been following the old procedures for client conflicts as to not get into any (legal) trouble. 
Now, my boss is saying I am violating the new guidelines and issued a warning to me, stating that either I follow his rules, or I'm out.

I'm not looking for legal advice - more like moral guidance. Is this a normal thing to happen in companies? Everyone around me is acting as if I'm the black sheep of the family. I cannot believe they are so short-sighted. To make it clear: the 150 people I work with are ALL in agreement that the boss has every right to make up his own rules as he goes. This seems really strange to me.

Tl;dr: boss declared new policy, has no authorization to do so, but everyone agrees we need to follow the new policy and ignore the official guidelines issued by the government.",27Jan2020,1
564,"I'm wondering if I should continue my niche rpg Twitch and podcast. 

They needs five people to run it and I have had 3 people quit and replaced them and then 2 more quit and feeling disheartened. Additionally our technical support crew is leaving the country at the end of Feb and says we can still use their old works equipment etc but thinking that place might close down and so would need to buy equipment etc soon.

I'm also working a stressful job full time and studying two degrees and run a burlesque company part time.

But i previously sold my ownership in another successful channel due to politics with the other owners and this channel is now very successful (I couldn't of stayed but you know you always think what if) and feel worried I might be missing out if we stop this channel.

Pros:

It would be good to continue the channels because we have  built a brand in our country and some jobs I would apply for give you bonus points if you're a creator on their platform ie Twitch. Also we have hit some major milestones:

The podcast channel which has started getting averagely 7000 downloads per episode, we also ran an episode for the official brand.

Our Twitch channel reached Twitch Affiliate in 3 months (streaming only once a week) and we could potentially earn some money on it.

We also have an okay social media following.

Cons:

I don't want to let the one consistent person down but unsure if it's worth my time and energy.

It would need more time spent on it to really grow it with two more stream sessions a week, which at least one would have to be done by me.

Would need to buy more equipment.

It's a lot of prep work and needs even more focus in marketing and social media if we want it to be more successful.

As I got older around 17 it got super bad I started drinking more (because your body gets used to it over time) it’s gotten to the point where I drink’ed up to 3 sometimes 4 cups of coffee a day.

My in-laws constantly feel like I don’t want to be around them because I look as though I am miserable. Even though I am at every event they through they are surprised when I show up.

572,"Warning: this is A LONG STORY but I feel like I have to explain in detail to get the best advice. Please read it all before commenting...

I have 2 children who I have sole custody of, a 6 year old and a 4 year old. My 4 year old is generally very well-behaved, other than the times I find her joining in with my 6 year old (thinking it’s acceptable because her older sister is doing it) but mostly she tells on her.

To start off, I have taken generally every precaution possible. I have bungee cords holding closed my fridge, a locked handle on the basement and the pantry (where all the cabinet food and sharps are), a safe in my room that’s about 2 feet big and I try to fit all I can in it, and chain locks on the house doors.

My 6 year old child destroys and torments literally everything in my home. I cannot even sleep at night because she does most of her destruction when I am asleep or in the shower or doing anything I can’t stare at her doing. I got an at-home camera with motion alerts set on it, and it when she passes by the camera it’ll wake me up, but now she’s realized this and has both unplugged it and crept by it. Her father is not at all involved (refuses to be involved), both of my parents have been dead since 2018, and my sisters are all still minors... so I do it very, very alone for her.

In short:
She’s always been a little bit in trouble, but it’s gotten worse over the last year. Her behavior is out of control. I am literally a graduate student doing it alone. She has cost me so much money I didn’t want to spend replacing everything. I keep a good watch on her, even with cameras... but it seems that EVERYTIME I have to look away for a minute (laundry, shower, cooking, SLEEPING) something happens.


Some of the incidents...
Whenever she doesn’t get her way, she destroys things. Not getting her way can be as simple as not taking her to the movies at 10pm. She has huge screaming tantrums.
Before I was closing up the fridge, which began in June, she was refusing meals at night so she could break in my fridge after I fell asleep and basically eat any dessert product she wanted (cake &gt; healthy dinner in her mind). Not only that but she has played with food to the point of just pouring it on the ground. Next, she began taking knives to the cords on the fridge to cut them open, so I had to lock the sharps in the pantry. She has drawn on the walls 11 times, and while I have locked up ALL writing utensils: she’s to the level of stealing them from people I have over or snatching them from my bags before I lock them up in my room. She flooded the bathroom sink one nighttime on purpose, after I warned her not to do it again, the ceiling fell on our kitchen below (we live in a townhouse) and it cost $700 out-of-pocket to fix. She snapped the shower handle right off before. She broke the railing in the hallway 7 times by swinging on it after everytime I fixed it, and refusing to not climb on it. She cannot even be trusted in her room...she ripped apart her queen sized bed and box spring. I didn’t want to buy her another expensive bed, so I gave her a toddler bed and she broke that right after (by jumping on the frame) along with her sister’s toddler bed. Next, she peeled apart the wood on her dresser till it looked so bad that I threw it out. She knocked her room’s closet doors off of the track, which slammed into a bedroom window and broke the window.She regularly broke her sister’s toys till I started keeping them downstairs separately and not letting her touch them. She has ripped holes in my couch. Broke the TV I had in her room (before her behavior escalated to this level). Cracked my glass dining table and my dining hutch by climbing on them when I was asleep to get to my cabinets. Threw down appliances, like my blender, when climbing at night. She cannot be trusted in stores and needs to be in a shopping cart or she will try and steal candy the entire time. AND SO MUCH MORE.

She is even bad at school, where she goes to kindergarten full-time. I have checked her backpack before and after class, and found many things in it. She’s tried to steal my makeup to bring to school. She has a huge lying problem, and has stolen from other kids and then told her teacher that what she stole came from ME. Her teacher has learned to message me whenever anything is said, and not to trust her words at all. They try to watch her closely but there’s 28 kids to 2 people (teacher and her aide) and she’s had incidents of bullying other kids and hiding/stealing things that they didn’t realize till much after. She’s even refused my packed lunch and tried to steal school lunch at least 5 times.

As previously stated, my parents both died in 2018. I have zero family help, and I have had friends who tried to help but she did these things to them and they gave up. I have taken her to her primary care doctor, and all I was told is “watch her better.” I explained how she will wait till I fall asleep (which I do put her to bed first) to do this, but they said she’s too young for any medication and any sleep training methods they gave me has failed for her. 

I do not let her just behave this way. I have tried EVERY punishment (that is legal and not-abusive obviously). She is put in time-out everytime she does something like this. I make her clean up her own messes to the best of her ability; example: if she draws on the wall, she will be the one to scrub it off with a magic eraser (I will paint it though if that fails to remove the writing). I will explain to her in detail why her behaviors are not acceptable. I will take away her toys and TV for a period of time for each incident. I do not at all allow any of this. 

She is out of control and I am so stressed out at this point. Her doctor has said she’s too young for most things because she’s only 6. Her school has basically blamed me and told me I need to “talk to her more about how bad she is,” which I do more than enough of. I took her for a psychiatric evaluation at the local hospital and they do not think she’s bad enough for their involvement because she’s “so young” and “not physically hurting anyone or herself.”
I am open to all reasonable advice on how to get her to not even be normal; just to stop destroying everything I own.",27Jan2020,1
573,"So go ahead and hate me or downvote me now if you care when I say I don't like dogs. 

My wife just got back from deployment, shes in the navy and just got back from a 10 month deployment. Were both originally from the same state, though she moved to our current state 4 years ago for the navy, and I only moved there a month ago to be there waiting when she came home. Shes been back for nearly a week, and while we were drinking one night she just started crying and telling me (now this is just the gist of it, I cant remember exact words) that she doesn't feel like shes home and she has nothing here to call her own, even though the house is in her name and already has 1 dog that I actually do like, and that she just needs something to love and be there for her. I tell her well we already have the one dog, she says its not the same anymore, I took care of this dog for 10 months while she was gone and now it listens to me more than her and she just wants another dog as something to call her own. I said we can look into it, but she only just got home and i think its too early for something like that, but now here we are with a 7 month old pitbull that I can't stand. We had both dogs meet before we took the other one home, and this pitbull isn't mean but he just plays a bit rough. Like biting the other dogs neck and mounting her even though hes been fixed and just seemingly trying to hurt her. She's asked me many times if I'm fine that we got another dog, and she knows my feelings on dogs, and I tell her ya its fine. Her happiness is my happiness, I truly have nothing here aside from her. I left my entire life and moved 1000 miles away to be with her, shes literally my everything out here, i just want her happy. If that means I have to set aside my feelings then so be it. So we bring this dog home Friday night and straight out the gate he's going after our other dog and tearing up toys and eating my socks and her underwear, and even though the previous owner claims he's housebroken, he's still shit in the house every time hes had to go and peed on our brand new bed the day we got him. I understand he's only a 7 month old puppy and hes gonna be wild, but this is a bit excessive. She also thinks my method of training is too mean. Now I know I said I dont like dogs, but I'm not a sick fuck and abuse them. Just because i dont like something doesn't mean I beat the hell out of it. But this puppy only responds when I yell and when I use the shock collar. Not at a high voltage, but enough to where he knows he got shocked. I've been constantly angry for 3 straight days now. My wife sees this and knows my feelings, and finally asked in bed last night if we made a mistake buying him. I tell her ""well he makes you happy so I'm fine with him"" and she doesnt like that response. After a bit more talking she tells me ""well its up to you. Should we give him back to the adoption place?"" I tell her I don't know and she rolls over and doesn't speak to me for the rest of the night. I'm not the best when it comes to emotions, and I'd also rather tell someone what they want to hear or avoid questions entirely to not upset/piss someone off. My 100% raw honesty, I can't stand this dog and i didn't want him in the first place and hes too wild and the only second though I have about giving this dog back is how upset it would make my wife. Im willing to stick it out for at least a month and try training him more and seeing if he gets better. But I cannot stand this fucking dog as of now.

So what should I do? Stop being a pussy and actually tell her how I feel? Or just keep waiting to see if he gets better? Im open to any suggestion at this point. I just can't stand being this angry all the time. It's depression when I'm at work and anger and sadness when I go home.",27Jan2020,1

I was so taken back and I really still don’t even know how to act. We haven’t argued but he knows how it made me feel. He apologised multiple times the next morning and I’m sure he regrets it. I feel bad about being angry about it but at the same time I can’t stop thinking about it and I just can’t seem to make myself feel okay with it and/or brush it off.

He's amazing, truly. But I'm nervous to share a bed with him for the first time.

577,"24 y/o..So I'm finishing up a 3 month internship and I'm finding that I don't think this is the industry I want to stay in for the majority of my career. The job itself is just ok, but I have noticed effects on my body due to the desk and chair being uncomfortable...I've brought this up to management(they have been helpful, but I'm still uncomfortable) so I am at a loss of what to do. On one hand they are going to offer me a full time position, but on the other hand I don't see myself staying there for more than 4 months(I don't want to waste anyone's time). I want to either pursue music professionally or try to work for a state park as a ranger or something like that. Right now I'm still living at home so expenses are low. I just don't know what to do.",27Jan2020,1
578,"Background: I'm 29, Canadian, I've almost never had a job (two months at Walmart). My mom died when I was 25, whom I was living with, and I used her life insurance (25k) to pay rent for another two years while trying to find employment. My LDR girlfriend rushed to be with me, who is american, so she could only come visit for one-month time frames before going back. Eventually she stayed the maximum amount of time, extending her visit through proper channels for 6 months at a time. After two years, my landlord kicked us out because they were losing their house and they needed to move into the apartment. I never had a formal rent agreement, as my mom was friends with the landlord, and paid her in cash, and I was sort of grandfathered into that agreement to continue living there.

&amp;#x200B;

  My now wife (legally married in Ontario city hall) and I desperately looked for places to live within the short timeframe we were given by my landlord to find a new place. Down to the last week, nothing before being homeless. My wife's mother, who was very positive and supportive (even giving us money for food when she could afford to) offered to take us both in back in Ohio. We were both very nervous, knowing border policies from my wife visiting so many times (and even getting denied once). My Aunt offered to drive us over to Detroit, where my Wife's mother would pick us up and drive us back. I know this was a shady decision, but I was faced with homelessness and sheer desperation. I have a passport, it's still valid until 2028. We went through an express lane, my aunt visits the US a few times a week for ball games and shopping that she has extra clearance to pass through without too much fuss. All of our passports were scanned, and we were allowed through (I've looked up my passport ID and I do have a valid entry date, but no stamp on my passport or like, visitor number or anything). 

&amp;#x200B;

 As we started living in Ohio, figuring out what we were going to do, my wife's mother was diagnosed with cancer, terminal. He condition worsened over a year and a half, and it soon became about taking care of her, and figuring out what the family was going to do, and the entirety of my personal situation took a back seat. My wife worked, small low-paying jobs, (now she has a good job at $20+/hr), and we were all struggling as a family (my wife is the second youngest of seven kids) just to get through these tough times. Our landlord then kicked us out (a re-occurring theme in my story unfortunately, and this time it was an official lease, but under my wife's mother's name, so it's not on our record or anything). 

&amp;#x200B;

  My Mother in law has a very toxic relationship with her own parents, build mostly on drama and money, the grandparents relationship with any of the kids and most of the grand kids is extremely vitriol. They bought my mother in law, their dying daughter, a very small house in a very bad neighborhood to live in (and its been said in some really tense conversations, to die in). It's mold-ridden, there are two bedrooms and one bathroom. (for once when seven people were living here, now five, 3 dogs, a cat). So it was a very tense living arrangement. Originally it was My wife &amp; I, my mother in law, my wife's sister, and my wife's brother, his wife, and their kid. (Since then, the sister has moved out, and my MIL has sadly passed away.)

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about two months since my MIL has passed away, and my Wife's grandparents have the rights to this house, and are kicking us all out by the end of February, so it's been a scramble between everyone to find a new place to live, while managing to live here (There's killer mold here, it's affecting everyone seriously). We have a few current ideas, some involve my wife getting a loan and buying a house, some involve renting a place, timing is critical so we don't have the luxury of being picky (and if you've been reading my story, you know I've never had that luxury.)

&amp;#x200B;

  Now we come to today, the worst day of my life. My wife, who is four years younger than me, has come to the ultimate decision that she no longer wants to be married to me. She has realized her sexual preferences, and after years of wrestling to find a happy medium (adding another person to the relationship, allowing her to have sexual encounters with women), she just told me an hour ago, that she wants a divorce. She told me that it's not me, personally, and if she was being honest, she's felt that she wasn't attracted to men for a long time, and the passing of my mother, and her mother, and everything, has just delayed her telling me how she really feels. 

&amp;#x200B;

  So now, here I am, no work history, no money (even if my wife gave me half our savings, it wouldn't be more than a few months rent), I've been in the US for two years, which I read a few months ago, six months was the limit, so technically I'm in this weird documented/undocumented immigrant, I can't work here, I can't rely on my now ex-wife for money, I can't go back to Canada, I have no family or anyone that would let me stay there, nobody will rent to me in Ontario without steady income, I can't go work in Canada without somewhere to live, and most of all, I have a family here now. I have bonded very closely with everyone in my wife's family, and while I do still want to be here with them, and I don't think they would ever kick me out, I can't rely on my wife's income and good will to support me forever financially, and I can't have her sponsor me into the country now that she doesn't want to be together, and I can't afford an immigration lawyer even if she did. 

&amp;#x200B;

  I truly, truly, don't know where to go, what to do. I have responsibilities here, two small dogs who I love like children, and I can't abandon or be apart from.

582,"Background:

I (m30) met my friend (f32) years ago. We initially dated a couple of times but sort of decided that we were better as friend and remained close. We’ve got back in touch multiple times over the years since but drifted apart a bit (it just happens in life). 

By chance we got back in touch with each other last year and both decided to make more of an effort to hang out. Which we’ve been doing, I assumed as friends. 

Cut to last weekend. She came over to hang out. I made some food and we had a chat and decided to watch some tv. During this she begins to cuddle up to me more and more, eventually pulling my arm over her shoulder to get closer to me. Which I thought was odd but didn’t mind. 

Cut to around 1AM when she’s leaving. She hugs me (completely normal) but then leans in and kisses me on the lips. I asked what she was doing and she said she didn’t know and did I want to kiss her back. I said I didn’t know. 

I’m not entirely sure how this happened but we ended up kissing. Things escalated and she stayed the night. 

We sort of left things pretty open the next day but I’m not really sure what to do. We’ve always got on really well but I’m not sure if I want to move into a romantic relationship with her. And I think she either feels the same way or has harboured feelings for a while. Or I’ve accidentally led her on or she’s mistaken friendship for something deeper. Either way I don’t really want to lose a friend through this.

584,"This is all true and is not a troll post.
I am 15 years old and currently in my junior year of highschool. I am in a bad situation right now Im gonna tell you how it all started. I am insecure and has a chinese blood making my eyes look like chinese that is sometimes insulted at by the cool kids but it is tolerable because it just happens like once every 2-3 weeks. When i Get insulted, i just laugh about it and not fight back so I thought insulting others is a way to make people laugh. So I started insulting one of my ex-classmate, let's name him Mario. Mario is a coolkid and has many connections with other classes and even a friend from the grade 10. He is with his friend Luigi while I was insulting Mario. We were playing football and when Mario asked where did the ball go, I said that the ball is him. He just laughed and said ""fuck you"" jokingly. Next week, Mario mentioned/tagged me in a joke which is unusual because we aren't that much close anymore. Simultaneously, I saw Mario saying something in twitter inderectly calling me out by saying ""we know all know someone who is a douchebag"" while tagging/mentioning Luigi and one of his classmate. I didnt mind because I thought he was referring to another person. Next few weeks, I was getting insulted at by his friends whenever i pass beside them. Mario managed to persuade more of his friends to go against me by mocking my profile pictures and my asian eyes. Now my friends in my class are now becoming fake and inauthentic to me already because they are Mario's true friends also.  One of my friends who is also my classmate, was one of the the last friends of Mario to be persuaded by Mario as he was by my side and was having ptty on me because of my situation and social status. Let us call him Heif. Heif and I were best friends and still I dumbly insulted him always about his hometown. In the past 2 weeks he started talking dirty on me and trash talking me. That moment, I realized this issue is much worse giving me anxiety and making me blush whenever I think about it. My fake friends including Heif who also are my seatmates, are now hiding my books and notebooks and because of it I have anxiety now. At any moment, they can hide them if Mario wanted to. I cannot report this bullying, cyberbullying and my fake friends hiding my books to the principal as I didnt not only insult Mario and Heif but also some of my friends in the snall school beside us. Let us call the school Duke. Mario is a coolkid so he also got connections with the coolkids in Duke. I knew this because one of the coolkids there who is his friend, keeps on waving  even though I confronted her in chat but she still kept on waving at me on the facebook messenger as a sign of disrespect and mockery to me. Let us call her Michelle. These coolkids on Duke has a high social status so they can persuade most of their classmates to hate me if they were told by Mario. In Duke, I also have a female friend name Lei, who I was talking to in social media for a year already. In the 1st semester of the school year, I was insulting her for being skinny as a twig. I sometimes also just leave her direct messages seen and snobb her sometime because I was having too much pride and looked upon myself so high. We were rant buddies before that but now she randomly asks me questions like ""what do you do if you get backstabbed your friends"" out of nowhere without any hello or introduction. I assume that she is persuaded by Michelle and her friends to go against me and help them because I insulted her before so they use her to ask me questions like that(only my assumption). Lei also doesn't listen to ke anymore whenever I rant to her and just laughs at my rants. Please help me I dont know what to do at my situation. I am trully regretting what I have done in the last months as an effect of my own insecurity and pride. I am also turning my self to Jesus for repentance and guidance. I also currently trying to change myself by not insulting anyone including my friends, praying more and not hurting my friends even jokingly. Heif recently said last week that he missed the old me who is noisy, insulting him jokingly and smacks him jokingly. I dont know if he is sincere about what he is saying or is also just a part of the plan of Mario. Please help me I am hopeless and I dont want to be an outcast for the remaining of my highschool life. Should I apologize to each one of them and if they don't stop the teasing then I report them? How do I apologize to them one by one? Or should I tell this to our guidance counselor and ask for help? Please give me ideas thanks.",27Jan2020,1

587,"I share an apartment with some roommates for years now. I am accustomed to only pay attention to my room. I don't use the kitchen, dining, living room and anything else. So in my naive mind I have no responsibility of cleaning them. I let my roommates do whatever they want with anything else as long as they won't bother me in my room. Although, i usually the one who collects and takes out the trash since they usually just leave it in trash bins around the place, its the full extent of my contribution to the cleaning. I do nothing else than just clean my room and trying not to touch anything else. I always assumed it is normal. But then one of my roommate left last month, and I a have a fresh new roommate. And here's how I f*ked up:

After hitting the gym, i came home and just walked to my room. Exhausted, i paid no attention to my new roommate who was sitting by the sofa. Well, i don't talk much. And all my remaining old roommates who still lives with me knows it. I rarely talk to them so they rarely talk to me. And we co-existed peacefully. But this new roommate reacted differently. As I was about to enter my room he let out a big sigh. Hint of frustration and anger.

""I just mopped the floor, now I have to mop it again. Such life..."" he exclaimed and ended it with another sigh. He didn't referred to me directly, so I pretended I didn't heard it and just locked myself up.

I just realized I'm the worst roommate. I never thought that my simple actions, such as walking from the front door to my room does affect the other people living with me. I wonder how much patience my other roommates have to deal with such a person like me.

I am currently curled up in my room thinking what should I do about this. And I just have to tell it to someone, so yeah, i have no one but reddit. Its currently eating me up. I actually planned to putting this in tifu, but as i tap this on my mobile its turning from a confession, to a rant, and to who knows what i really want for telling this. I just feel the need to tell it to someone, anyone.

I should apologize. But I'm too afraid to see how he would react. I can't handle conversations well, i might panic and end up saying worse things or i could break down. So... I'm just planning on buying a new mop, or new door mat, or some cleaning materials, or even an indoor shoe tomorrow and just *gift* it to him. But now that I think about it. Its worse. He might even get more offended. Will you be offended if your roommate gifted you cleaning stuff?

I... don't want to clean other people's filth. So I can't promise him about doing a part in cleaning the living room. He's the one who mostly spend his nights there when he invites company. So.. isn't it his responsibility to clean it? Argh. I'm deviating again from the point. I offended him, and I should apologize. Why is it so hard to do it? Maybe I should just kick him out so I don't have to deal with it. But my two other roommate would wonder why i kicked him out. And I would have to explain it to them that I'm stupid.

Aahh. I'm getting worse. Maybe I should just find a new place for my own. Dozens of thoughts swirling in my mind, just because of a simple f*cked up thing i did today. Why can't I just be normal? My head hurts so much, I'll just sleep it off for now and decide later what to do. So yeah, TIFU.",27Jan2020,1

I was originally going to post this last week, but I was drained emotionally and couldn't even fathom thinking about any longer. 

So, since the beginning of January, a job offer presented itself to me and it had ""potential"" written all over it. It was something right up my alley and couldn't have come at a better time (as I've been wanting to leave my current job for months). In the span of a week, I had a phone interview which led to me taking a personality exam, which then led to me filling out the official application and then finally coming in for the 1st in-person interview. It went very well and I had high hopes for this job (at this point, I even begun looking for apartments and doing to-do lists). Then, they wanted to schedule a 2nd interview, the following week, and during it, I had a weird feeling that something was off. I did the best I could and I knew it wasn't anything I did on my part, initially. Then, lo-and-behold, a few days later (last Thursday), I get the generic ""we've decided to move on"" e-mail.. Needless to say, I'm hurt..

I just find it a HUGE slap in the face that they would just send that to me without any explanation of why I didn't get the job, especially after countless interviews and being in contact with them, as if I wasn't anyone to them. A 5-minute phone call or a simple paragraph in an e-mail would've sufficed.

595,"Hey guys, I have been wanting to tell someone about this but I tend to bottle things up because I don't want to bother people with my problems, so I would like to see what you guys think.

It all happened about 3 years ago. I was 21 years old.  I met this girl online and we started talking. She lived in the US and I live in Canada. We had a lot in common and loved talking to each other. After a little while we started talking regularly, by that I mean every day, iMessage, Facetime, Snapchat, all that good stuff. 

It did not take long for the both of us to realize that we love each other. She was perfect for me and I did not want anyone else. We both established early on that we did not ever want to be in a long distance relationship with anyone because of how hard it is, but after realizing our feelings for each other (and that we were not that far apart compared to others), we decided that our love is worth it. 

**The only problem was**...My family members are all strict practicing muslims. And so was I. My parents did not let me do a lot. They did not let me hang out with friends, join a soccer team, get my licence. I went to school and back home, I did not have a social life, no friends. I was basically sheltered. Out of all my siblings, I was the sneaky one. I would sneak out the house to hang out with friends or even play soccer. When it came to girls, of course my family did not want me to be with girls, since contact with girls can lead to pre marital sex...I had to keep my first 2 relationships with girls a secret, and I had to keep my long distance relationship that I was in now a secret too. 

Until they found out about her. 

How they found out is a long story but when they did all hell broke loose. 

I told them how much I loved her and that I wanted to marry her if that's what it takes for us to be together, they told me to cut her off. She's not muslim which made it even worse. 

So I lied to them about cutting her off. We kept talking and even met in real life. After meeting her irl we realized that our love for each other was real and that we wanted to be together forever. 

To summarize, I ended up forcing myself to move out of my parents house so that I could continue my relationship with her. It was horrible. My parents and sisters lost their minds and could not believe I lied to them about cutting her off when i didn't.

It was extremely hard for me to move out and leaving my family, but they did not support me and my relationship. They told me if I leave, I will never hear from them again and they will not support me. It was hard. 

fast forward to now, and I am married to the love of my life. What started out to be a long distance relationship turned into marriage, and we live together in Canada now. 

I don't talk to my family, I have tried to get in touch and told them that I am truly sorry for what happened and how things turned out, but after receiving a call from my sister saying to never contact them again, it has been harder to deal with the fact that I was basically disowned for being with someone I love and makes me happy.

**I guess I just want to hear what you guys think and how I should cope with this. I think about them every day, we were a very tight knitted family, and I miss them a lot.** 

I love my wife and want to spend the rest of my life with her, it is just unfortunate that I had to pick one over the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.s. I just want to say appreciate your family and try to support them at all times. Family is all we got and if we are not supportive of each other, it's easy to lose each other. That's what I learned from all this. 

Please do not think that I am not happy with my relationship, I am the happiest man alive and my wife is perfect, I am just sad about the way things had to go with my family and every day I wish I would have my family AND my wife in my life.

Thanks for reading guys, I appreciate it a lot.",27Jan2020,1
596,"A friend of mine (F) messaged me a couple of days back about one of my classmates messaging her constantly and she wanted to know whether I had to do something with it. 

A little backstory (F) used to teach me in my freshman year and she quit teaching me and somehow we ended up being friends later on. Since then we've stayed in touch and became good friends. She still teaches in the same college and I'm in my senior year now.

She messaged me telling about the classmate that he's been texting her repeatedly even after she had not replied and kept him on read. I've told her to ignore him if she doesn't wants to engage with him because it's her personal preference whom she wants to talk to and not. She's emphasized on the fact that she wants to remain professional and not engage with students but somehow ends up replying out so that that she doesn't looks rude.

I'm a confused as to why she told me about him, because she could've taken care of him herself but rather than doing that she told me about it, does this mean that she wants me as well to abstain from talking to her?",27Jan2020,1
597,"My mom has got a photo editing app on her phone.

598,"Hi y'all. I'm 34, male, live in the U.S. Lower-middle class, have a wife, kids, and a good career. Job is stable and I'm decently successful -- work in communications/PR for a large health system. It's quite stressful at times, but I enjoy it and love what I do 95% of the time.

I've been having health issues for the last 12 months or so. Had what I  thought was a heart attack about 8 months ago. Turns out my heart is (by all accounts so far) healthy, and several docs have told me I shouldn't be concerned. I am also moderately overweight and have sleep apnea, which might be contributing to my problems somehow. Doc thinks I had a panic attack instead, and that my high blood pressure may have been a factor.

All my life, I've been confident and capable in nerve-wracking situations. I've given presentations in front of a group of executives, spoken at conferences in front of hundreds of people. I've been in dozens of pressurized situations and have handled myself well. I wouldn't have gotten to where I am now without being at least somewhat adept at handling stress. It used to give me positive energy and the good kind of butterflies when I had to speak in public or provide important information on a conference call.

But ever since I started having these health issues, something has drastically changed. I get super nervous and anxious when speaking in public, or even talking in person to a peer (ever worse if he/she is higher ranking than me) at work. Two weeks ago, I had an important call with the president of one of our hospitals, and I had to provide a report on something. I psyched myself up (or down) so much that my heart started to beat really fast and I thought I was having a heart attack again. It was only brought on by my nerves and anxiety of having to speak -- no other reason, really.

I think what's happening here is that I've replaced what used to be ""good"" butterflies and nervous energy with the anxiety and fear that I'd have another episode. Whenever I get heart palpitations or it skips a beat, the first thing I think of is -- oh crap, what if it's real this time?

I should add that my wife has had issues with mental/behavioral health her entire life, so I am quite familiar with that aspect. My doc asked me at my recent visit if I wanted a prescription for an anxiety med. I declined, because I think I can beat this without it somehow. I know there is no shame in taking something, but I am truly puzzled and almost angry that I used to be self-assured and confident, and now even the slightest bit of stress and pressure sets me off.

Sorry this is so long. Just looking for some feedback and insight from others. Has this happened to you? If so, how have you dealt with it?

Thanks!",27Jan2020,1

601,"I've posted a similar thing on r/helpme because I'm really desperate for some advice.

So I'm female, 20 and from Germany, so sorry if my english is bad

I'm in university right now, Law

So.... I'm sorry if this comes across as bratty... but I have everything I want in life, I have an okay family, a loving boyfriend, a wonderful dog and I'm not ugly or an addict or whatever, and that's honestly all I need. I dont need anything else, I dont want to travel or learn something new, have kids, a house or a car. Yes those things are nice to have, but I dont want/need them to be fulfilled. I could die right now and would say that I havent missed out on anything.

This gives me a major lack of motivation, I dont care to study, since I dont care if I'll get my degree or not (university is free here so it wouldnt waste money), since I own everything I want to have, I could work the rest of my life at McDonald's and wouldnt care, as long as I had food and a roof over my head. 
I also dont have any real hobbies, IF I have any free time (which is rare in uni) I mostly watch youtube videos, play videogames, look at memes or play with my dog, that's all I do. Nothing really interests me, so that's also not a motivation to study anything or work somewhere that's ""fun"" cause it's all uninteresting to me. 

That leads me to this week, my exams are soon and I just sit here crying... but why? Because I'll fail? I will surely fail because I didn't study..
 But i thought i didnt care if i fail, because i dont need this degree to be happy/fulfilled 
This hypocrisy of my feelings is making me crazy.
..... idk I just want to be someone who studied something??? To be better??? I guess?? But now, thinking about it, I dont really care about that either.

So.... tl;dr I have no goals, no dreams, nothing I want to do or achieve in life, so why continue? Why continue living? Why continue going to university? 

I hope this doesn't come across as bratty or as ""my life is so much better than yours"" 
I just hope someone has been in a similar situation and has any advice

I’m eighteen and my boyfriend has been living with my family for the past few months. He’s wonderful- we’ve worked really hard to make each other better people and I really do adore him. However, both of us have severe mental health issues and the other night we decided to try LSD for the first time which was the worst decision of my life. I was fine, but it caused him to have a psychotic break. He was hallucinating and yelling and screaming and stabbing the walls with scissors. My mom freaked out and called the police, and my boyfriend is terrified of the cops so when the cops came he grabbed me and held me because he was scared. The cops ripped him off of me and are trying to charge him with “domestic abuse” because of the way that it looked. He’s literally never put a hand on me in his life and he’s not violent at all. On top of it, the police put a mandatory restraining order between us that expires in around 2 more days. My mom is terrified of my boyfriend now and he’s never allowed back at the house. At the moment he’s getting help because he’s extremely suicide and i think he’s going to get hospitalized. I can’t live at my house anymore. It makes me way too depressed. I miss him so fucking much.

Right now, I am planning on moving as soon as he’s out of the hospital. His mental health is a lot better when he’s with me and i can’t live at home anymore. I have to live with him, and i think my moms about to kick me out anyway. I only have about $1000 in my bank account and he has around $2500.

We are only 30 minutes from a different county with a nice city! We really like the city and want to move back there (we both lived there when we were younger) it is more costly, however the schools are amazing!

We are a same sex couple and currently we are the only same sex couple with a child in our small run down town, (there is only one other couple around our ages and they are still in the party phase lol) The city offers more people who diverse and welcoming. We want our son to attend a school where we won’t have to fear him being bullied because of our martial status (he had some parents say things to other peers when he was in prek in this town). 

The schools in the city are really nice and better for him. They suit his needs and we are wanting him to go there. However where we live going out of district isn’t really possible so the only way to do that is to move. 

Here’s the issue, if we move we will then be a hour from my job. I have a great job where I make a good amount of money and have the flexibility to make my own schedule. I do not want to leave my job but I don’t know if commuting a hour every day to and from work is the best idea. I know I could possibly get a job in the city but I won’t have the flexibility I have now.

Background: 20s college student about to graduate. 

I work at this restaurant that has a bread logo. Recently they cut everyone's hours in half or more because one store got closer and more people transferred over to our store.

So I have been looking for another job when my hours got cut but, the cockroach sealed the deal that i just can't work there anymore.

613,"I recently got out of a relationship with a manipulator. When we argued at the end, he started insulting me over the phone and through text.

But I did take the time to get to know him and I knew what would hurt. I tried not to say it, but eventually I got so fed up with him and I wanted to hurt him, so I said it. That ended the conversation and he blocked me on everything. I deleted all our texts and deleted his contact information. 

I'm relieved it's over. He was using me and manipulating me and generally being mean and untrustworthy. I don't want anything more to do with him. I'm ashamed I ever got close with him. At the same time, I hate how mean I got. I hate that I wanted to hurt him at the end. This was the first man I ever said ""I love you"" to.

One person, Lisa, who we barely know, was only the party because she came with someone we know better, who is disabled and needed a lift. Lisa is a vocal Trump supporter. Her driving friend (who we have regular contact with) was told that if Lisa starts talking politics she will be asked to leave. We assume she told Lisa. 

During the evening, someone who did not know Lisa at all complained that Lisa was drinking her booze, of which, there was not a lot of. (Think filling an oversized wine glass with champagne.) After the party, another person, who did not know Lisa, let me know that she had overheard a disturbing discussion where Lisa was saying that immigrants should not be welcome in the country. 

I am happy to never see Lisa again. Even when I first me her, and knew nothing about her,  I had a bad vibe about her. I believe she feels entitled to come along to any activity as she is part of the group despite not getting a specific invite. The problem arises as she is ingrained in this friendship group so we will have more get-togethers at my house and the chance for her to come.

624,"I've been recovering from a NDE after giving birth to my daughter last April, the whole experience left me traumatised and I've been receiving therapy for PTSD so my mental health is fairly dire at the moment.

I pushed myself to take on a little cleaning job for a few hours per week to give me a sense of normality. The boss of the company was making personal remarks on my first day such as ""beautiful"" and so on. I was polite and returned the compliments which was my first fuck up. I would say something like ""oh thanks John you look nice today too""

I felt awkward but did my best not to show that, I was worried about offending him and there being a bad atmosphere when I came in.

I told my partner that I felt uncomfortable around ""John"" and told him why. I wanted to throw the towel in and not return but my partner encouraged me to return to the job and stick it out.

Within a couple of days because I hadn't outright told him to sod off and I outwardly seemed to be unbothered by the flirting (I lack confidence and assertiveness) he progressed to following me into the toilets where I was cleaning and kissed me, whilst trying to put his hand down my trousers.

I froze in fear momentarily then pushed him away and said ""no, stop. I'm not doing things like that in here"" when what I should have said was not to touch me and that I'm not interested. That was my second fuck up.

He processed my choice words as me being interested but just not wanting to do anything in the toilets so he clearly felt able to make another move later on.

Another day i had to visit another site to clean which was a couple of miles up the road. It was at the side of a motorway with no pedestrian access and it was torrential rain outside. He said he would take me so I didn't need to walk by the side of the motorway in torrential rain, on a small grassy ledge, in darkness. I accepted the lift. That was my third fuck up.

On the way he pulled into a secluded spot and initiated things, I didn't want to have sex with him but went along with it because I felt railroaded.

I realise this isn't rape, but I feel violated and taken advantage of because he was in a position of authority over me and I didn't feel able to assert myself. I allowed him to have sex with me when I didn't want it, I feel disgusted and ashamed of myself and it is bringing back trauma from when I was actually raped many years ago.

630,"Hi I need advice. I recently fell in love with a dog on the RSCPA's website, hes been there for so long and the poor thing needs a home. I rang my family for advice and they all told me it was majorly irresponsible but wouldn't give me any reasons why. I'm asking for advice because generally, not to sound harsh, my family underestimate me a lot and seem to think i am a party animal with no self control which i just tend to disagree with. I am a university student on my final year, i am in uni once a week and do most my studying in my room. I work but i am home all day 3 days a week usually and im always home in the evenings. I have set aside £500 to cover adoption fees and pet health insurance for the first month as well as any vet bills. I will then top the rest of the insurance up with my wages as i go. I've never thrown a party in this flat and go clubbing about once a month and honestly don't actually enjoy it. I will be getting a 9-5 job next year but my wages will go up then and i will be able to afford a dog walker so he isn't alone all day everyday, i will also still have my flatmate pottering about on the days i'm not in. I do not want to adopt a dog if i can't give it a good home. Do you think it would be irresponsible for me to get a dog because I'm not 100% sure what the future will bring, or is it okay because i have planned ahead accordingly?

(I have also asked my flatmate if it was okay and explained that it would mean she couldn't have loud groups of people over and she agreed that that isn't an issue since we don't do it anyway).",27Jan2020,1

633,"Just a brief history my wife and I have been trying for almost a decade before my son was conceived. Finally that miracle happened for us. We where so excited when we seen the first ultrasounds I remember my whole perspective changing in a fraction of a second. From young and irresponsible to I'll do anything and everything to give this child everything I didn't. My heart was fluttering, happiness took me over and for the first time I felt whole. Like it didnt matter who I was, or anything unfavorable I had done. All that mattered was this little wonderful life....
We finally get to the day of my wonderful son Wendell!
When he was born he had some respiratory issues. Not for any reason in specific. Anyway, my sweet 6 lb 7 oz baby boy came into this world. He had to be taken to the NICU due to him breathing very quickly. 
My wife had gotten an epidural so she wasn't allowed to get out of the bed until she could move her legs. So I was the only one to be able to go and see him.
I remember walking in there so nervous and scared. And then I seen him. I finally was standing next to my little angel. When I walked in he was crying and fussing so much. The nurses said he wouldn't calm down. I reached into the bassinet and touched his foot and he just calmed down. I connect with him so much at this moment. Really stuck thru the beautiful time I got to share with him. 
Oh I an sorry I really want to share all the amazing moments I got to spend being the happiest dad in the whole world.
(I'm sure that's how every dad feels)
But on November 12 I lost the biggest part of myself. I woke up that morning to find my son in his bassinet blue and unresponsive. I'm unable to go anymore into it. 
I am just lost know. My son was so much more than just the gift of having a child. He was hope! He gave me the role of his father which I was so proud of. For the first time in my life I was  proud of myself because I knew I wasn't just a good father in was a great father. Which when I  lost that my sweet baby boy. I lost the pride I finally felt for myself. I lost my heart.
I miss him every single day. I feel so lost. I'm seeing counselor's.  And psychiatric doctor. But i dont want to be all medicated.
I just am looking for a way to feel a bit of happiness again. A bit of something. And to not just be paralyzed by any thought or visual reminder of my son. I want to remember him. The time inched with him was the happiest I have ever been. 
Any help on maybe grieving information or anything honestly Im trying to find help any way I can.
I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and /or is able to help with info personal experience. Or even just say a prayer. Thank you all have a wonderful day.",27Jan2020,1

I could get a perfect 10 hours of sleep before having a lecture in this building, and 20 minutes in will start to misread sentences on the slides like I'm tripping on drugs, hallucinate, be in a dream-like mind state, doze off unexpectedly (like microsleeps), unable to maintain any focus, all the while counting down the minutes till it's over.

639,"Hello,

I am a US citizen trying to help my aunt in Peru with finding 24/7 care for her disabled 23 year old son with severe cerebral palsy on a feeding tube. He cannot speak or really move, but he smiles and makes sounds - my aunt lives him dearly and lives for him. She cares for him day and night and has a home nurse that comes while she is working. Any income she makes is to care for him but it is now imperative she care for herself as she is having heart and blood circulation problems.

I want to help her find a nursing home that can genuinely care for him 24/7 but it is so difficult to find a good one online. She said she tried one nursing home by the government but they treated him so badly she thought they would let him die. She vowed never to leave him again but I don't want her die from poor health.

- Does anyone know of any good resources for people with severe disabilities in Peru? 
- Are there any nursing homes in Peru that give genuine 24/7 care that we can trust?

I understand this will cost money but I intend to help with some and hope some other family members can help donate to her. She needs help and I feel terrible if she dies from poor health because no one helped.

Any recommendations would be amazing and genuinely appreciated!! Thank you .

648,"I'm someone who likes to acquire all kinds of random knowledge and enjoys learning, so I generally know lots of things that others around me don't. 

I THINK I'm a very nice, easygoing person. I'm also shy and introverted, and quite insecure because of an abusive childhood, but because I know how cruel the world can be, I try my best to enrich the lives of the people around me. 

There is something I've struggled with for most of my life without understanding why: I never come across as shy or insecure. Instead, I seem arrogant and condescending to people whenever I try to contribute to conversation. I've lost jobs and friends due to this, and I still don't understand why. I've been to therapy and the psychologist did not understand why I come across as arrogant either.

My boyfriend has a theory: he thinks because of my low self-esteem, I take more pride in knowledge than other people would, so when I talk to someone, this pride makes it seem like I'm putting myself on a pedestal while putting the other person down. This is obviously not my intention at all - so how do I learn some humility? How can I talk to people or explain something to someone without seeming arrogant or condescending? 

I honestly don't think I'm being condescending when someone asks me a question or something, but it's always received that way. For example, last night my boyfriend asked me to explain a computer script I'd written. So I explained the code to him. Knowing he was lacking the background to understand the function, I supplied said background but he interrupted me and told me ""you are doing it again, I know what the dollar sign means for christ's sake you don't have to talk to me like I'm 5"". But the thing is, he DOESN'T know. That's exactly why I explained it. 

Can you tell me how I can communicate better?",27Jan2020,1
649,"First off I apologize this will be a long post because it’s a lot of info, but please read I am desperate for some advice on how to make this situation better for all involved. My boyfriend and I have been together now for almost a year. We are both on the verge of age 40 and have known each other since high school. He used to date a friend of mine so my children have known him for about seven years now and they used to adore him, they used to pick and play around all the time with him, but now they absolutely hate him and I’m at a loss of how to make it better. Just to give some back story, my boyfriend has a history of drug abuse and bad decisions on his part, all of which I knew going into the relationship. His last relationship of six years was with a close friend of mine and we all spent a lot of time together going out on double dates and doing things with all of our kids, I at one point in time did not have a very good opinion of him myself because of his choices and actions that led to my friend being hurt and him doing some prison time.My children also know of his past and have never judged him for it prior to him becoming involved with me. I do understand that kids will worry and that they may feel like a new boyfriend equals less of my time for them but we always try to include them and I make sure to take time to spend with them one on one as well. He has been clean for almost two years now and is really trying to do better for himself and those who care about him. He has a great job and we have so many plans for our future. I have been a struggling single Mom and I haven't always made the best choices in my love life  but I have never turned to drugs and I have never stopped being a mother to my kids. I have always struggled and will admit that life has never been easy for me. My 13 year old son is on a waiting list for a kidney transplant for issues he was born with, and my oldest son who is 18 is currently doing some time in prison for simply being at the wrong place wrong time. Needless to say I have my plate full with my fair share of stress that I shoulder alone. When my boyfriend started pursuing me I fought against it for months before giving in because I guard my heart heavily and I knew that his past relationships have failed due to his inability to stay clean and make good choices and I was scared to take a chance on him. Plus you just don’t date your friends exes, right? But he was persistent and refused to take my ""no"" seriously. My ""friend"" and I had a falling out due to issues not related to him and I found out the hard way that she never really was a true friend but merely another person who sadly is only looking out for their own wants and needs in life and has no clue how to be a true friend. I am convinced that he is the love of my life, I have never felt so at home with anyone like I do him. He shows me everyday how much he loves me and my kids. He does everything in his power to make sure we don't need or want for anything if it's within his power to do. So when he recently asked me to marry him I said yes and we have moved in together excited to finally after years of searching found our missing pieces. We both agree to live together for a while and not be in a rush to get married. My three children and my disabled Mother are the other occupants of our home. Throughout the last few years I have battled depression and anxiety and have let things slide with my home and my children that I would normally not tolerate because I just didn't have the fight in me?This has of course created some bad habits with my kids because I have been so consumed with my internal fight to make a big deal out of little things or just let them slide because it was easier and now I have three children who don’t take responsibility for themselves who feel like they have to be anything other than lazy for lack of a better word. My boyfriend tries to help me by getting the kids to pick up after themselves, and spend less time with electronics and other things, he genuinely wants to help us better our lives and ensure that we have a great future ahead of us. But my kids hate him, they refuse to show him any respect and are always making sure that they disregard his thoughts and feelings about anything and everything. They make it known to him that they don’t like him and have no respect for him no matter how that makes him or I feel. I can’t get through to them no matter how hard I have tried. I have tried sitting them down and telling them how happy he makes me and that he only wants what’s best for them but all they can see is an asshole that isn’t worthy of their respect or affection of any kind. One of the big reasons for this is my Mother. She despises my boyfriend and thinks that he is still the same person he was in the past. She believes whole heartedly that he is only using me and will eventually backslide into his old routines and lifestyle of lies, drugs and deceiving people leaving me empty handed and in a situation worse than he found me in.Her opinions are not hidden from my children and they all talk about him like he’s trash not worthy of a second thought when he or myself is not around. My mom simply cannot look past his past to see what and who he is now and it breaks my heart. She thinks I’m blinded by my desire for a lasting love and bond in my life. I have been lonely and of course I want that connection like everyone does. Yes my boyfriend and I have argued and yes some mean and hurtful things have been said on both sides, no relationship is perfect. Hes always quick to admit when he's wrong and apologize, he even admits to my kids when he is wrong . But when it comes down to it he is truly a blessing in my life and the majority of our arguments have been brought on by either the disrespect and contempt he is shown by not only my kids but my mother as well. He has cried to me numerous times telling me that he feels so unwanted and unwelcome here and it breaks his heart that they won't give him a chance to prove he is worthy of their trust and respect. My kids are ages 11, 13 and 16 and have been raised to show respect for all people no matter who they are. This is all something new to me to have them behave this way. I understand that they feel like he isn’t their dad so he can’t tell them what to do, but he doesn’t boss them around he simply asks them to do something like take out the trash, or to keep their bedrooms clean to help me out and they rudely refuse to or just argue and back talk him until him and I both are aggravated and end up mad at each other over it. It doesn’t help matters that my Mom is openly vocal to not only me but my kids as well on her feelings about my boyfriend and she is unwilling to even give him a chance, she is constantly telling me that she thinks he’s doing drugs, or that he needs to do this or that differently, nothing is ever good enough and to her everything about him is a lie. But the truth is, he has the biggest and most giving heart of any man I have ever met. He owns his past and willingly admits to every mistake and choice he’s ever made and tries his very best every single day to be better than the day before. He isn’t perfect and doesn’t claim to be, he’s just wanting to build a future with me and my kids and they along with my mom are refusing to even try to give him a chance. I know that it won't be better overnight but I have literally seen no progress and it puts a strain on our relationship because I feel so torn. This relationship is one I thought long and hard about before I decided to get involved, there are no secrets between us, I know EVERY bad thing he’s ever done and that addiction and multiple drug use in the past is how he coped with his feelings. He has definitely been no saint. With that being said I also see the efforts he has made to change himself for the better. He works hard everyday, helps with bills and other household costs. He even makes sure that everyone’s wants are met to the best of his ability. He made sure that I was able to take the kids on a vacation over the summer, their first one ever because being a single Mom to four kids is hard! I have tried explaining to my family how I feel about him and that we are both serious about this relationship. We’re both adults and we deserve to be happy without our pasts lingering over our heads. Any advice on how to go for my happiness and make it work without alienating myself fromy family? My children are my world and my Mom is my best friend, I don't want them to be unhappy or think that I don't care about their feelings. While as a mother I understand my Moms reservations and feelings about him and my choice. I also understand that my kids are rebelling against him for various reasons but I don't understand why they hate him so much and refuse to give even a little, they won't even try. I truly love this man with all my heart and I feel like I deserve some happiness. I am not so blinded by love that I forgot about his past but I am a firm believer that people can and do change and that love does wonders to heal hearts and make people want to do better. I am at a loss on how to make them all see that he is everything I have ever wanted in a partner, full of life, overflowing with love and willing to take on the world just to prove it all. He not only wants me to be happy but he wants my kids to be happy as well. He would without a doubt give them the world if they would only let him. I would never choose a man over my kids, but I need and deserve to be happy too, he has made me want to be better for myself and my family. I need advice on how to proceed from here and still somehow keep everyone happy without sacrificing this love that I have searched for so long and have needed so badly, or sacrificing my children and my mom's love or respect.

i recently visited a friend &amp; seeing the way her animals were treated really just shocked me &amp; as i have many animals myself i have a very strong instinct to want to save &amp; protect them but i feel very helpless. thus the reason i’m making this post as i’m looking for advice on what i should do.

.

the dog stays in the small garden where no dog house or shed is provided as shelter from the cold or rain with dirty food/water bowls. the dog’s waste has also not been cleaned as it looks about a month or two’s worth of poo. it isn’t allowed inside the house &amp; will be physically hit if it does. temperatures over here hover at about -1°C at night &amp; it rains here constantly as well which concerns me. the dog overall has a very matted &amp; greasy coat. 

there’s also a kitten which stays in their tiny square bathroom. when i visited, the litter box was completely filled with again dirty water/food dishes. there are no toys supplied for stimulation &amp; i assume it just lies in there. when i approached it, it seemed very scared although this could just be down to the cat’s personality &amp; not a fault to the owners. 

so my question is,, what do i do? i haven’t stopped thinking about these animals &amp; i’m very close to the family who owns these pets so i’m really unsure.",27Jan2020,1

This is because I'm usually very chatty in class, and a lot of my smart comments are made in class also.

I try really hard to not be so chatty, like, when I'm talking in my head I'm like ""just shut up"" but I keep talking and whenever the oppertunity arises to make a smart comment I just make it without commenting. The teachers also get quite pissed off alao. 

My sense of humour is also pretty controversial and although I don't mean anything I say and I always say ""I'm only joking"" afterwards I still get this feeling that people might think I'm an asshole.

Basically, I just need advice on how I can be less chatty, how to stop making these smart comments and should I change my humour?",27Jan2020,1

666,"So, just want to start off by saying this is my first Reddit post. 

To begin, I'm a third year Aerospace Engineering student at Ryerson University, based in Toronto. All throughout my university career, being a pilot has always been at the back of my head. After I get my degree, I plan to be a full time pilot, as its something I'd like to pursue. Last summer I started flying on the side and I enjoyed it. I completed a few tests and got some certificates pertaining to being a pilot.

Fast forward to today and I'm starting my second semester of third year here and I just recently failed some of my courses from the previous semester. All in all the damage was done and I'll have to extend my graduation to 2022.

Last semester I started getting extremely bored of the courses and the course load started to get intense. I worked my ass off but still failed. I understand now that it's my fault for taking a full course load rather than spacing it out. And now I'm at an impasse. My parents have discussed this with me and through contemplation I've arrived at two options: in 2 years I can either finish my engineering degree and slog my way through it, or I can drop it and become a full time pilot by going through a certain program. Of course, I know that becoming a pilot will include studies that are just as hard as what I'm doing.

My Dad is a pilot himself so I would have the advantage in the pilot field, as he has said himself, but I can't help but think of all the hard work and studying that would be wasted in my engineering degree. And so that's where I am right now. I've decided that I would like to ask you guys and I'm also talking to others as well for insight into this.

In summary, I want to be a pilot but I have two years left of my engineering degree. What should I do? Thank you for reading.

P.S. I posted this in r/flying already but I could use some general advice from anyone as well.",27Jan2020,1

669,"My girlfriend (26 F) and I (26 M) have been together for a few years now and things are getting pretty serious. I tend to be the kind of person who dates with the goal of finding my eventual wife and have never been in a relationship less than a year long. We have talked about marriage at some point down the road and both of us are thinking that's something we want. Our relationship has been nothing but excellent. We communicate well, are very honest with one another ,and trust each other absolutely. We don't fight if we have a disagreement, we just talk it out. This has been the healthiest and happiest relationship I've ever been in. 

The issue: I don't want kids and never have. I had expressed my disinterest in having children before and she didn't really seem to feel strongly about it either way. But we talked about it again and she admitted she had never really thought about it as she kind of just assumed that would happen in her future. She told me now that she's thought about it, she feels like she wouldn't be able to commit to definitely not having them. We both cried a lot and I told her I'd need some time to really think about it.

I am trying to do a deep dive into why I don't want them. I think a major reason is I had a tough childhood. I was put through 2 divorces (one when I was 4 between my parents and one when I was in high school between my mother and her second husband who was a stong father figure in my life in addition to my dad) and I'm terrified of both divorce and putting children through what I went through. My mother is also a severe alcoholic and extremely manipulative which contributed to both. Alcoholism skips generations so any children I have would be at risk. I've never loved children, but I have a big family and am around them a good amount. I could see why people like having them. I've just always liked the idea of being an uncle so I don't have to be responsible for them all the time. I don't know if I just convinced myself I don't want kids because of trauma of my childhood or if I legitimately do not want them and figuring that out will determine if I get to marry the woman of my dreams or have to let her go. Does anybody have some insight? I don't know what to do.",27Jan2020,1
671,"I work as a McDonald's crew worker. I’m 18. I just found out from my crew trainer that I got thrown into the 'deep end'. As in, after 3 training shifts, they already threw me in drive thru where everything is timed 

And apparently, people aren't supposed to start drive thru unless they've done 1 month at front counter stuff. Since lots of drive thru people are leaving (specifically overnighters). So I got put into 'fast track mode'. 

He told me that it would be a shocking fact to other co-workers if they knew that I went straight to drive thru. And so far, that has been 100% true. 

And he told me he is mad at management for this, since its not right and to ignore other co – workers who yell at me for being slow, because its not my fault that I just got thrown in there. So yeah they want me to learn to take orders thorugh the mic, packaging orders, fries, drinks, desserts, cleaning, restocking. It's stressful. Since it's mainly coworkers pressuring and yelling at me for being slow at drive thru

&amp;#x200B;

12 hours from now, I’m having a 5 hour shift. The last shift I had, the manager talked with me privately and pretty much told me something along the lines of “You are too slow. I understand its your first job. But you’ve been here for 1 month and getting twice as much hours as most trainees. You should be better by now. What do you need help with? I am expecting a big improvement for your next shift.” 

But I just cant shake the feeling that, somewhere down, she might be thinking of firing me. Maybe im not worth the money or the time or effort to keep. Fuck. It just sucks. Maybe,she can instead plead with a more experienced, morning drive thru person to do overnights or find some other staff who can fill in from another Mcdonald’s branch. Or find another new person to train who can get so much better than me within the same timeframe that I was given. 

Also, I checked my roster and the shift 12 hours from now, is the only one I have ‘rostered’ for now. Usually before, I would have rostered hours at least 2 weeks in advance. 

So that doesn’t help shake off the feeling that in 12 hours, its make or break. 

I already asked her if I can train more and have more hours during mornings/mid-days, but she said that she does not need anymore morning people, since when I got approached, she was specifically looking for overnighters. 

Like, literally, after every shift I had. Afterwards, I go into the crew room and try to remember all the new things I learnt and write it down on my notes. They end up being about 100 - 200 words after each shift. I even took screenshots of each screen on the order taking so I can help memorise it and get faster once the manager told me she wanted me to improve faster, early on. 

I go through all of my notes before each shift and the gallery of screenshots. It has helped. But, yeah. Apparently, not enough. Sigh. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning, I thought I would be fine; I thought you know, I would just do the training, they’ll give me a reasonable timeframe or that someone will mostly be there to help me out until its no longer needed. 

To be honest, I can get over (a modest) 80% of orders correct on drive thru (listening through the headset). Sometimes, I just cannot hear the customer and ask them to drive through the next window OR I cant find a rare item that no one orders and then I go get help. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I was to rate myself modestly, compared to the most experienced people there:  

* Headset order taking, 6/10
* For packaging orders, 6/10
* Presenting, drinks and desserts 7/10  
* Helping out front counter at the sides, 7/10
* Fries, 9/10 
* Cleaning &amp; Restocking, 5/10 

&amp;#x200B;

And its just so fucking unfair. I started at the same time as this girl. And she gets about twice as much shifts as me. And of course, she is a lot better. And, of course I don’t think she gets asked and told by the manager that she ‘is moving to slow’ and that the manager is ‘expecting a big improvement’ from her. Fucking hell. I even told her that I only get 2 - 3 shifts a week and she said, “Oh, that’s weird.” She gets 4 – 5 a week. 

I found out from my crew trainer that he is leaving next week and I think that is what motivated the manager to have a private talk with me about my progress. And yeah, she did mention that overnight people are leaving and the reason why I’m hired is to replace them. 

The entire situation just seems unfair and cruel. I honestly think, just in my opinion. It would take at least 75 - 100 hours for a person to be at a decent level, say 8/10. I’ve done 50 hours so far. Idk. Or maybe im just terrible at this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck do I do? Its nerve wracking. Fuck. Sigh. I’m worried about: 

* Embarrassing myself, my family, friends – I mean, getting fired/replaced is always going to be somewhat embarrassing. No matter what. It’s common. 
* Looking like a fool, incompetent – me getting fired/replaced, might signal to others that I’m stupid, a fool, incompetent, etc. And they’d be probably think, ‘getting fired from a Mcdonald’s job?’ 

&amp;#x200B;

But you know. This job is really important to me. I’ll stick through it and try my best. There’s nothing else I can really do. I mean there IS no point getting mad at myself, for trying my best. There is nothing more I can do. If it comes to me getting fired/replaced, I'll make it through. It will just be difficult. But at least, a learning experience. Sigh. It's just hard.

672,"Hello, I am in major need of advice. I work for a sign company and I am currently an assistant to my boss (who is the manager over sales). Basically, I handle providing what a client needs sign wise if my boss is too busy to handle it. Currently, it is just my boss and one other sales person who are handling all the jobs coming in. Except, the other sales person doesn't really do their job. They are suppose to be driving around and trying to get more accounts but they don't. 

Anyways, my boss likes to consider me to be in sales since I help them take care of certain accounts on my own with them stepping in to advise if I don't know what to do. But I haven't had the discussion yet with them about actually moving into sales and doing what the other sales person is supposed to be doing. We talked it about last year when I received my review but then that was the last of it. I think they slowly are trying to get me into the hang of doing it on my own (we have gone out on drives to different properties to look at signs). 

Everyone is telling me to just bring up the conversation with my boss but I am so nervous to ask them. I am on the fence on whether my boss is waiting for me to take the initiative to ask or to just wait until my boss gives me another review (which I don't know when that going to happen.)

674,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months on and off a lot but it was never as serious as our last break up. We broke up and were apart for about 2 weeks. Now this time was different and I wanted to be done for good so I was going on dates and seeing other people. So we hung out a few times while we were broken up and one of the times we had unprotected sex. So after all this happened, I find out that the same day we broke up, he went and spent the night with his ex and they had unprotected sex. This made me mad because 1, he had unprotected sex with me after the fact that he had unprotected sex with her. 2, he lied about 100 times before he finally told me the truth but only because I told him I would drop it. Even after I found out, he tried to lie about it and then came clean and then started to try and lie about it AGAIN. And he was making me feel bad for accusing him when I was right all along. Now here's where I come in, I had safe sex with 2 people while we were broken up, I never told him that when we were trying to work things out again. The reason I didn't tell him is because I wanted him to have to find out the same way I did, through going into each other's phones and accounts. So eventually he found out about one person and i told him about it. He asked me to put everything on the table and i still lied and said that was it. Then he found out about the second person and i told him everything. The only reason I didn't tell him is because he lied to me. So he messaged the 2 people and sent them a photo of me with his dick in my mouth WITHOUT my consent. And now we're together again trying to work things out and build trust. He told me he wants to go have sex with another person to even the score. And he's been throwing it in my face saying I fucked up way worse but when i tell him he did too, he says I keep going back and forth with that tit for tat shit. And some other minor things to add is that when he was staying at his exes, he was in her messages trying to get back together with her and etc. We both hurt each other but I don't feel like I'm the one that did worse.

Without getting into too much unnecessary detail, he’s open to try penetration but I’m nervous he’s pushing himself into things he isn’t comfortable with to try to please me. I’ve told him about this fear, and he insists he isn’t.

 Background: I have big anxiety problems, as a disclaimer I have never took therapy, but I had a dedicated school psychologist (councillor I believe it's called) which advised me to go to therapy. My dad abused me physically and mentally (being extremely harsh with me, pushing me to my limits to study and all, be used to beat me for smaller inconveniences and had many  awful bruises which I used to hide as a long time I was at blame. Have been suicidal and it took me too much to accept that this is not normal... father was always against therapy, he knew I needed it, he was shaming me for harming myself and never allowed me to try to search for help. I grow no fking crazy kid, yeah...)

So that's my background. I'm older now, I ran in another country to go to college (even as a major person he was still acting like shit, yet he was more docile as I was always ""the black sheep, rebel one""and ""gave up on me"", meaning the abuses decreased, but never stopped). I never could've have an option and could've never say no to him.


Now, my current problem:still not taking therapy, I feel that I can't, I'm in a foreign country and am afraid as hell of therapy... so yeah... also, I am a bit better. But. I can't say no to anyone. Like there are some rare moments when I can, but mostly after me trying to have a compromise. E.g. someone wants to eat smth from my launch box. I'm like fck I'm starving, I won't be eating anything else in hours, but sure thing, eat as much as you can. This is just a thing.... or when someone wants me to give them smth, i don't want to... yet I'm doing it.

The rare occasions I say no is when I can ""blame"" someone else for my response. Or smth else. But never coming from me...

I hate myself each time it happens, I'm overthinking and I can't stand it anymore...

686,"I  went to school the first time to pursue a career as a health teacher. I  failed because I failed biology when my teacher wouldn't let me miss a  lab because I was seeing my grandpa before he passed away in another  state.

The 2nd I pursued Pharmacy Tech.

3rd time I pursued Medical Admin.

Now I am in for Medical Coding/Billing.

Alright so clearly I suck at medical stuff. I just don't understand it. And I am terrible at Math.

Back  in the Myspace days I got really good at coding and creating my own  layouts n stuff when I was 14. I also took a computer class where we  built desktops from scratch and learned all about computer language.  That was one of the only classes I ever got an A+ in. I do love  computers and all things tech.

I  also used to play around with alot of graphic design. (I like art, it's  just I always get the vibe that anything involving art, you'll be like a  starving artist and I have a big family to provide for.)

Now  I'm 32, and have 5 kids and work part time at Amazon. What I like about  Amazon is not having to work directly with the public. That's why I  decided to go for Coding/Billing because I knew it would be a solitary  job behind the scenes not dealing with the public. After years in  retail, I'm good on ppl.

What i'm in doubt is If i should/could text an ex-friend , it's been a year since i broke up this 8year old friendship, she is a female and i'm a male, yes i loved her and still do, but nothing happened between us, our friendship was really solid through the years, If i could describe our behavior around each other It would be like the youtubers Michael Reeves and Lilypichu, lots of fun, provocation and good chemistry in general even though we are different, she knew that i likes her, i confessed 3 times and for shut down 3 times, but that never really affected our friendship, no awkwardness around us, most of our time we would share our emotional bags with each other, i liked helping her to the point i started helping the emotional luggage of her whole family, her Brother with depression and relationships,her sister with her insecurities, her father with finding hinself and How to build trust, her mother with how to not let people abuse your trust in others(her parents were starting to broke up), she really loved her family and always thanked me for helping, i really enjoyed this feeling, then i started baking for fun and when i do It i always gave her a piece of whatever i was cooking that day, i started a tradition of always cooking something on her birthday, i started making a big deal of her birthday every single year, making a party, inviting her friends and always making an effort to make her happy, she always thanked me for It, i was her solid rock (that was what i was told so), then things started to go south 1 and a half years before the break up, i've notice she not texting back, we barely see each other, i ended up going out with her family more then her, she started making excuses saying she is too busy with college and too tired yet she posted photos skating and going out, i belived her at first, i even started developing with her a daily rotine and making some good food for her health, i was really worried about her, but she always sounded distant, i want to see if she really was avoiding me, i made a decision to not make the iniciative, and that's how i spended half an year without talking to her because she didn't texted me once, i broke the silence because i couldn't go any longer, the moment i texted her she start saying that she was about to text me asking for help to an assignmet on college ( i've did the same course before), and like q fool i helped her because i wanted to be close to her, things didn't get better from there, i cicle of her only talking to me when she needed something and saying sweet things and that the world would crash if we got separeted, i  reached the boiling point 2 days before her birthday, she started speaking her plans for the birthday and how i could her doing it,  at the moment i hold al my anger an said "" thanks for all those years of friendship i really enjoyed the time we spended together, but i think we should move on...."" The first thing she replied was "" but what about my party?"" I couldn't read a word after that and i blocked her.... Well the next day her boyfriend came after me saying that she was all tears and i really messed her up and asked why i can not go to her party, also saying that i shouldn't be mad at her because she is not hanging out with me anymore (i never told her why i left), i only replied ""this is a personal matter and i don't belive i can keep going with how things are, bye"" .... Today is her birthday (one year later)and i'm feeling a void since i left her, i really want to text her but i'm not sure... Should i do It? I'm feeling bad about this.",27Jan2020,1
690,"Hi Redditors 

This morning I was at Snap Fitness with my cousin, which is a 24/7 gym. To get into the building you scan a membership card in front of the doors. Please don't shame me, but I'm a broke college student, I do not have a membership there. My cousin has a membership, so I sneak in using her card, but she is always with me. 

While we were on the treadmill we were discussing spring break plans. Talking about the different cities we could see and the things we could do. We always travel together because we have similar interests while being tourists. The workout and conversation were nothing out of the ordinary and we were fine. Until I ask the fateful question, ""Can my boyfriend come?"" 

My cousin and I live together and my boyfriend lives across the street from us. They know each other and have spent considerable time together, so it wouldn't be awkward if he was around. 

I swear, her attitude flipped like a switch. Her first response to my question was, ""Why would you ask a  question like that?"" I was so confused because what would be the problem with this? She continued with her rage, in the middle of a snap fitness at 7am... Saying things like "" I can't believe you!"" ""You're cut off."" ""Would you want to come on a trip with me and my boyfriend??"" She kept swearing and yelling at me because I asked this question. Her last comment was, ""Actually, I'll just go with \_\_\_\_\_\_"" I was so confused as to where this came from. She raised her voice, I feel, very inappropriately. If she really had a problem with him coming, I feel she should've said something along the lines of, ""I'd rather it just be us two."" Or ""Maybe next time."" 

I responded with ""It was literally just a fucking question. You could've been nicer about it."" I got off the treadmill, just to walk away from the situation and not bring anymore attention to us. As I was getting off she said, ""Yea, you can walk home."" Our house is 3 miles away and its freezing (We live in MN). So I guess I had to walk home. 

Honestly, this argument shouldn't have been a big deal, she has an odd way of expressing emotions and initial responses are raw. Which can lead to hurt feelings. But anyways, we would've talked about it and gotten to the bottom of what really was bothering her. What happens after is why I'm writing this, I need advice on how to respond, feel, idk. I just don't know what to do. 

So I started to walk home. But I realized my keys were in her car. Which I figured she would leave in her car or on the dining room table because that's where we put the mail or like anything that the other roommates may need. I get a text when I'm half way home from her that says ""Your keys are at snap.""

I was livid! !!!!!!!!! why? Why! would she do that!!!!!!!!!! My keys have my ID and 2 credit cards in them, along with ALL the keys I need for my car and house. Firstly, I have no way of getting into snap because I am not a member, but the workers just saw me there so if I walk in without a membership card they're gonna be like ???????? uh? So I have no way of getting into the building. Secondly, when I did get into snap fitness, she hadn't left them with front desk. She put them into a cubby at the front of the gym. These cubbies don't have doors, literally anything you have in them can be seen. She left my keys with my ID and 2 cards for anybody to take. I don't like this. I feel violated, like she didn't care that someone could easily get my address and had access to cards. I need advice about how to respond. I need help with how to approach the situation. If you think I am in the wrong PLEASE let me know. I was to correct this situation without it getting worse, but honestly I feel so disrespected and betrayed. I am so anxious about my card or keys getting stolen, so the fact that she did this is...... unbelievable.",27Jan2020,1

694,"We broke up and decided we were better off as friends. I miss the companionship of it because now we just mostly text and don’t hang out at all (I also have no want for the relationship to start again it ended for a good reason). So the discussion of the past relationship we tip toe around for various reasons, some due to trauma. I want to be her friend but I think texting is hard for me rn and I want to be there for her without those feelings lingering. So I asked for space and she got incredibly angry with me. We fight a lot and I don’t know why, most the time it’s over small things that most ppl would just let go but idk. It sometimes feels like if something goes wrong in her life she displaces the anger onto me and finds something to yell at me about. Also, lately I’ve noticed a severe lack in effort on her part as a friend. She even took the side of someone who bullied me back in highschool because they were going through things... but I’ve met plenty of people going through similar who don’t bully and I haven’t even bullied for going through something similar. Idk it feels like she never has my back, even when we were dating when her best-friend fucked up she chose her side over mine, which hurt. She also resents me for asking her to stop being friends with her old ex. At the time we began the relationship she was FWB with him, and I found out he treated her like shit and raped her while she was passed out once. However, she told me if she was awake she would’ve consented. But she didn’t? So... I wasn’t comfortable with him especially when he even kept interfering with the relationship. She told me when she cut him off she didn’t even like him and then after we broke up... it turns out she lied. She defends him every step of the way even though he treated her badly. And with this break that I asked for she told me it’d be indefinite until she felt like talking to me again.  Am I being childish for asking for space? I honestly am confused am I in the wrong here?

699,"Hello!

My (38/F) husband's (40/M) job is relocating from NYC to Nashville.  It was  a hard decision to make because we were born and raised in NYC and so are our kids (5/M, 19mo/F).  We're also not really big risk takers so this decision was a big one.

Our choices for leaving outweigh the reasons to stay.  I'm just very scared because we do not know anyone there and we're both on the introverted side.  All our friends and family are in NYC so that will be a huge change.  I've worked full-time since I graduated college and the move to Nashville will let me take a small break from working and hopefully find some kind of part-time job.  I've been working as a paralegal / legal secretary all my life.  What kind of part time jobs can my experience land me in Nashville?  One of the big reasons for the move was that we won't need a full-time salary from me.  It might be possible that I don't have to work at all, but I think working would keep me happy and in a routine.  I can be there more for the kids and pick them up from school/daycare.  Currently in NYC my son is in school from 8-5 and my daughter is in daycare from 8:30-5:30.  Living in Nashville, my husband can be home by 5:00 (rather than 6-6:30 in NYC) and my kids can be picked up when school ends (\~3:50 for my son and my daughter can be picked up by me whenever).   All I've ever known was working and I'm sure being home, even for part of the time, would be a huge change for me.  Not knowing anyone, I'm afraid it will be isolating and lonely.  I'm not really the type to reach out and meet people b/c I'm on the shy side.  I usually do great when people approach me and want to get to know me first.  

Anyway, any advice from those who have moved with a family from a large city like NYC to a smaller city?  Any tips or advice before the move?  We are planning to move around July.",27Jan2020,1

my late shift finishes at 9pm, and my colleagues insist that i leave early, around 7:30pm, because apparently 9pm is too late to leave

they all like to leave early, and our manager doesn't know about it, and the other thing that makes this super dodgy is the fact that we work in a supported residence with vulnerable adults who require two members of staff to be on duty until 9pm, i've even asked my manager about this and she has verified this

my colleagues also know this but they're still happy to go behind her back and leave early, however i will not be caught up in it and refuse to risk being caught out for negligence and or fraud

my colleagues are quite stubborn about me staying until 9 and constantly insist i should leave early, but i am not comfortable with this, so my current excuse for staying until 9pm is that my friend gives me a lift home after she finishes work at 9pm, because its safer for her to pick me up later than it is for me to leave early and walk home in the dark

711,"I'm seventeen and homeschooled as of 2018, so sadly asking a school counselor/using a similar resource isn't an option. I'm curious what you think. 

TL;DR: have to think of a career (preferably abnormal or criminal-psych related) besides being a therapist that doesn't involve police training/crime scenes. Any ideas? 

I've had dreams of being a therapist since I started seeing a counselor in 6th grade, but I've had to accept that that may not be for me; I don't think I have the patience or strength for one-on-one work like that. However, I do still really want a career in the psychology field.

I was hospitalized as a BHU patient last year, and the psychiatrist in charge of me told me I could do great things if I utilize the traits I have that come with autism; especially hyperfixations.

That being said, right now I'm somewhat leaning towards a career in *criminal* psychology. I'm obsessed with abnormal psych and true crime. Not in the way that I *admire* depraved people, but I have a strong morbid curiosity and a lot of questions about the psychology behind crime. 

The problem with *that* is that I'm not the kind of person who can handle a crime scene, and I'm not sure if that cancels out all options there. I *could* probably desensitize myself enough to look at photos, but I'm not sure I even wanna do that.

My family has been pushing me a bit towards a career in art; it's one of my other long-standing passions, but I'm wary because of how difficult it is to stand out. Still, something in character design is an option. (And no, a police sketch artist isn't; I can't do realism for shit) 

I do feel like my strengths point towards psychology, though. Despite having ASD, I consider myself perceptive. I have strong empathy and an in-depth understanding of what it's like to suffer with mental health, and I want to make a difference with that. 

There's also no way I'm getting into a police academy. (Possibly needed for jobs like behavioral profiling iirc) I'm in the smaller 1% for size for my age/sex and will always be at a physical disadvantage no matter how fit I am. Not to mention, I have several chronic health conditions.",27Jan2020,1

717,"It’s going to be a super long post but I’ll try to consolidate it. 

Everything started when she sprained her ankle about 5 years back. Since then, because she sprained her ankle, she can’t work for a few months. Then it started with her feeling depressed, we’re still talking to her and also encouraging her. But one day, I woke up and saw her holding a chopper while we were sleeping looking at us. That image is still in my head till now and every time she acts all crazy, I can’t sleep well. 

Fast forward to these 2 years. My boyfriend has been helping us with the house reno. Background info: my sister and I didn’t have a room until I was 26 and she was 22 this year. Our living spaces were all filled with my mom’s things. After finally making a room with my bf, he also decided to change things in my home because he couldn’t bear to see my dad living like this. I could sense that their marriage is on the rocks but decided to stay cos of stupid Asian values that divorce has a stigma. 

This year, we did a major overhaul and also because my parents have been saying that they wanted to change the old furniture. So my bf and I came in to help. After clearing weekly for the past 5 months, we thought that things would improve. Slowly, all her items start piling back. My bf is very annoyed at this situation and said things to me. We were in a very rocky state. But we managed to talk things out. My mom knew about the things he said and has been holding grudges against him since. 

We didn’t even have a proper dining space since I was born into this family. The table is full of her things so I decided to get a dining set and since our relatives are coming over for New Year next year. She has been upset over this since then too. I’ve told her the table is coming in a week’s time and nothing has been cleared. 

Our family celebrates Chinese New Year so it’s a very big thing. But our family has been going through quarrels almost every day. My dad basically said everything out. He said his tired of telling my mom to clear her things, now what he wants is just a space he can use. My mom heard this and went all emotional blackmailing. She doesn’t want to tell us anything, she’d rather disappear for 1-2 hrs and talk with her friends. She did it during Chinese New Year when we were visiting our relatives. 

My aunt and I were playing the other day and I showed her the picture of my house to jokingly warn her not to give any more things to my mom. She secretly gave boxes and packets to my mom but my mom lied and said it was for diabetic patients. So my aunt was playing and fooling around with me to come and whisper to me what she gave my mom. She got all angry and shouted at me in front of my relatives. And walked away. 

Her behaviour is irking me and I’m at a loss. I’m intending to go to a family service centre for help.

719,"Let me preface this by saying two things-

1. I am going to keep this a secret from our friends and his family. I would never ever out someone against their will and his family is deeply homophobic and it would be a disaster.

2. I am in no way homophobic and I happen to be bisexual so trust me, I’m not judging him. I’m just shocked.

I have been friends with this guy, we will call him Tom, for 4 years. I am still in high school (17f) and he is graduated (21m). He’s been a close and accepting friend, but he and I fundamentally disagree on a few things. He’s a die hard fundamentalist catholic and I am a long time atheist (unlikely friendship, yeah). He believes being a homosexual is a horrible sin and says it makes him uncomfortable. 

He’s never had a girlfriend or expressed any interest in women at all. He’s remained consistently focused on his career and gets easily agitated and snappy about people asking if he’s into any women. He’s also got some stereotypically gay attributes such as an oddly in tune fashion sense and many feminine tendencies.

I didn’t make assumptions or come to any conclusions but I’ve had my suspicions for a long time. I’ve never ever brought it up with him or anyone else because I don’t want to make him uncomfortable or accidentally expose him. I always told myself that since he’s so homophobic, he must be straight and maybe he’s just shy about liking people.

Well, a few weeks ago, one of my classmates found Tom on tinder. That’s not a big deal, except it turns out he was looking for men on the app. However, I chalked it up to him looking for friends- he’s always been a bit of a loner and has expressed he doesn’t know how to meet people. His bio implied he was looking for friends or whatever so I figured he had it set to men and women and just talked to whoever. I told everyone to keep it quiet and that he’s “absolutely not gay” (I had my doubts but my primary goal is protecting him from being outed to his very very conservative family.)

I told him some people found his tinder (I wanted him to know that his brother might hear about it so he would be prepared). He denied even having one, clearly freaked out, so I laughed it off and decided not to press the issue. I said I wasn’t one to judge and that I just wanted him to know that some of his old classmates were aware of it.

Then, today, 5 of my classmates walked up to me hollering about something I “absolutely needed to see”. I thought it would be a meme but instead what I saw was Tom’s face on a Grindr profile. He is actively seeking out other men online. There’s nothing wrong with that, but now  I’m extremely worried. Several 15-17 year olds have now found “juicy information” on one of the alumni, and we are in a very close knit community and interact with him and his friends very often. Worst of all, his brother is my age and will likely hear about this.

I begged them to shut up and be quiet and tried to explain over and over again that it’s not ok to expose him if he’s clearly not ready to come out and that it’s absolutely none of their business. They all “swore to keep it secret” but this is after they practically screamed it in front of 20 other kids.

I don’t know what to do. I love Tom like a brother and I wasn’t ever going to bring up his sexuality with him unless he brought it up first, but now I want to warn him that he might be outed to his brother and half of the school of kids that he regularly interacts with. He’s in a college ROTC program too and I know it would be a mess if his peers found out.

Should I talk to him and gently let him know that some people found out or should I stay out of it? We are extremely close and I feel almost obligated since I’m his only truly close friend right now. 

TDLR: my friend “Tom” is on Grindr and a bunch of our friends found it. I’m worried they might out him to his homophobic family and I don’t know if I should warn him or discuss any of this with him.",27Jan2020,1

721,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for eight years. We dated from 2012 - 2015 then broke up for three months. We then dated 2015-2017 and broke up for a year and a half. We started dating again last February and just broke up last night. It has been a long time coming. We are obviously going in different directions. He is 33 and I am 25. He has a college degree and I want to pursue mine. He wants to travel internationally with his brother for a few months next year and I'm honestly not sure what I want to do. 
He wasn't very nice to me but I'm still mourning the relationship. He seems to have this big plan for himself that includes adventure and brotherly bonding and to be honest, I'm envious of that. I'm working a job that I absolutely love and am obsessed with but it's a dead end retail job. I'm a manager and it's not corporate so I can't get any higher. I need a career that will offer benefits which mine does not. So I've realized I need to go back to school, get the degree, and make my own happiness. This obviously cannot include him. My question is how can I move on from eight years of knowing this person? How do I move on knowing he's having some great time in Thailand while I'm trying to pull myself up by the bootstraps and make a career? 
Lastly, I am very lonely. I've stayed in my state because of my boyfriend. My mom lives a few states north of me. She has offered me her spare room and her help getting enrolled in school and help with navigating student loans so this isn't all so overwhelming. I'm thinking of taking it. I could really use some time with her and her help. I'm hesitant because it feels like giving up on my life. I love my job but at the end of the day, I have no future there.

723,"Hey reddit. I find myself in a bit of a life crisis and mostly would like to share a tough moment I'm going through in a semi-anonymous context, but also gladly appreciate any input you may have.
Long post ahead.

Years ago I was trying to become a math teacher, and had to drop out because of a skin condition that unexpectedly messed up my sight. After months of treatment, I reached a stable condition. I depended way more on my right eye. Lefty was a little blurry. Had to wear glasses. I went between retail jobs, computer fixing gigs and math tutoring to pay for medical bills, medicine and cover some of my student loan. That went on for 2 years.

After that, I decided to try again from scratch, since teaching is my passion in life. I had ups and downs both academically and physically. Made some sacrifices, and cut on expenses, asked for a lot of help. Took longer than I would've liked, but here I am now. Certified math teacher.

Still live with my dad, but I'm getting a grip on life. After a few months as a substitute I find myself happy but drained, and socially distant because I genuinely get tired way faster than I used to. Seeking a medical explanation, turns out it's the eyes again. Like a frog slowly getting boiled, I put a lot of stress on my eyes all those years in between, and got used to my bad vision.

Right eye (with glasses) now works at 70%. Left (with or without glasses it's the same) works at 15%.

S h i t

Can I treat it? Yes, but only so it doesn't get any worse than already is.
Surgery? Yes, an expensive one. And only to turn that 15% into a 30% at best
Anything I can do to improve this? Not really

That evaluation was exactly a week ago. I've been really depressed, and not sure what to do besides 'not getting worse'. My close family is worried, I haven't told many people (even my full spectre of social media friends clocks in at 44 right now). I'm unemployed and coming to terms with ""Everything I do for a job or recreation heavily depends on eyes that can't really handle those sort of activities""

I even had suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and as a funny note, couldn't find a suicide prevention service in my country/region, so I asked a friend who is a psychologist. She answered two days later to my first ""Hey, I need to ask you something important"", and couldn't muster the courage to ask for info at that point. So here I am, getting older and not really sure if I can respec/reroll my character sheet. Not the best ending for a story still in progress.


tl;dr 
Lost a little over half my vision. Feel depressed. Can't really work or enjoy hobbies. What to do?",27Jan2020,1
724,"please I need help with a situation that I can’t control on my own and that has been progressing in the worst way. I think that I have mixed feelings for my mom because of all the emotional and psychological abuse she has been laying against me and my sister recently and I can’t seem to find a way out of it. She had always taken care of us and had to work way too much as a single parent in order to provide us a roof and stability, while that one monster that should’ve been my dad proceeded to harm us and still it to this day bringing his own children to court for ruining our lives. But as the problems wore her out, she eventually started to become violent and emotionally abusive to the point where during heated arguments I would have wanted to call the police just to stop everything. She has narc attributes and would often lash out and throw at us the worst words possible, daring to kill us because we had the audacity to call her out on her behaviour (she believes that the parent needs to be respected regardless of its actions and shouldn’t be judged), I don’t think that she ever measured her words and this only escalated in horrible scenarios. I don’t think she’s a bad person but I never felt comfortable around her, I never felt supported and she just contributed with my father’s actions while trying to *protect* us in her words, I just want to cut ties and live without this anxiety. But can’t...I can’t let her go because she’s always guilt tripped me into thinking that a person abandoning a parent is a monster, how much she still cares for her mother even though she never respected her. I’m afraid",27Jan2020,1
725,"TL;DR AT THE END! i know it’s long, i tend to ramble, so just read the TL;DR and scroll back up if you need extra detail

John is mostly kind of an asshole, but we’ve known each other for years and he’s one of my only friends. A lot of my fondest memories are from hanging out together with him and my bf. He helped me through a lot in highschool when I was suicidal. Also had bad memories of him being an absolute asshole. He was really critical and had a short temper.

The three of us hung out and played games and wrestled a lot. We did a lot of weird questionable shit that crossed over into sexual territory a few times, but we just joked about it. One time, we crossed the line and we couldn’t pass it off as a joke. Our stupid little teenager bodies were just too horny and we got too handsy and grindy. After this, he bashed his head against the wall and claimed to have amnesia. But I’m left to deal with the memory.

Couple months after that, he hung out with us less. After graduation, we stopped talking almost completely. Now, me and my bf had no other friends. All our friends drifted after graduation. I only missed John. I dreamt about him every night. Mostly friendly dreams, sometimes sexual, occasionally violent. He was always on my mind. A lot of songs, smells, and everyday things reminded me of him, sometimes causing me sudden anxiety. I tried to contact him but he wasn’t interested in hanging out. For years I was conflicted between loving(platonically) him and hating him. He had promised to always be my friend!

I tried to make other friends, but didn’t have much interest. They weren’t John. I started getting obsessive. I tried to induce sleep paralysis so I could hallucinate seeing him, but it didn’t work. On my walks home, I always took the route by his house and then passed by his workplace that was nearby just to see if he was there. I stalked his social media and then dug through the internet for as much info i could find about him. I kept note of everything I knew about him. I found accounts on various sites, including a porn site. I looked through all his favorite pornos and checked when he would come online. I masturbated when he was online so I could feel like we were doing something together.

I visited him at work (coffee shop) often. He usually didn’t say anything, but I felt an intense happiness at the slightest interaction. Like when he would say hi, or write my name on my cup with a smiley face. We eventually got re-acquainted over music recommendations and videogames. We played games over discord and became friends again for a few months. I learned a lot of new things about him. The dreams stopped, and I didn’t stalk him online anymore. He was too busy to hang out irl but I missed him for so long that chatting over discord and playing games was good enough for me. It was really fun just playing and chatting!

When he chatted about his crush on a coworker, I felt jealous. I tried to be supportive. But then he mentioned that he wanted to be single forever and didn’t care if he died a virgin, and I felt relieved. I don’t want to date him, but I feel jealous. I am also sexually attracted to him and my relationship is open, but he said he doesn’t do fwb. I’m fine not fucking him, I mostly wanna be friends. but I feel like if he ever got a girlfriend or boyfriend I would be devastated. I don’t want anyone else to “have” him. But he’s not “mine” in the first place? I have no right to feel this way, but I feel it so strongly. Sometimes I feel like I would rather see him die an early death (as he predicts) than see him in a relationship. I am ashamed of this thought.

we haven’t been playing games together lately. he got super pissed at me because I suck ass at the game we played most often and we quit the other games we were playing. he said a lot of mean shit to me and i suck too much to continue playing. i feel like we are drifting again. i don’t want that to happen. but i also feel that it is unhealthy to cling to someone in this way. I don’t know how to make new friends. I dropped out of college and work full time. a lot of my friendly coworkers quit and the ones i like are never scheduled with me. i don’t like making online friends and prefer irl friendships. i went to a therapy group and i hated everyone there. i tried making friends with a new coworker but he turned out to be an absolute psycho (long story), my bf tried introducing me to a couple people but i didn’t like them. why don’t i like anybody? i’m thinking of quitting my job and getting a job at the coffee shop instead. they pay $1.50 more per hour than my current job and have better hours...and i would get to see him. John knew I applied there before a year ago and only didn’t get the job because my schedule was inflexible during school. my schedule is pretty flexible now. but i’m afraid. i dont know if thats the right thing to do.

i’ve been drinking more alcohol lately. it makes me feel good and dulls my social anxiety. but i cant be drunk all the time. it’s not legal, not good for me, and John said i’m an annoying piece of shit when i’m drunk. i’m planning to go to therapy but i feel stupid. i have been obsessing over this guy and dealing with social problems for years. the therapy hardly helped before. i just spent 4 hours struggling to type this whole thing out on small iPad and no one is gonna read all this bullshit lol



TL;DR:
I had a close friend who i was emotionally attached to and sexually attracted to. we drifted, and I got obsessed with him for a few years. I missed him terribly and it lead to me stalking him online, dreaming about him every night, and memories of him caused anxiety in my life. We rekindled our friendship last year over videogames, but we’re drifting apart again mostly due to him being an asshole and me sucking at videogames. I am afraid of drifting and can see my obsessive habits and thinking starting to return. i am also afraid that if he gets a gf/bf, i wont be able to cope with the jealousy. 

I think i should make friends but i dropped out of school and i’m busy with work and haven’t had good luck in meeting people i click with. i am tempted to quit my job and work with him instead since they pay more and i miss him too much. i also want to go back to therapy but i feel dumb because i’ve had this problem for years and the therapy never helped me with this problem before. i don’t know what to do next. i don’t know what other options i have. if i talk to him, what should i say? should i let him drift away, or keep trying? has anyone ever experienced something like this?

btw my bf is aware of all of this. he just tells me “go to therapy bro”",27Jan2020,1
726,"This is a first for me...



So I have recently purchased my first flat and to my surprise when I moved in I would get letters for someone who is not me. This can be normal as I have studied at uni and this usually happens for previous tenants. I believe this may be the case for this as well.

I noticed a few letters coming through every week and eventually, I decided to open one (sue me).

After reading the letter it became apparent the person had some debt that needed paying in the thousands. I read online that if I am not the person who it's addressed to then I should not worry but the letters seem to be quite aggressive in the sense that if the due balance isn't paid I will be sent to court or they would come and take things of that value. I also read that debts attached to certain properties are responsible to the landlord/homeowner which is me in this case. The company (debt collection agency is a company called Lowell.).



I feel like I'm babbling on now so to summarise. If anyone has had this situation to them what should I do about this?

I've called them to alert them but I still get letters and am worried someone will be at my door to take my assets/furniture and other things like my tv/console blah blah blah and I won't have any power to stop them.

My mother had an issue with this relating to unpaid council tax which ultimately was a misunderstanding and someone turned up at my door (bouncer type man) and said that if she didn't pay within 24 hours he would be back to take items of the value of the debt.

Like I said this was a misunderstanding and it turns out she didn't even need to pay in the end.",27Jan2020,1
727,"Characters:

Me: team leader of the shift and this is my first ever job in leadership. I've been working here only a few months.

R: low achieving employee

&amp;#x200B;

Let's set the scene. I'm leading a slower shift with about 5 employees with no higher management in the store than myself. And what higher management there is doesn't really like to be contacted unless it's serious. This business usually employs highschoolers and it's overall a very chill job. When it's busy, all employees are doing their jobs, but when it's not busy, there isn't a lot of extra work to be done, so everyone sits down until there's a job to do.  So this day, all my employees were doing work, including R, but he seemed to be sitting down a lot that shift and being lazy wherever possible (i.e. Letting his coworkers volunteer for jobs more often than he does). He comes to the back from working and he's coughing, so I give him some time to settle down. Some time goes by and I haven't heard any coughing for about 5 minutes, so I decide it's time for me to get him to do his fair share.

Me: R, would you please make sandwiches?

R: Why can't \[other employee\] do it?

Me: Because I asked you to

R: silence

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have to confront the employee, but I'm not experienced in leadership, so I think about how I'm going to handle it for about 5 minutes then pull him aside

Me: \[Owner of the business\] hired me to make shifts run smoothly and I can't have you telling me no when I ask you to do something. Maybe I misunderstand, but it's my recollection that I asked you to do a job and you straight up told me no. Is that right?

R: I told you I couldn't do the job because I was still coughing (I suspect he was lying, but it's possible I'm wrong)

Me: Okay. In that case, please make sandwiches as soon as you're ready

then R goes and sits down for 7 more minutes (with no coughing) before I come to him again

Me: R, why are you not making sandwiches?

R: The bread isn't baked yet

\*I see another employee making bread\*

Me: Okay, then let's wait 20 minutes then I want you to start making sandwiches

R: Okay

&amp;#x200B;

Then we get slightly busy for about 20 minutes and then slow again for 40 minutes. After that time, I ask R about the sandwiches and he finally gets to working on them. 

I feel like I was an absolute pushover. I should've confronted him immediately when he told me no, I should have asked him to bake the bread, I shouldn't have  let another employee bake the bread, and I know that I should've done something about my suspecting him lying. I feel like I gave him way too much benefit of the doubt and should've handled things very differently. I want my employees to like me, but I also want them to respect me. How should I have handled all of this?

tldr: I'm leading a shift at work and my employee tells me no when I ask him to do something. I was way too soft",27Jan2020,1

731,"My partner and I are trying to get out of homelessness and into housing, but we keep bumping into the same problems. Now, this isn't a homeless problem, as such, but a housing problem. We have money; the missus is a disabled veteran^^1 and has a relatively substantial pension. The issue is actually *finding* somewhere. 

The problem is we each have a con that goes against us as a couple. The missus is the primary income earner but she's a felon and has a bad credit rating. I have an almost-clean record (misdemeanor soon to be expunged) but I don't have a regular income (odd jobs, cash in hand etc). This bars us from using rental agencies for generic apartments, as her record would always result in a rejection, ditto for me not having proof of income. 

We're left to using Craigslist and Facebook rentals. Most of these are duds; ""private renter"" is really an agency, students only etc. or outright scams on CL (send me a check and I'll mail you the keys). We don't have a car (neither of us can drive anyway) so it's not like we can drive around looking for 'for rent' signs, and local papers either don't have classifieds or they're out of our price range or through a rental agency. 

Ideally we just want to find a private renter, sign a month to month contract and be about our business, but it's like they don't exist anymore!

I'm in a better place than I have been in a long time, but I feel as if I don't get through college, none of the struggling will have been worth it. It's something I need to do for myself.

I need to take more classes so I can transfer to a university, but my community college is telling me I'll have to wait until next semester until I can take a workshop and start again.

746,"**I need to put yourself up the situation.**  
I am a person who was born in Venezuela, I'm currently 19 y.o and also a medicine student (which is the only career worth of studying since is basically free, that's the only good thing about been here).   
In the mean time I have to see my mom (a gynecologist) break his back everyday working 12 hours everyday to buy some food since it is my brother (10 y.o), my mom and my two grandparents (both retired, I've heard the jubilation is something not all countries do that is basically working for a company for about 30+ years, then retire and live with a monthly payment from that company, they did it and every month they are sent 5$ each for all that). So, what's the problem? The problem is that the price of everything here is the same as in the U.S (some things even expensive since there's no national production so everything that is being sell here comes from outside the country) and the money my mom works for is just enough for supplying food everyday.

I actually know that someday I will graduate from the medicine university as a doctor, probably in about 5 years and the problem is just that, since then I have no way of helping my mom with this. You'll probably think: why don't you get a job at McDonald's or something? I've thought about it but for an 8 hour job everyday all they pay is 10$ a month + I really can't get a work that keeps me that busy since my studies are my priority. 

A month ago I found a job where I'm a social media manager of this car dealership, I manage their instagram account and their web page, monthly I make around 100$ but still not enough... 

I've come to a point where I even tried to find a sugar mommy or sugar daddy even if that means prostituting myself just for money until a week ago I thought about this plan and really doesn't seen that insane TO ME.

Venezuela is a narco-state, that means that the most powerful people in the government are related to selling drugs and the gold of the state and even the oil (you can look this up on google, is some kind of deal this people have with Russia and China...). That means you can see someone starving to death in the street while there's a Lamborghini besides him. There's no middle class, you're rich or poor, no middle line. 

The money laundry here has become massive, it's super easy to identify because there's stores that sell super expensive things that are not basic need, let's say a nutella, and they have huge amounts of them but no one buys them in weeks. I'm not saying there's not hard working people that still living here and open their business with effort but the majority of them are result of all the money the actual government stole and keeps stealing from the country.

That brings me for today's topic at last. I live in an apartment, in the 12th floor, in the tower D (there's A, B, C and D, each with 16 floors and 4 apartments in each floor but because of the actual crisis many people have left the country meaning that approximately half the residence is empty). My balcony gets a view to one of the two mains streets in the city (Barquisimeto, is not that big, you'll often know a person who knows another person who you already know) where I can see a pharmacy and a other things like that, I know for a fact that there's this old man who's a corrupted general of the army that comes every week for this medicine I guess (unless he owns the place lol), the thing is, he drives a Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro 2018, orange color and a Toyota Fortuner TRD Pro 2020 (as I said, it is something very common to see, specially the toyota vehicles, 4runner, Fortuner, Land cruiser, Tundra, being used by people related to the government).  He's really skinny and weak, doesn't seem like someone that has been in the army (that's other thing, in here if you have the connections you can become an important person in some things specially the army without moving a finger, general for example, take a look at Venezuelan general's, all fat guys eating from the money of the state). The point is, if I had a gun, just at the right time when he is about to enter his car I can go in, assault him and take the car. I would hide the car in the basement of my residence and then sell it for pieces (about 60k$ worth). At what price? taking something of someone that got it stealing? A small price to pay for helping my family.

The question here is, am I insane? I actually feel like when in breaking bad Walter is looking for any reason NOT to kill Crazy 8, exactly the same. 

I really don't want to do this but I'll do whatever I have to do to help my family.

Some respondes to questions I guess this can get: 

\- Those cars (2016+) often never wear plates, that means I could even use the stolen car as my everyday car and it would just be one more car without plates. There's no law here so police won't stop you for that, they'll just assume you're someone related to the government or in the military and let you be.

\- I'm have very cold blood so I guess I could kill someone without feeling remorse. Of course I'm not a monster, I wouln't do that to someone with a kid in the backseat, etc.

\- I actually don't have any idea on how to know if the car I will stole have gps on it or if it has it how to get rid of it. 

\- My biggest fear is to make the assault and realize the pilot isn't alone in the car or even worst, if the victim has escorts. 

So, what do you think? what would you do in my situation? Do you think it is really a bad thing to do? Be honest. 

I'm truly sorry if bad english...",27Jan2020,1

\-WARNING - long story 

**After quitting university I decided to apply to an education to become a business administrator. A fresh new start in a new city with new people and new tasks! Yay! The decision wasn't an easy one, before I quit university I was close to finnishing my Bachelors, but it wouldn't have worked out. For the sake of giving my parents some reflief when it came to money, but also because I didn't want to work in the field of education anymore.** 

**I got a very nice place to start my education and I honestly feel like home at work. I now work in retail in a big chain(so much I can tell). My coworkers are team players, reliable and really made it easy to get my head in the game. Even my boss is a totally nice person and helps me anytime I get into trouble :) My courses in vocational collage are very easy to me (except for maths, haha) and most of the time, when spending time in class or in my workplace with other trainees I'm momma bear. These folks are all considerably younger than I am, some still go through puberty (we all know thats a tough thing) and sometimes their problems don't really get a listen in our company and that's where I jump in. I like all of them alot and  get along with everyone just fine.** 

**So, there I am. New city, new people, new job, new boss, new school, new friends (and old ones) and I couldn't be happier - and then there's Mr. Asshat**

**Mr. Asshat is another trainee in our company but he already holds a very important place in our house. He's in his third year and is the head of our office department and as his name indicates he's a utter cunt. He's so good at what he is doing that our regional manager really, really likes him and also he is the nephew the head of our company Mr. Asshat gets to do the fuck he wants and gets away with every fucking thing. It's exhausting.**

**When I arrived at work he sort of took a dislike in me -  I suppose - and he keeps on making rude comments on my work and commands like a drill sergeant. I'm happy I don't see him often and tend to go out my way to avoid him as much as possible but when we meet he makes my fucking blood boil.**

**Example : I had to got to the head office because I had some costumer complaint and I wanted to discuss those with the person, another trainee in that case, these complaints concerned. If costumer complaints make their way to the head office of our boss the person concerning it, basically, is fucked. I wanted to prevent that and give the opportunity to solve matters right away. She would have done the same for me since her and me are great friends. Let's call her A. A is in her first year just like me and it sometimes is really hard to do the right thing when you really don't know what to do in the first place. So I enter the room, ask her if she got time and talk to her.**

**Enter Mr Asshole. He says to me ""Once you enter through this door you are supposed to adress me first!"" Us, being in the middle of our convo, look up and he throws some papers on her desk. He asks A ""What the fuck is this? Do you guys even work when I'm not here?! Doesn't seem like it! What is this crap?""**

**Guys. She had printed out a list in the wrong way. I'm not kidding.** 

**A gets all agitated and nervous allthough normally she's rather quiet and calm. She rambles about how she doesn't understand what she's done wrong and that she'll fix it asap.** 

**""What did you do wrong?! Do you even know?! Do you even listen when I explain things to you?!"" he asks her and puts himself behind the chair she's sitting on and comes WAY TO CLOSE to her.** 

**She goes through her documents and searches for her mistake, she's got shaky and by now and I'm already ready to throw him out the windows right onto the concrete on the street. There is no fucking reason you talk to ppl like that. Plus, she is YOUR TRAINEE. HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO LEARN ANYTHING WHEN SHE FEELS THREATENED AND YOU RANDOMLY YELL AT HER?! DO YOU THING FEAR IS A GOOD ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN IN????**

**A goes through her documents, finds her mistake and corrects it. But, no no, thats not enough.** 

**He srly tells her to say that she's sorry for not doing it right in the first place. So she says she's sorry and starts sobbing. I'm surprised I didn't lose it there but I somehow managed to stay calm and after she printed the new list we return to the costumer complaint I was in the office for in the first place. In the middle of our convo about what went wrong he interrupts again and the bitch has the audacity to snap the costumer complaint out of my hand and says:""These things go through me first. Who is it about any way..?"" He reads her name, tosses the paper in her desks in front of her and LAUGHS at her. He goes back to his desks and mumbles something under his breath which I luckily didn't catch. She starts crying again and I again am so close to losing it again. But she asks me to stay calm and tells me that he's just like that and that talking about would make it only worse.** 

**This happens daily and everytime I see his fucking face I get so mad. As I said, I don't see him often but when I do it's hell. He's condescending but he gets through with everything. He also started dating the daughter of the other boss owning our company so he gets a free pass with everything.** 

**Guys. How can I cope with this? Do you have any advice on how I can keep my calm? I feel like flipping my shit everytime he gets all arrogant and sometimes even blocks my work and thus I get into a lot of trouble that he knows only he can be the solution for. He makes me come running and he enjoys it. He knows he is in a position of power and he really, really likes to play it to his personal advantage. The bosses, supervisor, my coworkers everybody knows but they need him so bad they won't fire him or go along in the sense of ""well, thats just mr. asshat, thats just who he is...!"".**

749,"So, I have a job which requires a good deal of socializing. When I am home my preference is to do my thing (play games with family, play music et al...) rather than to reach out to friends. We will generally socialize 1-2x/month, though I will meet someone for dinner more frequently. Of note I am by far the more social person relative to my wife. 

We do organize playdates, maybe 3 per month per kid, but I am noticing that both of my kids (7, 10, both girls) are also tending towards introversion. I know the benefits of being able to talk to people, and developing a wide network of people in your life, so I am concerned that I am setting a bad example. Should I ignore my preferences and start being more social for their benefit?

755,"I'm 19 and graduated high school (or my country's equivalent) in June 2019. I had no idea (still don't) know what I want to study in the future, so I decided to get a job to get some money and experience until I figure it out. I've been working here for about 6 months now (since July) and I have flexible and irregular work hours, some weeks I work only once and some weeks it's full time.

Now to the problem: Anxiety. All my live I thought I was shy, but two years or so ago I realized that I'm not ""shy"": I'm anxious, always fearing irrational things and noticing details no one else thinks about. I struggle in social situations and events of public speaking such as presentations and seminars. I often become ""mute"", it literally feels like I am not able to speak. 

I still managed to get pretty good grades and feel good in school since I it was mostly writing, not speaking, and I had my little gang of friends that I could be pretty normal with (not completely ""normal"" though) and that made me feel secure. 

But since I got my job, everything has gone downhill. Most of the time I get pretty bad anxiety the night and morning before work. It has happened more than once that I called in sick because of anxiety and uncontrollable crying. I cried for hours last night. I was supposed to work at a place I've never worked at before (I cover in for people who are sick or if they just need more capacity at different places in my city), and it made me so anxious. I'm so ashamed, because I think my boss could sense that I was lying, and I feel worthless because I struggle so much with something that everyone else seems to be handling okay. 

The weird thing is that my job is okay most of the time. I have my anxious moments, but I usually manage to get through them pretty calmly. But there have been a few times that things went very badly and I felt worthless the whole day, like I couldn't do anything right and just was in the way. I think this is a cause of my anxiety, because even though those days have been pretty rare I always fear that it's gonna be one of those days. And even on my good job days, I get anxious when other people who work with me are in the same room as me and can see what I'm doing. In my mind they're looking at me and seeing how terribly I'm doing the job and judging me. Sometimes I become almost-mute and unable do things right because of this. 

This is the only job I could find that works with my studies (smaller side studies, some separate courses) that I'm doing right now. I would prefer to get a new job but I don't if that's possible right now. I'm also fearing that I will be anxious no matter what job I have. 

I have no idea how to control my anxiety. I've worked here for 6 months at this job and I still feel anxious almost every time I have to work, sometimes to an extent that it makes me cry and I call in sock. I need to work and I can't keep calling in sick this often. I don't know what's wrong with me or what I should do. If anyone has anything to say, please say it. I'd appreciate it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm 19, recently graduated my country's equivalent to high school and decided to get a job until I figure out what I wanna study. I work at a part time job with flexible hours which fits my life the way it is right now, but I also get terrible anxiety the night and morning before work. I cried almost all night. Even during good days (days at work with little anxiety), I can't work or talk normally anytime someone else is watching me.

So I've been kicked off of my mothers property, which is also where i built my tiny house(which is not on wheels), and banned from talking to her and my brothers. I'm a full time student, with some part time work and am in rather large debit because i made stupid choices. I have till the end of March to get my stuff together and leave, and am only allowed to move the tiny house with her help and no one else. She also took the mail key. 

I have no savings, only a bit of money till tax time, and live in canada.

&amp;#x200B;

I was kicked out because i asked her over text if it would be if i joined the satanic temple, which does not worship satan and is a moral activist type group with a lot of the same morals that i believe in, like egalitarianism and the like. Apparently this question could ruin her life and my brothers life as she is in the military and he is planning on doing so as well. I asked and didn't think it would be too much trouble because she like talks to ghosts and wards her house and thinks or use to think i'm psychic because I liked to read tarot cards for fun(i like symbolism and think its pretty neat, even if it doesn't mean anything) and had me read cards for someone at some point.

759,"Hi, so I have a friend who is struggling with schools.
It's an engineer school and we are in third years but we didn't do the first and second years there so it's pretty much our first year there. (In France its called ""parallel admissions"", don't know if this exists in others country) 

I didn't know him before coming to this school but we talked and then we bonded with others guys too and so we quickly had a groups with four guys( included me and him) 

But now we had our exam results and we all passed or near passed, but him got pretty much rekt and so has a lot of catching up exam to take and he's demotivated because it's not like he doesn't study, it's quite the opposite actually. 

So I don't know what to say to him, I could say ""don't worry it's not that important, at worst you will repeat a year"" but if it were me I don't think it would help me because I really don't want to repeat a year. 

I could also say ""You don't need to have an engineer degrees to have a jobs so don't worry, you can still do a professional degree"" but well, isn't this saying that he will fail? 

Currently he said ""I want to quit and do a professional degree"" and ""I can work at X and become a manager and then create my society"" (X is a society where he worked and was well received because he was really good) 

I said to him ""Maybe it's your studying method that are bad? "" but I have no idea what are good method and he also said that when he studies he reads the lesson and also redo the exercise that we did in class so I don't really know why he's that bad.

So my mum seems to be addicted to a game she has on her phone. I say ‘seems to be’ because I guess I need clarification on if she is or not from you guys and where to go from there.

So we have a very close relationship and I like to talk to her about everything. However, every time she is relaxing or winding down she is playing this game. I will try and talk to her and she’s very monosyllabic with me. It’s like speaking to a teenager when they are on social media or something.

I don’t know if I’m just being silly about this though. I have spoken to her about it and we do joke about how much time she spends on it. But, she doesn’t seem to do anything about it. 

I completely get that this is her way of relaxing but she must spend about 2/3 hours on this game a day. 

My mum works part time and she has provided for me. I love her to bits but I want her to be involved in things that are stimulating and interesting. I don’t want her to be spending so much time on this mobile game.

2: the boy with autism lives on a different floor. Not above us. My grandma and i don't get along so well so everyine i point that out she just gets mad and says she dosen't care.

She called me the morning after I had happened and told me about it. The story she told me goes as follows. It was her birthday party with her friend that also had her birthday the same day so they held a party together. I couldn't make it to the party because I was on vacation. Here in my country it's a tradition that you take as many shots as your age (at least in your teens) so I know she really was drunk (still not an excuse for cheating) and then her and her friend that held the party were lying on the couch after the party was over along with 2 guys that had stayed late. She then said that her friend and a guy started getting it on and then the other guy started trying to kiss her. She told me she said no at first but that he kept pushing and eventually she stopped saying no.

We have since talked a lot and she has cried over the phone telling me how much she loves me and that she doesn't want to lose me. She says that she is willing to do whatever it takes to give our relationship another shot. She has said that I can take a break to think about things (weeks or months) and that she will still be there for me if I want her back.

About 3 weeks ago, our upstairs neighbor (yes, upstairs) came to complain to us about noise. She mentioned things like talking too loud, the banging of doors/pantries, and the fact that we wake up early (7AM) and make noise.

The 3 weeks that followed, she would routinely bang the floor deliberately to tell us we were being noisy. This typically hapenned when a door slammed or when someone bumped the wall. Yesterday, she came back and she was she was especially irate about being awoken by us early in the morning (again, 7AM). She even threatened to tell the landlord.

My main issue isn't so much the threats as much as it is the nerve-wracking anxiety I've gotten following these incidents. I'm a very non-confrontational person so having someone come to me looking for trouble is not a welcome experience. I already plan to direct her to the landlord next time because I'm not deaing with her anymore.

So on a logistical basis, this issue is already dealt with, more or less, but as of now, I still feel like something's about to happen. There's a lingering anxious feeling which is very distracting. It also feels like walking on eggshells when I'm in my apartment, especially in the morning.

Do you guys have any advice on dealing with this type of anxiety?",27Jan2020,1

I am also a bit underpaid compared to all of my colleagues who studied with me. I am thinking about switching but I dont know whats the best way to do that.

The only thing I know is that I want to work in Eindhoven and it should be a big company. It shouldnt be a small company with lots of pressure and stress. It should have its own product not projects. 

Regarding work I know C++ and sql. But I dont mind learning C# or Java. I also dont mind going to data engineering or a more managerial role but I doubt I will get it given my experience.

My husband and I are expecting our first child in April. I will be on maternity leave for at least three months, if we can afford it, it will be four months. We currently live in Point A and the original plan was to move closer to my job in Point B  (approx. 45 mins- 1 hour) to cut down on my commute. After doing some looking over our finances, we figured it would be better for us to go ahead and move to the area because rent is cheaper over there (roughly $150-200 cheaper), however husband is concerned that the cost of child care will eat up those savings plus some absolutely negating the point of moving. This is because he was originally going to keep the baby throughout the day while he's in school and I'll take over when I get off work, but that would be almost impossible if we move because instead of me being an hour away and COMING home, he will be an hour away FROM home.

I guess my question is would it be wise to move now or if it is still wise to move, how to do the childcare part?

804,"First of all, I am in Germany. When you live in Germany in a house with multiple apartments, chances are you are obliged to clean the steps in front of your door every 2 weeks. 

I used to be able to do it, but after my second spine surgery around Christmas 2018 I am unable to. For a while I had a person help me, but she ghosted me 2 months ago. 

Since then my neighbor, who is a 60-something passiv-aggressive and entitled widow, is onto me. 

She did make drama because of the steps before, for example when I was in danger of being quadriplegic and had surgery to make me walk again. She harassed my mother (who took care of my cat) and actually tried to get into my apartment. She also did complain several times about things she accused me of doing, but which I did NOT do. Such as certain noise or leaving doors open so shady people can come into the house(????). So basically, every few weeks since I live here, there's some drama with Misses Karen. 

Well, now since christmas, she's started war on me. First it was a passive-aggressive Post-It note on my door. Right after Christmas she went to our landlady. I had a call the day before New year's Eve from my landlady that the neighbor was in her office complaining about me. 

I explained that I am physically unable to clean the steps. I am not allowed to lift heavy, and I have no feeling in part of my leg, it's literally a tripping hazard for me. I also have chronic pain in the scarred damaged area in my lower back, and it's literally dangerous to bend or lift, because any time my destroyed disc may slip again into my nerve canal, again making me partly quadriplegic, again having surgery. And my doctors warned me that either I'm super careful, or it happens again and then I'll have to get screws in my spine to stiffen that area. 

I also have several chronic illnesses and chronic pain in my joints and muscles. 

So yeah, I told my landlady all this and that I'm already trying to find a helper again, who can clean the steps for me, but I just hadn't found one yet. She said it was alright, I should just keep trying. 

Soon after, neighbor was complaining at the landlady's office again. And right after I asked my mom to clean the steps so at least it's done and I can keep searching for a helper, I got a letter from the landlady that I have to take care of this issue. 

Funny thing is though, that Karen does not clean the steps regularly herself. Since she started her little war since christmas, she hasn't done anything herself! She said she has knee pain sometimes. Knee pain! Does anybody see the irony here?

I'm honestly getting crazy, I'm getting paranoid, Im afraid of her, I'm having panic attacks and anxiety. I'm thinking about moving out. But I have to find a solution to this. I still haven't found a helper.

It's probably unlikely, but does anybody have an idea what I can do? Am I the asshole? I just don't know anymore. ",27Jan2020,1

819,"20/M here. I‘ve avoided sexual experiences since I was 17 because I also had erection problems back then and was too ashamed to try it again.

Now, last weekend, a girl invited herself over to my place after a night out and she wouldnt take a no. (god bless her, I think i wouldn‘t have been able to overcome my anxiety on my own) She obviously expected sex even though I told her beforehand that it wouldnt work due to me being drunk. She still came and I of course had a half boner all night.

I know this isn‘t uncommon, but what makes me much more concerned is that i can‘t get horny when im with a girl. I can fantasize, but in real life everything feels stiff, staged and just generally awkward. I dont get aroused and don‘t take the initiative. I acted as if I was sleeping when she was lying next to me and hoped she wouldnt notice. I wasnt in the mood at all.

When I lurk here and read threads that this is supposed to be the horniest time of my life, I get pretty sad. Stories are told where some guy in my age just needs a girl to sit on his lap and he almost instantly gets a rock hard boner. Whenever I read this, I think ‚this wouldn‘t happen to me at all‘ and I get mad.

WTF is wrong with me? I imagine other guys would take the chances that I get without a second thought. I fear that im somewhat submissive and generally dont feel in touch with my manliness because of my fucked up sexuality. Girls often want a guy to be rough and dominant, and i fear that im not that. When I fantasize (I cant memorize it completely in this moment) I think about how I wanna fuck this or that girls brain out. So maybe theres hope idk. I just hate that I cant be like a normal guy at my age.

Im not gay if youre wondering btw, as I only fantasize and get turned on by women (when alone ofc lol)

I also dont think im asexual.

Any tips? I dont know what to do anymore.

PS: I didnt ignore her the whole night, and i assured her that i find her attractive and its not because of her. I also got a half hard dick but never a full erection. I just dont get primal/animalistic like most other guys. I dont have the feral urge i get when i fantasize.I can get a raging boner when im making out with a girl, but as soon as it comes to real sex, my member goes limp.",27Jan2020,1
820,"Hello, I am a 17 yr old high school junior who has been playing competitive soccer for a long time. I have extreme passion for the game and love to keep playing and practicing, despite me not looking to go to college for soccer, but rather academics. This year, I am taking four ap classes and have gotten an A in every class, except for one- Ap computer science a, where I ended with a B+ this semester. My mother, being a strict indian parent, wants me to stop playing soccer until college applications are over in the winter of 2020-21. I told her that high level soccer requires an almost daily effort to train and even a few weeks without playing significantly hinders your skill. She thinks I am wasting time playing soccer as I will not aim to get recruited through soccer. With the second semester of jr year high school beginning, I will have to make a decision whether to quit soccer or keep playing along with school. What should I do?

I feel like I always have to text first, or try make plans. Some of them I could go a month or more without hearing a thing from them.

Lately I texted 2 of my friends first and then the conversation  was short and I was left on seen. I felt so horrible.

I dont know what to do lately, cause I dont talk to as many people or friends anymore like I use to. Some times when my other friends or bf are busy I feel so lonely.

825,"I've been suspicious of my spouse for a while now, last time I was out of town I hid a recording device in my living room (please don't judge me too harshly).  I think i have audio confirmation.  Basically, it's about 90 minutes or chit chat, then they turn on music.  Then I can't understand what they're saying, and then no voices for a while, and about 7-8 minutes into the silence some hushed talking.  The recorder was cheap and there is also a ton of white noise on top of the recording. The other problem is that the music is too loud, is there anyway I can download a mixer and increase the voices but decrease the music?  I know I'm naive to think it's just more idle chatter, but I need confirmation.  I also know that if I confront her with no real evidence she'll cover her tracks, and I'll never know the truth.  So if there are any audiophiles who can tell this pathetic loser how to clean up the recording I'd really appreciate it.",27Jan2020,1
826,"My girlfriend and I (26m) just split after a very long relationship of almost 8 years. I am still living with my mom.

828,"I see my therapist once a week. Lately I haven’t been able to deal with any stress or inconveniences in my life (but let’s be real, I haven’t been able to deal with stress for a long time now). As soon as I wake up in the morning I feel wired, wound up, my mind can’t stop racing, and I automatically feel stressed. Smoking seems to be the only thing that actually makes me feel calm and helps me to calm down when I’m triggered. I notice a huge difference in the way I feel when I smoke, vs when I don’t (obviously). I don’t like getting super stoned, I just take baby hits to feel buzzed.

My therapist has me practicing different techniques like deep breathing, journaling, and self awareness tricks. But smoking is the only thing that gives me instant relief. I have my medical card, originally got it for my back pain. I just don’t want her to think I’m “abusing drugs” to deal with my trauma and past issues. I honestly think weed is great, but I don’t know if she views it as a negative.

831,"This is a really specific dilemma so hopefully the person in question doesn’t see this haha

so last year there were some Australian exchange students who came to our school for around a term/semester, whatever you wanna call it. basically one of them was fairly attractive and basically I never actually spoke to him but today he added me on snapchat. I added him back because I mean why not it was just like adding anyone else from school to me and I wasn’t expecting him to actually snap me since we never really talked and I don’t snap a lot of people I have added. 
a few minutes maximum after I added him back he snaps me, it’s just a photo of his face, no text so I sent the same back. (he was sort of straight faced in the first pic then he started smirking a lil but maybe in the next? idk haha) this continued for maybe a few minutes maximum before he opened my snap and then didn’t respond. it’s now been a couple of hours (i’m a clown ik haha)
 I once saw this tiktok (made by a guy) that said that guys air the snaps of girls to see if they will double snap to determine whether or not they’re interested (though I think this is unlikely since I don’t know him).  
I know it’s unlikely that something could come from this since I don’t know him but I want to keep talking to him because he seems like he could be a great friend if nothing else because he has the characteristic of a really nice person if that makes sense?? 
I don’t really do streaks with anyone because I feel that’s a little cringe haha but I don’t know if he does or not so I dint know whether to expect another message tomorrow. 
should I send another snap tomorrow in the morning or something? or does that make me look too eager since we don’t know each other?

sorry I know this is a stupid problem but i just wanted some reliable advice from people more experienced than me or my friends

832,"Hello, I am a 23 year old and I have to have a surgery this year. I am coming to it from a pretty good insurance standpoint. I have my own insurance through my workplace, with a pretty low deductible ($250) and a pretty low Out-of-pocket max ($1900). Plus, I also am still under my parents insurance.


I am pretty sure that I will be maxing out my health insurance Out-OF-pocket doing this surgery, and probably within the next few months. So, I’ve already been looking into the medical providers I’ve needed/wanted to do, but couldn’t justify the cost. Such as a full blood panel, and full allergy testing. I also plan on potentially starting allergy immunotherapy as the biggest cost for that process is the initial test.


Since I will be able to get essentially anything my plan covers for really cheap, I didn’t know if there are any other important tests I should do to get a full picture of my heath at this time. 


So the advice I’m asking for is, are there any sort of tests or other medical things that I should seriously consider? I’m not trying to frivolously waste money doing unneeded medical things, but I’m generally a “don’t go to the doctor unless it’s a dire need because I’m poor” person. So this is a really unique situation. 


I’m willing to answer questions if you have any, but I’m hoping someone has any ideas of tests that are good to have done, but often too expensive to get without dire need. 


tl;dr: I’m maxing out my insurance early this year, what medical procedures/tests should I do now that I’ll be able to afford them?",27Jan2020,1

I was just let go from my job. It was not the best job, but my first real job. Not being apart of retail or school. In my city there are not many jobs to apply to that are equal in pay or benefits. My girlfriend has a wonderful job and I am not asking her to leave her job so I can get a job somewhere else in the state or surrounding states. 

***I need advice on how not to always say what is on my mind or to talk at all when I am asked something that I disagree with.***

 I am not 100% sure this is why I was let go, but most likely could have been in my case. 

Growing up I was told to always tell the truth even when it could get me into trouble and to answer questions if asked. 

Also for this job I was just let go from, I was written up for informing the company that they could be sued for customer data being leaked do to a hack and told them to have a redundant backup system that is not online. Another thing I was written up for was not telling when a customer had issues with one of my coworkers to the supervisor.

839,"So to keep it short, from age 12 to 19 I struggled with anxiety but it didn't become unmanageable until I was around 19 years old. The stress of adjusting to college as well as worrying about how to pay for college really triggered my anxiety to the point where I decided that I needed to go on medication. So I went on fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It helped but eventually two years in around 2017, I started to develop suicidal thoughts and admitted myself to a psych facility at a hospital. 

The dose of the fluoxetine was upped and a mood stabilizer was added to my regimen. Then, I started to gain 25 pounds, become lethargic, and emotionally numb virtually every day. In May of 2019, I talked to my PA about tapering off the medications to see how well I can manage without them. She agreed and she started my taper. Currently I am only on 10 mg of fluoxetine, and she plans to discontinue it when I see her in a couple of weeks approximately.

I just want to vent and ask for some personal advice about my concerns.


I was browsing Google and read some disturbing things about mental illness, psychiatric hospitalizations, and psychiatric medications. I saw some things that employers can use mental health issues as a means to not hire or to terminate an employment usually using something else as a scapegoat excuse.

Also I saw some information about side effects of the fluoxetine I was on that can be permanent. I talked to my primary care physician, and three psychiatric physician assistants about this and they all told me that they have never encountered that case in their experience as healthcare providers and that ""Dr. Google can be malevolent and inaccurate"". However, I have strong doubts of this because a common trend online about medication is that ""everyone reacts differently"" and ""doctors don't know what they are doing often times"".

I really don't know who to trust. The web or my doctors.

1. Should I trust the advice of four medical professionals over what I read online?

2. Is there a chance that I can get a good life back for the foreseeable future after my PA stops my treatment?

3. Should I worry must over the fact that everyone responds differently to medication? I heard horror stories of people dying or developing serious side effects due to antidepressants.",27Jan2020,1
840,"2 months ago I told my best friend that I need to ""put our friendship aside"" because it's causing far too much anxiety/emotional distress. I've known her 15+ years and this is probably our 3rd or 4th falling out. It's a toxic friendship - jealous, passive aggressive, possessive/territorial, guilt tripping, etc.

Long story short: she got engaged abruptly (after 4 months dating) and didn't take it well that I wasn't willing to drop everything for her wedding. She got upset that I was ""hesitant"" to be her MOH after she told me she wanted a destination wedding in Italy (in May, June, Sept or Oct - still hasn't decided). To be clear, I am already MOH in another wedding this August, but she insisted I be hers because I am ""the most important person"" in her life. I'm also saving to buy a house this year and my husband and I are trying to conceive, so it's simply not financially within my means to throw in a trip to Italy and be an MOH twice over but she took that as me ""pushing back."" She questioned if my husband and I are ""ready for a baby"" because of our current financial situation. She was still expecting me to execute her bach and bridal shower, whether I could attend the wedding or not. I told her I couldn't commit to this and wanted her to choose someone who was able to step up and fulfill the role (she hadn't announced a bridal party and had no date or venue yet). She also got upset that I'd considered plans to travel for my BROTHER'S wedding (not even this year but in 2021!) 

After all this, she wanted me to go bridal dress shopping with her and her mom (no one else), on Thanksgiving weekend - the SAME weekend that the other bride had her dress appt (I told her this weeks in advance), and wants me to go to 3 different bridal shops. Still no wedding date, no venue, her sister is out of town and no one in her bridal party was asked to go. She could have gone any other weekend, or just with her mom, but I found it odd that she kept creating situations where I would have to compromise time, money and other people in my life for her, beyond what I'm comfortable with and only for her to react passive aggressively when I say no. I'm summing this up, but this type of behavior went on repeatedly before I had to walk away. 

I haven't kept up or looked at her social media, but she's viewing every one of my IG stories, along with her ex-bf and current fiance. I don't think it's healthy for her to look at everything I'm doing, and it will probably feed negative thoughts, but I won't stop her. Her ex-bf didn't like me and said we'd never be friends. Her fiance weirds me out. Neither follow me, so they have to type in my name and look up my profile every day to see my stories - and they never miss one.  

I told my husband and he suggested I block the ex-bf and fiance, so I did, but did I go too far with blocking her fiance? I don't even know if she knows he's been looking, or what the intentions were, but I just felt weird about it, wondering what she could possibly be saying about me.

845,"Myself (f 21) and this old friend lets call them May (f 21) used to be best friends ever since elementary school. We were basically inseparable and at one point even lived in a duplex together (top floor ours bottom floor theirs). In middle school we kind of drifted apart a bit because of all the new people we were meeting but still had our core group with a few new people. Middle school was also when i started dealing with depression. I was unmedicated and very depressed all the time which i think made things seem different in my head then what they actually were. We got into a lot of fights (again looking back i think my mental state made me think differently) but always resolved them and continued on. once we were in highschool the same dynamic continued for a couple years until i decided to end the friendship. At the time i thought it was best for me but looking back now im obviously unsure. May took it badly but after a few weeks texted me to make amends. I agreed and we texted a bit until the texts became fewer and more far between. Thats where it was left.

I'm needing advice because...
As of lately I have not been able to stop thinking about that friendship. I can't get it out of my head what would have happened if we had stayed friends? Technically  it didn't end on a bad note but after so many years (at least 5 years) part of me thinks whats the point? I want to apologize for my skewed view of our friendship because i truly blame my depression for making it so bad towards the end. I have checked out their social media since then and it seems like now past all the drama of school we could have been really good friends. Same interests and it looks from what I've seen like we've grown a lot too. 

Do I try and reconnect even for the sole purpose of apologizing? It's been so long I don't want to bring up bad past feelings for May either though. I dont have May on any social media (just have seen some stuff from a non private account) so how would i get in contact with them?

850,"don’t know how to really phrase this any other way. i don’t want to sound whiny or anything, but i genuinely don't know why i’m being bullied.  it’s not a consistent thing, but every now and again it’ll happen and it really bugs me for some reason.  i don’t cause a scene or overreact, i barely even react, so getting a reaction out of me can’t be the motive.  normally everyone’s really nice to me. normally everything’s fine.

just once a month a group of girls/guys and their friends will go out of their way to make fun of me.  i know this isn’t a very good example, but today they stopped me in the hall and said something like “hey, [ my name ]!!  hey, hey, my buddy wants to know your snapchat. what’s your snapchat?” and when i asked why they all started laughing. and started muttering about how i probably post nudes n shit on there. i just kind of walked away, didn’t make a big deal or anything but now i feel really fucked. i want to cry.

it seems like such a minor thing, but the thing is i rarely talk to these people.  i don’t do anything to make myself the target.  i don’t overreact.  i barely even have a reputation, good or bad. so i don’t know why they chose me out of everyone. i think that’s the part that bugs me the most. they always choose me and i don’t know why. i just mind my own business, do my work, and go home. despite that fact, they still feel the need to pick on me. call me a sissy, faggot, the same old shit for seemingly no reason.

854,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but basically I'm just looking for advice on some general problems I have that I can't seem to get rid of. Here are the problems:

1. My living situation is extremely crappy. I live in a one room dorm with another guy, and it is literally preventing me from living the life I desire to live. My sleep schedule is non-existent because I can't go to bed until he does, and am forced to wake up earlier. He has his girlfriend over all the time without asking(also has other people over without asking), and she usually spends the night. He doesn't clean up after himself, he smells like shit, he has gotten us both into trouble for his alcohol, he takes up so much of the room space, and he doesn't wake up to his alarm(so I have to call him while I'm in bed across the room to turn his alarm off when it wakes me up, but that's just a minor pet peeve). Overall, it just hasn't allowed me to use my time in the ways I would like to, and I am not getting alone time I desire.
2. I have no real friends. Nobody really knows me, I'm just the quiet one that nobody has any problems with. There's nothing wrong with this, in fact I kind of prefer it to be that way. But, somewhere inside me I long for a person who I can tell anything and everything to. Nobody wants to get to know me, but that's mostly a result of me not putting myself out there. I have a girlfriend who I can tell most things to, but a lot of the time it just doesn't feel right to tell her some of the things that I want to get off of my chest. I have considered talking to a counselor, but it's quite expensive and I would be cautious to talk about some of the things that I want to talk about. 
3. I'm not enjoying the things I do on a day to day basis, and I want to learn how to make healthy habits more enjoyable. Things like meditation and exercise have been included in my daily habits for a while now, but I have been doing both less and would like to make them more fun. In general, I just find it hard to enjoy day to day life because it's unexciting and repetitive, and I envy those who always enjoy what they are doing. In addition, I can't focus on the task at hand ever. Focusing on one thing at a time has always been hard for me, and this is something I want to change. I'm always thinking about the past/future instead of enjoying the present, and it is something that holds me back.

I will devote the following 4-6 weeks to switching from mono to poly-phasic sleep. However there are some issues or factors that i need help with.

)i have a 11 hour window in which to sleep and wake,but after that I have only one chance to nap,meaning only one short nap,before i can return to the window. so, the 13 hours of day-time I have to cope with only a 30 min nap.

)I may have sleep insomnia and im afraid of spending 20 minutes --falling-l alseep,and just sleeping for 10 minutes,. How can i overcome this fear and problem?

)I have melatonin pills. should i take them before the first of my naps?or will they hurt me in my new schedule?",27Jan2020,1

861,"I’ll keep it short and sweet. I went to a good college (not Ivy, but renowned). I had a great time there, and even performed pretty well (just under a 3.5). But I didn’t network, and I didn’t intern in anything related to my major. 

After I graduated, I managed to get a job at a film production company as a receptionist/ assistant. It’s been a year and I’m still here, but I want to leave. The job doesn’t pay awesome, but that’s not even the issue. The issue is that it’s boring. 

I spend most days passing time- reading, writing, watching stuff whenever I’m not working. Online applications feel useless to me because I’ve applied to a good number and have heard back from very very few (and haven’t even gotten interviews).

I want a new job but I have a limited network and I struggle with motivation. I’m depressed because I know that I’m smart, but I don’t believe in myself nor do I have the courage or the discipline to really take a stab at something new. 

How do I stop feeling so down? How do I rediscover motivation? How do I build a network out of nowhere? How does one begin to get out of this kind of rut?",27Jan2020,1

863,"A few years ago a girl broke up with me and I never really processed it. She moved across the world and has been enjoying her life partying in Australia, and I felt inadequate and lonely. I started thinking that if I became rich and famous, a 'big shot', that would never happen, which is stupid. At the same time during that suicidal depression, I got caught up in some of these internet gurus who promise you fame and fortune if you follow their mindsets/steps. I realize how pathetic this is, but when you feel that low in life I think it's easy for people to take advantage of you.  
I've enjoyed some decent success, nothing insane but I am definitely ahead of almost everyone my age, as far as life stability, fitness, money, 'fame', etc goes... But I'm definitely not happy. At all. I was happiest before all of this when I just worked on my hobbies/projects, spent time with loved ones, and didn't care what anybody thought of me.    
    
I want to go back to the way I was but I feel brainwashed by this poisonous mindset. If I stop posting on social media everyday, stop my podcast, stop all my routines and habits I feel like I'm giving up and will never be a success, even though I don't even really want ""that"" kind of success anymore. I feel like I'm leaving a cult that I (and these internet gurus) created, and it's extremely distressing. And to top it off, I bet nobody gives a damn about my success, or if I stopped doing these things. My ego is essentially out of control.

865,"Why do I want to die? I think it's because I can't let go of the past. I can't let go of the injustice and cruelty dealt to me. I have forgiven, but even in my dreams I cannot forget. It haunts me. I want to forget, but my brain and my nervous cannot forget. The anxiety has ebbed significantly, but the depression has taken hold of me. I am so ashamed and disgusted, and it has imbued me with an absolute sense of worthlessness. I'm grateful to have lived, but, I sense that my life is spent already. Harrowing experiences are meant to make you stronger, but it hasn't for me. I feel out of control and powerless. 

I try to transport my energies from self unto others so as to worry more about others than myself- and this comes naturally for otherwise I would have killed myself a long time ago already- but feeling worthless, ashamed and powerless has rendered me feeling unnecessary as a human being; I have to keep reminding myself that I am in fact a human person, and not some type of sub-human creature with inadequate faculties, and of a sub-standard nature. 

Valueless.

I know people will say that it's a filter my mind has been blinded with due to past experiences and interpretations, but to me the issue lies so deep that it is unreachable. It's lost somewhere in the unfathomable emptiness and darkness that underlies my existence. It's so deep, it's seems to me to be not part of me. It's something beyond me. Like its source lies in the multiple other expressions of existence, even from a parallel dimension... somewhere inaccessible, no matter how much I meditate or allow healing to take place through the process of replacing false beliefs and opinions in my subconscious. So what I'm saying is... I believe my problem stems from somewhere deeper than my subconscious. 

It's much much bigger than me. It's from somewhere much vaster. Something outside of my existence- my experiences, subjective interpretations, whether subconscious or not. It's inception derives from prior my conception. It's from outside my DNA, and yet infused with it, mingled in like a link forced into the chain that makes me who I am. Something incomprehensible.

I don't think I'm making any sense here. 

I feel like the mould on a rotten, dying tree way out in the desert of space and time, like a parasite trying to eek out an existence from the rapidly rotting carcass of some creature whose demise coincided with the rest of life in some universal catastrophe. And it's left bereft and forgotten with only me, desperately, and invain, hanging onto some vague memory of the force of life that once might have had some thread thin connection with a dim shadow of a possible reality.

Omg this doesn't make sense even to me.

I don't feel real and neither does the world feel real. It's all a farce. 

And I'm stuck in limbo. I'm stuck here between a rock and hard place. Stuck between this unreality and the fear of hurting a handful of people with my escape from here. Where will I escape to? That scares me too, but I think logic leads me to believe I'll just not exist anywhere, without any sense of anything at all. Yay!

One of these nights, really soon, I fear that this drive to escape will overtake me. Two nights ago I was so close to ending it. If not for someone calling on me... 

But here I am. Still breathing. I don't know for how much longer. It's an oppressive state to be in every single day... and I've endured enough. There's only so much I can take.",27Jan2020,1
866,"Over the summer, I'll be working at an internship in a different city from where I currently go to school.  The place I'll be working is a pretty big college town so I just rented a room from a college student who lives in an apartment in the city. She seems fairly legit - showed me the lease that she handed over to her landlord (with both mine and her signatures on it). Initially she asked for a $250 deposit in case I decide not to move in to her place right before the summer and she has trouble finding someone else. She also said she would hold on to the money in case nothing is damaged and would return it to me at the end of my stay. She asked me to Venmo it to her. I said I would like some more time and preferred if I paid her the deposit closer to the move in date to which she agreed and said late February or early March is fine.

I know i am extremely empathetic but i can also be extremely mean.

I don't know why but i always get thoughts about doing the worst disgusting things to people i care about, like i fantasise about making them go into complete despair, such as completely humiliating them in front of everyone. Then it makes me guilty that i always think about this shit.

I think I am completely perfect and flawless, but inside i am extremely insecure? But i don't feel insecure,

basically my brain and heart think complete opposite thoughts.

I feel like i don't know who i truly am as my personality changes A LOT through out the day. When i get things perfect, such as my voice flowing and sounding perfect, my hair looking perfect etc, i get into a great mood but it fades fast. When i get one thing wrong such as speaking to someone when im in a bad mood and cannot muster enough energy to seem like an extremely fun person, or my lips not perfectly moisturised, then my whole day is ruined and i am on verge of mental breakdown.

When I approached an entrance ramp, a pickup truck was on that ramp and try to enter and merge into the highway. I was a litter ahead of it so I just kept driving on my regular speed. Just after I passed the entrance, the truck passed me from the right shoulder and cut me off and then brake-checked me. the distance was too short so I rear ended the truck. Then it ran off. BTW, the truck not just brake-checked me but also stopped in the middle of highway before he ran off.

I have a dash cam installed in my car and recorded everything. Not sure if it is legal to paste it here

Anyway, I called the police after and a police officer showed up and gave me a report. He didn't say who's fault or so. I've contacted my insurance company and let them know the story. The insurance company replied this morning and said I probably gonna take full fault on this.

877,"So my 13-year-old sister has always been a bit...off. She used to take delight in destroying my things and I used to think this was normal sibling behaviour until my next little sister was born. Not once has my youngest sister done anything like that so I now know it isn't normal.

My 13-year-old sister is continuously getting into trouble at school for bullying other children. Nobody in my family is a bully, she is not learning this from us! My poor mother has tried everything in terms of punishments and trying to get through to her. She has only just got her phone back after literally months of not having it due to bullying and other bad behaviours.

I was bullied in school myself by older girls and it really affected me and gave me intense social anxiety. 

What can we do to change this behaviour? Nothing has worked so far, it seems like she simply does not care about any punishment thrown her way. She's received punishments in school and they don't work either. We're at a total loss and worried that she's actually a psychopath.

879," 

Background:  
I currently have really awful mental health and I'm approaching the time where I'll have to either go to college or get a job, and I don't think I'll be able to handle either. I can do basic things, but most days I have an episode where I lose my memory and become immobilized by random mental agony, or my heart pounds and I feel senseless panic directed at nothing in particular. Beyond just being ill, I'm simply not a ""people person"" and I don't see how I could get a job with or without a degree when I'm so inherently unsocial. I'm not anxious in social situations, but people tell me I behave unusually (I twitch, don't look in the right places, don't pick up on certain cues, express things in highly idiosyncratic ways, etc. *Not autistic, not nervousness*) and I have esoteric interests that make it hard for me to relate to others. Making new friends isn't something important to me, but I'm concerned that my personality will alienate employers. My physical strength is pretty bad and I have respiratory issues, so labor-intensive work/skilled trades are out of the question even though I have an interest in them.

I have excellent high school grades, but I'm concerned that my health will deteriorate too much and I'll drop out. Another thing that bothers me is that high school was extremely easy to me and I could simply sit and listen in class, not take notes or study, and figure out all the content on the tests. Yes, this seems like a major advantage, but I have no experience or habit of studying and I'm worried this will screw me over hard when I go to college. I'm interested in practically every subject except business and healthcare, but I don't have a passion and I hate the idea of choosing one major or working in one discipline (I like the way school is, where you can do varied subjects). I wouldn't know what to do in college or after college.

I would really like to move to the US because I have a friend that lives there and there's nothing I'd like more than to live with him, but I don't see how I can get to America without being a student/getting a job. For personal reasons, my current life environment is really uncomfortable for me and worsens my health, and I can't access help. I want to seek mental health help if I move to America, but I don't think I qualify for disability aid if I'm not a citizen and I'm unsure on what would happen if I dropped out of college or was unable to land or stick to a job. There isn't anywhere for me to go in my home country. **My main fear is just that my health will get in the way of education, or that it will block me from job opportunities.**

Right now, I'm trying my best to get a part-time job so I can get a bit of money for the future while I still can, but I haven't been able to land anything except automated rejection emails. I apply to every single job in the area that doesn't require a diploma so I'm not sure what the issue is, since most people my age in this area have jobs.

Specific questions:

1. Could I start an apprenticeship or work in skilled trades? I'm relatively intelligent and hard-working, I have some experience, and I'm good with details, but I have abysmal strength and need assistance for any tasks requiring heavy lifting or brute force.
2. How can I move to America and access help? Would I have support if I became unable to do college/work?
3. What options are there for me in terms of education and employment? Tips on getting a job would be greatly appreciated.
4. Any other advice that would be helpful?",27Jan2020,1

885,"so on december 31st my best friend's (Jane) grandmother (who she was extremely close to) died. She woke up to the news on January 1st that her grandmother had passed in her sleep. It was a long time coming, she had been sick for a while and had lived longer than doctors had expected (they said around june/july). Jane kept this all very private and no one knew until over a month later. 

On the first day of school (7th of Jan) Jane came in and was her usual, happy, bubbly self. In hindsight i realise that she was putting up a wall but at the time i didn't know (nor did anyone else) that her grandmother had passed. she came in for the first week and hasn't been in back since (it's the 21st of Jan as I'm writing this). 

here's the tricky bit, Jane and I are partnered for a project that is worth 40% of our final A level grade for one of our subjects and without Jane, i cannot get full marks, even if it's worth that, the exam board won't give it to me because the spec requires two people. I'm freaking out because 40% is a HUGE amount of my course and both Jane and i are on track for full marks. my teacher said she's emailed the exam board explaining the situation but it's ultimately up to them and they likely won't change the rules.

How do i get Jane to come into school without sounding insensitive? as someone who suffers from chronic depression, i know what i hate when being spoken to about it but my situation is very different from Jane's and everyone's depression is different. any attempt at communication to her is met with one word answers and sometimes not even read. she's on her socials because she keeps posting pics of her grandmother and liking posts but she doesn't want to talk directly. how do i get her to come into school without being passive aggressive, insensitive or putting more stress on her with the project?",27Jan2020,1

892,"I have been unemployed since January 2019, but applied for a salesjob at an erotica market. It's looking pretty bright and positive on that I will get the job - I will find out on this Friday. 

Now the thing is; I wanna study to become a teacher. A middle school teacher. My whole education will take another 6-7 years and this job is only temporary so that I can earn money until July 2020 - when my school starts again. By then I will hopefully have done a lot of internships and voluntary services to add to my CV.  


My issue with this is - Won't it look weird if I'm a middle school teacher that has worked at an erotica market 8 or 10 years ago when I start applying for schools. Then again - My CV will be so filled, so I'm thinking not adding my work experiences pre-education anyway, else I'll end up with 6 pages.

905,"Dear Redditors,  
You probably get these questions often.. but here is mine anyways.   
Because I am not sure what I can do to help my lovely gf.  


My gf (18F) is a real **perfectionist**.   
She always expects the best from **herself** and wants to do everything right at the first try.  
To the point that she goes to school at 8 in the morning, sits to 5 and then works to 12 in the afternoon so she could get the best results.  
She also works 2 days a week with a total of 14 hours.  
I (17M) can barely get my schoolstuff done. We both do the highest possible schooling in The Netherlands. (Gymnasium).  


Her mother also has MS and even though she doesn't want to pressure her, she still puts a lot of weight on my gf.  


And most of the time my gf thinks I deserve ""better"" and the ""Go find someone who can really be your girlfriend"". But the truth is. She is really all I can long for in a relationship. She is so sweet, nice, kind and special but she puts way too much pressure on herself and she can't relax.

And the thing that bothers me the most is that she doesn't believe in life anymore.

""No. Not everything will be all right."" is what she usually says. Even though she is one of the best in the class and has a lovely family. (though sometimes really irritating and pushy)  


So.. my question: Is there anything I can do for her? I try to listen to all her problems. (She doesn't want ""sollutions"" because its always put too easy.  


(even if there are no replies... it is really helping to already put it on ""paper"")  


Thanks Reddit &lt;3",27Jan2020,1
906,"As of recently me and my best friend of 10+ years have ran into this problem that I don’t know how to feel about it. The problem is that I’ve been kind of distant with her and She came to me today asking me what my problem is and why I’ve been acting the way I have. I explained to her that she’s been very off putting in conversations over text or when we talk she just kinda brushes the conversation off and we don’t really speak about anything after she does that cause I felt that she’s closed off. If she gets like that I don’t feel like I have a way into talking to her cause she continuously j brushes conversations off. Now the reasoning around that is that me and her recently dated ab out a month ago she decided she wanted to break it off but still be close friends due to her situation at home where she’s hard at work taking care of her business. When she came to me confronting me about that she heard from someone else that I was feeling the way I was she went off on me and started crying about how everyone she’s ever talked to always hides something from her and that she’s done trying with people. Can someone tell me what I’m supposed to do with that situation? Because whenever she makes a mistake and she does something I don’t like I forgive her and I’m super understanding, but when I make a mistake she it’s like she doesn’t have time for it or she wants to run off and be super upset instead of trying to understand it’s like there’s 0 room for error for me.

910,"I’m a 15 year old guy and currently live with my (now single) mum in a flat or apartment for any American reading this, she was cheated on, fyi, around Christmas.

But here’s the deal, we’ve had problems with things being stolen in the close and my mum is ‘99%’ sure that it’s a loud, junkie mother and her 13 year old daughter upstairs, these are the type of people that generally cause a racket by shouting and slamming doors among other things that would take too long to write out. Now it fuckin boils my blood because we’re always friendly and NEVER bother anybody, we have a close knit family that don’t stick our noses in other peoples business, I’d also like to think that we’re good people.

There was one time when she put a vase in the close to just make the place a bit nicer and well, it was taken. Coincidentally, this daughter manages to cross paths with my mother in the close at some point after and proceeds to have the nerve to actually tell her that it looks like her vase got nicked. My mum tells me that she wanted to reply with “Yeah, by you” but was hesitant because she’s not absolutely certain it was them before accusing.

Now I have clothes coming in that’s costing around £180 and thankfully the parcels are being dropped off at the post office for pickup but for in the future, how do I deal with this if I’m not home to take something in and they manage to get their dirty hands on it?

911,"My partner and I (both 18) have been dating for a year now and have known each other as long as we can remember. We’re moving in together for uni next year but we’re having a bit of a hard time right now. This is by no means a break up scenario, I feel I need to clarify that this guy is my person, like I’ve never felt so certain about someone before. Despite this, my heart is breaking over him. 

We have both had traumatic experiences but his takes more of a toll on his everyday life as it was more recent. When I lived in our hometown it was easier because every time he’d have a “wobble” I’d be a five minute walk away and always able to comfort him - now I’m on the other side of the country in uni and he’s finishing high school this year back at home. I try my best to be there when I can but I physically can’t help him more than by just talking on the phone. It begins to take a toll on my health when he has a falling out at home and runs away, or refuses to go to school. How can I go to uni or do anything when I know he’s struggling so much and can’t do anything?

I just feel so helpless while this happens, like I’m forced to just sit and watch as my loved one suffers over and over again. I used to feel like I was good at helping, as I’ve experienced trauma before but I’ve only recently realised that our situations are far different and shouldn’t be compared. He is so important to me, and it makes me feel so empty inside knowing I can’t help (at least not as well as I used to be able to). 

The problem is that he refuses to seek help. I understand that many people require different solutions for mental health issues, but his idea of “it’ll fix itself” is unrealistic and damaging in my mind. When I was at my lowest point I sought therapy, I understand it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but I feel like it’s the most adaptable method of care and help. I would feel a lot better if he gave it a try and realised afterwards that it wouldn’t help instead of bluntly refusing, saying “it’s none of their business” or “I don’t want to look weak”. Even if he found an alternative to therapy I’d be overjoyed.

I love him more than anything, but I can’t just sit and watch him spiral because he doesn’t think he needs help. The signs are so obvious to me (quitting hobbies, missing school, falling out of contact with friends and not being bothered to do anything in general) but he doesn’t seem to realise - or maybe doesn’t want to realise - that there’s something wrong. 

Also if you see this, you know I love you more than anything and I’m really sorry, I just need to know how to best support you because just waiting and hoping isn’t working.  

tl;dr - I need help supporting my partner long distance, but he refuses therapy or any other kind of mental health help on the basis that “it’ll fix itself”.",27Jan2020,1

Okay so I have to keep reminding myself that I am in fact a human person, and not some type of sub-human creature with inadequate faculties, and of a sub-standard nature. 

I feel like I have nothing of value to add to the world.

I know people will say that it's a filter my mind has been blinded with due to past experiences and interpretations, but to me the issue lies so deep that it is unreachable. It's lost somewhere in the unfathomable emptiness and darkness that underlies my very existence. It's so deep, it seems to me that it's not a part of me. It's something beyond me. It's like the source of my issue lies somewhere inaccessible, no matter how much I meditate or allow healing to take place through the process of replacing false beliefs and opinions in my subconscious. So what I'm saying is... I believe my problem stems from somewhere deeper than my subconscious. 

It's much much bigger than me. It's from somewhere much vaster. It's something outside of my existence- my experiences, subjective interpretations, whether subconscious or not. It seems to derive from somewhere that undermines the notion that it's either nature or nurture.

I don't think I'm making any sense here.

I don't feel real and neither does the world feel real. It seems to be all a farce. Nothing feels real.

One of these nights, really soon, I fear that this drive to escape this unreality will overtake me. Two nights ago I was so close to ending it. If not for someone calling on me...

That relationship ends up being a disaster but then she moves on to start talking and flirting with another person at work.

923," Long-ish story ahead, you have been warned!

Started playing games a while ago, like 2 years maybe, around 95% slots and 5% sporting bets. No roulette or any other table games becaause they are not available in my country (or at least not in my city, maybe only in the top 3 biggest cities or so). Even though, like any gambler more or less, I know that the odds are against me, I play slots quite a lot. I never lose essential money that is supposed to go for basic living stuff, I never borrow money to play or do such things, BUT I lose most of my ""expendable"" money to them, which angers me in the end, because I can no longer invest as much as I used to in my hobbies and similar things. I can take breaks, but even so, at some point I will start again and it's making me unable to save money. I can save for 2-3-4 weeks at times but it always ends up the same way. Also, did not have a decent win in a year.

Bigger problem is that slots here are even more stacked against the player than in other places. No one really controls the casinos or they just bribe the people who are supposed to check them, so they mess with the pay rate as they please. There have been people who actually looked into it deep and found out that some casinos raise the RTP (or similar thing) to very high 1-2 nights a month when there are many people playing, only to lower them waaaay beyond the legal level and winning becomes outright impossible. Since a lot of people are outright addicted, it doesn't matter, they are still gonna play and the casinos are exploiting this to get way more money than they'd usually do.

I've managed to make some progress lately (my playing sessions have become rarer and the money lost has decreased (let's say that from losing 90-95% of my disposable money, it's down to a 60-70%). It's a progress, but still. I tried to quit completely (and still am) many times but since there are literally multiple slot machine places on every slightly important street, you're gonna get the temptation 5 times if you do as little as go to the next supermarket to buy 2 beers. They. Are. Literally. Everywhere.

Any advice on how to stop for good will be highly appreciated. As I have mentioned, some progress was made in the past few months, but I want to go beyond that. Thanks!",27Jan2020,1

928,"I’ve been working as a CNA for the past four months at a skilled nursing facility making $13.50/hr. The work isn’t bad but the management sucks and to be honest, so do many of the residents. Never in my life have I met so many entitled, spoiled, rude, demanding, hateful, and just plain disgusting people. This is long term care so unlike a hospital I’m pretty much stuck with these people until they finally kick it. There are some I like but I’m not sure the positives outweigh the negatives. I have a high degree of anxiety surrounding my job as I never know where I’ll be placed or who I’ll be working with until the day of (they float me constantly) and some halls and coworkers are worse than others. The last straw is the mandatory overtime they’ve given me and almost every other day shift CNA. I’m now working 4 12 hour shifts a week, and they’re trying to make me work 5 IN A ROW one week (although I won’t do that whether or not I can find coverage). 

The pros to staying in my current job is that it’s close to my house (about 5 minutes away), I like some residents/coworkers, and the pay is better than most places around here. 

The cons are that I hate the management and a good chunk of the residents. 

I’ve considered finding another job. If I can get $12/hr 40 hours a week the pay will be almost the same as my $13.50/hr 36 hours a week job I have now. I’d only be making $6 less a week which I’m okay with. However, it’s more likely I’d find a job that pays $11 an hour and that’s a $46 difference weekly or $1440 difference over the course of the next 30 weeks (the time until I start nursing school). I’m currently living with my dad and don’t have any bills just personal expenses.

As of last year October 2019 I (19 F) have been trying to join the Air Force National Guard/ Reserves. (They recently became the same thing.) I’m now having second thoughts. I went to MEPs earlier this month and passed everything with flying colors but at the very last second I was told that I have “Extremely dry eyes,” and that I’d have to see a doctor which they would appoint, then I’d have to come back to MEPs... Which should all take around about 1-3 months. I felt like that was a bunch of BS but I didn’t complain and just decided to go with the flow. The condescending officers with their superiority complex’s didn’t help with my situation at all either, but I just chose to ignore that also. I sucked it up and kept it pushing. A few days goes by, then I get a rather interesting phone call from my recruiter. He was telling me that some information at MEPs had gotten mixed up and I’d have to go back not to see the doctors for my “Dry eyes,” this time.. But to retake some medical tests which he nothing to do with my eyes first. I was at a loss for words so now my process will take longer than 3 months and I most likely won’t be able to knock out BMT and Technical training in time for the Fall Semester. I’m feeling defeated and wondering if it’s even worth it to join the Reserves and if I should just finish school and not join the military? Or maybe just revisit this decision when I have the time and financial stability to.. then join AF active duty? To top everything off, I never wanted to join the military either. I always wanted to be a Forensic Officer, I even started going to college a year early just to work towards that goal but my parents and sisters all told me as of last year that the benefits the military gives would be worth all of the hassle.

But because of a family emergency, I had to withdraw from the CC and be at the hospital. My unlucky ass withdrew a day after the deadline for dropping classes, meaning I ended up receiving a W. After wards, i decided to apply to several UC schools, and go to one next year. I only now realized that I did not report that I took those classes and received a W. I emailed several people about this in the campuses.

932,"hello! thank you everybody for reading this.

Im 20 years old, almost a year ago my father passed away randomly. At that time I was taking a year off from school and working a couple jobs. after he passed I quit everything and basically have wasted the past year of my life doing nothing. at this point i feel im starting to go crazy, getting frustrated because im doing the same pointless things almost everyday, lonely, and my hobbies half the time are annoying to do now. Im having a hard time getting a clear idea of what I want to do so I just avoid the thoughts i guess, after what happened last year ive developed some bad mental habits. I just want to start enjoying life again, and not waste anymore time. i re applied to colleges recently but in the meantime I just want to advance myself and actually enjoy the days.

would really appreciate some advice, thank you.",27Jan2020,1
933,"Hi, all. I (16F) am, unfortunately, addicted to nicotine. It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s the truth. The story of how I became addicted is probably similar to most people’s. I struggle a lot with mental health issues and turned to an unhealthy habit to cope.

Unfortunately, I am underage and I’ve run out of nicotine pods. The person I usually get them from isn’t going to be available for another week or so, and I’m going through serious withdrawals. The best way I can describe it is an itch I just can’t scratch. I just want some more pods, but I hate being addicted.

But because of a family emergency, I had to withdraw from the CC and be at the hospital. My unlucky ass withdrew a day after the deadline for dropping classes, meaning I ended up receiving a W. After wards, i decided to apply to several UC schools, and go to one next year. I only now realized that I did not report that I took those classes and received a W.

948,"Hi Redditors,
I need your advice. I (16M) am really starting to catch feelings for a girl in my grade. She came over to my house last weekend along with a couple other of my friends (both male and females came over, wasn’t just me and her). I really liked hanging out with her and I find her very attractive as well. However, I really don’t know what to do with this situation. 

Sure, I’ve had interactions with girls in the past; this isn’t my first time. But, this situation is different for a variety of reasons. First, it is important to note that I’ve had feelings for this girl before (fall of 2018). We hung out during that time period as well and she knew I liked her but nothing ever came of it. Never dated or hung out exclusively or anything like that. Second, I should note that this girls feelings are impossible to read. Everyone (me, my friends, and her friends included) can never tell if she has feelings for anyone or who she’s interested in. 
Third, and most importantly, I’m lacking confidence to try and snapchat her because I feel like i’m not her “type”. She’s a really nice girl but she has a personality where she always wants to be “cool”, so she’s been known to like the kind of guys who act cool and don’t give a shit about anyone around them. I haven’t texted/snap chatted her in over a year and even though a lot of friends are telling me i need to start to talk to her, I feel nervous about the situation because I’m scared she’ll just laugh about the situation and shut me down. 

What advice do you guys have for me? What should I do?",27Jan2020,1

954,"Posting this using an account I use for a specific sub, but using it here just to avoid detection. 

Basically, my fiancé has told me a variety of stories about his manager acting inappropriately with female colleagues, some of whom are only 16/17 year olds. He’s 26, and their superior. 

As the title suggests I don’t know whether to encourage my fiancé to report him, or to just make an anonymous complaint myself?

A complaint has already been made by a female colleague after he was ‘flirting’ with a 17 year old girl during her induction. I don’t know what exactly the outcome was, but he’s still in his position, so it seems very little/nothing has changed. 

Further things my fiancé has heard about(from reputable sources)/witnessed himself include the following: 

- him telling a 17 year old girl that he’d ‘like to see her on a night out’. 

- him commenting on how ‘fit’ a 16 year old is. When a colleague said, ‘you do know she’s 16?’, he replied with, ‘that means she’ll be tight’. 

- varied and repetitive comments about how he knows girls want to ‘fuck’ him. 

- continuous flirty behaviour with female members of staff and general inappropriate comments. 

Additionally, he’s in a five year relationship. 

I appreciate much worse things could be happening, but I just remember starting my first job at 16 and feeling so nervous and unsure. Fortunately I didn’t experience any inappropriate behaviour, however if I had, especially from a superior, I’m not sure I would have had the courage to bring it up myself, nor would I even necessarily have known who I could safely speak to about it. Also, I worry that if he continues to face no repercussions for his behaviour, then it’ll escalate and he may do much worse. 

I just really don’t know what to do, and any advice would be hugely appreciated!",27Jan2020,1
955,"**TLDR:** My dog freaks out when it comes to me (or the vet) trying to keep up with his hygiene/health (nail clipping, daily medicine, baths, doctors appointments) and I need advice on how to help him become less skeptical/scared. 

My boyfriend (21M) and I (20 F) own an Australian Cattle Dog (Kairo, 2 y/o neutered M) mixed breed that we rescued when he was just a puppy at around 2 months. He is super sweet, ***very*** smart, and doesn’t have a history of abuse or bad treatment. 

My issue is that he is very skeptical when it comes to anything upkeep or hygiene related. For example, he takes allergy medicine daily but always knows when we’re trying to give it to him and will refuse to come near us until we stop. We give him the allergy medicine by putting the pill into a spoon full of peanut butter and letting him lick it clean. We’ve tried pill pockets and other foods, but he will literally spit the pill out as soon as he feels it in his mouth. 

Another example is when we're trying to clip his nails, he freaks out and won’t come near us. We have tried easing him into it and giving him a treat for even just being around or being shown the clippers, but if it gets near him he shows his teeth and runs away.

He also has issues when seeing our vet so the only way my vet is able to give him shots or check him for any issues is by sedating him. We’ve only sedated him one time and I would like to keep it limited/not at all, but I really don’t want him to be terrified of everything. We’ve also had many “happy vet trips” where he will go and the veterinarian will literally just give him treats, play with him, and get him more comfortable with being in the environment.

He literally doesn’t trust anything medical related and I am so unsure as to how to help him and myself by making the process of upkeep generally easier. He’s really smart so trying to trick him into doing these things without him noticing is literally impossible. It always eventually leads to us just giving up since we don’t want to punish or hurt him. He also doesn’t get distracted or persuaded by treats or by us talking him through it as soon as he starts acting on edge.",27Jan2020,1

I've suspected various things that could be causing it and I personally felt like it was issues with her relationship. I know her very well, well used to... We were extremely close, but things got a little rough when we realised our friendship was becoming more than that (hence extra reluctance to ever open up to me anymore). So I get a good sense of her behaviour etc and could tell things weren't okay. If I tried to show any kind of direct care, like asking how she is or reminding her that I'm always there if she ever needs to chat, then she would get quite defensive and shrug everything off as she's fine.



Today I found out from a colleague that my friend is actually having a really bad time currently with her relationship (as I and others suspected). It's effecting her mental health now and essentially my friend shut down everyone since the new year, she isn't speaking to people very much.



I totally understand where she is right now, she's hoping for her relationship to work out, she is struggling to admit it even to herself that things aren't going well. She has never taken any friends or families advice in the past when these things were predicted. Now she's in so deep and unwilling to accept any advice or care. 



I'm getting increasingly concerned, as is my colleague. Neither of us know any of her family or her friends to do anything useful. I know it's her life and her decisions, I respect that, so all I wish for is to cheer her up a bit, to ease the stress she's putting herself through. No friend wants to sit and helplessly watch someone struggling like this.



What little things can I do to show her I care and support her during this time? We work together if that helps. I'm somewhat restricted, I'd take her out to lunch or something like that, but based on previous things, she might get that wrong idea from that... I'm not looking for anything like that, I simply valued the friendship we once had and can't see her like this everyday.

982,"I’ll just quickly preface this by excusing my bad English. It’s not my first language but I hope my message still gets across. Also, it’s going to be a bit long and probably just me rambling along the way. Sorry in advance. 

It’s past midnight where I live, and I can’t sleep because I’m thinking about a choice I made today. My classmates have agreed to go on a camping weekend in March and already booked the place (it’s not exactly the same as camping  but the English word comes close). Today, a classmate responsible for the whole planning posted about the trip and asked for us to let them know if we weren’t going. So I did. My friend was quick to text me asking what’s up, but didn’t believe me when I told her that I wasn’t feeling it. One of my arguments is that we have to write a big paper by the time that the weekend trip takes place and I want to fully focus on that. It plays a big role in our final grading as we are graduating this year. Not only that, but I also don’t feel as close with my classmates to be honest. It may sound like I’m just making up excuses, but I just feel like it would disappoint me to go. 

What worries me is that I’m sure my classmates will swarm me with questions. People I’m not even friends with will ask. This whole trip is a complete peer-pressure situation. They are planning to drink too (Youth drinking is a serious problem in my country) and I just know that someone would try to get me to drink if I tagged along. 

Here is where you might think: “Huh? Didn’t you just say that you weren’t feeling the trip? What’s with the change of heart all of a sudden?” Well, what my friend texted me did make me stop to think for a while. I was reminded that it was not until March and that anything could happen before that. Like, maybe I’d get a better relationship with my classmates or perhaps I’d finish my paper beforehand. These arguments honestly made me consider if I said no too quickly. Part of me is telling me that I’d might have fun going while the other part wants me to stay home and focus on my paper. I’m really conflicted about the situation. I’m interested in hearing about what you guys would do.",27Jan2020,1

Now before anything let me say i have gotten multiple opinions and comments from people irl or on sibredits where i posted different pictures for just some opinions.

Im pretty tired most of the time but docs haven't found any serious medical issues.I have heard comments from university classmates or people who are familiar with my looks say comments like ""Wow,o wouldnt recocnize him"",""Hahaha,look how he has become""and i even got pity stares by people in the cafeteria""This guy was a good looking kid last year"".I get it my face got messed up,my features skin and hair are unhealthy,but srly i never once thought anything about my appearance until i heard comments and realized the difference in treatment.

I really feel pathetic,its now to the point i have developed a fear of going out,im just to disgusted with the way i changed.Im afraid to look or talk to people and even go to my uni,im ashamed to show my face,i have no friends or anything like that for support.I want to flirt or even try my chances but i cant because i feel like i cant be accepted at this point,i just can't accept it,its so mentally exhausting.

Even when im walking on the street a girl will just lower her head and avoid me when passing by.My looks certainly feel  more intimidating since im 6""2,some might say height is an advantage but in my case it makes me more noticeable and intimidating.

Im sure again some might say""appearance is not all""""just move on"",but really please dont,i heard it,i know it,but i just can't, because thats what i got from my 20 years of my personal life experience and still get,and reality doesn't change that easily for me, because i dont have assets that can really make up for  what im now lacking in appearance,cause i didnt grow up not good looking but became due to unfortunate events and circumstances which implicated my health.",27Jan2020,1

991,"
Hi, 

So I just recently moved here. A month ago my crush and I had a good terms friendship. Laughed and talked quiet a bit. No feelings were involved at all. I enjoyed her company even though I don’t speak Spanish and she doesn’t speak English. I tried to ask her to do activities together on few occasions but she agree then ignore me. Finally I decided to ask her to go to a party together because I like parties and I go there quiet often. I have given some signs of interest and she probably never took it that serious anyway. I was not as hurt by her rejection as much as I am hurt by her reaction. She literally called me out on it. Just because I texted her “when will we go to party”  

She rejected me publically even though I asked her through text. I think that day she was really not in the mood of something wasnt right maybe. I dont know. She had done few act scenes that hurt. 

A little background previous me asking her out: we used to greet and kiss on the cheek. I would hug her tight, kiss her neck, she would hug me tighter. I had said before that I missed her. We agreed to have more conversations when I told her I enjoyed the way she talks. Well, that didnt seem to be enough. Anyhow, I tried to get closer to her. We had few exchanged signs or maybe I miss interpret it. A few days ago we went to an event in a group. I was looking at a mutual friend talking and she immediately turned my face towards her. We locked eyes for few seconds. Then,  she held my hand while crossing so we wont “get lost” in crowded place. And when i tried to replicate  and hold her hand, she would let go. 

The day of me asking her out: 

1) she was sitting with group of her friends. When I passed by, she called my name and when I went to her table, she started talking to another friend completely ignoring my existence. I was so disappointed and embarrassed as I stood there doing nothing. 

2) then, she texted me that she just read the text. 

3) she went to her room. Opened her window while I was sitting downstairs and literally said “my reply is no party” and other things in Spanish I didn’t understand. I just looked up and felt a bit bitter about it. Like why does she have to be so mean about it? I just don’t understand. She could just reject me 

Now, we are in horrible situation. She would avoid as I dont exist. She is not talking to me. She is not even greeting me as she used to. How come we cannot be civil about it? I swallowed the pill of rejection and fine with it. But as for her, she is not communicating with me at all. Its a bit sad and I am thinking perhaps if I find someone else and get distracted she would notice my lack of interest in her would bring me hers. I dont want to play games. We are adults. And me asking her out could have meant anything.",27Jan2020,1
992,"Should I stay or should I go now?

So I am about to finish my teachers college and am looking at jobs and the future and I am just so confused. So here is a bullet point of everything so that you can tell me what you would do in this situation:

- my partner doesn’t have a job and keeps telling me to go where my heart wants

- the state I live in is a dying ship. The politics of this state have shifted dramatically. Now I know that come September there will be a job for me. It won’t be my own classroom but it’ll be a full time job none the less

- I could swap to the next state over which is a coastal state. So that alone would increase my quality of living. Again the same issue of not having a full time job for May and June but I may have my own classroom which would be nice

- i am finally finding the community I’ve so desired here in my current city. I have friends outside of school who care and we talk daily. I have programs where I volunteer or just be present at and am missed if I miss a week for any reason. 

- my friends have ‘jokingly’ asked me not to go. I say this because we have become so close and I would be sad to go 

- the price of living is cheaper in this city and I have found the perfect apartment. It allows pets so I could finally get one and it’s in my price range. The other state this price would get me a flat the size of my current bedroom. 

- I couldn’t afford to have an apartment on my own in the new state or get a pet which is something I desire (the pet) and detest (the roommate.) for the roommate it’s because I’ve done five years of horrible roommates and I need some space for me to do me. 

- I don’t know anyone in the new state. My friend that is moving there would be two hours away at minimum from where I can afford to live. 

- I wouldn’t have help to move to the other state. By that I mean when I get there no one to help unload all my stuff 

- I was at a career fair and after I was talking and everyone agreed I was happier talking of the other states districts and jobs than my own. This may because my own states districts were doom and gloom with the current politics. 

- if I stay here I have support and connections. I know so many teacher who would help me in the first few months with no hesitations. I don’t have this kind of connections 

- the pay is better in my current state by a lot (the reason I could afford to fully live alone) 

- I have a job that will last me until September and if I move to the other state then I wouldn’t have a job. Or at least the safety net of a job. 

- after talking with my mom she says to go to the first one that offers a job but it doesn’t work the same way as other jobs. I’ll apply and sub and then wait till September. No district will hand me a job right now and sadly that’s just not how it works for education. 

I just don’t know what to do and I would love advice on how others would handle this situation",27Jan2020,1

996,"So here’s the tea:

My friend from home came to visit me and some of his other friends at my college, his name is James for the sake of the story. I went out that night with some of my friends and met up with James and some of his other friends at a bar, talked to all his friends, of which were really drunk, and had a fun time. Well one of his friends, named Sam, apparently kinda liked me so he got my number off of James. We started texting, and ended up really liking him and we started “talking” for about 3 weeks. Well one night, I stayed the night like I have a couple times and the next morning he hits me with the “I’m not over my ex” line (he dated his ex for 4 and a half years and they ended things in April and we started talking in mid September of the same year). I understood but I was still really hurt because he’s the one that pursued me. And then to make things worse, he asks if we could make our relationship more of a hook up situation and I was like “yeah no, I have feelings involved and that won’t end well.” 

So we don’t talk for about two months. Then one night I was talking to one of our mutual friends who encouraged me to reach out to Sam and see if we could be just friends because we got really close. So I did, and he was happy about that. And now we are good friends and we hang out sometimes. 

Here’s where the tea comes in though:

So this semester we’ve been hanging out, as friends, and I’ve noticed we aren’t really respecting the “just friends” boundaries a friendship kind of comes with. When we hang out with his roommates, he is always teasing me or tries to tickle me. When we go out on the weekends, he tends to hang more around me than his other friends, get involved in conversations that I start with random guys, and will usually either hug me from behind, put his hand on my leg, or rest his head on my shoulder. And then when we get back to his house all his roommates magically go upstairs and he’ll sit next to me on the couch and pull me into him where we’re kinda cuddling under a blanket together. And me being the cuddle hungry girl with feelings for him just goes along with it. And I just try to ignore the weird signs because confrontation is scary.

Well this Wednesday we went skating together because his friend invited both of us and his friend suddenly canceled so it was just the two of us. Does a friend grab said other friend around the waist or tuck hair behind their ear? No, I don’t think so. 

This weekend however made it so I couldn’t pretend it’s nothing, or it’s only one-sided anymore. We went out to the bars together, and it was fun and all and the whole time Sam and I were walking back with his roommates to their house he had his hand around my waist and pulling me into him. It was really cold so as soon as we got to their house, I hopped under the blankets and his roommates all disappear upstairs, as usual. So once again Sam and I end up cuddling, I get these amazing head scratches, and shoulder rubs, and a very surprising peck to the side of my head. I was getting tired and he then says “ok sleepy time for bed, let’s go” and he wasn’t telling me to go home or sleep on the couch. No, he was inviting me to sleep in his bed with him. It was verrryyy tempting but we have this “friendship” situation and I ended up saying no. I wanted to say yes, but I was so confused and needed to think about some things. 

It’s clear now that we both have feelings for each other. But I’m a sophomore in college while Sam is a senior. Meaning, in 3 months, he’ll graduate. So I need advice about this complicated situation because I could go for it and let things happen and be happy for the 3 months but then crushed when he graduates. Or I could set stricter boundaries and long for something more but save my heart in the long run. Or I could do nothing and stay in this confusing half couple half friendship situation I’m in. 

Any advice would be very appreciated!",27Jan2020,1
997,"   Ive been working at a company for a little over 2 years. My starting salary was basically minimum wage due to my lack of experience and fresh out of school since then, i slowly started to get better and understand the business. My peers compliment my work and my effort to improve.

i’m a 20F and i’m about to lose my virginity to a 20M. i’ve been in a couple long term relationships and have had many sexual encounters, but I’m still technically a virgin because i’ve never had a d*ck inside of me. there is a couple reasons for that, 1) I was molested in early teen years and I have extreme anxiety surrounding sex. none of my past sexual encounters have ever felt good or been enjoyable because of this. 2) I’ve struggled with a condition called vaginismus, which causes a woman to feel pain whenever anything is inserted into her vag. it’s often caused by anxiety or sexual abuse, both of which I’ve experienced. my last boyfriend and I were together for 1.5 years and did all the foreplay stuff but never achieved intercourse because of my vaginal pain. however, it can be cured through treatment. i’ve been in treatment for it for a little while now and after struggling for the past 5 years, I think I’m almost cured and ready for sex. A lot of people my age have been having sex since high school so I feel pretty behind. I feel insecure about the fact that i’m a virgin and that the person I am going to lose my virginity to is going to be more experienced. and even though my pain pretty much gone, I still struggle with intimacy because i’ve been abused in the past and feel uncomfortable when naked with another person I haven’t known for very long. I know this is something i’ll get over with time and experience, but I could use some advice. When I have intercourse for the first time, I don’t want to look like a noob and I want to have an idea of what to expect. the guy I’m losing it to isn’t my boyfriend and I haven’t decided whether to tell him about all of my past issues. he doesn’t know i’m a virgin because he knows i’ve had boyfriends in the past and assumes I had sex with them. I’m a little bit embarrassed to admit that I never did. how do I deal with having a partner that’s more experienced?what do you wish you knew before you had sex for the first time? what surprised you? how do I make it look like I know what i’m doing?",27Jan2020,1

Anytime I ask her to come around she always does, but she never comes alone. Her friends always seem to come along and I usually have a few friends around too. We tend to go partying a lot as a group and normally we drink. Some nights we drink more than others but we basically always drink. Ever since I met her I had my eyes on her and have wanted to get to know her more. Not only have I become closer to her than any girl I've ever talked to, but I also talk to her friends and honestly I like them too. This girl is not the type that doesn't have options she does and I get that so I don't really try to push anything. I mean she's not the only girl i've been into since we met. I guess maybe because i hang out with other girls then maybe she sees that as a reason to hang with other guys. Every time she comes around she always says i'm her favorite, and honestly shes my favorite girl too. We made out over the weekend and that was cool. She kind of just leaned over in the seat and put her head against my arm and chest. she took my hand and placed it in hers and placed my hand onto her chest. I couldn't stop looking at her eyes and eventually a song comes on and we began to kiss. I whispered how I felt in her ear and she just smiled and kissed me more. We end up stopping to get food because we are all hungry at this point. During the stop I kept holding her and brushing the hair away from her face, she has a pretty face. We drive for a little while longer and she ends up leaving to go into an apartment of this guy. I don't know him, but I asked her why she had to leave and she hugs me and says sorry but she has to go. I pleaded that she didn't leave but she did anyways. Kept hanging out with my friends and the friends she brought with her. Tried to not think about it too much, but I couldn't help but be happy because I had wanted to kiss her for a long time. It is weird that I feel this way even days after, but to me it felt right being with her and I haven't stopped thinking about her since. I have tried talking to other girls after to distract myself because deep down I know that most likely she was too drunk to even remember, and I am kind of afraid to ask her how she felt about it. Over the last few days she has posted pictures of me and her from the weekend and even put the song on that we started kissing too. This was our first kiss. I guess I really just want to know how she felt, but don't even know how to begin to ask. They say if you really love somebody you have to let them go and I believe that if something is meant to be then it will happen on it's own. Maybe i'm not actually in love or whatever and i'm just gonna end up getting myself hurt, but at this point two days have passed and I am just trying to figure out where to go from here.",27Jan2020,1
1007,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I also won’t name the church/religious group to maintain their privacy, since I believe it’s a relatively small church. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible but it might end up being longer than I anticipated so strap in, folks!

I (22F) met this friend (let’s call her Jen, 23F) my freshman year of college. We got close almost immediately, bonding over her childhood abuse and my recent abusive relationship. We understood each other when it felt like no one else did. We went to parties, stayed up too late talking all the time, and got lunch every day that we could. We talked about our experiences with sex, drinking, and general terrible decisions you tend to make when you’re 18 years old. She was super busy most days however, because she was deeply involved with her church both on and off campus.

Jen’s very Christian, and I’m very agnostic. We had talked about this early on in our friendship, so I was able to let her know that I wasn't interested in following a specific religion or searching for a higher power at that current moment. That didn’t mean I’d never want to or try to, I just had never felt compelled since religion wasn’t important to me at the time. I also wanted to experience that by myself, if I ever did. I never felt like I knew better than she did or that she knew better than I did; we both agreed to disagree and respected each other’s opinions.

This was the first time I had a friend who was strong in their religious beliefs, so this relationship was different for me. Jen never invited me to any event held by her church, even though she spent much of her time promoting the group &amp; ’preaching the gospel’ to students on campus. That made me feel super respected, like she and I were completely on the same page about where we stood with religion and each other.

The closer we got, the more her references became specific to her church and not Christianity as a whole. The members of her church called each other ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’, the women could only wear skirts to bible study/church, and members our age would secretly court each other using specific phrases and code words that meant so much more than what they sounded. So I thought it might just be an odd, small church, and I chose to ignore the signs.

She’s also sworn that she will only marry someone established in her church. She can’t really bring someone in and then marry them, it’s best if it’s someone who has been in that specific church their entire life. She told me this was her mother’s rule, and she promised she’d follow it. I again, never judged her because I knew how awful her upbringing was, and if marrying someone in her church was a family request, then so be it. 

Then senior year rolls around, we were both incredibly busy but still made time to hang out. During a study session, she told me that people choose to be gay, and that she “doesn’t hate them, just that the lifestyle they’re choosing goes against God’s wishes.” Which blew me away since she’s A) Had sex with other women and B) Knows that my brother is gay. I had given her the benefit of the doubt for years, not knowing how she actually felt about my brother. I told her I disagree and that it’d be unfair to send people to hell for romantic urges they have no control over. We didn’t argue, but I definitely viewed her differently after that conversation. She even said, “I love gay people! I have many gay friends.” Just like a bigot would say! Great…

After that, I immediately drew away from her. Work was getting overwhelming on top of my classes, so I just happened to be ‘busy’ most times she wanted to see me. We had been planning on going to grad school together, but she chose instead to attend a 4-year bible school in another state (hosted by you guessed it! her church). I asked her if she planned to work during that time to gain experience for her career, and she told me that a job would distract her from her goal of becoming closer to God, and any job who didn’t think that constituted as experience was not the right place for her. So again, yes, I minded my own business and didn’t push the conversation any further.

So now it’s the fall after graduation, and she’s been gone for almost 6 months at this bible camp. I decided to actually look up where she was and what she was doing, something I should’ve done years ago. I find the website, and it looks like all of the reference material was written by one man (immediate red flags). The dress code was extremely strict, and even their recruitment methods for reeling people in was posted online. They believe other denominations are harmful, and that all Christians who do not follow their exact denominations’ beliefs are hell-bound. The school was extremely pricey, offered its own health insurance (which was mandatory to pay for), and the actual bible wasn’t mentioned once. She wasn’t studying God’s word, she was studying the word of one man who capitalized off of his dozens of books and tuition from his school programs. This, plus all of the weird things she said, made me realize she wasn’t just going to a normal church. Want to know the cherry on top? They mandate that members marry within the church, meaning she lied to me. Realizing that sent chills down my spine. She was 50 feet deep in this craziness and had no idea. This was her entire life, so I knew it was time I start to step away from her.

At the end of the year, she facetimes me on a random night after not talking for a long while, and we had a conversation that made me very uncomfortable. That’s why I’m here asking for advice. 

She tells me about her church. She loves it; there’s no distractions like romance, pants, cursing, drinking, or internet! She even asked me to look something up for her, she was only allowed to make phone calls to loved ones. No internet whatsoever. She then randomly asks me if I believe in evolution, where I then said “….yeah?” wondering what the hell she was going to say next. And she just plainly goes, “Oh, I don’t. Yeah, I just think it’s too far of a reach to say that we came from monkeys, like how would that even work?” Mind you, this girl now has a degree in a biology-heavy field, I have no idea what she must’ve been doing for the last 4 years.

And my original feeling of not really wanting to talk, multiplied by 700. I don’t want to argue; I know that this is what she believes and it’s not my place or my business to try and convince her otherwise. Which is exactly what I would never expect her to do to me. But oh goodness, was I wrong!

Jen told me about her day-to-day life, which involved a whole lot of preaching the gospel at the campus she was staying at. As she went on, I had to stop her a few times, so she could explain some of her religious references. I said “I’m sorry I keep asking you to clarify some things, I’m just so unaware of Christian culture so bear with me.” To which she replies, “Oh it’s okay! I love people who don’t know much about Christianity. They’re like a blank canvas that I can paint the spirit of Jesus all over.” And then went on a spiel about how, “People are always missing something when they don’t have Jesus. You see all of these famous people, they have everything! But they still drink and do drugs because they haven’t accepted the Lord into their heart. It’s so sad that people don’t realize how easy it is to fill that empty hole inside of you. All you have to do is accept Jesus.” 

Meanwhile I’m just so taken aback by this entire conversation. She’s waaaaay too far gone and I don’t feel inclined to even say anything at all. After almost 4 years of friendship and respecting each other’s beliefs, I learn that to her I am an empty hole, as well as a blank canvas. She basically told me to my face that I am nothing, just because I don’t believe what she does. So I’m obviously hurt, but I decide it’d be easier to just let the friendship die than try and fight it. 

Fast forward a few months to today. I happened to get a job in the city she grew up near, and she’s home on break. She wants to see me, but I’m not sure if I should avoid her forever or let her try to convert me to my face (and then try not to blow up at her). My boyfriend thinks I need to take into account both her childhood abuse and her history as a reliable friend. She may believe things that I think are outlandish, but that doesn’t mean I need to completely cut her off. He also thinks that the empty hole comment may have not been directed at me, but I’m so tempted to just ghost her. I feel so stupid for believing that she ever respected me or my choice to process my relationship with religion by myself. It’s tough thinking that she assumed I’d be going to hell our entire friendship, and that I need saving. I feel like I was basically her secret non-religious friend who she could bond over sex and alcohol with, something she told me she couldn't talk about with any of her church friends. I'm just hurt and not sure what to do.

I’m sorry if any of my wording came off rude or offensive to anyone. I just wanted to share my story and now ask for unbiased opinions. If you were in this situation, what did you do? What would you hypothetically do, if you were in my shoes?

TLDR; Discovered my close friend of 4 years may possibly be in a cult, she had never tried to convince me to follow her religious beliefs until recently. She says being gay is a choice and a sin, evolution is not real, and those who don’t follow her religion have empty holes inside of them (aka me). She wants to see me, I’m not interested, but my bf says I may be being too closed off and not understanding of how her childhood abuse led her down this path. Looking for advice on what to do.",27Jan2020,1
